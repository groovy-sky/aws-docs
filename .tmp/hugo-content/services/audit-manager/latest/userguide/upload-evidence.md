# Adding manual evidence in AWS Audit Manager

Audit Manager can automatically collect evidence for many controls. However, some controls might
require evidence that can't be collected automatically. In such cases, you can manually add your
own evidence.

Consider the following examples:

- Some controls relate to the provision of physical records (such as signatures), or events
that aren’t generated in the cloud (such as observations and interviews). In these cases, you
can manually add files as evidence. For instance, if a control requires information about your
organizational structure, you can upload a copy of your company’s org chart as manual
evidence.

- Some controls represent a vendor risk assessment question. A risk assessment question
might require documentation as evidence (such as an org chart). Or, it might only need a simple
text response (such as a list of job titles). For the latter, you can respond to the question
and save your response as manual evidence.

You can also use the manual upload feature to manage evidence from multiple environments. If
your company uses a hybrid cloud model or multicloud model, you can upload evidence from your
on-premises environment, an environment hosted in the cloud, or your SaaS applications. This
enables you to organize your evidence (regardless of where it came from) by storing it within the
structure of an Audit Manager assessment, where each piece of evidence is mapped to a specific
control.

## Key points

When it comes to adding manual evidence to your assessments in Audit Manager, you have three methods
to choose from.

1. **Importing a file from Amazon S3 -** This method is ideal when
    you have evidence files stored in an S3 bucket, such as documentation, reports, or other
    artifacts that can't be automatically collected by Audit Manager. By importing these files directly
    from S3, you can seamlessly integrate this manual evidence with the automatically collected
    evidence.

2. **Uploading a file from your browser** \- If you have
    evidence files locally stored on your computer or network, you can manually upload them to
    Audit Manager using this method. This approach is particularly useful when you need to include physical
    records, such as scanned documents or images, that aren't available in digital format within
    your AWS environment.

3. **Adding free-form text as evidence** \- In some cases, the
    evidence you need to provide is not in the form of a file but rather a text response or
    explanation. This method allows you to enter free-form text directly into Audit Manager. This can be
    especially helpful when responding to vendor risk assessment questions.
