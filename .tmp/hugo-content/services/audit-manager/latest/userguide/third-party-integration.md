# Integrations with third-party GRC products

AWS Audit Manager supports integrations with the third-party partner GRC products that are listed
on this page.

If your company uses a hybrid cloud model or multicloud model, it’s likely that you use a
GRC product to manage evidence from those environments. When that product is integrated with
Audit Manager, you can pull evidence about your AWS usage directly into your GRC environment. This
simplifies how you manage compliance by providing you with a centralized place to review and
remediate evidence as you prepare for audits.

Read this page for an overview of the third-party GRC products that can ingest evidence
from Audit Manager. You can also see a reference of which Audit Manager API actions you can take directly within
those products.

## Understanding how third-party integrations work with Audit Manager

GRC partners can use the Audit Manager public APIs to integrate their products with Audit Manager. With
this integration in place, you can map the enterprise controls in your GRC environment to
the common controls that Audit Manager provides.

###### Tip

You can map your enterprise controls to any type of [Audit Manager\
control](concepts.md#control). However, we recommend that you use common controls. When you map to a
common control that represents your goal, Audit Manager collects evidence from a predefined group
of data sources that's managed by AWS. This means that you don’t have to be an AWS
expert to know which data sources collect the relevant evidence for your goal.

After you complete this one-time control mapping exercise, you can create Audit Manager
assessments directly in the GRC product. This action starts the collection of evidence about
your AWS usage. You can then see this AWS evidence along with the other evidence that’s
collected from your hybrid environment, all within the same context of your enterprise
controls.

When you use an Audit Manager integration with a third-party GRC product, keep in mind the
following points:

- Integrations are available for all [AWS Regions where Audit Manager is\
supported](../../../../general/latest/gr/audit-manager.md).

- Any Audit Manager resources that you create in the GRC partner product are also reflected in
Audit Manager.

- You’re subject to [AWS Audit Manager\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/pricing) in addition to the pricing of the third-party GRC product.

- The evidence that Audit Manager collects is immutable. Evidence is presented in exactly the
same way in third-party GRC products as it is in the Audit Manager console. However, if you use a
third-party integration, you might be able to enhance this evidence by providing
additional context in your reporting.

- The same [quotas that apply to\
Audit Manager](service-quotas.md) also apply within the third-party GRC product. For example, each
AWS account can have up to 100 active Audit Manager assessments. This account-level quota
applies whether you create the assessments in the Audit Manager console or in the third-party GRC
product. Most Audit Manager quotas, but not all, are listed under the AWS Audit Manager namespace in the
Service Quotas console. To learn how to request a quota increase, see [Managing your Audit Manager quotas](service-quotas.md#managing-your-service-quotas).

## Third-party GRC partner products that integrate with Audit Manager

The following third party GRC products can ingest evidence from Audit Manager.

### MetricStream

To use this integration, reach out to [MetricStream](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5ph5amfrrmyx4?qid=1616170904192&sr=0-1) for the access and
purchase of MetricStream GRC software.

Built on the MetricStream Platform, the MetricStream Enterprise GRC solution allows
for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to enterprise-wide GRC activities and
processes. By ingesting evidence from Audit Manager into MetricStream, you can proactively identify
non-compliant evidence from your AWS environment and review it alongside evidence from
your on-premises data sources or other cloud partners. This provides you with a convenient
and centralized way to review and improve your cloud security and compliance posture as
you prepare for audits.

With the MetricStream and Audit Manager integration, you can perform the following API
operations.
