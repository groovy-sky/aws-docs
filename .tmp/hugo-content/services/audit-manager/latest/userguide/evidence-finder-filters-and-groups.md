AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see

# Filter and grouping options for evidence finder

On this page, you can see a list of the filter and grouping options that are available for
you to use in evidence finder.

## Filter reference

You can use the following filters to find evidence that matches specific criteria, such as
an assessment, control, or AWS service.

###### Topics

- [Required filters](#required-filters)

- [Additional filters (optional)](#additional-filters)

- [Combining filters](#combining-filters)

### Required filters

Use these filters to get started with a high-level overview of the evidence in an
assessment.

Filter nameDescriptionNotes

**Assessment**

Returns evidence for a specific assessment.

You can filter by one assessment only.

**Date range**

Returns evidence for a specific time period.

Either, you can use a _Relative range_ to define a
range that’s relative to today’s date (for example, `Last 30 days`).

Or, you can use an _Absolute range_ to specify a
specific date range (for example, `June 27th – July
          4th`).

**Resource compliance**Returns resources with a specific compliance check evaluation.

Audit Manager collects [compliance check\
evidence](concepts.md#evidence) for controls that use AWS Config and Security Hub CSPM as a data source type. Multiple
resources might be assessed during evidence collection. As a result, a single piece of
compliance check evidence can include one or more resources. You can use this filter to
explore compliance status at the resource level.

You can choose one or more of the following options:

- **Non-compliant** – This filter finds resources with
compliance check issues. This happens if Security Hub reports a _Fail_ result, or if AWS Config reports a _Non-compliant_ result.

- **Compliant** – This filter finds resources that don’t have
compliance check issues. This happens if Security Hub CSPM reports a _Pass_ result, or if AWS Config reports a _Compliant_ result.

- **Inconclusive** – This filter finds resources for which a
compliance check isn’t available or applicable. This happens if a resource uses AWS Config
or Security Hub CSPM as the underlying data source type, but those services aren't enabled. This
also happens if the resource uses an underlying data source type that doesn't support
compliance checks (such as manual evidence, AWS API calls, or CloudTrail).

### Additional filters (optional)

Use these filters to narrow the scope of your search query. For example, use
**Service** to see all evidence that's related to Amazon S3. Use
**Resource type** to focus just on S3 buckets. Or, use **Resource**
**ARN** to target a specific S3 bucket.

You can create additional filters using one or more of the following criteria.

Criteria nameDescriptionWhen to use this criteria**Account ID**

Drill down by AWS account.

Use this criteria to find evidence that's related to a specific
AWS account.**Control**

Drill down by control name.

Use this criteria to find evidence that's related to a specific control.

**Control domain**

Drill down by control domain.

Use this criteria to focus on a specific subject area as you prepare for an audit.
You can filter by control domain if you're querying an assessment that was created from a
standard framework.

Examples of control domains include network security, identity and access management,
and data protection.

Some control domains might be marked as **Outdated**
following Audit Manager's transition to a new set of control domains provided by AWS Control
Catalog. For more information, see [I see that a control domain is marked as “outdated”. What does this mean?](evidence-finder-issues.md#outdated-control-domains).

**Data source type**

Drill down by the type of data source.

Use this criteria to focus on a specific data source.

Set the value to `Manual` to find evidence that you uploaded manually.
Otherwise, you can filter automated evidence based on where it came from (for example,
`AWS Config`, `CloudTrail`, `Security Hub CSPM`, or `AWS API
           calls`).

**Event name**

Drill down by event name.

Use this criteria to focus on a specific event that the evidence is related to. An
event is a record of an activity in an AWS account.

For example, you can search for the name of an API call, such as the IAM
`AttachRolePolicy` operation that's used to configure permissions. Or, search
for a CloudTrail keyword, such as the `ConsoleLogin` event that's logged by CloudTrail when
a user signs in to your account.

**Resource ARN**

Drill down by Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Use this criteria to find evidence that's related to a specific AWS
resource.

**Resource type**

Drill down by resource type.

Use this criteria to focus on the type of resource that's being assessed, such as an
Amazon EC2 instance or an S3 bucket.**Service**

Drill down by AWS service name.

Use this criteria to find evidence that's related to a specific AWS service, such
as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, or AWS Config.**Service category**

Drill down by AWS service category.

Use this criteria to focus on a specific category of AWS service.

Examples
include security, identity and compliance, database, and storage.

### Combining filters

#### Criteria behavior

When you specify more than one criteria, Audit Manager applies the `AND` operator to
your selections. This means that all of the criteria are grouped into a single query, and the
results must match all of the combined criteria.

###### Example

In the following filter setup, evidence finder returns non-compliant resources from
the last 7 days for the assessment that’s called `MySOC2Assessment`.
Additionally, the results relate to both an IAM policy and the specified control.

#### Criteria value behavior

When you specify more than one criteria value, the values are linked with an
`OR` operator. Evidence finder returns results that match any of these criteria
values.

###### Example

In the following filter setup, evidence finder returns search results that come from
either AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, or AWS Security Hub CSPM.

## Grouping reference

You can group your search results for quicker navigation. Grouping shows you the breadth of
your search results, and how they're distributed across a specific dimension.

You can use any of the following group by values.

Group byDescription **Account ID**Group results by AWS account.**Control**Group results by control name.**Data source type**Group results by the type of data source where the evidence came from.**Event name**Group results by an event name.**Resource ARN**Group results by Amazon Resource Name (ARN).**Resource type**Group results by resource type.**Service**Group results by AWS service name.**Service category**Group results by AWS service category.
