# Using the control library to manage controls in AWS Audit Manager

You can access and manage controls from the control library in AWS Audit Manager.

## Key points

In the control library, controls are organized into the following categories.

- **Common controls** collect evidence that supports
multiple overlapping compliance standards. Automated common controls contain one or more
related [core controls](concepts.md#core-control)
that each collect supporting evidence from a predefined group of data sources. This
provides you with an efficient way to identify the AWS data sources that map to your
portfolio of compliance requirements. The underlying data sources for each automated
common control are validated and maintained by industry certified assessors in [AWS Security\
Assurance Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/security-assurance-services).

- **Standard controls** collect evidence to support a
specific compliance standard. You can view the details of standard controls, but you can't
edit or delete them. However, you can make an editable copy of any standard control to
create a new control that meets your specific requirements.

- **Custom controls** are controls that you own and define.
When you create a custom control, we recommend that you choose the common controls that
represent your goals and use them as an evidence source. As a result, your custom control
can collect all of the evidence that’s relevant to those common controls. You can also use
core controls as an evidence source, or use other sources that you define yourself. When
you’re done, add your custom controls to a custom framework, and then create an assessment
to start collecting evidence.
