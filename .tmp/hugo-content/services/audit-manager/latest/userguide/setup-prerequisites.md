AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Prerequisites for setting up AWS Audit Manager

Before you can use AWS Audit Manager, you must make sure that you have properly set up your
AWS account and user permissions.

This page outlines the necessary steps to create an AWS account (if needed),
configure an administrative user, and grant the permissions required to access and
enable Audit Manager.

###### Tasks

1. [Sign up for an AWS account](#sign-up-for-aws)

2. [Create a user with administrative access](#create-an-admin)

3. [Add the required permissions to access and enable Audit Manager](#attach-IAM)

###### Important

If you’re already set up with AWS and IAM, you can skip tasks 1 and 2.
However, you must complete task 3 to ensure that you have the required permissions
to set up Audit Manager.

## Sign up for an AWS account

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.

###### To sign up for an AWS account

1. Open [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

2. Follow the online instructions.

Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call or text message and entering
    a verification code on the phone keypad.

When you sign up for an AWS account, an _AWS account root user_ is created. The root user has access to all AWS services
    and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-root-user.md#root-user-tasks).

AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is
complete. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by
going to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My**
**Account**.

## Create a user with administrative access

After you sign up for an AWS account, secure your AWS account root user, enable AWS IAM Identity Center, and create an administrative user so that you
don't use the root user for everyday tasks.

###### Secure your AWS account root user

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.

For help signing in by using root user, see [Signing in as the root user](../../../signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.md#introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial) in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

2. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your root user.

For instructions, see [Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user (console)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/enable-virt-mfa-for-root.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Create a user with administrative access

1. Enable IAM Identity Center.

For instructions, see [Enabling\
    AWS IAM Identity Center](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-idc.md) in the
    _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

2. In IAM Identity Center, grant administrative access to a user.

For a tutorial about using the IAM Identity Center directory as your identity source, see [Configure user access with the default IAM Identity Center directory](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/quick-start-default-idc.md) in the
    _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

###### Sign in as the user with administrative access

- To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user.

For help signing in using an IAM Identity Center user, see [Signing in to the AWS access portal](../../../signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.md) in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

###### Assign access to additional users

1. In IAM Identity Center, create a permission set that follows the best practice of applying least-privilege permissions.

For instructions, see [Create a permission set](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-create-a-permission-set.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

2. Assign users to a group, and then assign single sign-on access to the group.

For instructions, see [Add groups](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/addgroups.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

## Add the required permissions to access and enable Audit Manager

You must give users the required permissions to enable Audit Manager. For users who need
full access to Audit Manager, use the [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) managed policy. This is an AWS
managed policy that’s available in your AWS account, and it’s the recommended
policy for Audit Manager administrators.

###### Tip

As a security best practice, we recommend that you get started with AWS
managed policies and then move toward least-privilege permissions. AWS managed
policies grant permissions for many common use cases. However, keep in mind that
because AWS managed policies are available for use by all AWS customers,
they might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases. As
a result, we recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining [customer managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to
your use cases. For more information, see [AWS managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide._

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:

- Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:

Create a permission set. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

- Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

Create a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for a third-party identity provider (federation)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-idp.md)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

- IAM users:

- Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user (console)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-users-change-permissions.md#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Next steps

Now that you've set up your AWS account and granted the required permissions,
you're ready to enable Audit Manager. For step-by-step instructions, see [Enabling AWS Audit Manager](setup-audit-manager.md).
