# Finding the available controls in AWS Audit Manager

You can find all available controls on the **Control library** page in
the Audit Manager console.

You can also view all available controls using the Audit Manager API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view controls in AWS Audit Manager.
Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
