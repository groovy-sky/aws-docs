AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# GDPR 2016

AWS Audit Manager provides a prebuilt standard framework that supports the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016.

This framework contains only manual controls. These manual controls don't collect
evidence automatically. However, if you want to automate evidence collection for some
controls under GDPR, you can use the custom control feature in Audit Manager. For more information,
see [Using this framework](#framework-GDPR).

## What is the GDPR?

The GDPR is a European privacy law that became enforceable on May 25, 2018. The GDPR
replaces the EU Data Protection Directive, also known as [Directive 95/46/EC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive).
It's intended to harmonize data protection laws throughout the European Union (EU). It
does this by applying a single data protection law that's binding throughout each EU
member state.

The GDPR applies to all organizations that are established in the EU and to
organizations (no matter whether they were established in the EU) that process the
personal data of EU data subjects in connection with either the offering of goods or
services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of behavior that takes place within
the EU. Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
natural person.

You can find the GDPR framework in the framework library page of Audit Manager. For more
information, see the [General Data\
Protection Regulation (GDPR) Center](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center).

## Using this framework

You can use the GDPR 2016 framework in Audit Manager to help you prepare for audits.

The framework details are as follows:

Framework name in AWS Audit ManagerNumber of automated controlsNumber of manual controlsNumber of control setsGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016037810

This standard framework contains manual controls only.

###### Note

If you want to automate evidence collection for GDPR, you can use Audit Manager to [create\
your own custom controls](create-controls.md) for GDPR. The following table provides
recommendations on the AWS data sources that you can map to GDPR requirements in your
custom controls. Although some of the following data sources are mapped to multiple
controls, keep in mind that you're charged only once for each resource
assessment.

The following recommendations use AWS Config and AWS Security Hub CSPM as data sources. To
successfully collect evidence from these data sources, make sure that you followed the
instructions to [enable and set up\
AWS Config and AWS Security Hub CSPM](setup-recommendations.md) in your AWS account. After you've set up both
services in this way, Audit Manager collects evidence each time an evaluation occurs for the
specified AWS Config rule or Security Hub CSPM control.

You can [create a custom\
control](create-controls.md) in AWS Audit Manager that supports this GDPR control.

When
you [specify the control details](customize-control-from-scratch.md#from-scratch-step-1), enter the following under

After you create your new custom controls for GDPR, you can add them to a custom GDPR
framework. You can then create an assessment from the custom GDPR framework. This way,
Audit Manager can collect evidence automatically for the custom controls that you added.

## Next steps

For instructions on how to view detailed information about this framework, including the
list of standard controls that it contains, see [Reviewing a framework in AWS Audit Manager](review-frameworks.md).

For instructions on how to create an assessment using this framework, see [Creating an assessment in AWS Audit Manager](create-assessments.md).

For instructions on how to customize this framework to support your specific
requirements, see [Making an editable copy of an existing framework in AWS Audit Manager](create-custom-frameworks-from-existing.md).
