# Delegating a control set for review in AWS Audit Manager

When you need assistance from a subject matter expert, you can choose the AWS account
that you want to help you, and then delegate a control set to them for review.

## Delegate permissions

The below policy is attached to a delegate to whom the control set is delegated to.

Audit Manager replaces the `placeholder text` with your account and
resource identifiers before attaching the policy.

                "AWS": "Principal for user/role who is delegated a Control Set of the Assessment"

```

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to create a delegation in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

You can use either of the following procedures to delegate a control set.

###### To delegate a control set from the assessment page

01. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Assessments**.

03. Select the name of the assessment that contains the control set that you want to delegate.

04. From the assessment page, choose the **Controls** tab. This displays the
     control status summary and the list of controls in the assessment.

05. Select a control set and choose **Delegate control set**.

06. Under **Delegate selection**, a list of users and roles is displayed.
     Choose a user or role, or use the search bar to look for one.

07. Under **Delegation details**, review the control set name and the
     assessment name.

08. (Optional) Under **Comments**, add a comment with instructions to help the
     delegate fulfill their review task. Don't include any sensitive information in your
     comment.

09. Choose **Delegate control set**.

10. A green success banner confirms the successful delegation of the control set. Choose
     **View delegation** to see the delegation request. You can also view your
     delegations at any time by choosing **Delegations** in the left navigation
     pane of the AWS Audit Manager console.

###### To delegate a control set from the delegations page

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Delegations**.

3. From the delegations page, choose **Create delegation**.

4. Under **Choose assessment and control set**, specify the assessment and the
    control set that you want to delegate.

5. Under **Delegate selection**, you will see a list of users and roles.
    Choose a user or role, or use the search bar to look for one.

6. (Optional) Under **Comments**, add a comment with instructions to help the
    delegate fulfill their review task. Don't include any sensitive information in your
    comment.

7. Choose **Create delegation**.

8. A green success banner confirms the successful delegation of the control set. Choose
    **View delegation** to see the delegation request. You can also view your
    delegations at any time by choosing **Delegations** in the left navigation
    pane of the AWS Audit Manager console.

After you delegate a control set for review, the delegate receives a notification and
can then begin to review the control set. This process that delegates follow is described
in [Understanding the different delegation tasks for delegates](delegation-for-delegates.md).
