## I can’t see any controls or control sets in my assessment

In short, to view the controls for an assessment, you must be specified as an
audit owner for that assessment. Moreover, you need the necessary IAM permissions
to view and manage the related Audit Manager resources.

If you need access to the controls in an assessment, ask one of the audit owners
for that assessment to specify you as audit owner. You can specify audit owners when
you're [creating](create-assessments.md#choose-audit-owners) or [editing](edit-assessment.md#edit-choose-audit-owners) an assessment.

Make sure also that you have the necessary permissions to manage the assessment.
We recommend that audit owners use the [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) policy. If you need help with IAM
permissions, contact your administrator or [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us). For more information about how to attach a policy to an
IAM identity, see [Adding Permissions to a User](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-users-change-permissions.md#users_change_permissions-add-console) and [Adding and\
removing IAM identity permissions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-attach-detach.md) in the _IAM_
_User Guide_.

## I can’t upload manual evidence to a control

If you can't manually upload evidence to a control, it's likely because the
control is in _inactive_ status.

To upload manual evidence to a control, you must first change the control status
to either _Under review_ or _Reviewed_. For instructions, see [Changing the status of an assessment control in AWS Audit Manager](change-assessment-control-status.md).

###### Important

Each AWS account can only manually upload up to 100 evidence files to a
control each day. Exceeding this daily quota causes any additional manual
uploads to fail for that control. If you need to upload a large amount of manual
evidence to a single control, upload your evidence in batches across several
days.

## What does it mean if a control says “Replacement available”?

![Screenshot of the pop-up message that prompts you to recreate your assessment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/troubleshooting-control-replacement-available-console.png)

If you see this message, this means that an updated control definition is
available for one or more of the standard controls in your custom framework. We
recommend that you replace these controls so that you can benefit from the improved
evidence sources that Audit Manager now provides.

For instructions on how to proceed, see [On my custom framework details page, I’m prompted to recreate my custom framework](framework-issues.md#recreate-framework-post-common-controls).

## I need to use multiple AWS Config rules as a data source for a single control

You can use a combination of managed rules and custom rules for a single control.
To do this, define multiple evidence sources for the control, and select your
preferred rule type for each one. You can define up to 100 customer managed data
sources for a single custom control.

## The custom rule option is unavailable when I’m configuring a control data source

This means that you don't have permissions to view custom rules for your
AWS account or organization. More specifically, you don't have permissions to
perform the [DescribeConfigRules](../../../../reference/config/latest/apireference/api-describeconfigrules.md) operation in the Audit Manager console.

To resolve this issue, contact your AWS administrator for help. If you're an
AWS administrator, you can provide permissions for your users or groups by [managing your IAM policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage.md).

## The custom rule option is available, but no rules appear in the dropdown list

This means that no custom rules are enabled and available for use in your
AWS account or organization.

If you don’t have any custom rules yet in AWS Config, you can create one. For
instructions, see [AWS Config\
custom rules](../../../config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config-develop-rules.md) in the _AWS Config Developer_
_Guide_.

If you're expecting to see a custom rule, check the following troubleshooting
item.

## Some custom rules are available, but I can’t see the rule that I want to use

If you can’t see the custom rule that you’re expecting to find, this could be due
to one of the following issues.

**Your account is excluded from the**
**rule**

It's possible that the delegated administrator account that you're
using is excluded from the rule.

Your organization's management account (or one of the AWS Config
delegated administrator accounts) can create custom organization rules
using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). When they do so, they can specify a [list of accounts to be excluded](../../../../reference/config/latest/apireference/api-putorganizationconfigrule.md#config-PutOrganizationConfigRule-request-ExcludedAccounts) from the rule. If your
account is on this list, the rule isn’t available in Audit Manager.

To resolve this issue, contact your AWS Config administrator for help.
If you're an AWS Config administrator, you can update the list of excluded
accounts by running the [put-organization-config-rule](../../../cli/latest/reference/configservice/put-organization-config-rule.md) command.

**The rule wasn’t successfully created and enabled in**
**AWS Config**

It’s also possible that the custom rule wasn't created and enabled
successfully. If an [error occurred when creating the rule](../../../../reference/config/latest/apireference/api-putconfigrule.md#API_PutConfigRule_Errors), or [the rule isn't enabled](../../../config/latest/developerguide/setting-up-aws-config-rules-with-console.md), it doesn’t appear in the list of
available rules in Audit Manager.

For assistance with this issue, we recommend that you contact your
AWS Config administrator.

**The rule is a managed rule**

If you can't find the rule that you're looking for under the dropdown
list of custom rules, it’s possible that the rule is a managed
rule.

You can use the [AWS Config\
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/config) to verify if a rule is a managed rule. To do so,
choose **Rules** in the left navigation
menu and look for the rule in the table. If the rule is a managed rule,
the **Type** column shows **AWS**
**managed**.

![A managed rule as shown in the AWS Config console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/rules-managed-console.png)

After you've confirmed that it's a managed rule, return to Audit Manager and
select **Managed rule** as the rule type. Then, look
for the managed rule identifier keyword in the dropdown list of managed
rules.

![The same rule that's found in the managed rule dropdown list in the Audit Manager console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/control_data_source-managed_rule-console.png)

## I can’t see the managed rule that I want to use

Before you select a rule from the dropdown list in the Audit Manager console, make sure
that you selected **Managed rule** as the rule type.

![The managed rule option selected in the Audit Manager console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/ruletype-managed-console.png)

If you still can’t see the managed rule that you’re expecting to find, it’s
possible that you’re looking for the rule _name_.
Instead, you must look for the rule _identifier_.

If you're using a default managed rule, the name and the identifier are similar.
The name is in lowercase and uses dashes (for example,
`iam-policy-in-use`). The identifier is in uppercase and uses
underscores (for example, `IAM_POLICY_IN_USE`). To find the identifier
for a default managed rule, review the [list of supported AWS Config managed rule keywords](control-data-sources-config.md#aws-config-managed-rules) and follow the link for
the rule that you want to use. This takes you to the AWS Config documentation for that
managed rule. From here, you can see both the name and the identifier. Look for the
identifier keyword in the Audit Manager dropdown list.

![A managed rule name and identifier as shown in the AWS Config documentation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/ruleidentifier-configdocs.png)

If you're using a custom managed rule, you can use the [AWS Config console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/config) to find the rule identifier. For example,
let's say that you want to use the managed rule called
`customized-iam-policy-in-use`. To find the identifier for this rule,
go to the AWS Config console, choose **Rules** in the left navigation
menu, and choose the rule in the table.

![A managed rule with a customized name in the rules table of the AWS Config console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/managedrule-customname-configconsole.png)

Choose **Edit** to open details about the managed rule.

![The edit rule option in the AWS Config console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/editrule-configconsole.png)

Under the **Details** section, you can find the source identifier
that the managed rule was created from ( `IAM_POLICY_IN_USE`).

![The managed rule details in the AWS Config console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/ruledetails-configconsole.png)

You can now return to the Audit Manager console and select the same identifier keyword from
the dropdown list.

## I want to share a custom framework, but it has controls that use custom AWS Config rules as a data source. Can the recipient collect evidence for these controls?

Yes, the recipient can collect evidence for these controls, but a few steps are
needed to achieve this.

For Audit Manager to collect evidence using an AWS Config rule as a data source mapping, the
following must be true. This applies to both managed rules and custom rules.

1. The rule must exist in the recipient’s AWS environment

2. The rule must be enabled in the recipient’s AWS environment

Remember that the custom AWS Config rules in your account likely don’t exist already
in the recipient’s AWS environment. Moreover, when the recipient accepts the share
request, Audit Manager doesn’t recreate any of your custom rules in their account. For the
recipient to collect evidence using your custom rules as a data source mapping, they
must create the same custom rules in their instance of AWS Config. After the recipient
[creates](../../../config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config-develop-rules.md) and then [enables](../../../config/latest/developerguide/setting-up-aws-config-rules-with-console.md) the rules, Audit Manager can collect evidence from that data source.

We recommend that you communicate with the recipient to let them know if any
custom rules need to be created in their instance of AWS Config.

## What happens when a custom rule is updated in AWS Config? Do I need to take any action in Audit Manager?

###### For rule updates within your AWS environment

If you update a custom rule within your AWS environment, no action is needed
in Audit Manager. Audit Manager detects and handles the rule updates as described in the following
table. Audit Manager doesn't notify you when a rule update is detected.

ScenarioWhat Audit Manager doesWhat you need to do

A custom rule is **updated** in
your instance of AWS Config

Audit Manager continues to report findings for that rule using the updated
rule definition. No action is needed.

A custom rule is **deleted** in
your instance of AWS Config

Audit Manager stops reporting findings for the deleted rule.

No action is needed.

If you want to, you can [edit\
the custom controls](edit-controls.md) that used the deleted rule as a
data source mapping. Doing so helps to clean up your data source
settings by removing the deleted rule. Otherwise, the deleted
rule name remains as an unused data source mapping.

###### For rule updates outside your AWS environment

If a custom rule is updated outside of your AWS environment, Audit Manager doesn’t
detect the rule update. This is something to consider if you use shared custom
frameworks. This is because, in this scenario, the sender and the recipient each
work in separate AWS environments. The following table provides recommended
actions for this scenario.

Your roleScenarioRecommended action

Sender

- You shared a framework that uses custom rules as a
data source mapping.

- After you shared the framework, you updated or deleted
one of those rules in AWS Config.

Let the recipient know about your update. That way, they can
apply the same update and stay in sync with the latest rule
definition.Recipient

- You accepted a shared framework that uses custom rules
as a data source mapping.

- After you recreated the custom rules in your instance
of AWS Config, the sender updated or deleted one of those
rules.

Make the corresponding rule update in your own instance of
AWS Config.
