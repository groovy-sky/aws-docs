AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Configuring your default export destination for evidence finder

When you run queries in evidence finder, you can export your search results into a
comma-separated values (CSV) file. Use this setting to choose the default S3 bucket
where Audit Manager saves your exported files.

## Prerequisites

Your S3 bucket must have the required permissions policy to allow CloudTrail to write
the export files to it. More specifically, the bucket policy must include an
`s3:PutObject` action and the bucket ARN, and list CloudTrail as the
service principal.

- For an example permission policy that you can use, see [Resource-based policy examples for AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-resource-based-policy-examples.md).

- For instructions to attach this policy to your S3 bucket, see [Adding a bucket\
policy by using the Amazon S3 console](../../../s3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.md).

- For more tips, see [configuration tips for your export\
destination](evidence-finder-settings.md#settings-export-destination-tips) on this page.

### Configuration tips for your export destination

To ensure a successful file export, we recommend that you verify the
following configurations for your export destination.

**AWS Region**

The AWS Region of your customer managed key (if you provided one) must
match the Region of your assessment. For instructions on how to
change your KMS key, see [Audit Manager data encryption settings](general-settings.md#settings-KMS).

**Cross-account S3 buckets**

Using a cross-account S3 bucket as your export destination isn’t
supported in the Audit Manager console. It’s possible to specify a
cross-account bucket using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs, but
for simplicity, we recommend that you not do this. If you do choose
to use a cross-account S3 bucket as your export destination,
consider the following points.

- By default, S3 objects—such as CSV
exports—are owned by the AWS account that uploads
the object. You can use the [S3 Object Ownership](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md) setting to change this
default behavior, so that any new objects that are written
by accounts with the `bucket-owner-full-control`
canned access control list (ACL) automatically become owned
by the bucket owner.

Although it’s not a requirement, we recommend that you
make the following changes to your cross-account bucket
settings. Making these changes ensures that the bucket owner
has full control of the exported files that you publish to
their bucket.

- [Set the object ownership of the S3 bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md#enable-object-ownership)
to _bucket owner_
_preferred_, instead of the default
_object writer_

- [Add a bucket policy](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md#ensure-object-ownership) to ensure that
objects uploaded to that bucket have the
`bucket-owner-full-control` ACL

- To allow Audit Manager to export files to a cross-account S3
bucket, you must add the following S3 bucket policy to your
export destination bucket. Replace the
`placeholder text` with your
own information. The `Principal` element in this
policy is the user or role that owns the assessment and
exports the file. The `Resource` specifies the
cross-account S3 bucket where the file is exported
to.

## Procedure

You can update this setting using the Audit Manager console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the
Audit Manager API.

Audit Manager console

###### To update your export destination settings on the Audit Manager console

1. From the **Evidence finder** settings tab, go
    to the **Export destination** section.

2. Choose one of the following options:

- If you want to remove the current S3 bucket, choose
**Remove** to clear your
settings.

- If you want to save a default S3 bucket for the first
time, proceed to step 3.

3. Specify the S3 bucket that you want to store your exported
    files in.

- Choose **Browse S3** to choose from a
list of your buckets.

- Alternatively, you can enter the bucket URI in this
format:
`s3://bucketname/prefix`

###### Tip

To keep your destination bucket organized, you can create
an optional folder for your CSV exports. To do so, append a
slash ( `/`) and a prefix to the value
in the **Resource URI** box (for example,
`/evidenceFinderCSVExports`). Audit Manager
then includes this prefix when it adds the CSV file to the
bucket, and Amazon S3 generates the path specified by the prefix.
For more information about prefixes in Amazon S3, see [Organizing objects in the Amazon S3 console](../../../s3/latest/userguide/using-folders.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service_ User
Guide.

4. When you’re done, choose **Save**.

For instructions on how to create an S3 bucket, see [Creating a\
bucket](../../../s3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

AWS CLI

###### To update your export destination settings in the AWS CLI

Run the [update-settings](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/update-settings.html) command and use the
`--default-export-destination` parameter to specify
an S3 bucket.

In the following example, replace the `placeholder
                                text` with your own information:

```

aws auditmanager update-settings --default-export-destination destinationType=S3,destination=amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket
```

For instructions on how to create an S3 bucket, see [create-bucket](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html) in the _AWS CLI Command_
_Reference_.

Audit Manager API

###### To update your export destination settings using the API

Call the [UpdateSettings](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-updatesettings.md) operation and use the [defaultExportDestination](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-updatesettings.md#auditmanager-UpdateSettings-request-defaultAssessmentReportsDestination) parameter to specify an S3
bucket.

For instructions on how to create an S3 bucket, see [CreateBucket](../../../s3/latest/api/api-createbucket.md) in the _Amazon S3 API_
_Reference_.
