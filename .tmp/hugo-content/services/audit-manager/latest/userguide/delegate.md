# Delegations in AWS Audit Manager

As you navigate through the assessment process in AWS Audit Manager, you might encounter situations
where you need help from subject matter experts to review and validate the collected evidence.
This is where the concept of delegations comes into play.

## Key points

Delegations enable [audit owners](concepts.md#audit-owner) to
assign specific control sets to [delegates](concepts.md#delegate-persona) –
individuals with specialized expertise in relevant areas. By using the delegation feature, you
can ensure that the evidence for each control is thoroughly evaluated by the appropriate
personnel. This helps you to streamline the review process and enhance the overall accuracy
and reliability of your assessments. Whether you need guidance on interpreting technical
evidence, clarifying compliance requirements, or gaining deeper insights into specific
domains, delegations enable you to collaborate effectively with subject matter experts.

At a high level, the delegation process is as follows:

1. The audit owner chooses a control set in their assessment and delegates it for
    review.

2. The delegate reviews those controls and their evidence, and submits the control set
    back to the audit owner when finished.

3. The audit owner is notified that the review is complete, and checks the reviewed
    controls for any remarks from the delegate.

###### Note

An AWS account can be an audit owner or a delegate in different AWS Regions.
