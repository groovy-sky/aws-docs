# `DeletionPolicy` attribute

With the `DeletionPolicy` attribute you can preserve, and in some cases, backup
a resource when its stack is deleted. You specify a `DeletionPolicy` attribute for
each resource that you want to control. If a resource has no `DeletionPolicy`
attribute, CloudFormation deletes the resource by default.

This capability also applies to stack update operations that lead to resources being
deleted from stacks. For example, if you remove the resource from the stack template, and then
update the stack with the template. This capability doesn't apply to resources whose physical
instance is replaced during stack update operations. For example, if you edit a resource's
properties such that CloudFormation replaces that resource during a stack update.

###### Note

**Exception**: The default policy is `Snapshot`
for `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` resources and for `AWS::RDS::DBInstance`
resources that don't specify the `DBClusterIdentifier` property.

To keep a resource when its stack is deleted, specify `Retain` for that
resource. You can use `Retain` for any resource. For example, you can retain a
nested stack, Amazon S3 bucket, or EC2 instance so that you can continue to use or modify those
resources after you delete their stacks.

###### Note

If you want to modify resources outside of CloudFormation, use a `Retain`
deletion policy and then delete the stack. Otherwise, your resources might get out of sync
with your CloudFormation template and cause stack errors.

For resources that support snapshots, such as `AWS::EC2::Volume`, specify
`Snapshot` to have CloudFormation create a snapshot before deleting the
resource.

The following snippet contains an Amazon S3 bucket resource with a `Retain` deletion
policy. When this stack is deleted, CloudFormation leaves the bucket without deleting it.

## JSON

```json

{
  "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09",
  "Resources" : {
    "MyBucket" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::S3::Bucket",
      "DeletionPolicy" : "Retain"
    }
  }
}
```

## YAML

```yaml

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    DeletionPolicy: Retain
```

## `DeletionPolicy` options

`Delete`

CloudFormation deletes the resource and all its content if applicable during stack
deletion. You can add this deletion policy to any resource type. By default, if
you don't specify a `DeletionPolicy`, CloudFormation deletes your
resources. However, be aware of the following considerations:

- For `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` resources, the default policy is
`Snapshot`.

- For `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` resources that don't specify the
`DBClusterIdentifier` property, the default policy is
`Snapshot`.

- For Amazon S3 buckets, you must delete all objects in the bucket for deletion
to succeed.

###### Note

The default behavior of CloudFormation is to delete the secret with the
ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery flag.

`Retain`

CloudFormation keeps the resource without deleting the resource or its contents
when its stack is deleted. You can add this deletion policy to any resource type.
When CloudFormation completes the stack deletion, the stack will be in
`Delete_Complete` state; however, resources that are retained
continue to exist and continue to incur applicable charges until you delete those
resources.

For update operations, the following considerations apply:

- If a resource is deleted, the `DeletionPolicy` retains the
physical resource but ensures that it's deleted from CloudFormation's
scope.

- If a resource is updated such that a new physical resource is created to
replace the old resource, then the old resource is completely deleted,
including from CloudFormation's scope.

`RetainExceptOnCreate`

`RetainExceptOnCreate` behaves like `Retain` for stack
operations, except for the stack operation that initially created the resource. If
the stack operation that created the resource is rolled back, CloudFormation deletes
the resource. For all other stack operations, such as stack deletion, CloudFormation
retains the resource and its contents. The result is that new, empty, and unused
resources are deleted, while in-use resources and their data are retained. Refer
to the [UpdateStack](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-updatestack.md) API
documentation to use this deletion policy as an API parameter without updating
your template.

`Snapshot`

For resources that support snapshots, CloudFormation creates a snapshot for the
resource before deleting it. When CloudFormation completes the stack deletion, the
stack will be in the `Delete_Complete` state; however, the snapshots
that are created with this policy continue to exist and continue to incur
applicable charges until you delete those snapshots.

Resources that support snapshots include:

- [AWS::DocDB::DBCluster](aws-resource-docdb-dbcluster.md)

- [AWS::EC2::Volume](aws-resource-ec2-volume.md)

- [AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster](aws-resource-elasticache-cachecluster.md)

- [AWS::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup](aws-resource-elasticache-replicationgroup.md)

- [AWS::Neptune::DBCluster](aws-resource-neptune-dbcluster.md)

- [AWS::RDS::DBCluster](aws-resource-rds-dbcluster.md)

- [AWS::RDS::DBInstance](aws-resource-rds-dbinstance.md)

- [AWS::Redshift::Cluster](aws-resource-redshift-cluster.md)
