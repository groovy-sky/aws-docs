# AWS::MWAAServerless::Workflow NetworkConfiguration

Network configuration for workflow execution. Specifies VPC security groups and subnets for secure network access. When provided, Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Serverless deploys ECS worker tasks in your specified VPC configuration, enabling secure access to VPC-only resources. The service uses a proxy API container architecture where one container handles external communication while the worker container connects to your VPC for task execution. This design provides both security isolation and connectivity flexibility.
