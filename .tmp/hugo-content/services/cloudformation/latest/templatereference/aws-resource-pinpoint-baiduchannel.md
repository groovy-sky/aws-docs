# AWS::Pinpoint::BaiduChannel

A _channel_ is a type of platform that you can deliver messages to.
You can use the Baidu channel to send notifications to the Baidu Cloud Push notification
service. Before you can use Amazon Pinpoint to send notifications to the Baidu Cloud
Push service, you have to enable the Baidu channel for an Amazon Pinpoint
application.

The BaiduChannel resource represents the status and authentication settings of the
Baidu channel for an application.
