# AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable ResourcePolicy

Creates or updates a resource-based policy document that contains the permissions for
DynamoDB resources, such as a table, its indexes, and stream. Resource-based
policies let you define access permissions by specifying who has access to each resource,
and the actions they are allowed to perform on each resource.

In a CloudFormation template, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format
because CloudFormation converts YAML to JSON before submitting it to DynamoDB. For more information about resource-based policies, see [Using\
resource-based policies for DynamoDB](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-resource-based.md) and [Resource-based policy\
examples](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-examples.md).

While defining resource-based policies in your CloudFormation templates, the
following considerations apply:

- The maximum size supported for a resource-based policy document in JSON format is
20 KB. DynamoDB counts whitespaces when calculating the size of a policy
against this limit.

- Resource-based policies don't support [drift\
detection](../userguide/using-cfn-stack-drift.md). If you update a policy outside of the CloudFormation
stack template, you'll need to update the CloudFormation stack with the
changes.

- Resource-based policies don't support out-of-band changes. If you add, update, or
delete a policy outside of the CloudFormation template, the change won't be
overwritten if there are no changes to the policy within the template.

For example, say that your template contains a resource-based policy, which you
later update outside of the template. If you don't make any changes to the policy in
the template, the updated policy in DynamoDB won’t be synced with the
policy in the template.

Conversely, say that your template doesn’t contain a resource-based policy, but
you add a policy outside of the template. This policy won’t be removed from DynamoDB as long as you don’t add it to the template. When you add a policy to
the template and update the stack, the existing policy in DynamoDB will be
updated to match the one defined in the template.

- Within a resource-based policy, if the action for a DynamoDB
service-linked role (SLR) to replicate data for a global table is denied, adding or
deleting a replica will fail with an error.

- The [AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable](../userguide/aws-resource-dynamodb-globaltable.md) resource doesn't support
creating a replica in the same stack update in Regions other than the Region where
you deploy the stack update.

For a full list of all considerations, see [Resource-based\
policy considerations](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-considerations.md).

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "PolicyDocument" : Json
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  PolicyDocument: Json

```

## Properties

`PolicyDocument`

A resource-based policy document that contains permissions to add to the specified
DynamoDB table, its indexes, and stream. In a CloudFormation
template, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format because CloudFormation
converts YAML to JSON before submitting it to DynamoDB. For more information
about resource-based policies, see [Using\
resource-based policies for DynamoDB](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-resource-based.md) and [Resource-based policy\
examples](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/rbac-examples.md).

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: Json

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

## Examples

### Attaching a resource-based policy to a DynamoDB table created using the `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` resource.

The following CloudFormation template creates a table with the [AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable](../userguide/aws-resource-dynamodb-globaltable.md) resource and attaches a
resource-based policy to the table and its stream. This policy allows the user
`foobar` to perform the [GetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-getitem.md)
operation on the table. Additionally, the following template enables a stream and
then attaches a resource-based policy to the stream. The resource-based policy for
the stream allows the user `foobar` to perform the [GetRecords](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-streams-getrecords.md), [GetShardIterator](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-streams-getsharditerator.md), and [DescribeStream](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-streams-describestream.md) operations on the stream.

###### Important

If you enable a stream within a CloudFormation template and also
define a policy for the stream, the policy is attached to the stream only after
the stream is enabled, but before the stack update is complete.
