# AWS::Deadline::Fleet AcceleratorSelection

Describes a specific GPU accelerator required for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud worker host.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "Name" : String,
  "Runtime" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  Name: String
  Runtime: String

```

## Properties

`Name`

The name of the chip used by the GPU accelerator.

The available GPU accelerators are:

- `t4` \- NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU (16 GiB memory)

- `a10g` \- NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPU (24 GiB memory)

- `l4` \- NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU (24 GiB memory)

- `l40s` \- NVIDIA L40S Tensor Core GPU (48 GiB memory)

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `t4 | a10g | l4 | l40s`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`Runtime`

Specifies the runtime driver to use for the GPU accelerator. You must use the same
runtime for all GPUs in a fleet.

You can choose from the following runtimes:

- `latest` \- Use the latest runtime available for the chip. If you
specify `latest` and a new version of the runtime is released, the new
version of the runtime is used.

- `grid:r570` \- [NVIDIA vGPU software 18](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/18.0/index.html)

- `grid:r535` \- [NVIDIA vGPU software 16](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/16.0/index.html)

If you don't specify a runtime, AWS Deadline Cloud uses `latest` as the default. However,
if you have multiple accelerators and specify `latest` for some and leave others
blank, AWS Deadline Cloud raises an exception.

###### Important

Not all runtimes are compatible with all accelerator types:

- `t4` and `a10g`: Support all runtimes ( `grid:r570`, `grid:r535`)

- `l4` and `l40s`: Only support `grid:r570` and newer

All accelerators in a fleet must use the same runtime version. You cannot mix different runtime versions within a single fleet.

###### Note

When you specify `latest`, it resolves to `grid:r570` for all currently supported accelerators.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Minimum_: `1`

_Maximum_: `100`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
