# AWS::ECS::DaemonTaskDefinition ContainerDependency

The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can contain
multiple dependencies. When a dependency is defined for container startup, for container
shutdown it is reversed.

Your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container
agent to use container dependencies. However, we recommend using the latest container
agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the
latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS\
Container Agent](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance
needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the `ecs-init` package. If your container
instances are launched from version `20190301` or later, then they contain
the required versions of the container agent and `ecs-init`. For more
information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized\
Linux AMI](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized-ami.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Note

For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the
following platforms:

- Linux platform version `1.3.0` or later.

- Windows platform version `1.0.0` or later.

For more information about how to create a container dependency, see [Container dependency](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/example-task-definitions.md#example_task_definition-containerdependency) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service_
_Developer Guide_.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "Condition" : String,
  "ContainerName" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  Condition: String
  ContainerName: String

```

## Properties

`Condition`

The dependency condition of the container. The following are the available conditions
and their behavior:

- `START` \- This condition emulates the behavior of links and volumes
today. It validates that a dependent container is started before permitting
other containers to start.

- `COMPLETE` \- This condition validates that a dependent container
runs to completion (exits) before permitting other containers to start. This can
be useful for nonessential containers that run a script and then exit. This
condition can't be set on an essential container.

- `SUCCESS` \- This condition is the same as `COMPLETE`,
but it also requires that the container exits with a `zero` status.
This condition can't be set on an essential container.

- `HEALTHY` \- This condition validates that the dependent container
passes its Docker health check before permitting other containers to start. This
requires that the dependent container has health checks configured. This
condition is confirmed only at task startup.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `START | COMPLETE | SUCCESS | HEALTHY`

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)
