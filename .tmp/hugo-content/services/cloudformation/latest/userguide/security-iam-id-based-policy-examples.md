# Example IAM identity-based policies for CloudFormation

By default, users and roles don't have permission to create or modify CloudFormation
resources. They also can't perform tasks by using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or
AWS API. To grant users permission to perform actions on the resources that they need, an
IAM administrator can create IAM policies. The administrator can then add the IAM
policies to roles, and users can assume the roles. For more information, see [Defining IAM identity-based policies for CloudFormation](control-access-with-iam.md#iam-id-based-policies).

The following examples show policy statements that you could use to allow or deny
permissions to use one or more CloudFormation actions.

## Require a specific template URL

The following policy grants permissions to use only the
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.template`
template URL to create or update a stack.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:CreateStack",
                "cloudformation:UpdateStack"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "cloudformation:TemplateUrl": [
                        "https://s3.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.template"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Deny all CloudFormation import operations

The following policy grants permissions to complete all CloudFormation operations except
import operations.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAllStackOperations",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "cloudformation:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "DenyImport",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "cloudformation:*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "ForAnyValue:StringLike": {
          "cloudformation:ImportResourceTypes": [
            "*"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Allow import operations for specific resource types

The following policy grants permissions to all stack operations, in addition to
import operations only on specified resources (in this example,
`AWS::S3::Bucket`.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowImport",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "cloudformation:*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "ForAllValues:StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
          "cloudformation:ImportResourceTypes": [
            "AWS::S3::Bucket"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Deny IAM resources in stack templates

The following policy grants permissions to create stacks but denies requests if the
stack's template include any resource from the IAM service. The policy also requires
users to specify the `ResourceTypes` parameter, which is available only for
AWS CLI and API requests. This policy uses explicit deny statements so that if any other
policy grants additional permissions, this policy always remain in effect (an explicit
deny statement always overrides an explicit allow statement).

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : [ "cloudformation:CreateStack" ],
      "Resource" : "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : [ "cloudformation:CreateStack" ],
      "Resource" : "*",
      "Condition" : {
        "ForAnyValue:StringLikeIfExists" : {
          "cloudformation:ResourceTypes" : [ "AWS::IAM::*" ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action" : [ "cloudformation:CreateStack" ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "Null": {
          "cloudformation:ResourceTypes": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Allow stack creation with specific resource types

The following policy is similar to the previous example. The policy grants
permissions to create a stack unless the stack's template includes any resource from the
IAM service. It also requires users to specify the `ResourceTypes`
parameter, which is available only for AWS CLI and API requests. This policy is simpler,
but it doesn't use explicit deny statements. Other policies, granting additional
permissions, could override this policy.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : [ "cloudformation:CreateStack" ],
      "Resource" : "*",
      "Condition" : {
        "ForAllValues:StringNotLikeIfExists" : {
          "cloudformation:ResourceTypes" : [ "AWS::IAM::*" ]
        },
        "Null":{
          "cloudformation:ResourceTypes": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Control access based on resource-mutating API actions

The following policy grants permissions to filter access by the name of a
resource-mutating API action. This is used to control which APIs IAM users can use to
add or remove tags on a stack or stack set. The operation that is used to add or remove
tags should be added as value for the condition key. The following policy grants
`TagResource` and `UntagResource` permissions to mutating
operation `CreateStack`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "CreateActionConditionPolicyForTagUntagResources",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "cloudformation:TagResource",
            "cloudformation:UntagResource"
        ],
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
                "cloudformation:CreateAction": [
                    "CreateStack"
                ]
            }
        }
    }]
}

```

## Restrict stack set operations based on Region and resource types

The following policy grants service-managed stack set permissions. A user with this
policy can only perform operations on stack sets with templates containing Amazon S3 resource
types ( `AWS::S3::*`) or the `AWS::SES::ConfigurationSet` resource
type. If signed in to the organization management account with ID
`123456789012`, the user can also only perform operations on stack sets
that target the OU with ID `ou-1fsfsrsdsfrewr`,
and can only perform operations on the stack set with ID `stack-set-id` that
targets the AWS account with ID
`987654321012`.

Stack set operations fail if the stack set template contains resource types other
than those specified in the policy, or if the deployment targets are OU or account IDs
other than those specified in the policy for the corresponding management accounts and
stack sets.

These policy restrictions only apply when stack set operations target the
`us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, or `eu-west-2`
AWS Regions.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stackset/*",
                "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:type/resource/AWS-S3-*",
                "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:111122223333:type/resource/AWS-SES-ConfigurationSet",
                "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:111122223333:stackset-target/*/ou-1fsfsrsdsfrewr",
                "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:111122223333:stackset-target/stack-set-id/444455556666"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "ForAllValues:StringEqualsIgnoreCase": {
                    "cloudformation:TargetRegion": [
                        "us-east-1",
                        "us-west-2",
                        "eu-west-1"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Allow all IaC generator operations

The following policy allows access to CloudFormation actions related to IaC generator
resource scanning and template management. The first statement grants permissions to
describe, list, and start resource scans. It also allows access to additional required
permissions ( `cloudformation:GetResource`,
`cloudformation:ListResources`, and `cloudformation:ListTypes`)
that enable the IaC generator to retrieve information about resources and available
resource types. The second statement grants full permissions to create, delete,
describe, list, and update generated templates.

You must also grant read permissions for the target AWS services to anyone who will
scan resources with IaC generator. For more information, see [IAM permissions required for scanning resources](generate-iac.md#iac-generator-permissions).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"ResourceScanningOperations",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[
                "cloudformation:DescribeResourceScan",
                "cloudformation:GetResource",
                "cloudformation:ListResources",
                "cloudformation:ListResourceScanRelatedResources",
                "cloudformation:ListResourceScanResources",
                "cloudformation:ListResourceScans",
                "cloudformation:ListTypes",
                "cloudformation:StartResourceScan"
            ],
            "Resource":"*"
        },
        {
            "Sid":"TemplateGeneration",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[
                "cloudformation:CreateGeneratedTemplate",
                "cloudformation:DeleteGeneratedTemplate",
                "cloudformation:DescribeGeneratedTemplate",
                "cloudformation:GetResource",
                "cloudformation:GetGeneratedTemplate",
                "cloudformation:ListGeneratedTemplates",
                "cloudformation:UpdateGeneratedTemplate"
            ],
            "Resource":"*"
        }
    ]
}
