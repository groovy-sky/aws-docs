# Delete a change set for a CloudFormation stack

Deleting a change set removes it from the list of change sets for the stack. Deleting a
change set prevents you or another user from accidentally executing a change set that
shouldn't be applied. Unless you delete them, CloudFormation retains all change sets until you
update the stack.

Delete a change set

###### To delete a change set (console)

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

3. On the **Stacks** page, select the name of the stack that
    contains the change set that you want to delete.

4. In the navigation pane, choose **Change sets** to view a list
    of the stack's change sets.

5. Select the name of the change set that you want to delete.

6. On the change set's details page, choose **Delete change**
**set**.

CloudFormation immediately starts to delete the change set from the stack's list of
    change sets, and you're redirected to the **Stacks** page.

Delete a change set for nested stacks (console)

###### To delete a change set for nested stacks

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

3. On the **Stacks** page, select the stack name associated with
    the root change set.

4. In the navigation pane, choose **Change sets** to view a list
    of the stack's change sets.

5. Select the name of the change set that you want to delete.

6. On the change set's details page, choose **Delete**. By
    choosing **Delete change set**, you will delete the whole hierarchy
    of nested change sets.

###### Note

The delete operation for change sets for nested stacks is asynchronous and
will show a `DELETE_PENDING` status, followed by a
`DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` status. Upon completion of the delete change set
operation, the change sets will be removed from the list. Nested stacks in the
`REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` status will also be deleted if they were created
during the change set creation.

CloudFormation immediately starts to delete the change set from the stack's list of
    change sets.

###### Note

If you have nested stacks that are stuck in an in-progress operation, see
Troubleshooting Errors in [Nested\
stacks rollback failure](troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-errors-nested-stacks-are-stuck).

###### To delete a change set (AWS CLI)

- Run the [delete-change-set](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/delete-change-set.md) command, specifying the ID of the change set
that you want to delete, as shown in the following example:

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation delete-change-set \
      --change-set-name \
        arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:changeSet/SampleChangeSet/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000
```
