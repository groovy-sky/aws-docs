# Get values stored in other services using dynamic references

Dynamic references provide a convenient way for you to specify external values stored and
managed in other services and decouple sensitive information from your
infrastructure-as-code templates. CloudFormation retrieves the value of the specified reference
when necessary during stack and change set operations.

With dynamic references, you can:

- Use secure strings – For sensitive data,
always use secure string parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or secrets in
AWS Secrets Manager to ensure your data is encrypted at rest.

- Limit access – Restrict access to the
Parameter Store parameters or Secrets Manager secrets to only authorized principals and
roles.

- Rotate credentials – Regularly rotate your
sensitive data stored in Parameter Store or Secrets Manager to maintain a high level of
security.

- Automate rotation – Leverage the automatic
rotation features of Secrets Manager to periodically update and distribute your sensitive data
across your applications and environments.

## General considerations

The following are the general considerations for you to consider before you specify
dynamic references in your CloudFormation templates:

- Avoid including dynamic references, or any sensitive data, in resource
properties that are part of a resource's primary identifier. CloudFormation may use
the actual plaintext value in the primary resource identifier, which could be a
security risk. This resource ID may appear in any derived outputs or
destinations.

To determine which resource properties comprise a resource type's primary
identifier, refer to the resource reference documentation for that resource in
[AWS resource and property types reference](../templatereference/aws-template-resource-type-ref.md). In the **Return values** section,
the `Ref` function return value represents the resource properties
that comprise the resource type's primary identifier.

- You can include up to 60 dynamic references in a stack template.

- If you're using transforms (like `AWS::Include` or
`AWS::Serverless`), CloudFormation doesn't resolve dynamic references
before applying the transform. Instead, it passes the literal string of the
dynamic reference to the transform, and resolves the references when you execute
the change set using the template.

- Dynamic references can't be used for secure values (like those stored in
Parameter Store or Secrets Manager) in custom resources.

- Dynamic references are also not supported in
`AWS::CloudFormation::Init` metadata and Amazon EC2
`UserData` properties.

- Don't create a dynamic reference that ends with a backslash (\\). CloudFormation
can't resolve these references, which will cause stack operations to
fail.

references.
