# CloudFormation walkthroughs

This documentation provides a collection of walkthroughs designed to give you hands-on
practice with stack deployments.

- [Refer to resource outputs in another CloudFormation stack](walkthrough-crossstackref.md) – This walkthrough shows you
how to reference outputs from one CloudFormation stack within another stack. Instead of
including all resources in a single stack, you can create related AWS resources in
separate stacks to create more modular and reusable templates.

- [Deploy applications on Amazon EC2](deploying-applications.md)
– Learn how to use CloudFormation to automatically install, configure, and start
up your application on Amazon EC2 instances. This way, you can easily duplicate
deployments and update existing installations without connecting directly to the
instances.

- [Update a CloudFormation stack](updating-stacks-walkthrough.md) – Walk through a simple
progression of updates to a running stack with CloudFormation.

- [Create a scaled and load-balanced application](walkthrough-autoscaling.md)
– Discover how to use CloudFormation to create a scalable and load-balanced
application. This walkthrough covers creating an Auto Scaling group, a load balancer, and
other related resources to ensure your application can handle varying traffic loads
and maintain high availability.

- [Peer with a VPC in another AWS account](peer-with-vpc-in-another-account.md) – This walkthrough
guides you through the process of creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering
connection between two VPCs in different AWS accounts. VPC peering helps you route
traffic between the VPCs and access resources as if they were part of the same
network.

- [Perform ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy using CloudFormation](blue-green.md) – Discover how to
use CloudFormation to perform AWS CodeDeploy blue/green deployments on Amazon ECS. Blue/green
deployments are a way to update your applications or services with minimal
downtime.
