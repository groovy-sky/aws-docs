# Start a resource scan with CloudFormation IaC generator

Before you create a template from existing resources, you first must initiate a
resource scan to discover your current resources and their relationships.

You can start a resource scan using one of the following options. For first-time users
of IaC generator, we recommend the first option.

- Scan all resources (full scan) – Scans
all existing resources in the current account and Region. This scanning process
can take up to 10 minutes for 1,000 resources.

- Scan specific resources (partial scan) –
Manually select which resource types to scan in the current account and Region.
This option provides a faster and more focused scanning process, making it ideal
for iterative template development.

After the scan completes, you can choose which resources and their related resources
to include when generating your template. When using partial scanning, related resources
will only be available during template generation if either:

- You specifically selected them before starting the scan, or

- They were required to discover your selected resource types.

For example, if you select `AWS::EKS::Nodegroup` without selecting
`AWS::EKS::Cluster`, IaC generator automatically includes
`AWS::EKS::Cluster` resources in the scan because discovering the node
group requires discovering the cluster first. In all other cases, the scan will only
include the resources you specifically select.

###### Note

Before you continue, confirm that you have the permissions required to work with
IaC generator. For more information, see [IAM permissions required for scanning resources](generate-iac.md#iac-generator-permissions).

## Start a resource scan (console)

###### To start a resource scan of all resource types (full scan)

1. Open the [IaC\
    generator page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?) of the CloudFormation console.

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region
    that contains the resources to scan.

3. From the **Scans** panel, choose **Start a new**
**scan** and then choose **Scan all resources**.

###### To start a resource scan of specific resource types (partial scan)

1. Open the [IaC\
    generator page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?) of the CloudFormation console.

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region
    that contains the resources to scan.

3. From the **Scans** panel, choose **Start a new**
**scan** and then choose **Scan specific**
**resources**.

4. In the **Start partial scan** dialog box, select up to
    100 resource types, and then choose **Start scan**.

## Start a resource scan (AWS CLI)

###### To start a resource scan of all resource types (full scan)

Use the following [start-resource-scan](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/start-resource-scan.md) command. Replace
`us-east-1` with the AWS Region that
contains the resources to scan.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation start-resource-scan --region us-east-1
```

If successful, this command returns the ARN of the scan. Note the ARN in the
`ResourceScanId` property. You need it to create your
template.

```json

{
    "ResourceScanId":
      "arn:aws:cloudformation:region:account-id:resourceScan/0a699f15-489c-43ca-a3ef-3e6ecfa5da60"
}
```

###### To start a resource scan of specific resource types (partial scan)

1. Use the following [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)) command to store the resource types you want to scan in a
    JSON file named `config.json` in your home directory. The
    following is an example scanning configuration that scans for Amazon EC2
    instances, security groups, and all Amazon S3 resources.

```nohighlight

$ cat > config.json
[
     {
       "Types":[
         "AWS::EC2::Instance",
         "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",
         "AWS::S3::*"
       ]
     }
]
```

2. Use the [start-resource-scan](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/start-resource-scan.md) command with the
    `--scan-filters` option, along with the
    `config.json` file you created, to start the partial scan.
    Replace `us-east-1` with the
    AWS Region that contains the resources to scan.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation start-resource-scan --scan-filters file://config.json --region us-east-1
```

If successful, this command returns the ARN of the scan. Note the ARN in
    the `ResourceScanId` property. You need it to create your
    template.

```json

{
       "ResourceScanId":
         "arn:aws:cloudformation:region:account-id:resourceScan/0a699f15-489c-43ca-a3ef-3e6ecfa5da60"
}
```

###### To monitor the progress of a resource scan

Use the [describe-resource-scan](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-resource-scan.md) command. For the
`--resource-scan-id` option, replace the sample ARN with the
actual ARN.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-resource-scan --region us-east-1 \
  --resource-scan-id arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:resourceScan/0a699f15-489c-43ca-a3ef-3e6ecfa5da60
```

If successful, this command returns output similar to the following:

```json

{
    "ResourceScanId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:region:account-id:resourceScan/0a699f15-489c-43ca-a3ef-3e6ecfa5da60",
    "Status": "COMPLETE",
    "StartTime": "2023-08-21T03:10:38.485000+00:00",
    "EndTime": "2023-08-21T03:20:28.485000+00:00",
    "PercentageCompleted": 100.0,
    "ResourceTypes": [
        "AWS::CloudFront::CachePolicy",
        "AWS::CloudFront::OriginRequestPolicy",
        "AWS::EC2::DHCPOptions",
        "AWS::EC2::InternetGateway",
        "AWS::EC2::KeyPair",
        "AWS::EC2::NetworkAcl",
        "AWS::EC2::NetworkInsightsPath",
        "AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface",
        "AWS::EC2::PlacementGroup",
        "AWS::EC2::Route",
        "AWS::EC2::RouteTable",
        "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",
        "AWS::EC2::Subnet",
        "AWS::EC2::SubnetCidrBlock",
        "AWS::EC2::SubnetNetworkAclAssociation",
        "AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation",
        ...
    ],
    "ResourcesRead": 676
}
```

For a partial scan, the output will look similar to the following:

```json

{
    "ResourceScanId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:region:account-id:resourceScan/0a699f15-489c-43ca-a3ef-3e6ecfa5da60",
    "Status": "COMPLETE",
    "StartTime": "2025-03-06T18:24:19.542000+00:00",
    "EndTime": "2025-03-06T18:25:23.142000+00:00",
    "PercentageCompleted": 100.0,
    "ResourceTypes": [
        "AWS::EC2::Instance",
        "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",
        "AWS::S3::Bucket",
        "AWS::S3::BucketPolicy"
    ],
    "ResourcesRead": 65,
    "ScanFilters": [
        {
            "Types": [
                "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup",
                "AWS::S3::*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For a description of the fields in the output, see [DescribeResourceScan](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-describeresourcescan.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation API Reference_.
