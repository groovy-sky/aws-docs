# Prevent updates to stack resources

When you create a stack, all update actions are allowed on all resources. By default, anyone
with stack update permissions can update all of the resources in the stack. During an update,
some resources might require an interruption or be completely replaced, resulting in new
physical IDs or completely new storage. You can prevent stack resources from being
unintentionally updated or deleted during a stack update by using a stack policy. A stack policy
is a JSON document that defines the update actions that can be performed on designated
resources.

After you set a stack policy, all of the resources in the stack are protected by default. To
allow updates on specific resources, you specify an explicit `Allow` statement for
those resources in your stack policy. You can define only one stack policy per stack, but, you
can protect multiple resources within a single policy. A stack policy applies to all CloudFormation
users who attempt to update the stack. You can't associate different stack policies with
different users.

A stack policy applies only during stack updates. It doesn't provide access controls like an
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. Use a stack policy only as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent accidental
updates to specific stack resources. To control access to AWS resources or actions, use
IAM.

## Example stack policy

The following example stack policy prevents updates to the `ProductionDatabase`
resource:

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "LogicalResourceId/ProductionDatabase"
    }
  ]
}
```

When you set a stack policy, all resources are protected by default. To allow updates on
all resources, we add an `Allow` statement that allows all actions on all
resources. Although the `Allow` statement specifies all resources, the explicit
`Deny` statement overrides it for the resource with the
`ProductionDatabase` logical ID. This `Deny` statement prevents all
update actions, such as replacement or deletion, on the `ProductionDatabase`
resource.

The `Principal` element is required, but supports only the wild card
( `*`), which means that the statement applies to all [principals](../../../glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.md#principal).

###### Note

During a stack update, CloudFormation automatically updates resources that depend on other
updated resources. For example, CloudFormation updates a resource that references an updated
resource. CloudFormation makes no physical changes, such as the resource's ID, to automatically
updated resources, but if a stack policy is associated with those resources, you must have
permission to update them.

## Defining a stack policy

When you create a stack, no stack policy is set, so all update actions are allowed on all
resources. To protect stack resources from update actions, define a stack policy and then set
it on your stack. A stack policy is a JSON document that defines the CloudFormation stack update
actions that CloudFormation users can perform and the resources that the actions apply to. You set
the stack policy when you create a stack, by specifying a text file that contains your stack
policy or typing it out. When you set a stack policy on your stack, any update not explicitly
allowed is denied by default.

You define a stack policy with five elements: `Effect`, `Action`,
`Principal`, `Resource`, and `Condition`. The following
pseudo code shows stack policy syntax.

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny_or_Allow",
      "Action" : "update_actions",
      "Principal" : "*",
      "Resource" : "LogicalResourceId/resource_logical_ID",
      "Condition" : {
        "StringEquals_or_StringLike" : {
          "ResourceType" : [resource_type, ...]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`Effect`

Determines whether the actions that you specify are denied or allowed on the
resource(s) that you specify. You can specify only `Deny` or
`Allow`, such as:

```json

"Effect" : "Deny"
```

###### Important

If a stack policy includes overlapping statements (both allowing and denying
updates on a resource), a `Deny` statement always overrides an
`Allow` statement. To ensure that a resource is protected, use a
`Deny` statement for that resource.

Action

Specifies the update actions that are denied or allowed:

Update:Modify

Specifies update actions during which resources might experience no
interruptions or some interruptions while changes are being applied. All resources
maintain their physical IDs.

Update:Replace

Specifies update actions during which resources are recreated. CloudFormation
creates a new resource with the specified updates and then deletes the old
resource. Because the resource is recreated, the physical ID of the new resource
might be different.

Update:Delete

Specifies update actions during which resources are removed. Updates that
completely remove resources from a stack template require this action.

Update:\*

Specifies all update actions. The asterisk is a wild card that represents all
update actions.

The following example shows how to specify just the replace and delete
actions:

```json

"Action" : ["Update:Replace", "Update:Delete"]
```

To allow all update actions except for one, use `NotAction`. For example,
to allow all update actions except for `Update:Delete`, use
`NotAction`, as shown in this example:

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "NotAction" : "Update:Delete",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Principal

The `Principal` element specifies the entity that the policy applies to.
This element is required but supports only the wild card ( `*`), which means
that the policy applies to all [principals](../../../glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.md#principal).

Resource

Specifies the logical IDs of the resources that the policy applies to. To specify
types of resources, use the `Condition` element.

To specify a single resource, use its logical ID. For example:

```json

"Resource" : ["LogicalResourceId/myEC2instance"]
```

You can use a wild card with logical IDs. For example, if you use a common logical
ID prefix for all related resources, you can specify all of them with a wild
card:

```json

"Resource" : ["LogicalResourceId/CriticalResource*"]
```

You can also use a `Not` element with resources. For example, to allow
updates to all resources except for one, use a `NotResource` element to
protect that resource:

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "NotResource" : "LogicalResourceId/ProductionDatabase"
    }
  ]
}
```

When you set a stack policy, any update not explicitly allowed is denied. By
allowing updates to all resources except for the `ProductionDatabase`
resource, you deny updates to the `ProductionDatabase` resource.

Conditions

Specifies the resource type that the policy applies to. To specify the logical IDs
of specific resources, use the `Resource` element.

You can specify a resource type, such as all EC2 and RDS DB instances, as shown in
the following example:

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
  {
    "Effect" : "Deny",
    "Principal" : "*",
    "Action" : "Update:*",
    "Resource" : "*",
    "Condition" : {
      "StringEquals" : {
        "ResourceType" : ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::RDS::DBInstance"]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Effect" : "Allow",
    "Principal" : "*",
    "Action" : "Update:*",
    "Resource" : "*"
  }
  ]
}
```

The `Allow` statement grants update permissions to all resources and the
`Deny` statement denies updates to EC2 and RDS DB instances. The
`Deny` statement always overrides allow actions.

You can use a wild card with resource types. For example, you can deny update
permissions to all Amazon EC2 resources—such as instances, security groups, and
subnets—by using a wild card, as shown in the following example:

```json

"Condition" : {
  "StringLike" : {
    "ResourceType" : ["AWS::EC2::*"]
  }
}
```

You must use the `StringLike` condition when you use wild cards.

## Setting a stack policy

You can use the console or AWS CLI to apply a stack policy when you create a stack. You can
also use the AWS CLI to apply a stack policy to an existing stack. After you apply a stack
policy, you can't remove it from the stack, but you can use the AWS CLI to modify it.

Stack policies apply to all CloudFormation users who attempt to update the stack. You can't
associate different stack policies with different users.

For information about writing stack policies, see [Defining a stack policy](#stack-policy-reference).

###### To set a stack policy when you create a stack (console)

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region to create the
    stack in.

3. On the **CloudFormation Stacks** page, choose **Create**
**stack**.

4. In the Create Stack wizard, on the **Configure stack options** page,
    expand the **Advanced** section and then choose **Stack**
**policy**.

5. Specify the stack policy:

- To write a policy directly in the console, choose **Enter stack**
**policy** and then type the stack policy directly in the text field.

- To use a policy defined in a separate file, choose **Upload a**
**file**, then **Choose file** to select the file containing
the stack policy.

###### To set a stack policy when you create a stack (AWS CLI)

- Use the [create-stack](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.md) command with the `--stack-policy-body`
option to type in a modified policy or the `--stack-policy-url` option to
specify a file containing the policy.

###### To set a stack policy on an existing stack (AWS CLI only)

- Use the [set-stack-policy](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/set-stack-policy.md) command with the
`--stack-policy-body` option to type in a modified policy or the
`--stack-policy-url` option to specify a file containing the policy.

###### Note

To add a policy to an existing stack, you must have permission to the CloudFormation
[SetStackPolicy](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-setstackpolicy.md) action.

## Updating protected resources

To update protected resources, create a temporary policy that overrides the stack policy
and allows updates on those resources. Specify the override policy when you update the stack.
The override policy doesn't permanently change the stack policy.

To update protected resources, you must have permission to use the CloudFormation [SetStackPolicy](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-setstackpolicy.md) action. For information about setting CloudFormation
permissions, see [Control CloudFormation access with AWS Identity and Access Management](control-access-with-iam.md).

###### Note

During a stack update, CloudFormation automatically updates resources that depend on other
updated resources. For example, CloudFormation updates a resource that references an updated
resource. CloudFormation makes no physical changes, such as the resources' ID, to automatically
updated resources, but if a stack policy is associated with those resources, you must have
permission to update them.

###### To update a protected resource (console)

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. Select the stack that you want to update, choose **Stack actions**,
    and then choose **Update stack**.

3. If you _haven't_ modified the stack template, select **Use**
**current template**, and then click **Next**. If you have
    modified the template, select **Replace current template** and specify
    the location of the updated template in the **Specify template**
    section:

- For a template stored locally on your computer, select **Upload a template**
**file**. Choose **Choose File** to navigate to the file and
select it, and then click **Next**.

- For a template stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, select **Amazon S3 URL**.
Enter or paste the URL for the template, and then click
**Next**.

If you have a template in a versioning-enabled bucket, you can specify a specific
version of the template template by appending
`?versionId=version-id` to the URL. For more
information, see [Working with objects in a versioning-enabled bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/manage-objects-versioned-bucket.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

4. If your template contains parameters, on the **Specify stack**
**details** page, enter or modify the parameter values, and then choose
    **Next**.

CloudFormation populates each parameter with the value that is currently set in the stack
    except for parameters declared with the `NoEcho` attribute. You can use current
    values for those parameters by choosing **Use existing value**.

For more information about using `NoEcho` to mask sensitive information, as
    well as using dynamic parameters to manage secrets, see the [Do not embed credentials in your templates](security-best-practices.md#creds) best practice.

5. Specify an override stack policy.

1. On the **Configure stack options** page, in the
       **Advanced options** section, select **Stack**
      **policy**.

2. Select **Upload a file**.

3. Click **Choose file** and navigate to the file that contains the
       overriding stack policy or type a policy.

4. Choose **Next**.

The override policy must specify an `Allow` statement for the protected
resources that you want to update. For example, to update all protected resources, specify
a temporary override policy that allows all updates:

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

###### Note

CloudFormation applies the override policy only during this update. The override policy
doesn't permanently change the stack policy. To modify a stack policy, see [Modifying a stack policy](#protect-stack-resources-modifying).

6. Review the stack information and the changes that you submitted.

Check that you submitted the correct information, such as the correct parameter values
    or template URL. If your template contains IAM resources, choose **I acknowledge**
**that this template may create IAM resources** to specify that you want to use
    IAM resources in the template. For more information,
    see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

In the **Preview your changes** section, check that CloudFormation will
    make all the changes that you expect. For example, check that CloudFormation adds, removes,
    and modifies the resources that you intended to add, remove, or modify. CloudFormation
    generates this preview by creating a change set for the stack. For more information, see
    [Update CloudFormation stacks using change sets](using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.md).

7. When you are satisfied with your changes, click **Update**.

###### Note

At this point, you also have the option to view the change set to review your
proposed updates more thoroughly. To do so, click **View change set**
instead of **Update**. CloudFormation displays the change set generated
based on your updates. When you are ready to perform the stack update, click
**Execute**.

CloudFormation displays the **Stack details** page for your stack.
    Your stack now has a status of `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`. After
    CloudFormation has successfully finished updating the stack, it sets the stack status to
    `UPDATE_COMPLETE`.

If the stack update fails, CloudFormation; automatically rolls back changes, and sets
    the stack status to `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`.

###### To update a protected resource (AWS CLI)

- Use the [update-stack](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.md) command with the
`--stack-policy-during-update-body` option to type in a modified policy or
the `--stack-policy-during-update-url` option to specify a file containing the
policy.

###### Note

CloudFormation applies the override policy only during this update. The override policy
doesn't permanently change the stack policy. To modify a stack policy, see [Modifying a stack policy](#protect-stack-resources-modifying).

## Modifying a stack policy

To protect additional resources or to remove protection from resources, modify the stack
policy. For example, when you add a database that you want to protect to your stack, add a
`Deny` statement for that database to the stack policy. To modify the policy, you
must have permission to use the [SetStackPolicy](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-setstackpolicy.md) action.

Use the AWS CLI to modify stack policies.

###### To modify a stack policy (AWS CLI)

- Use the [set-stack-policy](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/set-stack-policy.md) command with the
`--stack-policy-body` option to type in a modified policy or the
`--stack-policy-url` option to specify a file containing the policy.

You can't delete a stack policy. To remove all protection from all resources, you modify
the policy to explicitly allow all actions on all resources. The following policy allows all
updates on all resources:

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## More example stack policies

The following example policies show how to prevent updates to all stack resources and to
specific resources, and prevent specific types of updates.

### Prevent updates to all stack resources

To prevent updates to all stack resources, the following policy specifies a
`Deny` statement for all update actions on all resources.

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Prevent updates to a single resource

The following policy denies all update actions on the database with the
`MyDatabase` logical ID. It allows all update actions on all other stack
resources with an `Allow` statement. The `Allow` statement doesn't
apply to the `MyDatabase` resource because the `Deny` statement always
overrides allow actions.

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "LogicalResourceId/MyDatabase"
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can achieve the same result as the previous example by using a default denial. When
you set a stack policy, CloudFormation denies any update that is not explicitly allowed. The
following policy allows updates to all resources except for the
`ProductionDatabase` resource, which is denied by default.

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "NotResource" : "LogicalResourceId/ProductionDatabase"
    }
  ]
}
```

###### Important

There is risk in using a default denial. If you have an `Allow` statement
elsewhere in the policy (such as an `Allow` statement that uses a wildcard),
you might unknowingly grant update permission to resources that you don't intend to.
Because an explicit denial overrides any allow actions, you can ensure that a resource is
protected by using a `Deny` statement.

### Prevent updates to all instances of a resource type

The following policy denies all update actions on the RDS DB instance resource type. It
allows all update actions on all other stack resources with an `Allow` statement.
The `Allow` statement doesn't apply to the RDS DB instance resources because a
`Deny` statement always overrides allow actions.

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*",
      "Condition" : {
        "StringEquals" : {
          "ResourceType" : ["AWS::RDS::DBInstance"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Prevent replacement updates for an instance

The following policy denies updates that would cause a replacement of the instance with
the `MyInstance` logical ID. It allows all update actions on all other stack
resources with an `Allow` statement. The `Allow` statement doesn't
apply to the `MyInstance` resource because the `Deny` statement always
overrides allow actions.

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : "Update:Replace",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "LogicalResourceId/MyInstance"
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Prevent updates to nested stacks

The following policy denies all update actions on the CloudFormation stack resource type
(nested stacks). It allows all update actions on all other stack resources with an
`Allow` statement. The `Allow` statement doesn't apply to the
CloudFormation stack resources because the `Deny` statement always overrides allow
actions.

```json

{
  "Statement" : [
    {
      "Effect" : "Deny",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*",
      "Condition" : {
        "StringEquals" : {
          "ResourceType" : ["AWS::CloudFormation::Stack"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect" : "Allow",
      "Action" : "Update:*",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource" : "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
