# Amazon SNS-backed custom resources

The following topic shows you how to configure a custom resource with a service token that
specifies the Amazon SNS topic that CloudFormation sends requests to. You also learn the sequence of
events and messages sent and received as a result of custom resource stack creation, updates,
and deletion.

With custom resources and Amazon SNS, you can enable scenarios such as adding new resources to a
stack and injecting dynamic data into a stack. For example, when you create a stack,
CloudFormation can send a `Create` request to a topic that's monitored by an
application that's running on an Amazon EC2 instance. The Amazon SNS notification triggers the
application to carry out additional provisioning tasks, such as retrieve a pool of
allow-listed Elastic IP addresses. After it's done, the application sends a response (and any
output data) that notifies CloudFormation to proceed with the stack operation.

When you specify an Amazon SNS topic as the target of a custom resource, CloudFormation sends
messages to the specified SNS topic during stack operations involving the custom resource. To
process these messages and perform the necessary actions, you must have a supported endpoint
subscribed to the SNS topic.

For an introduction to custom resources and how they work, see [How custom resources work](template-custom-resources.md#how-custom-resources-work). For
information about Amazon SNS and how it works, see the [Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide](../../../sns/latest/dg.md).

### Step 1: Stack creation

1. The template developer creates a CloudFormation stack that contains a custom resource.

In the template example below, we use the custom resource type name
    `Custom::SeleniumTester` for the
    custom resource with logical ID
    `MySeleniumTest`. Custom resource type
    names must be alphanumeric and can have a maximum length of 60 characters.

The custom resource type is declared with a service token, optional
    provider-specific properties, and optional [Fn::GetAtt](resources-section-structure.md#resource-properties-getatt) attributes that are
    defined by the custom resource provider. These properties and attributes can be used to pass
    information from the template developer to the custom resource provider and vice-versa. The service
    token specifies an Amazon SNS topic that the resource provider has configured.

```json

{
      "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09",
      "Resources" : {
         "MySeleniumTest" : {
            "Type": "Custom::SeleniumTester",
            "Version" : "1.0",
            "Properties" : {
               "ServiceToken": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:CRTest",
               "seleniumTester" : "SeleniumTest()",
               "endpoints" : [ "http://mysite.com", "http://myecommercesite.com/", "http://search.mysite.com" ],
               "frequencyOfTestsPerHour" : [ "3", "2", "4" ]
            }
         }
      },
      "Outputs" : {
         "topItem" : {
            "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : ["MySeleniumTest", "resultsPage"] }
         },
         "numRespondents" : {
            "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : ["MySeleniumTest", "lastUpdate"] }
         }
      }
}
```

###### Note

The names and values of the data accessed with
`Fn::GetAtt` are returned by the custom resource provider during
the provider's response to CloudFormation. If the custom resource provider is a third-party, then
the template developer must obtain the names of these return values from the
custom resource provider.

2. CloudFormation sends an Amazon SNS notification to the resource provider with a
    `"RequestType" : "Create"` that contains information about the
    stack, the custom resource properties from the stack template, and an S3 URL for
    the response.

The SNS topic that's used to send the notification is embedded in the template
    in the `ServiceToken` property. To avoid using a hardcoded value, a
    template developer can use a template parameter so that the value is entered at the
    time the stack is launched.

The following example shows a custom resource `Create` request which
    includes a custom resource type name, `Custom::SeleniumTester`, created
    with a `LogicalResourceId` of `MySeleniumTester`:

```json

{
      "RequestType" : "Create",
      "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "ResponseURL" : "http://pre-signed-S3-url-for-response",
      "ResourceType" : "Custom::SeleniumTester",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MySeleniumTester",
      "ResourceProperties" : {
         "seleniumTester" : "SeleniumTest()",
         "endpoints" : [ "http://mysite.com", "http://myecommercesite.com/", "http://search.mysite.com" ],
         "frequencyOfTestsPerHour" : [ "3", "2", "4" ]
      }
}
```

For detailed information about the request object for `Create`
    requests, see the [Request and response reference](crpg-ref.md)
    topic.

3. The custom resource provider processes the data sent by the template developer and determines
    whether the `Create` request was successful. The resource provider then
    uses the S3 URL sent by CloudFormation to send a response of either
    `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`.

Depending on the response type, different response fields will be expected by
    CloudFormation. For information about the response fields for a particular request
    type, see the documentation for that request type in the [Request and response reference](crpg-ref.md) section.

In response to a create or update request, the custom resource provider can return data
    elements in the `Data` field of the response. These are name value
    pairs, and the _names_ correspond to the
    `Fn::GetAtt` attributes used with the custom
    resource in the stack template. The _values_ are the data
    that's returned when the template developer calls `Fn::GetAtt`
    on the resource with the attribute name.

The following is an example of a custom resource response:

```json

{
      "Status" : "SUCCESS",
      "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MySeleniumTester",
      "PhysicalResourceId" : "Tester1",
      "Data" : {
         "resultsPage" : "http://www.myexampledomain/test-results/guid",
         "lastUpdate" : "2012-11-14T03:30Z"
      }
}
```

For detailed information about the response object for `Create`
    requests, see the [Request and response reference](crpg-ref.md)
    topic.

The `StackId`, `RequestId`, and
    `LogicalResourceId` fields must be copied verbatim from the request.

4. CloudFormation declares the stack status as `CREATE_COMPLETE` or
    `CREATE_FAILED`. If the stack was successfully created, the
    template developer can use the output values of the created custom resource by
    accessing them with [Fn::GetAtt](resources-section-structure.md#resource-properties-getatt).

For example, the custom resource template used for illustration used
    `Fn::GetAtt` to copy resource outputs into the stack
    outputs:

```json

"Outputs" : {
      "topItem" : {
         "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : ["MySeleniumTest", "resultsPage"] }
      },
      "numRespondents" : {
         "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : ["MySeleniumTest", "lastUpdate"] }
      }
}
```

### Step 2: Stack updates

To update an existing stack, you must submit a template that specifies updates for
the properties of resources in the stack, as shown in the example below. CloudFormation
updates only the resources that have changes specified in the template. For more
information, see [Understand update behaviors of stack resources](using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md).

You can update custom resources that require a replacement of the underlying physical
resource. When you update a custom resource in a CloudFormation template, CloudFormation sends
an update request to that custom resource. If a custom resource requires a replacement,
the new custom resource must send a response with the new physical ID. When CloudFormation
receives the response, it compares the `PhysicalResourceId` between the old
and new custom resources. If they're different, CloudFormation recognizes the update as a
replacement and sends a delete request to the old resource, as shown in [Step 3: Stack deletion](#crpg-walkthrough-stack-deletion).

###### Note

If you didn't make changes to the custom resource, CloudFormation won't send requests
to it during a stack update.

1. The template developer initiates an update to the stack that contains a custom
    resource. During an update, the template developer can specify new Properties in the
    stack template.

The following is an example of an `Update` to the stack template
    using a custom resource type:

```json

{
      "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09",
      "Resources" : {
         "MySeleniumTest" : {
            "Type": "Custom::SeleniumTester",
            "Version" : "1.0",
            "Properties" : {
               "ServiceToken": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:CRTest",
               "seleniumTester" : "SeleniumTest()",
               "endpoints" : [ "http://mysite.com", "http://myecommercesite.com/", "http://search.mysite.com",
                  "http://mynewsite.com" ],
               "frequencyOfTestsPerHour" : [ "3", "2", "4", "3" ]
            }
         }
      },
      "Outputs" : {
         "topItem" : {
            "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : ["MySeleniumTest", "resultsPage"] }
         },
         "numRespondents" : {
            "Value" : { "Fn::GetAtt" : ["MySeleniumTest", "lastUpdate"] }
         }
      }
}
```

2. CloudFormation sends an Amazon SNS notification to the resource provider with a
    `"RequestType" : "Update"` that contains similar information to the
    `Create` call, except that the `OldResourceProperties`
    field contains the old resource properties, and ResourceProperties contains the
    updated (if any) resource properties.

The following is an example of an `Update` request:

```json

{
      "RequestType" : "Update",
      "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "ResponseURL" : "http://pre-signed-S3-url-for-response",
      "ResourceType" : "Custom::SeleniumTester",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MySeleniumTester",
      "PhysicalResourceId" : "Tester1",
      "ResourceProperties" : {
         "seleniumTester" : "SeleniumTest()",
         "endpoints" : [ "http://mysite.com", "http://myecommercesite.com/", "http://search.mysite.com",
            "http://mynewsite.com" ],
         "frequencyOfTestsPerHour" : [ "3", "2", "4", "3" ]
      },
      "OldResourceProperties" : {
         "seleniumTester" : "SeleniumTest()",
         "endpoints" : [ "http://mysite.com", "http://myecommercesite.com/", "http://search.mysite.com" ],
         "frequencyOfTestsPerHour" : [ "3", "2", "4" ]
      }
}
```

For detailed information about the request object for `Update`
    requests, see the [Request and response reference](crpg-ref.md)
    topic.

3. The custom resource provider processes the data sent by CloudFormation. The custom resource
    performs the update and sends a response of either `SUCCESS` or
    `FAILED` to the S3 URL. CloudFormation then compares the
    `PhysicalResourceIDs` of old and new custom resources. If they're
    different, CloudFormation recognizes that the update requires a replacement and sends
    a delete request to the old resource. The following example demonstrates the
    custom resource provider response to an `Update` request.

```json

{
      "Status" : "SUCCESS",
      "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MySeleniumTester",
      "PhysicalResourceId" : "Tester2"
}
```

For detailed information about the response object for `Update`
    requests, see the [Request and response reference](crpg-ref.md)
    topic.

The `StackId`, `RequestId`, and
    `LogicalResourceId` fields must be copied verbatim from the request.

4. CloudFormation declares the stack status as `UPDATE_COMPLETE` or
    `UPDATE_FAILED`. If the update fails, the stack rolls back. If the
    stack was successfully updated, the template developer can access any new output values
    of the created custom resource with `Fn::GetAtt`.

### Step 3: Stack deletion

1. The template developer deletes a stack that contains a custom resource. CloudFormation
    gets the current properties specified in the stack template along with the SNS
    topic, and prepares to make a request to the custom resource provider.

2. CloudFormation sends an Amazon SNS notification to the resource provider with a
    `"RequestType" : "Delete"` that contains current information about
    the stack, the custom resource properties from the stack template, and an S3 URL
    for the response.

Whenever you delete a stack or make an update that removes or replaces the
    custom resource, CloudFormation compares the `PhysicalResourceId` between
    the old and new custom resources. If they're different, CloudFormation recognizes the
    update as a replacement and sends a delete request for the old resource
    ( `OldPhysicalResource`), as shown in the following example of a
    `Delete` request.

```json

{
      "RequestType" : "Delete",
      "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "ResponseURL" : "http://pre-signed-S3-url-for-response",
      "ResourceType" : "Custom::SeleniumTester",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MySeleniumTester",
      "PhysicalResourceId" : "Tester1",
      "ResourceProperties" : {
         "seleniumTester" : "SeleniumTest()",
         "endpoints" : [ "http://mysite.com", "http://myecommercesite.com/", "http://search.mysite.com",
            "http://mynewsite.com" ],
         "frequencyOfTestsPerHour" : [ "3", "2", "4", "3" ]
      }
}
```

For detailed information about the request object for `Delete`
    requests, see the [Request and response reference](crpg-ref.md)
    topic.

`DescribeStackResource`, `DescribeStackResources`, and
    `ListStackResources` display the user-defined name if it has been
    specified.

3. The custom resource provider processes the data sent by CloudFormation and determines whether the
    `Delete` request was successful. The resource provider then uses the
    S3 URL sent by CloudFormation to send a response of either `SUCCESS` or
    `FAILED`. To successfully delete a stack with a custom resource, the
    custom resource provider must respond successfully to a delete request.

The following is an example of a custom resource provider response to a `Delete`
    request:

```json

{
      "Status" : "SUCCESS",
      "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MySeleniumTester",
      "PhysicalResourceId" : "Tester1"
}
```

For detailed information about the response object for `Delete`
    requests, see the [Request and response reference](crpg-ref.md)
    topic.

The `StackId`, `RequestId`, and
    `LogicalResourceId` fields must be copied verbatim from the request.

4. CloudFormation declares the stack status as `DELETE_COMPLETE` or
    `DELETE_FAILED`.
