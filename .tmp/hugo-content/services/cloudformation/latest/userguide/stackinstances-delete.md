# Delete stacks from CloudFormation StackSets

You can delete stacks from StackSets using either the CloudFormation console or the
AWS CLI.

###### Topics

- [Delete stacks from your StackSet (console)](#stackinstances-delete-console)

- [Delete stacks from your StackSet (AWS CLI)](#stackinstances-delete-cli)

###### Note

Deleting stacks from a top-level organizational unit (OU) removes that OU as a
StackSet target.

## Delete stacks from your StackSet (console)

###### To delete stacks

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region
    you created the StackSet in.

3. From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**. On the
    StackSets page, select the StackSet.

4. With your StackSet selected, choose **Delete stacks from**
**StackSet** from the **Actions** menu.

5. On the **Set deployment options** page, first choose the
    accounts and Regions where you want to delete the stacks.
1. \[Self-managed permissions\] For **Accounts**,
       choose **Deploy stacks in accounts** or
       **Deploy stacks in organizational**
      **units**.

      If you choose **Deploy stacks in accounts**,
       paste your target account numbers in the **Account**
      **numbers** text box, separating multiple numbers with
       commas.

      If you choose **Deploy stacks in organizational**
      **units**, paste a target OU ID in the
       **Organization numbers** text box to target all
       accounts that are part of the specified organization.

2. \[Service-managed permissions\] For **Organizational units**
      **(OUs)**, specify the target OU IDs.

      ###### Important

      CloudFormation will delete stacks from both the specified target
      OUs and their child OUs.

      For **Account filter type**, you can refine which
       accounts will have stacks deleted by choosing one of the following
       options and providing account numbers.

- **None** (default) – Delete stacks
from all accounts in the specified OUs.

- **Intersection** – Delete stacks
only from specific individual accounts within the selected
OUs.

- **Difference** – Delete stacks
from all accounts in the selected OUs except for specific
accounts.

- **Union** – Delete stacks from the
specified OUs plus additional individual accounts.

3. For **Specify regions**, choose the Regions from
       which you want to delete stacks within the target accounts.
6. For **Deployment options**, do the following:

- For **Maximum concurrent accounts**, specify how
many accounts are processed concurrently.

- For **Failure tolerance**, specify the maximum
number of account failures allowed per Region. The operation will
stop and won't proceed to other Regions once this limit is
reached.

- For **Retain stacks**, enable this option to save
the stacks and their associated resources when removing them from
your StackSet. The resources stay in their current state but are no
longer part of the StackSet.

- For **Region concurrency**, choose how to process
Regions: **Sequential** (one Region at a time) or
**Parallel** (multiple Regions
concurrently).

- For **Concurrency mode**, choose how concurrency
behaves during operation execution.

- **Strict failure tolerance** –
Reduces account concurrency level when failures occur,
staying within **Failure tolerance**
+1.

- **Soft failure tolerance** –
Maintains your specified concurrency level (the value of
**Maximum concurrent accounts**)
regardless of failures.

7. Choose **Next**.

8. On the **Review** page, review your choices. To make
    changes, choose **Edit** on the related section.

9. When you are ready to remove the stacks from your StackSet, choose
    **Submit**.

After stack deletion is finished, you can verify that stacks were deleted
    from your StackSet in the StackSet detail page, on the **Stack**
**instances** tab.

## Delete stacks from your StackSet (AWS CLI)

###### Note

When acting as a delegated administrator, you must include `--call-as
                        DELEGATED_ADMIN` in the command.

Use the **delete-stack-instances** command with your StackSet
name.

In these examples, we use the `--no-retain-stacks` option because we
aren't retaining any stacks. Use `--retain-stacks` instead of
`--no-retain-stacks` if you want to keep the stacks and their
resources.

For `--regions`, specify the AWS Regions you want to delete stacks
from, for example, `us-west-2` and `us-east-1`.

Set concurrent account processing and other preferences using the
`--operation-preferences` option. These examples use count-based
settings. Note that `MaxConcurrentCount` must not exceed
`FailureToleranceCount` \+ 1\. For percentage-based settings, use
`FailureTolerancePercentage` or `MaxConcurrentPercentage`
instead.

###### To delete stacks (self-managed permissions)

For the `--accounts` option, specify the IDs of the account to
delete stacks from.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation delete-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
  --accounts account_ID_1 account_ID_2 \
  --regions us-west-2 us-east-1 \
  --no-retain-stacks \
  --operation-preferences MaxConcurrentCount=1,FailureToleranceCount=0
```

###### To delete stacks (service-managed permissions)

For `--deployment-targets`, specify the organization root ID or
organizational unit (OU) IDs to delete stacks from.

###### Important

CloudFormation will delete stacks from both the specified target OUs and their
child OUs.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation delete-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
  --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=ou-rcuk-1x5jlwo,ou-rcuk-slr5lh0a \
  --regions us-west-2 us-east-1 \
  --no-retain-stacks \
  --operation-preferences MaxConcurrentCount=1,FailureToleranceCount=0
```

For more information, see [DeleteStackInstances](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-deletestackinstances.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation API Reference_.

Optionally, after stack deletion is finished, verify that stacks were deleted from
your StackSet by running the **describe-stack-set-operation** command to
show the status and results of the delete stacks operation. For
`--operation-id`, use the operation ID that was returned by your
**delete-stack-instances** command.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation --stack-set-name my-stackset \
  --operation-id ddf16f54-ad62-4d9b-b0ab-3ed8e9example
```
