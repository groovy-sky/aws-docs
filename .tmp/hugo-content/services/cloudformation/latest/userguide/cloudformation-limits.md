# Understand CloudFormation quotas

Your AWS account has CloudFormation quotas that you might need to know when authoring templates
and creating stacks. By understanding these quotas, you can avoid limitation errors that would
require you to redesign your templates or stacks.

The following table shows the CloudFormation quotas.

Quotas

255 characters

[Parameter value](parameters-section-structure.md)

to deregister versions you aren't using anymore.

[Resources](resources-section-structure.md)

example, [nested stacks](using-cfn-nested-stacks.md).

[Resources in concurrent stack\
operations](resources-section-structure.md)

The maximum number of resources you can have involved in stack operations (create,
update, or delete operations) in your Region at a given time.

Use the [DescribeAccountLimits](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-describeaccountlimits.md) API to determine the current limit for an account in a
specific Region.

## Feature availability

Not all features of CloudFormation may be available in every Region. For more information about
AWS Regions, see [Global\
infrastructure Region table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

- [Macros](template-macros.md) are currently not available in the following
Region:

- Asia Pacific (Jakarta)

- [Performing ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy using\
CloudFormation](blue-green.md) is currently not available in the following Regions:

- Africa (Cape Town)

- Asia Pacific (Osaka)

- Europe (Milan)

## StackSets and macros

StackSets does not currently support creating or updating stack sets with
service-managed permissions from templates that contain macros. This includes transforms, which
are macros hosted by CloudFormation. For more information about macros, see [Template macros](template-macros.md).
