# Automation actions reference

The following is the reference documentation for automation actions used in App Studio.

An automation action, commonly referred to as an **action**,
is an individual step of logic that make up an automation. Each action performs a specific task, whether it's sending an email, creating a data record, invoking a Lambda function,
or calling APIs. Actions are added to automations from the action library, and can be grouped into conditional statements or loops.

For information about creating and configuring automations and their actions, see the topics in
[Automations and actions: Define your app's business logic](automations.md).

## Invoke API

Invokes an HTTP REST API request. Builders can use this action to send requests from App Studio to other systems or services with APIs. For example, you
could use it to connect to third-party systems or homegrown applications to access business critical data, or invoke API endpoints that cannot be called by dedicated
App Studio actions.

For more information about REST APIs, see [What is a RESTful API?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api).

### Properties

#### Connector

The **Connector** to use for the API requests made by this action. The connector dropdown only contains
connectors of the following types: `API Connector` and `OpenAPI Connector`. Depending
on how the connector is configured, it can contain
important information such as credentials and default headers or query parameters.

For more information about
API connectors, including a comparison between using `API Connector` and `OpenAPI Connector`,
see [Connect to third-party services](add-connector-third-party.md).

#### API request configuration properties

Choose **Configure API request** from the properties panel to open the request configuration dialog box. If
an **API connector** is selected, the dialog box will include connector information.

**Method:** The method for the API call. Possible values are as follows:

- `DELETE`: Deletes a specified resource.

- `GET`: Retrieves information or data.

- `HEAD`: Retrieves only the headers of a response without the body.

- `POST`: Submits data to be processed.

- `PUSH`: Submits data to be processed.

- `PATCH`: Partially updates a specified resource.

**Path:** The relative path to the resource.

**Headers:** Any headers in the form of key-value pairs to be sent with the API request.
If a connector is selected, its configured headers will
be automatically added and cannot be removed. The configured headers cannot be edited, but you can override them by adding another header
with the same name.

**Query parameters:** Any query parameters in the form of key-value pairs to be sent with the API request.
If a connector is selected, its configured query parameters will
be automatically added and cannot be edited or removed.

**Body:** Information to be sent with the API request in JSON format. There is no body for `GET` requests.

#### Mocked output

Actions do not interact with external services or resources in the preview environment. The **Mocked output**
field is used to provide a JSON expression that simulates the behavior of a connector in the preview environment for testing purposes.
This snippet is stored in the action's `results` map, just like the connector response would be for a published app
in the live environment.

With this field, you can test various scenarios and their impact on other actions within the
automation such as simulating different result values, error scenarios, edge cases, or unhappy paths without communicating with
external services through connectors.

## Invoke AWS

Invokes an operation from an AWS service. This is a general action for calling AWS services or operations, and
should be used if there is not a dedicated action for the desired AWS service or operation.

### Properties

#### Service

The AWS service which contains the operation to be run.

#### Operation

The operation to be run.

#### Connector

The connector to be used for the operations run by this action. The configured connector should be set up with the
proper credentials to run the operation, and other configuration information, such as the AWS region that contains any
resources referenced in the operation.

#### Configuration

The JSON input to be when running the specified operation. For more information about configuring inputs for AWS operations,
see the [AWS SDK for JavaScript](../../../../reference/sdk-for-javascript.md).

## Invoke Lambda

Invokes an existing Lambda function.

### Properties

#### Connector

The connector to be used for the Lambda functions run by this action. The configured connector should be set up with the
proper credentials to access the Lambda function, and other configuration information, such as the AWS region that contains the
Lambda function. For more information about configuring a connector for Lambda, see [Step 3: Create Lambda connector](connectors-lambda.md#connectors-lambda-create-connector).

#### Function name

The name of the Lambda function to be run. Note that this is the function name, and not the function ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

#### Function event

Key-value pairs to be passed along to your Lambda function as the event payload.

#### Mocked output

Actions do not interact with external services or resources in the preview environment. The **Mocked output**
field is used to provide a JSON expression that simulates the behavior of a connector in the preview environment for testing purposes.
This snippet is stored in the action's `results` map, just like the connector response would be for a published app
in the live environment.

With this field, you can test various scenarios and their impact on other actions within the
automation such as simulating different result values, error scenarios, edge cases, or unhappy paths without communicating with
external services through connectors.

## Loop

Runs nested actions repeatedly to iterate through a list of items, one item at a time. For example, add the
[Create record](#automations-actions-reference-create-record) action to a loop action
to create multiple records.

The loop action can be nested within other loops or condition actions. The loop actions are run sequentially, and not in parallel. The
results of each action within the loop can only be accessed to subsequent actions within the same loop iteration. They cannot be accessed outside of
the loop or in different iterations of the loop.

### Properties

#### Source

The list of items to iterate through, one item at a time. The source can be the result of a previous action or a static list of strings, numbers, or objects that
you can provide using a JavaScript expression.

##### Examples

The following list contains examples of source inputs.

- Results from a previous action: `{{results.actionName.data}}`

- A list of numbers: `{{[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}}`

- A list of strings: `{{["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"]}}`

- A computed value: `{{params.actionName.split("\n")}}`

#### Current item name

The name of the variable that can be used to reference the current item being iterated. The current item name is configurable so that you can nest two or more loops
and access variables from each loop. For example, if you are looping through countries and cities with two loops, you could configure and reference `currentCountry`
and `currentCity`.

## Condition

Runs actions based on the result of one or more specified logical conditions that are evaluated when the automation is run. The condition action
is made up of the following components:

- A _condition_ field, which is used to provide a JavaScript expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.

- A _true branch_, which contains actions that are run if the condition evalutes to `true`.

- A _false branch_, which contains actions that are run if the condition evalutes to `false`.

Add actions to the true and false branches by dragging them into the condition action.

### Properties

#### Condition

The JavaScript expression to be evaluated when the action is run.

## Create record

Creates one record in an existing App Studio entity.

### Properties

#### Entity

in the entity.

## Update record

Updates an existing record in an App Studio entity.

### Properties

#### Entity

The entity that contains the records to be updated.

#### Conditions

The criteria that defines which records are updated by the action. You can group conditions to create one logical statement.
You can combine groups or conditions with `AND` or `OR` statements.

## Invoke data action

Runs a data action with optional parameters.

### Properties

#### Data action

The data action to be run by the action.

#### Parameters

Data action parameters to be used by the data action. Data action parameters are used to send values that are used as inputs
for data actions. Data action parameters can be added when configuring the automation action, but must be edited in the **Data** tab.

#### Advanced settings

The `Invoke data action` action contains the following advanced settings:

- **Page size:** The maximum number of records to fetch in each query. The default value is 500, and the maximum value is 3000.

- **Pagination token:** The token used to fetch additional records from a query. For example, if the `Page size` is
set to 500, but there are more than 500 records, passing the pagination token to a subsequent query will fetch the next 500. The token will be undefined if
no more records or pages exist.
