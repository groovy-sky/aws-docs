# Data dependencies and timing considerations

When building complex applications in App Studio, it's crucial to understand and manage data
dependencies between different data components, such as forms, detail views, and automation-powered components.
Data components and automations may not complete their data retrieval or execution at the same time, which can
lead to timing issues, errors, and unexpected behavior. By being aware of potential timing issues and following best practices, you can create more reliable and
consistent user experiences in your App Studio applications.

Some potential issues are as follows:

1. **Render timing conflicts:** Data components may render in an order that doesn't align with
    their data dependencies, potentially causing visual inconsistencies or errors.

2. **Automation run timing:** Automation tasks may complete before components have fully loaded,
    leading to runtime execution errors.

3. **Component crashes:** Components powered by automations may crash on invalid responses or when the
    automation hasn't finished running.

## Example: Order details and customer information

This example demonstrates how dependencies between data components can lead to timing issues and potential errors in data display.

Consider an application with the following two data components on the same page:

- A Detail component ( `orderDetails`) that fetches order data.

- A Detail component ( `customerDetails`) that displays customer details related to the order.

In this application, there are two fields in the `orderDetails` detail component, configured with the following values:

```

// 2 text fields within the orderDetails detail component

// Info from orderDetails Component
{{ui.orderDetails.data[0].name}}

// Info from customerDetails component
{{ui.customerDetails.data[0].name}} // Problematic reference
```

In this example, the `orderDetails` component is attempting to display the customer name by referencing data from the `customerDetails`
component. This is problematic, because the `orderDetails` component may render before the `customerDetails` component has fetched its data.
If the `customerDetails` component data fetch is delayed or fails, the `orderDetails` component will display incomplete or incorrect information.

## Data dependency and timing best practices

Use the following best practices to mitigate data dependency and timing issues in your App Studio app:

1. **Use conditional rendering:** Only render components or display data when you've confirmed it's available.
    Use conditional statements to check for data presence before displaying it. The following snippet shows an example conditional statement:

```nohighlight

{{ui.someComponent.data ? ui.someComponent.data.fieldName : "Loading..."}}
```

2. **Manage child component visibility:** For components like Stepflow, Form, or Detail that render
    children before their data is loaded, manually set the visibility of child components. The following snippet shows an example of setting visibility based on parent component
    data availability:

```nohighlight

{{ui.parentComponent.data ? true : false}}
```

3. **Use join queries:** When possible, use join queries to fetch related data in a single query.
    This reduces the number of separate data fetches and minimizes timing issues between data components.

4. **Implement error handing in automations:** Implement robust error handling in your automations to gracefully
    manage scenarios where expected data is not available or invalid responses are received.

5. **Use optional chaining:** When accessing nested properties, use optional chaining to
    prevent errors if a parent property is undefined. The following snippet shows an example of optional chaining:

```nohighlight

{{ui.component.data?.[0]?.fieldSystemName}}
```
