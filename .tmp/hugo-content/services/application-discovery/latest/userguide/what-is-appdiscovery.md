# What is AWS Application Discovery Service?

AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan your migration to the AWS cloud by collecting usage and
configuration data about your on-premises
servers and
databases. Application Discovery Service is integrated with
AWS Migration Hub and
AWS Database Migration Service Fleet
Advisor.
Migration Hub simplifies your migration tracking as it aggregates your migration status information
into a single console. You can view the discovered servers, group them into applications,
and then track the migration status of each application from the Migration Hub console in your
home Region. You can
use DMS Fleet Advisor to assess migrations options for database
workloads.

All discovered data is stored in your AWS Migration Hub home Region. Therefore, you must set
your home Region in the Migration Hub console or with CLI commands before performing any discovery
and migration activities. Your data can be exported for analysis in Microsoft Excel or AWS
analysis tools such as Amazon Athena and Amazon Quick.

Using Application Discovery Service APIs, you can export the system performance and utilization data for your
discovered servers. Input this data into your cost model to compute the cost of running
those servers in AWS. Additionally, you can export data about the network connections that
exist between servers. This information helps you determine the network dependencies between
servers and group them into applications for migration planning.

###### Note

Your home Region must be set in AWS Migration Hub before you begin the process of discovery,
because your data will be stored in your home Region. For more information about working
with a home Region, see [Home Region](../../../migrationhub/latest/ug/home-region.md).

Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your
on-premises servers:

- **Agentless discovery** can be performed by deploying
the Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector) (OVA file)
through your VMware vCenter. After Agentless Collector is configured, it
identifies virtual machines (VMs) and hosts associated with vCenter.
Agentless Collector collects the following static configuration data:
Server hostnames, IP addresses, MAC addresses, disk resource allocations, database
engine versions, and database schemas. Additionally, it collects the utilization
data for each VM and database providing the average and peak utilization for metrics
such as CPU, RAM, and Disk I/O.

- **Agent-based discovery** can be performed by
deploying the AWS Application Discovery Agent (Discovery Agent) on each of your VMs and physical servers. The
agent installer is available for Windows and Linux operating systems. It collects
static configuration data, detailed time-series system-performance information,
inbound and outbound network connections, and processes that are running.

- **File-based import** allows you to import details of
your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the
Agentless Collector or Discovery Agent, so you can perform migration assessment
and planning directly from your imported data. The data ingested is dependent on the
data provided.

Application Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner Network (APN)
partners. These third-party solutions can help you import details about your on-premises
environment directly into Migration Hub, without using any agentless collector or discovery agent.
Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the
Application Discovery Service database using the public API. In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view
it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track migrations.

## VMware Discovery

If you have virtual machines (VMs) that are running in the VMware vCenter environment,
you can use the Agentless Collector to collect system information without
having to install an agent on each VM. Instead, you load this on-premises appliance into
vCenter and allow it to discover all of its hosts and VMs.

Agentless Collector captures system performance information and resource
utilization for each VM running in the vCenter, regardless of what operating system is
in use. However, it cannot “look inside” each of the VMs, and as such, cannot figure out
what processes are running on each VM nor what network connections exist. Therefore, if
you need this level of detail and want to take a closer look at some of your existing
VMs in order to assist in planning your migration, you can install the Discovery Agent on an
as-needed basis.

Also, for VMs hosted on VMware, you can use both the Agentless Collector and
Discovery Agent to perform discovery simultaneously. For details regarding the exact types of
data each discovery tool will collect, see [Using the VMware vCenter Agentless Collector data collection module](agentless-collector-gs-data-collection-vcenter.md).

## Database discovery

If you have database and analytics servers in your on-premises environment, then you
can use the Agentless Collector to discover and inventory these servers. You
can then collect performance metrics for each database server without the need to
install Agentless Collector on each computer in your environment.

The Agentless Collector database and analytics data collection module
captures metadata and performance metrics that provide insight into your data
infrastructure. The database and analytics data collection module uses LDAP in Microsoft
Active Directory to gather information about the OS, database, and analytics servers in
your network. Then, the data collection module periodically runs queries to collect
actual utilization metrics of CPU, memory, and disk capacity for the databases and
analytics servers. For details regarding the collected metrics, see [Data collected \
by the database and analytics module](agentless-collector-data-collected-database-analytics.md).

After Agentless Collector completes data collection from your environment,
you can use the AWS DMS console for further analysis and for planning your migration. For
example, to choose an optimal migration target in the AWS Cloud, you can generate
target recommendations for your source databases. For more information, see [Using the database and analytics data collection module](agentless-collector-gs-database-analytics-collection.md).

## Assumptions

To use Application Discovery Service, the following is assumed:

- You have signed up for AWS. For more information, see [Setting up Application Discovery Service](setting-up.md).

- You have selected a Migration Hub home Region. For more information, see [the\
documentation regarding home Regions](../../../migrationhub/latest/ug/home-region.md).

Here's what to expect:

- The Migration Hub home Region is the only Region where Application Discovery Service stores your
discovery and planning data.

- Discovery agents, connectors, and imports can be used in your selected Migration Hub
home Region only.

- For a list of AWS Regions where you can use Application Discovery Service, see the [Amazon Web Services General Reference](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#migrationhub-region).
