# Configuring Agentless Collector

Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector) is an Amazon Linux 2
based virtual machine (VM). The following section describes how to configure a collector
VM on the Agentless Collector console's **Configure**
**Agentless Collector** page.

###### To configure a collector VM on the **Configure Agentless Collector** page

1. For **Collector name**, enter a name for the collector to
    identify it. The name can contain spaces but it cannot contain special
    characters.

2. Under **Data synchronization**, enter the AWS access key
    and secret key for the AWS account IAM user to specify as the destination
    account to receive the data discovered by the collector. For information about
    the requirements for the IAM user, see [Deploying Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-deploying.md#agentless-collector-gs-iam-user).
1. For **AWS access-key**, enter the access key of the
       AWS account IAM user that you're specifying as the destination
       account.

2. For **AWS secret-key**, enter the secret key of the
       AWS account IAM user that you are you're specifying as the
       destination account.

3. (Optional) If your network requires the use of a proxy to access
       AWS, enter the proxy host, proxy port, and, optionally, the
       credentials needed to authenticate with your existing proxy
       server.
3. Under **Agentless Collector password**, set up a
    password to use to authenticate access to Agentless Collector.

- Passwords are case-sensitive

- Passwords must be between 8 and 64 characters in length

- Passwords must contain at least one character from each of the
following four categories:

- Lowercase letters (a-z)

- Uppercase letters (A-Z)

- Numbers (0-9)

- Non-alphanumeric characters (@$!#%\*?&)

- Passwords cannot contain special characters other than the following
ones: @$!#%\*?&

1. For **Agentless Collector password**, enter
       a password to use to authenticate access to the collector.

2. For **Re-enter Agentless Collector**
      **password**, for verification, enter the password
       again.
4. Under **Other settings**, read the **License**
**Agreement**. If you agree to accept it, select the check
    box.

5. To enable automatic updates for Agentless Collector, under
    **Other settings**, select **Automatically update**

The following topics describe optional collector configuration tasks.

###### Optional Configuration Tasks

- [(Optional) Configure a static IP address for the Agentless Collector VM](#agentless-collector-gs-configure-ip)

- [(Optional) Reset the Agentless Collector VM back to using DHCP](#agentless-collector-gs-configure-dhcp)

- [(Optional) Configure the Kerberos authentication protocol](#agentless-collector-gs-configure-kerberos)

## (Optional) Configure a static IP address for the Agentless Collector VM

The following steps describe how to configure a static IP address for the
Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector) VM. When first
installed, the collector VM is configured to use the Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP).

###### Note

The Agentless Collector supports IPv4. It does not support
IPv6.

Agentless Collector version 2

###### To configure a static IP address for the collector VM

1. Collect the following network information from VMware
    vCenter:

- **Static IP address**
– An unsigned IP address in the subnet. For
example, 192.168.1.138.

- **CIDR netmask** –
To get the CIDR netmask, check the IP address setting of
the VMware vCenter host that hosts the collector VM. For
example, /24.

- **Default Gateway**
– To get the default gateway, check the IP
address setting of the VMware vCenter host that hosts
the collector VM. For example, 192.168.1.1.

- **Primary DNS** –
To get the primary DNS, check the IP address setting of
the VMware vCenter host that hosts the collector VM. For
example, 192.168.1.1.

- (Optional) **Secondary**
**DNS**

- (Optional) **Local domain**
**name** – This allows the collector
to reach the vCenter host URL without the domain
name.

2. Open the collector’s VM console and sign in as
    `ec2-user` using the password
    `collector` as shown in the following
    example.

```bash

username: ec2-user
password: collector
```

3. Disable the network interface, by entering the following
    command in the remote terminal.

```

sudo ip link set ens192 down
```

4. Update the interface configuration by using the following
    steps.
1. Open 10-cloud-init-ens192.network in the vi editor by
       using the following command.

      ```

      sudo vi /etc/systemd/network/10-cloud-init-ens192.network
      ```

2. Update the values, as shown in the following example,
       with the information that you collected in the **Collect network information**
       step.

      ```nohighlight

      [Match]
      Name=ens192

      [Network]
      DHCP=no
      Address=static-ip-value/CIDR-netmask
      Gateway=gateway-value
      DNS=dnsserver-value
      ```
5. Update the Domain Name System (DNS) using the following
    steps.
1. Open the `resolv.conf` file in vi
       using the following command.

      ```

      sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
      ```

2. Update the `resolv.conf` file in vi
       using the following command.

      ```nohighlight

      search localdomain-name
      options timeout:2 attempts:5
      nameserver dnsserver-value
      ```

      The following example shows an edited
       `resolv.conf` file.

      ```

      search vsphere.local
      options timeout:2 attempts:5
