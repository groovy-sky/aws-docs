# Sorting data collectors in the AWS Migration Hub console

If you deployed many data collectors, you can sort the displayed list of deployed
collector's on the **Data Collectors** page of the console. You sort
the list by applying filters in the search bar. You can search and filter on most of the
criteria specified in the **Data Collectors** list.

The following table shows the search criteria that you can use for
**Agents**, including operators, values, and a definition of the
values.
