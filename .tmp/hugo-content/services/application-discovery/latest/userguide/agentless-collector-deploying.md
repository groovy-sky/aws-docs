AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](application-discovery-service-availability-change.md).

# Deploying Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector

To deploy Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector, you must first create an IAM user and
download the collector. This page walks you through the steps to take to deploy a
collector.

## Create an IAM user for Agentless Collector

To use Agentless Collector, in the AWS account that you used in [Sign in to the Migration Hub console and choose a home Region](setting-up.md#setting-up-choose-home-region), you must create an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) user. Then, set up this IAM user to use the following AWS managed policy
[AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentlessCollectorAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#security-iam-awsmanpol-AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentlessCollectorAccess). You attach this IAM
policy when you create the IAM user.

To use the database and analytics data collection module, create two customer
managed IAM policies. These policies provide access your Amazon S3 bucket and the AWS DMS
API. For more information, see [Create a customer\
managed policy](../../../iam/latest/userguide/tutorial-managed-policies.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- Use the following JSON code to create the
`DMSCollectorPolicy` policy.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "dms:DescribeFleetAdvisorCollectors",
              "dms:ModifyFleetAdvisorCollectorStatuses",
              "dms:UploadFileMetadataList"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      }]
}

```

- Use the following JSON code to create the
`FleetAdvisorS3Policy` policy.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:GetObject*",
                  "s3:GetBucket*",
                  "s3:List*",
                  "s3:DeleteObject*",
                  "s3:PutObject*"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name",
                  "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/*"
              ]
          }
      ]
}

```

In the preceding example, replace
`bucket_name` with the name of
the Amazon S3 bucket that you created in the prerequisites step.

We recommend that you create a non-administrative IAM user to use with
Agentless Collector. When creating non-administrative IAM users, follow
the security best practice [Grant Least\
Privilege](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md#grant-least-privilege), granting users minimum permissions.

###### To create a non-administrator IAM user to use with Agentless Collector

1. In AWS Management Console, navigate to the IAM console, using the AWS account that
    you used to set the home Region in [Sign in to the Migration Hub console and choose a home Region](setting-up.md#setting-up-choose-home-region).

2. Create a non-administrator IAM user by following the instructions for
    creating a user with the console as described in [Creating an IAM user in your\
    AWS account](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-users-create.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

While following the instructions in the
    _IAM User Guide_:

- When on the step about selecting the type of access, select
**Programmatic access**. Note, while not
recommended, only select **AWS Management Console**
**access** if you plan to use the same IAM user
credentials for accessing the AWS console.

- When on the step about the **Set permission**
page, choose the option to **Attach existing policies to**
**user directly**. Then select the
`AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentlessCollectorAccess`
AWS managed policy from the list of policies.

Next, select the `DMSCollectorPolicy` and
`FleetAdvisorS3Policy` customer managed IAM
policies.

- When on the step about viewing the user's access keys (access key
IDs and secret access keys), follow the guidance in the
**Important** note about saving the user's new
access key ID and secret access key in a safe and secure place.
You'll need these access keys in [Configuring Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-gs-configure.md).

It's an AWS security best practice to rotate access keys. For
information about rotating keys, see [Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require\
long-term credentials](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md#rotate-credentials) in the
_IAM User Guide._

## Download the Agentless Collector

To set up the Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), you
must download and deploy the Agentless Collector Open Virtualization
Archive (OVA) file. The Agentless Collector is a virtual appliance that you
install in your on-premises VMware environment. This step describes how to download
the collector OVA file and the next step describes how to deploy it.

###### To download the collector OVA file and verify its checksum

1. Sign in to vCenter as a VMware administrator and switch to the directory
    where you want to download the Agentless Collector OVA file.

2. Download the OVA file from the following URL:

[Agentless Collector OVA](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws.agentless.discovery.collector.bundle/releases/latest/ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector.ova)

3. Depending on which hashing algorithm you use in your system environment,
    download either the [MD5](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws.agentless.discovery.collector.bundle/releases/latest/ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector.ova.md5) or [SHA256](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws.agentless.discovery.collector.bundle/releases/latest/ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector.ova.sha256) to get the file containing the checksum value. Use the
    downloaded value to verify the
    `ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector` file
    downloaded in the preceding step.

4. Depending on your variation of Linux, run the version appropriate MD5
    command or SHA256 command to verify that the cryptographic signature of the
    `ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector.ova`
    file matches the value in the respective MD5/SHA256 file that you
    downloaded.

```

$ md5sum ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector.ova
```

```

$ sha256sum ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector.ova
```

## Deploy Agentless Collector

###### To deploy Agentless Collector

1. Sign in to vCenter as a VMware administrator.

2. Use one of the following ways to install the OVA file:
   - Use the UI: Choose **File**, choose
      **Deploy OVF Template**, select the collector
      OVA file you downloaded in the previous section, and then complete
      the wizard. Ensure the proxy settings in the server management
      dashboard are configured correctly.

   - Use the command line: To install the collector OVA file from the
      command line, download and use the VMware Open Virtualization Format
      Tool (ovftool). To download ovftool, select a release from the
      [OVF\
      Tool Documentation](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf) page.

     The following is an example of using the ovftool command line tool
      to install the collector OVA file.

     ```nohighlight

     ovftool --acceptAllEulas --name=AgentlessCollector --datastore=datastore1 -dm=thin ApplicationDiscoveryServiceAgentlessCollector.ova 'vi://username:password@vcenterurl/Datacenter/host/esxi/'
     ```

     ###### The following describe the `replaceable` values in the example

- The name is the name that you want to use for your
Agentless Collector VM.

- The datastore is the name of the datastore in your
vCenter.

- The OVA file name is the name of the downloaded collector
OVA file.

- The username/password are your vCenter credentials.

- The vcenterurl is the URL of your vCenter.

- The vi path is the path to your VMware ESXi host.
3. Locate the deployed Agentless Collector in your vCenter.
    Right-click the VM, and then choose **Power**,
    **Power On**.

4. After a few minutes, the IP address of the collector displays in vCenter.
    You use this IP address to connect to the collector.
