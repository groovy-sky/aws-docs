# Resilience in AWS CloudTrail

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which
are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With
Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically
fail over between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more
highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or
multiple
data center infrastructures. If you specifically need to replicate your
CloudTrail log files over greater geographic distances, you can use [Cross-Region Replication](../../../s3/latest/userguide/replication.md) for your trail Amazon S3
buckets, which enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in
different AWS Regions.

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global\
Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure).

In addition to the AWS global infrastructure, CloudTrail offers several features to help support your data resiliency and backup needs.

**Trails and event data stores that log events in all AWS Regions**

When you create a multi-Region trail, CloudTrail creates trails with identical
configurations in all enabled AWS Regions in your account.

When you create a multi-Region event data store, CloudTrail collects events that occur in all AWS Regions in your account.

**Versioning, lifecycle configuration, and object lock protection for**
**CloudTrail log data**

Because CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 buckets to store log files, you can also use the features provided
by Amazon S3 to help support your data resiliency and backup needs. For more information, see
[Resilience in\
Amazon S3](../../../s3/latest/userguide/disaster-recovery-resiliency.md).
