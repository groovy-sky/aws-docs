## Prerequisites

Before you can use the examples in this topic, you must:

- Create a trail with the console or CLI.

- Create a log group, which you can do as part of creating a trail. For more information about creating a trail,
see [Creating a trail with the CloudTrail console](cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.md).

- Specify or create an IAM role that grants CloudTrail the permissions to create a
CloudWatch Logs log stream in the log group that you specify and to deliver CloudTrail events to
that log stream. The default `CloudTrail_CloudWatchLogs_Role` does
this for you.

For more information, see [Sending events to CloudWatch Logs](send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.md). Examples in this
section are performed in the Amazon CloudWatch Logs console. For more information about how to create
metric filters and alarms, see [Creating metrics from log events using filters](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/monitoringlogdata.md) and [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/alarmthatsendsemail.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

## Create a metric filter and create an alarm

To create an alarm, you must first create a metric filter, and then configure an alarm
based on the filter. The procedures are shown for all examples. For more information
about syntax for metric filters and patterns for CloudTrail log events, see the JSON-related
sections of [Filter and pattern\
syntax](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/filterandpatternsyntax.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

## Example security group configuration changes

Follow this procedure to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is triggered when configuration
changes occur on security groups.

### Create a metric filter

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, under **Logs**, choose **Log groups**.

03. In the list of log groups, choose the log group that you created for your trail.

04. From the **Metric filters** or **Actions** menu, choose **Create metric**
    **filter**.

05. On the **Define pattern** page, in **Create filter**
    **pattern**, enter the following for **Filter**
    **pattern**.

    ```nohighlight

    { ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) || ($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress) || ($.eventName = CreateSecurityGroup) || ($.eventName = DeleteSecurityGroup) }
    ```

06. In **Test pattern**, leave defaults. Choose
     **Next**.

07. On the **Assign metric** page, for **Filter name**,
     enter `SecurityGroupEvents`.

08. In **Metric details**, turn on **Create new**, and then
     enter `CloudTrailMetrics` for **Metric**
    **namespace**.

09. For **Metric name**, type
     `SecurityGroupEventCount`.

10. For **Metric value**, type `1`.

11. Leave **Default value** blank.

12. Choose **Next**.

13. On the **Review and create** page, review your choices.
     Choose **Create metric filter** to create the filter, or
     choose **Edit** to go back and change values.

### Create an alarm

After you create the metric filter, the CloudWatch Logs log group details page for your CloudTrail trail
log group opens. Follow this procedure to create an alarm.

1. On the **Metric filters** tab, find the metric filter you created in
    [Create a metric filter](#cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail-security-group-metric-filter). Fill the check box for the metric filter. In the **Metric**
**filters** bar, choose **Create alarm**.

2. For **Specify metric and**
**conditions**, enter the following.
1. For **Graph**, the line is set at
       `1` based on other settings you make when
       you create your alarm.

2. For **Metric name**, keep the current metric
       name, `SecurityGroupEventCount`.

3. For **Statistic**, keep the default,
       `Sum`.

4. For **Period**, keep the default, `5
      									minutes`.

5. In **Conditions**, for **Threshold**
      **type**, choose **Static**.

6. For **Whenever `metric_name`**
      **is**, choose **Greater/Equal**.

7. For the threshold value, enter
       `1`.

8. In **Additional configuration**, leave defaults.
       Choose **Next**.
3. On the **Configure actions** page, choose **Notification**, and then choose **In**
**alarm**, which indicates that the action is taken when the
    threshold of 1 change event in 5 minutes is crossed, and
    **SecurityGroupEventCount** is in an alarm
    state.
1. For **Send a notification to the following SNS topic**, choose
       **Create new topic**.

2. Enter `SecurityGroupChanges_CloudWatch_Alarms_Topic`
       as the name for the new Amazon SNS topic.

3. In **Email endpoints that will receive the**
      **notification**, enter the email addresses of users whom you
       want to receive notifications if this alarm is raised. Separate
       email addresses with commas.

      Each email recipient will receive an email asking them to
       confirm that they want to be subscribed to the Amazon SNS topic.

4. Choose **Create topic**.
4. For this example, skip the other action types. Choose
    **Next**.

5. On the **Add name and description** page, enter a
    friendly name for the alarm, and a description. For this example, enter
    `Security group configuration changes` for the
    name, and `Raises alarms if security group configuration changes
   							occur` for the description. Choose
    **Next**.

6. On the **Preview and create** page, review your choices.
    Choose **Edit** to make changes, or choose **Create**
**alarm** to create the alarm.

After you create the alarm, CloudWatch opens the **Alarms**
    page. The alarm's **Actions** column shows
    **Pending confirmation** until all email recipients on
    the SNS topic have confirmed that they want to subscribe to SNS
    notifications.

## Configuring notifications for CloudWatch Logs alarms

You can configure CloudWatch Logs to send a notification whenever an alarm is triggered for CloudTrail.
Doing so enables you to respond quickly to critical operational events captured in CloudTrail
events and detected by CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send email. For more information,
see [Setting up Amazon SNS notifications](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/notify-users-alarm-changes.md#US_SetupSNS) in the _CloudWatch User Guide_.
