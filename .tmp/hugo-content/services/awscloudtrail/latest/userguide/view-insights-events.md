# Viewing Insights events for trails

This section describes how you can lookup the last 90 days of Insights events for a trail with CloudTrail Insights enabled. For information about how to view CloudTrail Insights for an event data store,
see [Viewing the Insights dashboard for an event data store](insights-events-view-lake.md#insights-events-view-lake-dashboard).

You can view, filter, and download the last 90 days of Insights events for a trail from the
**Insights** page on the console.

You can fetch the last 90 days of Insights events programmatically:

- For Trails logging management events by running the AWS CLI
[lookup-events](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudtrail/lookup-events.md) command, or the [LookupEvents](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-lookupevents.md) API operation.

- For Trails logging data events by running the AWS CLI
[list-insights-data](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudtrail/list-insights-data.md) command, or the [ListInsightsData](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-listinsightsdata.md) API operation.

For descriptions of Insights events record fields for trails, see [CloudTrail record contents for Insights events for trails](cloudtrail-insights-fields-trails.md).

###### Note

The **Insights** page and AWS CLI `lookup-events` or `list-insights-data` command only list Insights events if you've enabled Insights on a trail that is logging management or data events. For information
about enabling Insights on a trail, see [Enabling CloudTrail Insights on an existing trail with the console](insights-events-enable.md#insights-events-enable-trail) and
[Logging Insights events for a trail using the AWS CLI](insights-events-cli-enable.md#insights-events-CLI-enable-trails).

To log Insights events on the API call rate, the trail must log `write` management or data events.
To log Insights events on the API error rate, the trail must log `read` or `write` management or data events.
