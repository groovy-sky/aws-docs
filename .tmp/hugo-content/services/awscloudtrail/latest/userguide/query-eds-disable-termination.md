# Manage event data store lifecycles

###### Note

AWS CloudTrail Lake will no longer be open to new customers starting May 31, 2026.
If you would like to use CloudTrail Lake, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[CloudTrail Lake availability change](cloudtrail-lake-service-availability-change.md).

The following are the lifecycle stages of an event data store:

- `CREATED` – A short-term state indicating that the event
data store has been created.

- `ENABLED` – The event data store is active and ingesting
events. You can run queries and copy trail events to the event data
store.

- `STARTING_INGESTION` – A short-term state indicating
that the event data store will start ingesting live events.

- `STOPPING_INGESTION` – A short-term state indicating
that the event data store will stop ingesting live events.

- `STOPPED_INGESTION` – The event data store is not
ingesting live events. You can still run queries on any events already in
the event data store and copy trail events to the event data store.

- `PENDING_DELETION` – The event data store was in an
`ENABLED` or `STOPPED_INGESTION` state and has
been deleted but is within the 7-day wait period before permanent deletion.
You cannot run queries on the event data store, and no operations can be
performed on the event data store except restoration.

You can only delete an event data store if both federation and termination
protection are disabled. _Termination protection_
prevents an event data store from getting accidentally deleted. By default,
termination protection is enabled on an event data store. [Federation](query-federation.md) lets you query your event data
store data in Athena and is disabled by default.

After you delete an event data store, it remains in the
`PENDING_DELETION` state for 7 days before it is permanently deleted.
You can restore an event data store during the 7-day wait period. While in the
`PENDING_DELETION` state, an event data store is not available for
queries, and no other operations can be performed on the event data store except
restore operations. An event data store that is pending deletion does not ingest
events and does not incur costs. However, event data stores that are pending
deletion count toward the quota of event data stores that can exist in one
AWS Region.

**Actions available on event data stores**

To [delete](query-event-data-store-delete.md) or [restore](query-eds-restore.md) an event data store, [copy trail\
events](cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake-eds.md), start or stop ingesting events, or turn on or turn off an event data store's
termination protection, use commands on the **Actions** menu of the
event data store's details page.

The option to **Copy trail events** is only available on event
data stores that contain CloudTrail events. The options to
**Start ingestion** and **Stop ingestion** are
only available on event data stores containing either CloudTrail events (management and
data events), or AWS Config configuration items.
