# Viewing Insights events for trails with the console

This section describes how to view, look up, and download the last 90 days of Insights
events for a trail from the **Insights** page on the CloudTrail console. For information about how to view CloudTrail Insights for an event data store,
see [Viewing the Insights dashboard for an event data store](insights-events-view-lake.md#insights-events-view-lake-dashboard).

After Insights events are logged for a trail, the events are shown on the
**Insights** page for 90 days. You cannot manually delete events from
the **Insights** page. Since Insights events enabled for a trail are stored
in the Amazon S3 bucket configured for that trail, removing the Insights events from the bucket will delete those events.

You can monitor your trail logs and be notified when specific Insights events occur by enabling CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Monitoring CloudTrail Log Files with Amazon CloudWatch Logs](monitor-cloudtrail-log-files-with-cloudwatch-logs.md).

###### Note

- CloudTrail Insights events must be enabled on your trail to see Insights events in the console. Allow up to
36 hours for CloudTrail to deliver the first Insights events, provided that unusual activity is detected during that time.

- For Management events Insights: To log Insights events on the API call rate, the trail must log `write` management events.
To log Insights events on the API error rate, the trail must log `read` or `write` management events.

- For Data events Insights: To log Insights events on the API call rate or API error rate, the trail must log `read` or `write` data events.

###### To view Insights events

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Insights** to see all Insights events logged in your
    account in the last 90 days. You can also view the five most recent Insights events
    from the **Dashboards** page.

3. On the **Insights** page, you can select either the management events Insights or data events Insights tab

4. You can filter Insights events by event source, event name, or event ID. For more information about
    filtering Insights events, see [Filtering Insights events](#filtering-insights-events).

5. You can further limit the list to a **Relative range** or **Absolute range**.

## Filtering Insights events

By default, events on the **Insights** page are shown in reverse
chronological order by event start time.

You can filter the list by choosing from one of the following three attributes:

**Event name**

The name of the event, typically the AWS API on which unusual levels of
activity were recorded.

**Event source**

The AWS service to which the request was made, such as
`iam.amazonaws.com` or `s3.amazonaws.com`. If you choose to filter by event source, you can
scroll through a list of event sources.

**Event ID**

The ID of the Insights event. Event IDs are not shown in the
**Insights** page table, but they are an attribute on
which you can filter Insights events. The event IDs of management or data events that are
analyzed to generate Insights events are different from the event IDs of
Insights events.

![The CloudTrail Insights event list filter.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/images/insights_events_filter.png)

The following list describes the attributes of an event, which are not filterable:

**Insight type**

The type of CloudTrail Insights event, which is either **API call rate**
or **API error rate**. The **API call rate** insight type
analyzes write-only management or data API calls that are aggregated per minute against
a baseline API call volume. The **API error rate** insight type analyzes
management or data API calls that result in error codes. The error is shown if the API call is
unsuccessful.

**Event start time**

The start time of the Insights event, measured as the first minute in
which unusual activity was recorded. This attribute is shown in the
**Insights** table, but you cannot filter on event
start time in the console.

**Baseline average**

Baseline represents the normal pattern of API call rate or error rate activity,
calculated daily. The baseline average is the average of these daily baselines over
the seven days preceding the start of an Insights event. While this period is generally
seven days, CloudTrail rounds the calculation period to a whole number of days,
so the exact baseline duration may vary slightly.

**Insight average**

The average number of calls to an API, or the average number of a specific
error that was returned on calls to an API, that triggered the Insights
event. The CloudTrail Insights average for the start event is the rate of
occurrences that triggered the Insights event. Typically, this is the first
minute of unusual activity. The Insights average for the end event is the
rate of occurrences over the duration of the unusual activity, between the
start Insights event and the end Insights event.

**Rate change**

The difference between the value of **Baseline average**
and **Insight average**, measured as a percentage. For
example, if the baseline average of an `AccessDenied` error
occurring is 1.0, and the Insight average is 3.0, the rate change is 300%. A
rate change for an Insight average that exceeds a baseline average shows an
up-arrow next to the value. If the Insights event was logged because the
activity is below the baseline average, **Rate change**
shows a down-arrow next to the percentage.

If there are no events logged for the attribute or time that you choose, the results
list is empty. You can apply only one attribute filter in addition to the time range. If
you choose a different attribute filter, your specified time range is preserved.

The following steps describe how to filter by attribute.

###### To filter by attribute

1. To filter the results by an attribute, choose a lookup attribute from the
    dropdown menu, and then type or choose a value in the **Enter a lookup**
**value** box.

2. To remove an attribute filter, choose the **X** on the right
    of the attribute filter box.

The following steps describe how to filter by a start and end date and time.

###### To filter by a start and end date and time

1. From **Filter by date and time**, choose one of the following:

- **Absolute range** \- Lets you choose a specific time. Go on
to the next step.

- **Relative range** \- Selected by default.
Lets you choose a time period relative to the start time of an Insights
event. Go on to step 3.

2. To set an **Absolute range**, do the following.
1. Choose the day that you want the time range to start. Enter a start
       time on the selected day. To enter a date manually, type the date in the
       format `yyyy/mm/dd`. The start and end times use a 24-hour
       clock, and values must be in the format `hh:mm:ss`. For
       example, to indicate a 6:30 p.m. start time, enter
       `18:30:00`.

2. Choose an end date for the range on the calendar, or specify an end
       date and time below the calendar. Choose
       **Apply**.
3. To set a **Relative range**, do the following.
1. Choose a preset time period relative to the start time of Insights events. Preset time ranges include
       30 minutes, 1 hour, 12 hours, or 1 day. To specify a custom time range, choose
       **Custom**.

2. When you have set the relative time that you want, choose
       **Apply**.
4. To remove a time range filter, choose the calendar icon on the right of the
    **Filter by date and time** box, and then choose
    **Clear and dismiss**.

## Viewing Insights events details

1. Choose an Insights event in the results list to show its details. The details
    page for an Insights event shows a graph of the unusual activity
    timeline.

![A CloudTrail Insights detail page showing unusual API activity.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/images/insights_event_view.png)

2. Hover over the highlighted bands to show the start time and duration of each
    Insights event in the graph.

![Insights event statistics shown after hovering over an Insights event.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/images/insights_event_statistics.png)

The following information is shown in the **Additional**
**information** area of the graph:

- **Insight type**. This can be API call rate or API
error rate.

- **Trigger**. This is a link to the
**Cloudtrail events** tab, which lists the
management or data events that were analyzed to determine that unusual activity
occurred.

- **API calls per minute** or **Errors per minute**

- **Baseline average** \- The
typical rate of occurrences per minute on the API on which the
Insights event was logged, as measured within approximately the
preceding seven days, in a specific Region in your
account.

- **Insights average** \- The rate
of occurrences per minute on this API that triggered the
Insights event. The CloudTrail Insights average for the start event is the
rate of calls or errors per minute on the API that triggered the
Insights event. Typically, this is the first minute of unusual
activity. The Insights average for the end event is the rate of
API calls or errors per minute over the duration of the unusual
activity, between the start Insights event and the end Insights
event.

- **Event source**. The AWS service endpoint on which
the unusual number of API calls or errors were logged. In the preceding
image, the source is `ec2.amazonaws.com`, which is the
service endpoint for Amazon EC2.

- **Start event ID** \- The ID of
the Insights event that was logged at the start of unusual
activity.

- **End event ID** \- The ID of the
Insights event that was logged at the end of unusual
activity.

- **Shared event ID** \- In Insights events,
the **Shared event ID** is a GUID that is
generated by CloudTrail Insights to uniquely identify a start and end pair of
Insights events. **Shared event ID** is common
between the start and the end Insights event, and helps to
create a correlation between both events to uniquely identify
unusual activity.

3. Choose the **Attributions** tab to view information about the
    user identities, user agents, and on API call rate Insights events, error codes
    correlated with unusual and baseline activity. A maximum of five user
    identities, five user agents, and five error codes are shown in tables on the
    **Attributions** tab, sorted by an average of the count of
    activity, in descending order from highest to lowest.

4. On the **CloudTrail events** tab, view related events that CloudTrail
    analyzed to determine that unusual activity occurred. By default, a filter is
    already applied for the Insights event name, which is also the name of the
    related API. The **CloudTrail events** tab shows CloudTrail management or data
    events related to the subject API that occurred between the start time (minus
    one minute) and end time (plus one minute) of the Insights event.

As you select other Insights events in the graph, the events shown in the
    **CloudTrail events** table change. These events help you perform
    deeper analysis to determine the probable cause of an Insights event and reasons
    for unusual API activity.

To show all CloudTrail events that were logged during the Insights event duration,
    and not only those for the related API, turn off the filter.

5. Choose the **Insights event record** tab to view the Insights
    start and end events in JSON format.

6. Choosing the linked **Event source** returns you to the
    **Insights** page, filtered by that event source.

## Zoom, pan, and download graph

You can zoom, pan, and reset the axes of the graph on the Insights event details page
by using a toolbar in the upper right corner.

![Download as PNG, zoom, pan, zoom in, zoom out, and reset axes command toolbar.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/images/insights_details_custom_widgets.png)

From left to right, the command buttons on the graph toolbar do the following:

- **Download plot as a PNG** \- Download the graph image shown
on the details page, and save it in PNG format.

- **Zoom** \- Drag to select an area on the graph that you want
to enlarge and see in greater detail.

- **Pan** \- Shift the graph to see adjacent dates or
times.

- **Reset axes** \- Change graph axes back to the original,
clearing zoom and pan settings.

## Change graph time span settings

You can change the time span—the selected duration of the events shown on the
_x_ axis—that is shown in the graph by choosing a setting
in the graph's upper right corner.

## Downloading Insights events

You can download recorded Insights event history as a file in CSV or JSON format. Use
filters and time ranges to reduce the size of the file you download.

###### Note

CloudTrail event history files are data files that contain information (such as resource
names) that can be configured by individual users. Some data can potentially be
interpreted as commands in programs used to read and analyze this data (CSV
injection). For example, when CloudTrail events are exported to CSV and imported to a
spreadsheet program, that program might warn you about security concerns. As a
security best practice, disable links or macros from downloaded event history
files.

1. Specify the filter and time range for events you want to download. For
    example, you can specify the event name, `StartInstances`, and
    specify a time range for the last 12 hours of activity.

2. Choose **Download events**, and then choose
    **Download as CSV** or **Download as JSON**. You
    are prompted to choose a location to save the file.

###### Note

Your download might take some time to finish. For faster results, before
you start the download process, use a more specific filter or a shorter time
range to narrow the results.

3. After your download is complete, open the file to view the events that you
    specified.

4. To cancel your download, choose **Cancel**. If you
    cancel a download before it is finished, a CSV or JSON file on your local
    computer might contain only part of your events.
