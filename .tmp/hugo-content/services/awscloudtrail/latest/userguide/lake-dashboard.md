# CloudTrail Lake dashboards

###### Note

AWS CloudTrail Lake will no longer be open to new customers starting May 31, 2026.
If you would like to use CloudTrail Lake, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[CloudTrail Lake availability change](cloudtrail-lake-service-availability-change.md).

You can use CloudTrail Lake dashboards to see event trends for the event data stores in your account. CloudTrail Lake
offers the following types of dashboards:

- **Managed dashboards** – You can view a
managed dashboard to see event trends for an event data store that collects
management events, data events, or Insights events. These dashboards are
automatically available to you and are managed by CloudTrail Lake.
CloudTrail offers 14 managed dashboards to choose from. You can manually refresh managed dashboards. You cannot modify, add, or remove the widgets for these dashboards,
however, you can save a managed dashboard as a custom dashboard
if you want to modify the widgets or set a refresh schedule.

- **Custom dashboards** – Custom dashboards allow you to query
events in any event data store type. You can add up to 10 widgets to a custom dashboard. You can manually refresh a custom dashboard, or you can set a refresh schedule.

- **Highlights dashboards** – Enable the Highlights dashboard to view an at-a-glance overview of the
AWS activity collected by the event data stores in your account. The Highlights dashboard is managed by CloudTrail
and includes widgets that are relevant to your account. The widgets shown on the Highlights
dashboard are unique to each account. These widgets could surface detected abnormal activity or anomalies.
For example, your Highlights dashboard could include the **Total cross-account access widget**,
which shows if there is an increase in abnormal cross-account activity. CloudTrail updates the Highlights dashboard every 6 hours.
The dashboard shows the last 24 hours of data from the last update.

Each dashboard consists of one or more widgets and each widget provides a graphical
representation of the results of a SQL query. To view the query for a widget, choose
**View and edit query** to open up the query editor.

When a dashboard is refreshed, CloudTrail Lake runs queries to populate the dashboard's widgets.
Because running queries incurs costs, CloudTrail asks you to acknowledge the costs associated with
running queries. For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see [CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to CloudTrail Lake dashboards:

- To view and use Lake dashboards, you must create at least one CloudTrail Lake event
data store. You can create event data stores using the console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
For information about creating an event data store using the console, see [Create an event data store for CloudTrail events with the console](query-event-data-store-cloudtrail.md). For information about
creating an event data store using the AWS CLI, see [Create an event data store with the AWS CLI](lake-cli-create-eds.md).

- You must have adequate permissions to view, create, update, and refresh
dashboards. For more information, see [Required permissions](#lake-dashboard-permissions).

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to CloudTrail Lake dashboards:

- You can only enable the Highlights dashboard for event data stores that exist in your account.

- You can only view managed dashboards for event data stores that exist in your account.

- For custom dashboards, you can only add sample widgets or create new widgets that query event data stores that exist in your account.

- Delegated administrators for a AWS Organizations organization cannot view or manage dashboards that are owned by the management account.

## Region support

The CloudTrail Lake dashboards are supported in all AWS Regions where CloudTrail Lake is
supported.

The **Activity summary** widget on the
**Highlights** dashboard is supported in the following
Regions:

- Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region (ap-northeast-1)

- US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)

- US West (Oregon) Region (us-west-1)

All other widgets are supported in all AWS Regions where CloudTrail Lake is
supported.

For information about CloudTrail Lake supported Regions, see [CloudTrail Lake supported Regions](cloudtrail-lake-supported-regions.md).

## Required permissions

This section describes the required permissions for CloudTrail Lake dashboards and discusses
two types of IAM policies:

- Identity-based policies which allow you to perform actions to create, manage,
and delete dashboards.

- Resource-based policies that allow CloudTrail to run queries on your event data
store when the dashboard is refreshed and perform scheduled refreshes of custom
dashboards and the Highlights dashboard on your behalf. When you create
dashboards using the CloudTrail console, you are given the option to attach
resource-based policies. You can also run the AWS CLI [put-resource-policy](lake-dashboard-cli-manage.md#lake-dashboard-cli-add-rbp)
command to add a resource-based policy to your event data stores or dashboards.

### Identity-based policy requirements

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach
to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These policies
control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what
conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based policy, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-create.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

To view and manage CloudTrail Lake dashboards, you need one of the following
policies:

- The [`CloudTrailFullAccess`](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awscloudtrail-fullaccess.md) managed policy.

- The [`AdministratorAccess`](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/administratoraccess.md) managed policy.

- A custom policy that includes one or more of the specific permissions
described in the sections which follow.

#### Required permissions for creating dashboards

The following sample policy provides the required minimum permissions for
creating dashboards. Replace `partition`,
`region`, `account-id`,
and `eds-id` with the values for your
configuration.

- `StartQuery` permission is required only if the request
contains widgets. Provide `StartQuery` permissions for all
event data stores included in a widget query.

- `StartDashboardRefresh` permission is required only if the
dashboard has a refresh schedule.

- For the Highlights dashboard, the caller must have
`StartQuery` permission on all the event data stores in
the account.

            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

#### Required permissions for refreshing dashboards

The following sample policy provides the required minimum permissions for
refreshing dashboards. Replace `partition`,
`region`, `account-id`,
`dashboard-name`, and
`eds-id` with the values for your
configuration.

- For custom dashboards and the Highlights dashboards, the caller must
have `cloudtrail:StartDashboardRefresh permissions`.

- For managed dashboards, the caller must have
`cloudtrail:StartDashboardRefresh` permission and
`cloudtrail:StartQuery` permissions for the event data
store involved in the refresh.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudtrail:StartDashboardRefresh",
                "cloudtrail:StartQuery"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:111111111111:dashboard/dashboard-name",
                "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-1:111111111111:eventdatastore/eds-id"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

### Resource-based policies for dashboards and event data stores

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource.
Examples of resource-based policies are IAM role trust policies and Amazon S3 bucket
policies. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what
actions a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what
conditions. You must specify a principal in a resource-based policy.

To run queries on a dashboard during a manual or scheduled refresh, you must
attach a resource-based policy to every event data store that is associated with a
widget on the dashboard. This allows CloudTrail Lake to run the queries on your behalf.
When you create a custom dashboard, or enable the **Highlights**
dashboard using the CloudTrail console, CloudTrail gives you the option to choose which event
data stores you want to apply permissions to. For more information about the
resource-based policy, see [Example: Allow CloudTrail to run queries to refresh a dashboard](security-iam-resource-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples-eds-dashboard).

To set a refresh schedule for a dashboard, you must attach a resource-based policy
to the dashboard to allow CloudTrail Lake to refresh the dashboard on your behalf. When
you set a refresh schedule for a custom dashboard, or enable the
**Highlights** dashboard using the CloudTrail console, CloudTrail gives you
the option to attach a resource-based policy to your dashboard. For an example
policy, see [Resource-based policy example for a dashboard](security-iam-resource-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples-dashboards).

You can attach a resource-based policy using the CloudTrail console, the [AWS CLI](lake-dashboard-cli-manage.md#lake-dashboard-cli-add-rbp), or the
[PutResourcePolicy](../../../../reference/awscloudtrail/latest/apireference/api-putresourcepolicy.md) API operation.

### KMS key permissions to decrypt data in an event data store

If an event data store being queried is encrypted with a KMS key, ensure the
KMS key policy allows CloudTrail to decrypt the data in the event data store. The
following example policy statement allows the CloudTrail service principal to decrypt the
event data store.

```JSON

{
      "Sid": "AllowCloudTrailDecryptAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
          "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
        },
      "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
      "Resource": "*"
}
```
