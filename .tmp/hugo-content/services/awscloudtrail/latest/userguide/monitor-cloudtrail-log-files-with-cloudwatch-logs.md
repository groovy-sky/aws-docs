# Monitoring CloudTrail Log Files with Amazon CloudWatch Logs

You can use [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/whatiscloudwatchlogs.md) to monitor,
store, and access your log files from CloudTrail.

CloudWatch Logs enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications,
and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service. You can then easily view
them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields,
or archive them securely for future analysis. CloudWatch Logs enables you to see all of your logs,
regardless of their source, as a single and consistent flow of events ordered by time.

Complete the following steps to configure CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs to monitor your trail logs and
be notified when specific activity occurs.

1. Configure your trail to send log events to CloudWatch Logs.

2. Define CloudWatch Logs metric filters to evaluate log events for matches in terms, phrases,
    or values. For example, you can monitor for `ConsoleLogin` events.

3. Assign CloudWatch metrics to the metric filters.

4. Create CloudWatch alarms that are triggered according to thresholds and time periods
    that you specify. You can configure alarms to send notifications when alarms are
    triggered, so that you can take action.

5. You can also configure CloudWatch to automatically perform an action in response to an
    alarm.
