# Validating CloudTrail log file integrity with the AWS CLI

To validate logs with the AWS Command Line Interface, use the CloudTrail `validate-logs` command. The
command uses the digest files delivered to your Amazon S3 bucket to perform the validation. For
information about digest files, see [CloudTrail digest file structure](cloudtrail-log-file-validation-digest-file-structure.md).

The AWS CLI allows you to detect the following types of changes:

- Modification or deletion of CloudTrail log files

- Modification or deletion of CloudTrail digest files

- Modification or deletion of both of the above

###### Note

The AWS CLI validates only log files that are referenced by digest files. For more
information, see [Checking whether a particular file was delivered by CloudTrail](#cloudtrail-log-file-validation-cli-validate-logs-check-file).

## Prerequisites

To validate log file integrity with the AWS CLI, the following conditions must be
met:

- You must have online connectivity to AWS.

- You must have read access to the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the digest and log
files.

- The digest and log files must not have been moved from the original Amazon S3
location where CloudTrail delivered them.

- The role executing the command must have permissions to call `ListObjects`,
`GetObject`, and `GetBucketLocation` for each S3 bucket referenced by the trail.

###### Note

Log files that have been downloaded to local disk cannot be validated with the
AWS CLI. For guidance on creating your own tools for validation, see [Custom implementations of CloudTrail log file integrity validation](cloudtrail-log-file-custom-validation.md).

## validate-logs

### Syntax

The following is the syntax for `validate-logs`. Optional parameters
are shown in brackets.

`aws cloudtrail validate-logs  --trail-arn <trailARN> --start-time <start-time> [--end-time <end-time>] [--s3-bucket <amzn-s3-demo-bucket>] [--s3-prefix <prefix>] [--account-id <account-id>] [--verbose]`

###### Note

The `validate-logs` command is Region specific. You must specify the `--region` global option to validate logs for a specific AWS Region.

### Options

The following are the command-line options for `validate-logs`. The
`--trail-arn` and `--start-time` options are required. The `--account-id` option is additionally required for organizational trails.

`--start-time`

Specifies that log files delivered on or after the specified UTC
timestamp value will be validated. Example:
`2015-01-08T05:21:42Z`.

`--end-time`

Optionally specifies that log files delivered on or before the
specified UTC timestamp value will be validated. The default value is
the current UTC time ( `Date.now()`). Example:
`2015-01-08T12:31:41Z`.

###### Note

For the time range specified, the `validate-logs`
command checks only the log files that are referenced in their
corresponding digest files. No other log files in the Amazon S3 bucket
are checked. For more information, see [Checking whether a particular file was delivered by CloudTrail](#cloudtrail-log-file-validation-cli-validate-logs-check-file).

`--s3-bucket`

Optionally specifies the Amazon S3 bucket where the digest files are
stored. If a bucket name is not specified, the AWS CLI will retrieve it by
calling `DescribeTrails()`.

`--s3-prefix`

Optionally specifies the Amazon S3 prefix where the digest files are
stored. If not specified, the AWS CLI will retrieve it by calling
`DescribeTrails()`.

###### Note

You should use this option only if your current prefix is
different from the prefix that was in use during the time range that
you specify.

`--account-id`

Optionally specifies the account for validating
logs. This parameter is required for organization trails for validating
logs for the specific account inside an organization.

`--trail-arn`

Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the trail to be validated.
The format of a trail ARN follows.

```nohighlight

arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:111111111111:trail/MyTrailName
```

###### Note

To obtain the trail ARN for a trail, you can use the
`describe-trails` command before running
`validate-logs`.

You may want to specify the bucket name and prefix in addition to
the trail ARN if log files have been delivered to more than one
bucket in the time range that you specified, and you want to
restrict the validation to the log files in only one of the buckets.

`--verbose`

Optionally outputs validation information for every log or digest file
in the specified time range. The output indicates whether the file
remains unchanged or has been modified or deleted. In non-verbose mode
(the default), information is returned only for those cases in which
there was a validation failure.

### Example

The following example validates log files from the specified start time to the
present, using the Amazon S3 bucket configured for the current trail and specifying
verbose output.

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail validate-logs --start-time 2015-08-27T00:00:00Z --end-time 2015-08-28T00:00:00Z --trail-arn arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:111111111111:trail/my-trail-name --verbose
```

### How `validate-logs` works

The `validate-logs` command starts by validating the most recent
digest file in the specified time range. First, it verifies that the digest file has
been downloaded from the location to which it claims to belong. In other words, if
the CLI downloads digest file `df1` from the S3 location `p1`,
validate-logs will verify that
`p1 == df1.digestS3Bucket + '/' + df1.digestS3Object`.

If the signature of the digest file is valid, it checks the hash value of each of
the logs referenced in the digest file. The command then goes back in time,
validating the previous digest files and their referenced log files in succession.
It continues until the specified value for `start-time` is reached, or
until the digest chain ends. If a digest file is missing or not valid, the time
range that cannot be validated is indicated in the output. The
`validate-logs` command first operates on the standard digest chain.
After completing standard digest validation, it validates backfill digest files,
if present. Backfill digests form a separate validation chain and are processed
independently from standard digests.

## Validation results

Validation results begin with a summary header in the following format:

```nohighlight

Validating log files for trail trail_ARN  between time_stamp and time_stamp
```

Each line of the main output contains the validation results for a single digest or
log file in the following
format. Lines prefixed with `(backfill)` indicate backfill digest files,
which form a separate validation chain from the standard digest files.

```nohighlight

<optional (backfill)> <Digest file | Log file> <S3 path> <Validation Message>
```

The following table describes the possible validation messages for log and digest files.

File TypeValidation MessageDescription`Digest file``valid`The digest file signature is valid. The log files it references
can be checked. This message is included only in verbose
mode.`Digest file``INVALID: has been moved from its original location`The S3 bucket or S3 object from which the digest file was
retrieved do not match the S3 bucket or S3 object locations that are
recorded in the digest file itself.`Digest file``INVALID: invalid format`The format of the digest file is invalid. The log files
corresponding to the time range that the digest file represents
cannot be validated.`Digest file``INVALID: not found`The digest file was not found. The log files corresponding to the
time range that the digest file represents cannot be
validated.`Digest file``INVALID: public key not found for fingerprint ` `fingerprint`The public key corresponding to the fingerprint recorded in the
digest file was not found. The digest file cannot be
validated.`Digest file``INVALID: signature verification failed`The digest file signature is not valid. Because the digest file
is not valid, the log files it references cannot be validated, and
no assertions can be made about the API activity in them.`Digest file``INVALID: Unable to load PKCS #1 key with fingerprint` `fingerprint`Because the DER encoded public key in PKCS #1 format having the
specified fingerprint could not be loaded, the digest file cannot be
validated.`Log file``valid`The log file has been validated and has not been modified since
the time of delivery. This message is included only in verbose
mode.`Log file``INVALID: hash value doesn't match`The hash for the log file does not match. The log file has been
modified after delivery by CloudTrail.`Log file``INVALID: invalid format`The format of the log file is invalid. The log file cannot be
validated.`Log file``INVALID: not found`The log file was not found and cannot be validated.

The output includes summary information about the results returned.

## Checking whether a particular file was delivered by CloudTrail

To check if a particular file in your bucket was delivered by CloudTrail, run
`validate-logs` in verbose mode for the time period that includes the file.
If the file appears in the output of `validate-logs`, then the file was
delivered by CloudTrail.
