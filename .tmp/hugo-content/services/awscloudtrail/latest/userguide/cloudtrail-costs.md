# Viewing your CloudTrail cost and usage with AWS Cost Explorer

This section describes how you can view your CloudTrail costs and usage using [AWS Cost Explorer](../../../cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-what-is.md). Cost Explorer gives you the ability to visualize,
understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

For details about CloudTrail pricing, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

###### To view CloudTrail cost and usage with Cost Explorer

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Cost Explorer console
    at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home#/custom](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home).

2. Under **Time**, choose the date range you want to analyze.

3. Under **Group by**, for **Dimension**, choose **Usage type**.

4. Under **Filters**, for **Service**, choose **CloudTrail**.

The following image shows an example of a cost report filtered for CloudTrail and grouped by **Usage type**.

![The Cost Explorer report grouped by Usage type and filtered for the CloudTrail service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/images/cost-explorer-cloudtrail-usage.png)

Review the **Usage type** to see which CloudTrail features generated the most cost. Each
**Usage type** begins with the code for the AWS Region where the
charge was incurred.

The following table describes the CloudTrail usage types for each CloudTrail feature.
