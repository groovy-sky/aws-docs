# Sharing CloudTrail log files between AWS accounts

This section explains how to share CloudTrail log files between multiple AWS accounts. The
approach you use to share logs between AWS accounts depends on the configuration of your
S3 bucket. These are the options for sharing log files:

- **[Bucket owner enforced](../../../s3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-existing-bucket.md)** – [S3 Object Ownership](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md) is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to
control ownership of objects uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable access
control lists (ACLs). By default, Object Ownership is set to the **Bucket**
**owner enforced** setting and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are
disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to
data exclusively using access management policies. When the **Bucket**
**owner enforced** option is set, access is managed through the bucket policy,
eliminating the need for users to assume a role.

- **[Assume a role to share log files](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-assumerole)** – If you
haven't chosen the **Bucket owner enforced** setting, users will
need to assume a role to access the log files in your S3 bucket.

## Share log files between accounts by assuming a role

###### Note

This section applies only to Amazon S3 buckets that are not using
the **Bucket owner enforced** setting.

This section explains how to share CloudTrail log files between multiple AWS accounts by assuming a role and describes
the scenarios for sharing log files.

- **Scenario 1**: Grant read-only access to the
accounts that generated the log files that have been placed into your Amazon S3
bucket.

- **Scenario 2**: Grant access to all of the log
files in your Amazon S3 bucket to a third-party account that can analyze the log
files for you.

###### To grant read-only access to the log files in your Amazon S3 bucket

1. [Create an IAM role](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) for each account you want to share log files with.
    You must be an administrator to grant permission.

When you create the role, do the following:

- Choose the **Another AWS account** option.

- Enter the twelve-digit account ID of the account to
be granted access.

- Check the **Require MFA** box if you want the
user to provide multi-factor authentication before assuming the
role.

- Choose the
**AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy.

###### Note

By default, the **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy grants
retrieval and list rights to all Amazon S3 buckets within your account.

For details about permissions management for IAM roles, see [IAM roles](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles.md) in the IAM User Guide.

2. [Create an access policy](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-your-accounts) that grants read-only access to the account you want to share the log files with.

3. Instruct each account to [assume a role](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-assume-role) to retrieve the log files.

###### To grant read-only access to the log files with a third-party account

1. [Create an IAM role](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) for the third-party account you want to share log files with.
    You must be an administrator to grant permission.

When you create the role, do the following:

- Choose the **Another AWS account** option.

- Enter the twelve-digit account ID of the account to
be granted access.

- Enter an external ID that provides additional control over who can assume the role.
For more information, see
[How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user-externalid.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- Choose the
**AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy.

###### Note

By default, the **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy grants
retrieval and list rights to all Amazon S3 buckets within your account.

2. [Create an access policy](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-third-party) that grants read-only access to the third-party account you want to share the log files with.

3. Instruct the third-party account to [assume a role](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-assume-role) to retrieve the log files.

The following sections provide more detail about these steps.

### Creating an access policy to grant access to accounts you own

As the Amazon S3 bucket owner, you have full control over the Amazon S3 bucket
to which CloudTrail writes log files for the other accounts. You want to share each business unit's log files back to
business unit that created them. But, you don't want a unit to be able to read any other unit's log files.

For example, to share account B's log files with account B but not with account C, you
must create a new IAM role in your account that specifies that account B is a trusted account.
This role trust policy specifies that account B is trusted to assume the role created by your account,
and should look like the following example. The trust policy is automatically created if you
create the role by using the console. If you use the SDK to create the role, you must supply the
trust policy as a parameter to the `CreateRole` API. If you use the CLI to create the
role, you must specify the trust policy in the `create-role` CLI command.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

```

You must also create an access policy to specify that account B can read from only the location to
which B wrote its log files. The access policy will look something like the following. Note that the
**Resource** ARN includes the twelve-digit account ID for account B, and the prefix you
specified, if any, when you turned on CloudTrail for account B during the aggregation process. For more
information about specifying a prefix, see
[Create trails in additional accounts](turn-on-cloudtrail-in-additional-accounts.md).

###### Important

You must ensure that the prefix in the access policy is exactly the same as the prefix
that you specified when you turned on CloudTrail for account B. If it is not, then you must edit the
IAM role access policy in your account to incorporate the actual prefix for account B. If the
prefix in the role access policy is not exactly the same as the prefix you specified when you
turned on CloudTrail in account B, then account B will not be able to access its log files.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/account-B-id/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:Get*",
        "s3:List*"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
    }
  ]
}

```

Use the preceding process for any additional accounts.

After you create roles for each account and specify the appropriate trust and access
policies, and after an IAM user in each account has been granted access by the administrator
of that account, an IAM user in accounts B or C can programmatically assume the role.

For more information, see
[Assuming a role](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-assume-role).

### Creating an access policy to grant access to a third party

You must create a separate IAM role for a third-party account. When you create the role,
AWS automatically creates the trust relationship,
which specifies that third-party account will be trusted to assume the role. The access policy for the
role specifies what actions that account can take. For more information about creating roles,
see [Create an IAM role](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md).

For example, the trust relationship created by AWS specifies that the third-party account (account Z in this example) is
trusted to assume the role that you've created. The following is an example trust policy:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

```

If you specified an external ID when you created the role for the third-party account, your access
policy contains an added `Condition` element that tests the unique ID
assigned by that account. The test is performed when the role is assumed. The following example
access policy has a `Condition` element.

For more information, see [How to use an external ID when granting access \
to your AWS resources to a third party](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user-externalid.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:root"},
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"sts:ExternalId": "external-ID-issued-by-account-Z"}}
    }]
}

```

You must also create an access policy for your account to specify that the third-party account can
read all logs from the Amazon S3 bucket. The access policy should look something like the following
example. The wild card (\*) at the end of the `Resource` value indicates that the third-party account
can access any log file in the S3 bucket to which it has been granted access.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
        }
    ]
}

```

After you create a role for the third-party account and specify the appropriate trust relationship and
access policy, an IAM user in the third-party account must programmatically assume the role to be able
to read log files from the bucket. For more information, see [Assuming a role](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-assume-role).

### Assuming a role

You must designate a separate IAM user to assume each role you create in each account.
You must then ensure that each IAM user has appropriate permissions.

#### IAM users and roles

After you create the necessary roles and policies,
you must designate an IAM user in each of the account with which you want to share files. Each IAM user
programmatically assumes the appropriate role to access the log files. When a user assumes a role,
AWS returns temporary security credentials to
that user. They can then make requests to list, retrieve, copy, or delete log files
depending on the permissions granted by the access policy associated with the role.

For more information about working with IAM identities, see [IAM Identities (users, user groups, and roles)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id.md).

The primary difference in the access policy that you create
for each IAM role in each scenario.

- In scenario 1, the access policy limits each account to reading only its
own log files. For more information, see [Creating an access policy to grant access to accounts you own](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-your-accounts).

- In scenario 2, the access policy allows a third-party it to read all the
log files that are aggregated in the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see
[Creating an access policy to grant access to a third party](#cloudtrail-sharing-logs-third-party).

#### Creating permissions policies for IAM users

To perform the actions permitted by a role, the IAM user must have permission to
call the AWS STS [`AssumeRole`](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/api-assumerole.md) API. You must edit the policy for each user to grant them the appropriate
permissions. To do this, you set a **Resource** element in the policy
that you attach to the IAM user. The following example shows a policy for an
IAM user in another account that allows that user to assume a role named `Test`
created earlier by Account A.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Test"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### To edit a customer managed policy (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**.

3. In the list of policies, choose the policy name of the policy to edit. You can use the
    search box to filter the list of policies.

4. Choose the **Permissions** tab, and then choose
    **Edit**.

5. Do one of the following:

- Choose the **Visual** option to change your policy without
understanding JSON syntax. You can make changes to the service, actions, resources, or
optional conditions for each permission block in your policy. You can also import a
policy to add additional permissions to the bottom of your policy. When you are
finished making changes, choose **Next** to continue.

- Choose the **JSON** option to modify your policy by typing or
pasting text in the JSON text box. You can also import a policy to add additional
permissions to the bottom of your policy. Resolve any security warnings, errors, or general warnings generated during [policy validation](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-policy-validator.md), and then choose **Next**.

###### Note

You can switch between the **Visual** and
**JSON** editor options any time. However, if you make changes or
choose **Next** in the **Visual** editor, IAM
might restructure your policy to optimize it for the visual editor. For more
information, see [Policy restructuring](../../../iam/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-policies.md#troubleshoot_viseditor-restructure) in the _IAM User Guide_.

6. On the **Review and save** page, review **Permissions defined**
**in this policy** and then choose **Save changes** to save your
    work.

7. If the managed policy already has the maximum of five versions, choosing
    **Save changes** displays a dialog box. To save your new version, the
    oldest non-default version of the policy is removed and replaced with this new version.
    Optionally, you can set the new version as the default policy version.

Choose **Save changes** to save your new policy version.

#### Calling AssumeRole

A user can assume a role by creating an application that calls the
AWS STS [`AssumeRole`](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/api-assumerole.md)
API and passes the role session name, the Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the role to
assume, and an optional external ID. The role session name is defined by the account
that created the role to assume. The external ID, if any, is defined by the third-party account and
passed to owning account for inclusion during role creation. For more information, see [How to Use an External\
ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user-externalid.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_. You can retrieve the ARN from the Account A
by opening the IAM console.

###### To find the ARN Value in Account A with the IAM console

1. Choose **Roles**

2. Choose the role you want to examine.

3. Look for the **Role ARN** in the **Summary** section.

The AssumeRole API returns temporary credentials to use to access resources in owning
account. In this example, the resources you want to access are the Amazon S3 bucket and the
log files that the bucket contains. The temporary credentials have the permissions that
you defined in the role access policy.

The following Python example (using the
[AWS SDK for Python (Boto)](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools))
shows how to call `AssumeRole` and how to use the
temporary security credentials returned to list all Amazon S3 buckets controlled by Account
A.

```python

def list_buckets_from_assumed_role(user_key, assume_role_arn, session_name):
    """
    Assumes a role that grants permission to list the Amazon S3 buckets in the account.
    Uses the temporary credentials from the role to list the buckets that are owned
    by the assumed role's account.

    :param user_key: The access key of a user that has permission to assume the role.
    :param assume_role_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that
                            grants access to list the other account's buckets.
    :param session_name: The name of the STS session.
    """
    sts_client = boto3.client(
        "sts", aws_access_key_id=user_key.id, aws_secret_access_key=user_key.secret
    )
    try:
        response = sts_client.assume_role(
            RoleArn=assume_role_arn, RoleSessionName=session_name
        )
        temp_credentials = response["Credentials"]
        print(f"Assumed role {assume_role_arn} and got temporary credentials.")
    except ClientError as error:
        print(
            f"Couldn't assume role {assume_role_arn}. Here's why: "
            f"{error.response['Error']['Message']}"
        )
        raise

    # Create an S3 resource that can access the account with the temporary credentials.
    s3_resource = boto3.resource(
        "s3",
        aws_access_key_id=temp_credentials["AccessKeyId"],
        aws_secret_access_key=temp_credentials["SecretAccessKey"],
        aws_session_token=temp_credentials["SessionToken"],
    )
    print(f"Listing buckets for the assumed role's account:")
    try:
        for bucket in s3_resource.buckets.all():
            print(bucket.name)
    except ClientError as error:
        print(
            f"Couldn't list buckets for the account. Here's why: "
            f"{error.response['Error']['Message']}"
        )
        raise

```

### Stop sharing CloudTrail log files between AWS accounts

To stop sharing log files to another AWS account, delete the role that you created
for that account. For information about how to delete a role, see [Deleting roles or instance profiles](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-manage-delete.md).
