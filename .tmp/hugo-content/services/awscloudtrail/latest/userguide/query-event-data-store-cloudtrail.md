# Create an event data store for CloudTrail events with the console

###### Note

AWS CloudTrail Lake will no longer be open to new customers starting May 31, 2026.
If you would like to use CloudTrail Lake, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[CloudTrail Lake availability change](cloudtrail-lake-service-availability-change.md).

Event data stores for CloudTrail events can include CloudTrail management events, data events, and
network activity events. You can keep the event data in an event data store for up to 3,653 days (about 10 years) if you choose the **One-year extendable retention pricing** option,
or up to 2,557 days (about 7 years) if you choose the **Seven-year retention pricing** option..

CloudTrail Lake event data stores incur charges. When you create an event data store, you choose the [pricing option](cloudtrail-lake-manage-costs.md#cloudtrail-lake-manage-costs-pricing-option) you want
to use for the event data store. The pricing option determines the cost for ingesting and storing events, and
the default and maximum retention period for the event data store. For information
about CloudTrail pricing and managing Lake costs, see
[AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing) and [Managing CloudTrail Lake costs](cloudtrail-lake-manage-costs.md).

## To create an event data store for CloudTrail events

Use this procedure to create an event data store that logs CloudTrail management events, data events, or network activity events.

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudTrail console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

02. From the navigation pane, under **Lake**, choose **Event data stores**.

03. Choose **Create event data store**.

04. On the **Configure event data store** page, in
     **General details**, enter a name for the event data
     store. A name is required.

05. Choose the **Pricing option** that you want to use for your event data store. The pricing option determines the cost for ingesting and storing events, and the
     default and maximum retention periods for your event data store. For more information, see
     [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing) and [Managing CloudTrail Lake costs](cloudtrail-lake-manage-costs.md).

    The following are the available options:

- **One-year extendable retention pricing** \- Generally recommended if you expect to ingest less than 25 TB of event data per month and want a flexible retention period of up to
10 years. For the first 366 days (the default retention period), storage is
included at no additional charge with ingestion pricing. After 366 days, extended retention is available at pay-as-you-go pricing. This is the default option.

- **Default retention period:** 366 days

- **Maximum retention period:** 3,653 days

- **Seven-year retention pricing** \- Recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 7 years. Retention is included with ingestion
pricing at no additional charge.

- **Default retention period:** 2,557 days

- **Maximum retention period:** 2,557 days

06. Specify a retention period for the event data store. Retention periods can be between 7 days and 3,653 days (about 10 years) for the **One-year extendable retention pricing** option,
    or between 7 days and 2,557 days (about seven years) for the **Seven-year retention pricing** option.

     CloudTrail Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the `eventTime`
     of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you specify a retention period
     of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events when their `eventTime` is
     older than 90 days.

    ###### Note

    If you are copying trail events to this event data store, CloudTrail will
    not copy an event if its `eventTime` is older than
    the specified retention period. To determine the appropriate retention period, take the sum of the oldest event you want to copy in days and the number of days you
    want to retain the events in the event data store ( **retention period** =
    `oldest-event-in-days` +
    `number-days-to-retain`). For example, if the oldest event you're copying is 45 days old
    and you want to keep the events in the event data store for a
    further 45 days, you would set the retention period to 90
    days.

07. (Optional) To enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service, choose **Use my**
    **own AWS KMS key**. Choose **New** to have
     an AWS KMS key created for you, or choose **Existing**
     to use an existing KMS key. In **Enter KMS alias**,
     specify an alias, in the format
     `alias/` `MyAliasName`. Using your
     own KMS key requires that you edit your KMS key policy to
     allow your event data store to be encrypted and decrypted. For more information, see [Configure AWS KMS key policies for CloudTrail](create-kms-key-policy-for-cloudtrail.md). CloudTrail also
     supports AWS KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region
     keys, see [Using\
     multi-Region keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer_
    _Guide_.

    Using your own KMS key incurs AWS KMS costs for encryption and decryption.
     After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key
     cannot be removed or changed.

    ###### Note

    To enable AWS Key Management Service encryption for an organization event data store,
    you must use an existing KMS key for the management account.

08. (Optional) If you want to query against your event data using Amazon Athena, choose **Enable** in **Lake query federation**.
     Federation lets you view the metadata associated with the event data store in the AWS Glue
     [Data Catalog](../../../glue/latest/dg/components-overview.md#data-catalog-intro) and run SQL queries against the event data in Athena. The table metadata stored in the AWS Glue Data Catalog
     lets the Athena query engine know how to find, read, and process the data that you want to query. For more information, see
     [Federate an event data store](query-federation.md).

    To enable Lake query federation, choose **Enable** and then do the following:
    1. Choose whether you want to create a new role or use an existing IAM role. [AWS Lake Formation](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/how-it-works.md)
        uses this role to manage permissions for the federated event data store. When you create a new role using the CloudTrail console, CloudTrail automatically creates a role with the required permissions.
        If you choose an existing role, be sure the policy for the role provides the
        [required minimum permissions](query-federation.md#query-federation-permissions-role).

    2. If you are creating a new role, enter a name to identify the role.

    3. If you are using an existing role, choose the role you want to use. The role must exist in your account.
09. (Optional) Choose **Enable resource policy** to add a resource-based policy to your event data store.
     Resource-based policies allow you to control which principals can perform actions on your event data store.
     For example, you can add a resource based policy that allows the root users in other accounts to query this event data store and view the query results. For example policies, see
     [Resource-based policy examples for event data stores](security-iam-resource-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_resource-based-policy-examples-eds).

    A resource-based policy includes one or more statements. Each statement in
     the policy defines the [principals](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-elements-principal.md) that are allowed or denied access
     to the event data store and the actions the principals can perform
     on the event data store resource.

    The following actions are supported in resource-based policies for event data stores:

- `cloudtrail:StartQuery`

- `cloudtrail:CancelQuery`

- `cloudtrail:ListQueries`

- `cloudtrail:DescribeQuery`

- `cloudtrail:GetQueryResults`

- `cloudtrail:GenerateQuery`

- `cloudtrail:GenerateQueryResultsSummary`

- `cloudtrail:GetEventDataStore`

For [organization event data stores](cloudtrail-lake-organizations.md), CloudTrail creates a [default resource-based policy](cloudtrail-lake-organizations.md#cloudtrail-lake-organizations-eds-rbp) that
lists the actions that the delegated administrator accounts are allowed to perform on organization event data stores. The permissions in this policy are derived from the delegated
administrator permissions in AWS Organizations. This policy is updated automatically following changes to the organization event data store or to the organization
(for example, a CloudTrail delegated administrator account is registered or removed).

10. (Optional) In the **Tags** section, you can add up to 50
     tag key pairs to help you identify, sort, and control access to your event
     data store. For more information about how to use IAM policies to
     authorize access to an event data store based on tags, see [Examples: Denying access to create or delete event data stores based on tags](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-eds-tags). For
     more information about how you can use tags in AWS, see [Tagging\
     AWS resources](../../../tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.md) in the
     _Tagging AWS Resources_
    _User Guide_.

11. Choose **Next** to configure the event data store.

12. On the **Choose events** page, choose **AWS**
    **events**, and then choose **CloudTrail**
    **events**.

13. For **CloudTrail events**, choose at least one event type. By
     default, **Management events** is selected. You can add
     [management events](logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.md), [data events](logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md),
     and [network activity events](logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.md) to your event data store.

14. (Optional) Choose **Copy trail events** if you want to
     copy events from an existing trail to run queries on past events. To copy
     trail events to an organization event data store, you must use the
     management account for the organization. The delegated administrator account
     cannot copy trail events to an organization event data store. For more
     information about considerations for copying trail events, see [Considerations for copying trail events](cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake-eds.md#cloudtrail-trail-copy-considerations-lake).

15. To have your event data store collect events from all accounts in an
     AWS Organizations organization, select **Enable for all accounts in my**
    **organization**. You must be signed in to the management account
     or delegated administrator account for the organization to create an event
     data store that collects events for an organization.

    ###### Note

    To copy trail events or enable Insights events, you must be signed in to the management account for your organization.

16. Expand **Additional settings** to choose whether you
     want your event data store to collect events for all AWS Regions, or
     only the current AWS Region, and choose whether the event data store
     ingests events. By default, your event data store collects events from
     all Regions in your account and starts ingesting events when it's
     created.
    1. Select **Include only the current region in my event data**
       **store** to include only events that are logged in
        the current Region. If you do not choose this option, your event
        data store includes events from all Regions.

    2. Deselect **Ingest events** if you do not want the event data store to start ingesting events. For example, you may want to deselect **Ingest events**,
        if you are copying trail events and do not want the event data store to include any future events. By default, the event data store starts ingesting events
        when it's created.
17. If your event data store includes management events, you can choose from
     the following options. For more information about management events, see [Logging management events](logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.md).
    1. Choose between **Simple event collection**
        or **Advanced event collection**:

- Choose **Simple event collection** if you want to log all events, log only read events, or log only write events.
You can choose also to exclude AWS Key Management Service and Amazon RDS Data API events.

- Choose **Advanced event collection** if you want to include or exclude management events based on the values of advanced event selector fields, including the `eventName`,
`eventType`, `eventSource`, `sessionCredentialFromConsole`, and `userIdentity.arn` fields.

    2. If you selected **Simple event collection**,
        choose whether you want to log all events, log only read events, or log only write events.
        You can also choose to exclude AWS KMS and Amazon RDS Data API events.

    3. If you selected **Advanced event collection**, make the following selections:
       1. In **Log selector template**, choose a predefined template, or **Custom** to
           build a custom configuration based on advanced event selector field values.

          You can choose from the following predefined
           templates:

- **Log all events** –
Choose this template to log all events.

- **Log only read events** –
Choose this template to log only read events.
Read-only events are events that do not change the
state of a resource, such as `Get*` or `Describe*`
events.

- **Log only write events** – Choose this template to log only write events.
Write events add, change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts,
such as `Put*`, `Delete*`, or `Write*` events.

- **Log only AWS Management Console events** –
Choose this template to log only events originating from the AWS Management Console.

- **Exclude AWS service initiated events** – Choose this template to exclude
AWS service events, which have an `eventType` of `AwsServiceEvent`,
and events initiated with AWS service-linked roles (SLRs).

       2. (Optional) In **Selector name**, enter a name to identify your selector. The selector name is a
           descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log management events from AWS Management Console sessions". The selector name is listed as `Name` in the
           advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the
           **JSON view**.

       3. If you chose **Custom**, in **Advanced event selectors** build an expression based on advanced event selector
           field values.

          ###### Note

          Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like `*` . To match multiple values with a single condition,
          you may use `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, `NotStartsWith`, or `NotEndsWith` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

          1. Choose from the following fields.

- **`readOnly`** – `readOnly` can
be set to **equals** a value of `true` or
`false`. When it is set to `false`, the event data store logs
Write-only management events. Read-only management events are events that do not change the
state of a resource, such as `Get*` or `Describe*` events.
Write events add, change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts, such as
`Put*`, `Delete*`, or `Write*` events. To log
both **Read** and **Write** events, don't add a
`readOnly` selector.

- **`eventName`** – `eventName`
can use any operator. You can use it to include or exclude any management event, such as `CreateAccessPoint` or
`GetAccessPoint`.

- **`userIdentity.arn`** – Include or exclude events for actions taken by specific IAM identities. For more information, see [CloudTrail userIdentity element](cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md).

- **`sessionCredentialFromConsole`** – Include or exclude events originating from an AWS Management Console session. This field can be set to **equals** or **not equals** with a value of
`true`.

- **`eventSource`** –
You can use it to include or exclude specific event sources. The `eventSource` is typically a short form of the service name
without spaces plus `.amazonaws.com`. For example, you could set `eventSource` **equals** to
`ec2.amazonaws.com` to log only Amazon EC2 management events.

- **`eventType`** – The [eventType](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md#ct-event-type) to include or exclude. For example, you can set this field to
**not equals** `AwsServiceEvent` to exclude [AWS service events](non-api-aws-service-events.md).

          2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to
              add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500
              specified values for all conditions.

             For information about how CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions, see
              [How CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions for a field](filtering-data-events.md#filtering-data-events-conditions).

             ###### Note

             You can have a maximum of 500 values for all selectors on
             an event data store. This includes arrays of multiple values for a
             selector such as `eventName`. If you have single
             values for all selectors, you can have a maximum of 500
             conditions added to a selector.

          3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields
              as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or
              duplicate values for fields.
       4. Optionally, expand **JSON view** to see your
           advanced event selectors as a JSON block.
    4. Choose **Enable Insights events capture** to enable Insights. To enable Insights, you need to set up a [destination event data store](query-event-data-store-insights.md#query-event-data-store-insights-procedure)
        to collect Insights events based upon the management event activity in this event data store.

       If you choose to enable Insights, do the following.
       1. Choose the destination event store that will log Insights events. The destination event data store will collect Insights events
           based upon the management event activity in this event data store. For information about how to
           create the destination event data store, see [To create a destination event data store that logs Insights events](query-event-data-store-insights.md#query-event-data-store-insights-procedure).

       2. Choose the Insights types. You can choose
           **API call rate**, **API error rate**,
           or both. You must be logging **Write** management events to
           log Insights events for **API call rate**. You must be logging
           **Read** or **Write** management events to
           log Insights events for **API error rate**.
18. To include data events in your event data store, do the following.
    1. Choose a resource type. This is the AWS service and resource
        on which data events are logged.

    2. In **Log selector template**, choose a predefined template, or choose **Custom** to
        define your own event collection conditions based on the values of advanced event selector fields.

       You can choose from the following predefined
        templates:

- **Log all events** –
Choose this template to log all events.

- **Log only read events** –
Choose this template to log only read events.
Read-only events are events that do not change the
state of a resource, such as `Get*` or `Describe*`
events.

- **Log only write events** – Choose this template to log only write events.
Write events add, change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts,
such as `Put*`, `Delete*`, or `Write*` events.

- **Log only AWS Management Console events** –
Choose this template to log only events originating from the AWS Management Console.

- **Exclude AWS service initiated events** – Choose this template to exclude
AWS service events, which have an `eventType` of `AwsServiceEvent`,
and events initiated with AWS service-linked roles (SLRs).

    3. (Optional) In **Selector name**, enter a name to identify your selector. The selector name is a
        descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as "Log data events for only two S3 buckets". The selector name is listed as `Name` in the
        advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the
        **JSON view**.

    4. If you selected **Custom**, in **Advanced event selectors** build an expression based on the values of advanced event selector fields.

       ###### Note

       Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like `*` . To match multiple values with a single condition,
       you may use `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, `NotStartsWith`, or `NotEndsWith` to explicitly match the beginning or end of the event field.

       1. Choose from the following fields.

- **`readOnly`**
\- `readOnly` can be set to
**equals** a value of
`true` or `false`. Read-only
data events are events that do not change the state of a
resource, such as `Get*` or
`Describe*` events. Write events add,
change, or delete resources, attributes, or artifacts,
such as `Put*`, `Delete*`, or
`Write*` events. To log both
`read` and `write` events,
don't add a `readOnly` selector.

- **`eventName`** -
`eventName` can use any operator. You can
use it to include or exclude any data event logged to
CloudTrail, such as `PutBucket`,
`GetItem`, or
`GetSnapshotBlock`.

- **`eventSource`** – The event source to include or exclude. This field can use any operator.

- **eventType** – The event type to include or exclude. For example, you can set this field to
**not equals** `AwsServiceEvent` to exclude
[AWS service events](non-api-aws-service-events.md). For a list of event types,
see [eventType](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md#ct-event-type) in
[CloudTrail record contents for management, data, and network activity events](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md).

- **sessionCredentialFromConsole** – Include or exclude events originating from an AWS Management Console session. This field can be set to **equals** or **not equals** with a value of
`true`.

- **userIdentity.arn** – Include or exclude events for actions taken by specific IAM identities. For more information, see [CloudTrail userIdentity element](cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md).

- **`resources.ARN`** \- You can use
any operator with `resources.ARN`, but if you
use **equals** or
**does not equal**, the value must
exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type
you've specified in the template as the value of
`resources.type`.

###### Note

You can't use the `resources.ARN` field to filter resource types that do not have ARNs.

For more information about the ARN formats of data event
resources, see [Actions, resources, and condition\
keys for AWS services](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/reference-policies-actions-resources-contextkeys.md) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.

       2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to
           add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500
           specified values for all conditions. For example, to exclude
           data events for two S3 buckets from data events that are logged
           on your event data store, you can set the field to
           **resources.ARN**, set the operator for
           **does not start with**, and then paste in
           an S3 bucket ARN for which you do
           not want to log events.

          To add the second S3 bucket, choose **+**
          **Condition**, and then repeat the preceding
           instruction, pasting in the ARN for or browsing for a different
           bucket.

          For information about how CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions, see
           [How CloudTrail evaluates multiple conditions for a field](filtering-data-events.md#filtering-data-events-conditions).

          ###### Note

          You can have a maximum of 500 values for all selectors on
          an event data store. This includes arrays of multiple values for a
          selector such as `eventName`. If you have single
          values for all selectors, you can have a maximum of 500
          conditions added to a selector.

       3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields
           as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or
           duplicate values for fields. For example, do not specify an ARN
           in one selector to be equal to a value, then specify that the
           ARN not equal the same value in another selector.
    5. Optionally, expand **JSON view** to see your
        advanced event selectors as a JSON block.

    6. To add another resource type on which to log data events, choose **Add data event type**.
        Repeat steps a through this step to configure advanced event selectors for the resource type.
19. To include network activity events in your event data store, do the following.
    1. From **Network activity event source**, choose the source for network activity events.

    2. In **Log selector template**, choose a template.
        You can choose to log all network activity events, log all network activity access denied events, or choose **Custom** to
        build a custom log selector to filter on multiple fields, such as `eventName` and `vpcEndpointId`.

    3. (Optional) Enter a name to identify the selector. The selector name is listed as **Name** in the advanced event selector and is viewable if you expand the
        **JSON view**.

    4. In **Advanced event**
       **selectors** build expressions by choosing values for **Field**,
        **Operator**, and **Value**. You can skip this step if you are using a predefined log template.
       1. For excluding or including network activity
           events, you can choose from the following fields in the console.

- **`eventName`** – You can use any operator with `eventName`.
You can use it to include or exclude any event, such as `CreateKey`.

- **`errorCode`** – You can use it to filter on an error code. Currently, the only supported `errorCode` is `VpceAccessDenied`.

- **`vpcEndpointId`** – Identifies the VPC endpoint that the operation passed through. You can use
any operator with `vpcEndpointId`.

       2. For each field, choose **\+ Condition** to add as many conditions as you need, up to a maximum of 500 specified values for all conditions.

       3. Choose **\+ Field** to add additional fields as required. To avoid errors, do not set conflicting or duplicate values for fields.
    5. To add another event source for which you want to log network activity events, choose **Add**
       **network activity event selector**.

    6. Optionally, expand **JSON view** to see your
        advanced event selectors as a JSON block.
20. To copy existing trail events to your event data store, do the
     following.
    1. Choose the trail that you want to copy. By default, CloudTrail only
        copies CloudTrail events contained in the S3 bucket's
        `CloudTrail` prefix and the prefixes inside the
        `CloudTrail` prefix, and does not check prefixes for
        other AWS services. If you want to copy CloudTrail events contained in
        another prefix, choose **Enter S3 URI**, and then
        choose **Browse S3** to browse to the prefix. If
        the source S3 bucket for the trail uses a KMS key for data
        encryption, ensure that the KMS key policy allows CloudTrail to decrypt
        the data. If your source S3 bucket uses multiple KMS keys, you
        must update each key's policy to allow CloudTrail to decrypt the data in
        the bucket. For more information about updating the KMS key
        policy, see [KMS key policy for decrypting data in the source S3 bucket](cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake-eds.md#copy-trail-events-permissions-kms).

    2. Choose the time range for
        copying the events. CloudTrail checks the prefix and log file name to verify the name contains a date between the chosen start and end date before attempting to copy trail events. You can choose a **Relative range** or an
        **Absolute range**. To avoid duplicating events between the source trail and destination event data store, choose a time range that is earlier than the creation of the event data store.

       ###### Note

       CloudTrail only copies trail events that have an `eventTime` within the event data store’s retention period.
       For example, if an event data store’s retention period is 90 days, then CloudTrail will not copy any trail events with an `eventTime` older than 90 days.

- If you choose **Relative range**, you can
choose to copy events logged in the last 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 7 years, or a custom range. CloudTrail copies the events logged within the chosen time period.

- If you choose **Absolute range**, you can choose a specific start and end date. CloudTrail copies the events that occurred between the chosen
start and end dates.

    3. For **Permissions**, choose from the following
        IAM role options. If you choose an existing IAM role, verify
        that the IAM role policy provides the necessary permissions. For
        more information about updating the IAM role permissions, see
        [IAM permissions for copying trail events](cloudtrail-copy-trail-to-lake-eds.md#copy-trail-events-permissions-iam).

- Choose **Create a new role**
**(recommended)** to create a new IAM role. For
**Enter IAM role name**, enter a name
for the role. CloudTrail automatically creates the necessary
permissions for this new role.

- Choose **Use a custom IAM role ARN** to use
a custom IAM role that is not listed. For **Enter**
**IAM role ARN**, enter the IAM ARN.

- Choose an existing IAM role from the drop-down list.
21. Choose **Next** to enrich your events by adding resource tag keys and IAM global condition keys.

22. In **Enrich events**, add up
    to 50 resource tag keys and 50 IAM global condition keys to provide additional
    metadata about your events. This helps you categorize and group related events.

    If you add resource tag keys, CloudTrail will include the selected tag keys associated with the resources that were involved in the API call. API events related to deleted resources will not have resource tags.

    If you add IAM global condition keys,
    CloudTrail will include information about the selected condition keys that were evaluated during the authorization process,
    including additional details about the principal, session, network, and the request itself.

    Information about the resource tag keys and IAM global condition keys is shown in the `eventContext`
    field of the event. For more information, see [Enrich CloudTrail events by adding resource tag keys and IAM global condition keys](cloudtrail-context-events.md).

    ###### Note

    If an event contains a resource that doesn’t belong to the event Region,
    CloudTrail will not populate tags for this resource because tag retrieval is limited to the event Region.

23. Choose **Expand event size** to expand the event payload up to 1 MB from 256 KB. This option is automatically enabled
     when you add resource tag keys or IAM global condition keys to ensure all of your added keys are included in the event.

    Expanding the event size is helpful for analyzing and troubleshooting events because it allows you to
     see the full contents of the following fields as long as the event payload is less than 1 MB:

- `annotation`

- `requestID`

- `additionalEventData`

- `serviceEventDetails`

- `userAgent`

- `errorCode`

- `responseElements`

- `requestParameters`

- `errorMessage`

For more information about these fields, see [CloudTrail record contents](cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.md).

24. Choose **Next** to review your choices.

25. On the **Review and create** page, review your choices.
     Choose **Edit** to make changes to a section. When you're
     ready to create the event data store, choose **Create event data**
    **store**.

26. The new event data store is visible in the **Event data**
    **stores** table on the **Event data stores** page.

    From this point forward, the event data store captures events that match
     its advanced event selectors (if you kept the **Ingest events** option selected). Events that occurred before you created the
     event data store are not in the event data store, unless you opted to copy
     existing trail events.

You can now run queries on your new event data store. The **Sample**
**queries** tab provides example queries to get you started. For more
information about creating and editing queries, see [Create or edit a query with the CloudTrail console](query-create-edit-query.md).

You can also view the [managed dashboards](lake-dashboard-managed.md), or [create custom dashboards](lake-dashboard-custom.md) to visualize event trends. For more information about Lake dashboards,
see [CloudTrail Lake dashboards](lake-dashboard.md).
