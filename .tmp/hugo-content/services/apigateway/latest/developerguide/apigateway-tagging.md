# Tagging your API Gateway resources

A _tag_ is a metadata label that you assign or that AWS assigns to an
AWS resource. Each tag has two parts:

- A _tag key_ (for example, `CostCenter`,
`Environment`, or `Project`). Tag keys are case
sensitive.

- An optional field known as a _tag value_ (for example,
`111122223333` or `Production`). Omitting the
tag value is the same as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are
case-sensitive.

Tags help you do the following:

- Control access to your resources based on the tags that are assigned to them. You
control access by specifying tag keys and values in the conditions for an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) policy. For more information about tag-based access
control, see [Controlling Access Using Tags](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-tags.md) in the _IAM User_
_Guide_.

- Track your AWS costs. You activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses
the tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to
you. For more information, see [Use Cost Allocation\
Tags](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.md) in the [AWS Billing User Guide](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2.md).

- Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so
you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that
the resources are related. For example, you could assign the same tag to an API Gateway
stage that you assign to a CloudWatch Events rule.

For tips on using tags, see the whitepaper [AWS\
Tagging Strategies](../../../whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.md).
