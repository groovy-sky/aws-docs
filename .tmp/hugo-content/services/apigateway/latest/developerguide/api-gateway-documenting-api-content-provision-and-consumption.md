# Control access to API documentation in API Gateway

If you have a dedicated documentation team to write and edit your API documentation,
you can configure separate access permissions for your developers (for API development)
and for your writers or editors (for content development). This is especially
appropriate when a third-party vendor is involved in creating the documentation for you.

To grant your documentation team the access to create, update, and publish your API
documentation, you can assign the documentation team an IAM role with the following
IAM policy, where `account_id` is the AWS account ID of
your documentation team.

    }
  ]
}
