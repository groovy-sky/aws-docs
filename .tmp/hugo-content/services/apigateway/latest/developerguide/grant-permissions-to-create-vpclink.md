# Grant permissions for API Gateway to create a VPC link (legacy)

###### Note

The following implementation of private integrations uses VPC links V1. VPC links V1 are legacy resources. We recommend
that you use [VPC links V2 for REST APIs](apigateway-vpc-links-v2.md).

For you or a user in your account to create and maintain a VPC link, you or the user
must have permissions to create, delete, and view VPC endpoint service configurations,
change VPC endpoint service permissions, and examine load balancers. To grant such
permissions, use the following steps.

###### To grant permissions to create, update, and delete a VPC link

1. Create an IAM policy similar to the following:
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "apigateway:POST",
                   "apigateway:GET",
                   "apigateway:PATCH",
                   "apigateway:DELETE"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:apigateway:us-east-1::/vpclinks",
                   "arn:aws:apigateway:us-east-1::/vpclinks/*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ec2:CreateVpcEndpointServiceConfiguration",
                   "ec2:DeleteVpcEndpointServiceConfigurations",
                   "ec2:DescribeVpcEndpointServiceConfigurations",
                   "ec2:ModifyVpcEndpointServicePermissions"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
}

```

If you want to enable tagging for your VPC link, make sure to allow tagging operations. For more
    information, see [Allow tagging operations](apigateway-tagging-iam-policy.md#allow-tagging).

2. Create or choose an IAM role and attach the preceding policy to the
    role.

3. Assign the IAM role to you or a user in your account who is creating VPC
    links.
