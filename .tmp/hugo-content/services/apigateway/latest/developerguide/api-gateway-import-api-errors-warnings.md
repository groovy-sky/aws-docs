# Errors and warnings from importing your API into API Gateway

When you import your external definition file into API Gateway, API Gateway might generate warnings and errors. The
following sections discuss the errors and warnings that might occur during import.

## Errors during import

During the import, errors can be generated for major issues like an invalid
OpenAPI document. Errors are returned as exceptions (for example,
`BadRequestException`) in an unsuccessful response. When an error
occurs, the new API definition is discarded and no change is made to the existing
API.

## Warnings during import

During the import, warnings can be generated for minor issues like a missing
model reference. If a warning occurs, the operation will continue if the
`failonwarnings=false` query expression is appended to the request
URL. Otherwise, the updates will be rolled back. By default,
`failonwarnings` is set to `false`. In such cases,
warnings are returned as a field in the resulting [RestApi](../api/api-restapi.md) resource. Otherwise, warnings are returned as a message in the
exception.
