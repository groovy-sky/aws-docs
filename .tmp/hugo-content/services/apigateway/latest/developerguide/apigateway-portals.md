# API Gateway portals

You can use an API Gateway portal to share your APIs and API documentation with API consumers in a web page. A portal
contains a set of _portal products_. Each portal product is a logical grouping of REST APIs and
contains the documentation that you create and publish for your API consumers. Product pages within a portal contain
the custom documentation at the portal product level. _Product REST endpoint pages_ contain the
documentation for each of the REST APIs and the path, method, and stage of a REST API. The combination of product
pages and product REST endpoint pages provide the complete documentation to allow API consumers to learn how to start
using your REST APIs.

Use a portal to do the following:

- Use API Gateway for your entire API lifecycle, from creating your APIs to documenting and distributing
them.

- Share portal products across AWS accounts.

- Customize and share a central location for your portal products and provide product pages.

## Considerations

The following considerations might impact your use of API Gateway portals:

- You can only create portals to share REST APIs.

- Portals are created at the AWS Region level. Your portal can only contain REST APIs that are
in the same Region where you create the portal.

- You can only use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to create and share your portals.

- You can only control access to your portal using Amazon Cognito user pools. Your portal consumers can either sign
in directly through a user pool, or they can federate through a third-party identity provider (IdP). If you
use an Amazon Cognito user pool, you cannot set a client secret for your user pool. For more information, see [Amazon Cognito user\
pools](../../../cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools.md).
