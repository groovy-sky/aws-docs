# Call a REST API integrated with an Amazon Cognito user pool

To call a method with a user pool authorizer configured, the client must do the
following:

- Enable the user to sign up with the user pool.

- Enable the user to sign in to the user pool.

- Obtain an [identity or access token](../../../cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-with-identity-providers.md) of the signed-in user from the user pool.

- Include the token in the `Authorization` header (or
another header you specified when you created the authorizer).

You can use AWS Amplify to perform these tasks.
See [Integrating Amazon Cognito With Web and Mobile Apps](../../../cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-integrate-apps.md)
for more information.
