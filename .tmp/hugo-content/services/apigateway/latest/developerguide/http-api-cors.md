# Configure CORS for HTTP APIs in API Gateway

[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
is a browser security feature that restricts HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser.
If you cannot access your API and receive an error message that contains `Cross-Origin Request Blocked`,
you might need to enable CORS. For more information, see [What is CORS?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cross-origin-resource-sharing).

CORS is typically required to build web applications that access APIs hosted on a
different domain or origin. You can enable CORS to allow requests to your API from a web application hosted on a
different domain. For example, if your API is hosted on
`https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/` and you want to call your API from a web
application hosted on `example.com`, your API must support CORS.

If you configure CORS for an API, API Gateway automatically sends a response to preflight
OPTIONS requests, even if there isn't an OPTIONS route configured for your API. For a
CORS request, API Gateway adds the configured CORS headers to the response from an
integration.

###### Note

If you configure CORS for an API, API Gateway ignores CORS headers returned from your
backend integration.

You can specify the following parameters in a CORS configuration. To add these parameters using the API Gateway HTTP API console, choose **Add** after you enter your value.

To return CORS headers, your request must contain an `origin` header. For the `OPTIONS`
method, your request must contain an `origin` header and an `Access-Control-Request-Method`
header.

Your CORS configuration might look similar to the following:

## Configuring CORS for an HTTP API with a `$default` route and an authorizer

You can enable CORS and configure authorization for any route of an HTTP API.
When you enable CORS and authorization for the [`$default` route](http-api-develop-routes.md#http-api-develop-routes.default), there are some special considerations. The
`$default` route catches requests for all methods and routes that you
haven't explicitly defined, including `OPTIONS` requests. To support
unauthorized `OPTIONS` requests, add an `OPTIONS /{proxy+}` route
to your API that doesn't require authorization and attach an integration to the route. The `OPTIONS /{proxy+}` route
has higher priority than the `$default` route. As a result, it enables
clients to submit `OPTIONS` requests to your API without authorization. For
more information about routing priorities, see [Routing API requests](http-api-develop-routes.md#http-api-develop-routes.evaluation).

## Configure CORS for an HTTP API by using the AWS CLI

The following [update-api](../../../cli/latest/reference/apigatewayv2/update-api.md) command enables CORS requests from
`https://www.example.com`:

###### Example

```nohighlight

aws apigatewayv2 update-api --api-id api-id --cors-configuration AllowOrigins="https://www.example.com"
```

For more information, see [CORS](../../../apigatewayv2/latest/api-reference/apis-apiid.md#apis-apiid-model-cors) in the Amazon API Gateway Version 2 API Reference.
