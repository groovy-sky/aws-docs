# AWS managed policies for Amazon Elastic Container Registry

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed
to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because
they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining
[customer managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS
managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is
most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for
existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

Amazon ECR provides several managed policies that you can attach to IAM identities or to
Amazon EC2 instances. These managed policies allow differing levels of control over access to
Amazon ECR resources and API operations. For more information about each API operation mentioned
in these policies, see [Actions](../../../../reference/amazonecr/latest/apireference/api-operations.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Registry API Reference_.

## AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

You can attach the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess` policy to your IAM identities.
This policy grants administrative access to Amazon ECR resources and grants an IAM identity
(such as a user, group, or role) access to the AWS services that Amazon ECR is integrated
with to use all of Amazon ECR features. Using this policy allows access to all of Amazon ECR
features that are available in the AWS Management Console.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonec2containerregistryfullaccess.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

## AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser

You can attach the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser` policy to your
IAM identities. This policy grants administrative permissions that allow IAM users to read and write
to repositories, but doesn't allow them to delete repositories or change the policy
documents that are applied to them.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonec2containerregistrypoweruser.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

## AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPullOnly

You can attach the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPullOnly` policy to your
IAM identities. This policy grants permission to pull container images from Amazon ECR. If the registry is enabled for pull-through cache, it will also allow pulls to import an image from an upstream registry.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPullOnly](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonec2containerregistrypullonly.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

## AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly

You can attach the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` policy to your
IAM identities. This policy grants read-only permissions to Amazon ECR. This includes the ability to list
repositories and images within the repositories. It also includes the ability to pull
images from Amazon ECR with the Docker CLI.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonec2containerregistryreadonly.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

## `AWSECRPullThroughCache_ServiceRolePolicy`

You can't attach the `AWSECRPullThroughCache_ServiceRolePolicy` managed
IAM policy to your IAM entities. This policy is attached to a service-linked role
that allows Amazon ECR to push images to your repositories through the pull through cache
workflow. For more information, see [Amazon ECR service-linked role for pull through cache](slr-pullthroughcache.md).

## `ECRReplicationServiceRolePolicy`

You can't attach the `ECRReplicationServiceRolePolicy` managed IAM policy
to your IAM entities. This policy is attached to a service-linked role that allows
Amazon ECR to perform actions on your behalf. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECR](using-service-linked-roles.md).

## `ECRTemplateServiceRolePolicy`

You can't attach the `ECRTemplateServiceRolePolicy` managed IAM policy
to your IAM entities. This policy is attached to a service-linked role that allows
Amazon ECR to perform actions on your behalf. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECR](using-service-linked-roles.md).
