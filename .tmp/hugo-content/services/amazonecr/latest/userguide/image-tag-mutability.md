# Preventing image tags from being overwritten in Amazon ECR

You can prevent image tags from being overwritten by turning on tag immutability in a
repository. After tag immutability is turned on, the `
            ImageTagAlreadyExistsException` error is returned if you push an image with a tag
that is already in the repository. Tag immutability affects all tags. You cannot make
some tags immutable while others aren't.

You can use the AWS Management Console and AWS CLI tools to set image tag mutability for a new
repository or for an existing repository. To create a repository using console steps,
see [Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images](repository-create.md).

## Setting image tag mutability (AWS Management Console)

###### To set image tag mutability

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to
    edit.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Repositories** under **Private**
**registry**.

If you don't see **Repositories**, choose **Private**
**registry** to expand the menu and then choose **Repositories**.

4. On the **Private repositories** page, choose the radio
    button before the repository name for which you want to set the image tag
    mutability settings.

5. Choose **Actions** and then choose **Repository**
    under **Edit**.

6. For **Image tag immutability**, choose one of the
    following tag mutability settings for the repository.

- **Mutable** – Choose this option if you
want image tags to be overwritten. Recommended for repositories
using pull through cache actions to ensure Amazon ECR can update cached
images. Additionally, to disable tag updates for a few mutable tags,
enter tag names or use wildcards (\*) to match multiple similar tags
in the **Mutable tag exclusion** text box.

- **Immutable** – Choose this option if you
want to prevent image tags from being overwritten, and it applies to
all tags and exclusions in the repository when pushing an image with
existing tag. Amazon ECR returns an `ImageTagAlreadyExistsException`
if you attempt to push an image with an existing tag. Additionally,
to enable tag updates for a few immutable tags, enter tag names or
use wildcards (\*) to match multiple similar tags in the **Immutable**
**tag**
**exclusion** text box.

7. For **Image scan settings**, while you can specify the
    scan settings at the repository level for basic scanning, it is best
    practice to specify the scan configuration at the private registry level.
    Specify the scanning settings at the private registry allow you to enable
    either enhanced scanning or basic scanning as well as define filters to
    specify which repositories are scanned. For more information, see [Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR](image-scanning.md).

8. For **Encryption settings**, this is a view only field as
    the encryption settings for a repository can't be changed once the
    repository is created.

9. Choose **Save** to update the repository settings.

## Setting image tag mutability (AWS CLI)

###### To create a repository with immutable tags configured

Use one of the following commands to create a new image repository with
immutable tags configured.

- [create-repository](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.md)
(AWS CLI) with image tag mutability

```nohighlight

aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE --region us-east-2
```

- [create-repository](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.md)
(AWS CLI) with image tag mutability exclusion filters

```nohighlight

aws ecr create-repository --repository-name name --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE_WITH_EXCLUSION --image-tag-mutability-exclusion-filters filterType=WILDCARD,filter=filter-text --region us-east-2
```

- [New-ECRRepository](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ecrrepository.md)
(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) with image tag mutability

```nohighlight

New-ECRRepository -RepositoryName name -ImageTagMutability IMMUTABLE -Region us-east-2 -Force
```

- [New-ECRRepository](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ecrrepository.md)
(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) with image tag mutability exclusion filters

```nohighlight

New-ECRRepository -RepositoryName name -ImageTagMutability IMMUTABLE_WITH_EXCLUSION -ImageTagMutabilityExclusionFilter @{FilterType=WILDCARD Filter=filter-text} -Region us-east-2 -Force
```

###### To update the image tag mutability settings for a repository

Use one of the following commands to update the image tag mutability settings
for an existing repository.

- [put-image-tag-mutability](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/put-image-tag-mutability.md) (AWS CLI) with image tag mutability

```nohighlight

aws ecr put-image-tag-mutability --repository-name name --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE --region us-east-2
```

- [put-image-tag-mutability](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/put-image-tag-mutability.md) (AWS CLI) with image tag mutability exclusion
filters

```nohighlight

aws ecr put-image-tag-mutability --repository-name name --image-tag-mutability IMMUTABLE_WITH_EXCLUSION --image-tag-mutability-exclusion-filters filterType=WILDCARD,filter=latest --region us-east-2
```

- [Write-ECRImageTagMutability](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/write-ecrimagetagmutability.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) with image tag mutability

```nohighlight

Write-ECRImageTagMutability -RepositoryName name -ImageTagMutability IMMUTABLE -Region us-east-2 -Force
```

- [Write-ECRImageTagMutability](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/write-ecrimagetagmutability.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell) with image tag mutability
exclusion filters

```nohighlight

Write-ECRImageTagMutability -RepositoryName name -ImageTagMutability IMMUTABLE_WITH_EXCLUSION -ImageTagMutabilityExclusionFilter @{FilterType=WILDCARD Filter=latest}
```
