# Pushing a multi-architecture image to an Amazon ECR private repository

You can push multi-architecture images to an Amazon ECR repository by creating and
pushing Docker manifest lists. A _manifest list_ is a list of
images that is created by specifying one or more image names. In most cases, the
manifest list is created from images that serve the same function but are for
different operating systems or architectures. The manifest list isn't required. For
more information, see [docker\
manifest](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest).

A manifest list can be pulled or referenced in an Amazon ECS task definition or Amazon EKS
pod spec like other Amazon ECR images.

**Prerequisites**

- In your Docker CLI, turn on experimental features. For information about
experimental features, see [Experimental\
features](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli) in the Docker documentation.

- The Amazon ECR repository must exist before you push the image. For more
information, see [Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images](repository-create.md).

- Images must be pushed to your repository before you create the Docker
manifest. For information about how to push an image, see [Pushing a Docker image to an Amazon ECR private repository](docker-push-ecr-image.md).

###### To push a multi-architecture Docker image to an Amazon ECR repository

1. Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR registry to which you intend
    to push your image. Authentication tokens must be obtained for each registry
    used, and the tokens are valid for 12 hours. For more information, see [Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR](registry-auth.md).

To authenticate Docker to an Amazon ECR registry, run the **aws ecr**
**get-login-password** command. When passing the authentication
    token to the **docker login** command, use the value
    `AWS` for the username and specify the Amazon ECR registry URI you
    want to authenticate to. If authenticating to multiple registries, you must
    repeat the command for each registry.

###### Important

If you receive an error, install or upgrade to the latest version of
the AWS CLI. For more information, see [Installing the\
AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.md) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

```nohighlight

aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

2. List the images in your repository, confirming the image tags.

```nohighlight

aws ecr describe-images --repository-name my-repository
```

3. Create the Docker manifest list. The `manifest create` command
    verifies that the referenced images are already in your repository and creates the
    manifest locally.

```nohighlight

docker manifest create aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository:image_one_tag aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository:image_two
```

4. (Optional) Inspect the Docker manifest list. This enables you to confirm
    the size and digest for each image manifest referenced in the manifest
    list.

```nohighlight

docker manifest inspect aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository
```

5. Push the Docker manifest list to your Amazon ECR repository.

```nohighlight

docker manifest push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository
```
