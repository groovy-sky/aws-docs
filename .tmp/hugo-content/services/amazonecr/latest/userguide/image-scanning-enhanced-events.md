# EventBridge events sent for enhanced scanning in Amazon ECR

When enhanced scanning is turned on, Amazon ECR sends an event to EventBridge when the scan
frequency for a repository is changed. Amazon Inspector sends events to EventBridge when an initial
scan is completed and when an image scan finding is created, updated, or
closed.

**Event for a repository scan frequency**
**change**

When enhanced scanning is turned on for your registry, the following event is sent
by Amazon ECR when there is a change with a resource that has enhanced scanning turned
on. This includes new repositories being created, the scan frequency for a
repository being changed, or when images are created or deleted in repositories with
enhanced scanning turned on. For more information, see [Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR](image-scanning.md).

**Event for an initial image scan (enhanced**
**scanning)**

When enhanced scanning is turned on for your registry, the following event is sent
by Amazon Inspector when the initial image scan is completed. The `finding-severity-counts`
parameter will only return a value for a severity level if one exists. For example,
if the image contains no findings at `CRITICAL` level, then no critical
count is returned. For more information, see [Scan images for OS and programming language package vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR](image-scanning-enhanced.md).

When enhanced scanning is turned on for your registry, the following event is sent
