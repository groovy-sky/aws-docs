# Granting registry permissions for pull through cache in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR private registry permissions may be used to scope the permissions of
individual IAM entities to use pull through cache. If an IAM entity has more
permissions granted by an IAM policy than the registry permissions policy is
granting, the IAM policy takes precedence.

###### To create a private registry permissions policy (AWS Management Console)

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to configure your private
    registry permissions statement in.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Private registry**,
    choose **Features & Settings**, and then choose **Permissions**.

4. On the **Registry permissions** page, choose **Generate**
**statement**.

5. For each pull through cache permissions policy statement you want to
    create, do the following.
1. For **Policy type**, choose **Pull**
      **through cache policy**.

2. For **Statement id**, provide a name for the pull
       through cache statement policy.

3. For **IAM entities**, specify the users,
       groups, or roles to include in the policy.

4. For **Cache namespace**, select the pull through
       cache rule to associate the policy with.

5. For **Repository names**, specify the repository
       base name to apply the rule for. For example, if you want to specify
       the Amazon Linux repository on Amazon ECR Public, the repository name would be `
                                      amazonlinux`.
