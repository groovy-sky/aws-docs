# Validating pull through cache rules in Amazon ECR

After you create a pull through cache rule, for upstream registries that require
authentication you can validate that the rule works properly. When validating a pull through
cache rule, Amazon ECR makes a network connection with the upstream registry, verifies that it can
access the Secrets Manager secret containing the credentials for the upstream registry, and verifies that
authentication was successful.

Before you start working with your pull through cache rules, verify that you have the proper
IAM permissions. For more information, see [IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private registry](pull-through-cache-iam.md).

The following steps show how to validate a pull through cache rule
using the Amazon ECR console.

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region containing the pull
    through cache rule to validate.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Private**
**registry**, **Pull through**
**cache**.

4. On the **Pull through cache configuration**
    page, select the pull through cache rule to validate. Then, use
    the **Actions** drop down menu and choose
    **View details**.

5. On the pull through cache rule detail page, use the
    **Actions** drop down menu and choose
    **Verify authentication**. Amazon ECR will
    display a banner with the result.

6. Repeat these steps for each pull through cache rule you want
    to validate.

The [validate-pull-through-cache-rule](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/validate-pull-through-cache-rule.md) AWS CLI command is used to
validate a pull through cache rule for an Amazon ECR private registry. The
following example uses the `ecr-public` namespace prefix.
Replace that value with the prefix value for the pull through cache rule
to validate.

```nohighlight

aws ecr validate-pull-through-cache-rule \
     --ecr-repository-prefix ecr-public \
     --region us-east-2
```

In the response, the `isValid` parameter indicates whether
the validation was successful or not. If `true`, Amazon ECR was
able to reach the upstream registry and authentication was successful.
If `false`, there was an issue and validation failed. The
`failure` parameter indicates the cause.
