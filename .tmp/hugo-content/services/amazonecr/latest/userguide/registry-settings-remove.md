# Removing private image replication settings in Amazon ECR

To remove or disable replication settings for your private registry, you need to
configure an empty replication configuration. There is no dedicated removal command in
the AWS CLI.

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to remove your registry
    replication settings from.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Private**
**registry**.

4. On the **Private registry** page, choose **Settings** and then choose **Edit** under **Replication**
**configuration**.

5. Remove all existing replication rules by choosing the delete option
    for each rule.

6. Choose **Save** to apply the empty replication
    configuration.

1. Create a JSON file with an empty rules array to remove all replication
    settings.

```

{
       "rules": []
}
```

2. Apply the empty replication configuration to your registry.

```nohighlight

aws ecr put-replication-configuration \
        --replication-configuration file://empty-replication-settings.json \
        --region us-west-2
```

3. Confirm that replication settings have been removed.

```nohighlight

aws ecr describe-registry \
        --region us-west-2
```

The output should show an empty `replicationConfiguration`
    with no rules.

###### Important

Removing replication settings does not delete any previously replicated
repositories or images. You must manually delete replicated content if it is
no longer needed.
