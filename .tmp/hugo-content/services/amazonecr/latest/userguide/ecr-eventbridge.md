# Amazon ECR events and EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge enables you to automate your AWS services and to respond automatically to
system events such as application availability issues or resource changes. Events from
AWS services are delivered to EventBridge in near real time. You can write simple rules to
indicate which events are of interest to you and include automated actions to take when
an event matches a rule. The actions that can be automatically triggered include the
following:

- Adding events to log groups in CloudWatch Logs

- Invoking an AWS Lambda function

- Invoking Amazon EC2 Run Command

- Relaying the event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

- Activating an AWS Step Functions state machine

- Notifying an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon SQS queue

For more information, see [Getting Started\
with Amazon EventBridge](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-getting-set-up.md) in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

## Sample events from Amazon ECR

The following are example events from Amazon ECR. Events are emitted on a best effort
basis.

**Event for a completed image scan (basic**
**scanning)**

When basic scanning is enabled for your registry, the following event is sent when
each image scan is completed. The `finding-severity-counts` parameter
will only return a value for a severity level if one exists. For example, if the
image contains no findings at `CRITICAL` level, then no critical count is
returned. For more information, see [Scan images for OS vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR](image-scanning-basic.md).

###### Note

For details about events that Amazon Inspector emits when enhanced scanning is enabled,
see [EventBridge events sent for enhanced scanning in Amazon ECR](image-scanning-enhanced-events.md).

**Event for a change notification on a resource with enhanced**
**scanning enabled (enhanced scanning)**

When enhanced scanning is enabled for your registry, the following event is sent
by Amazon ECR when there is a change with a resource that has enhanced scanning enabled.
This includes new repositories being created, the scan frequency for a repository
being changed, or when images are created or deleted in repositories with enhanced
scanning enabled. For more information, see [Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR](image-scanning.md).
