# Customizing repository prefixes for ECR to ECR pull through cache

Pull through cache rules support both the **ecr repository prefix**
and the **upstream repository prefix**. The **ecr repository**
**prefix** is the repository namespace prefix in Amazon ECR cache registry that's
associated with the rule. All repositories using this prefix become pull through
cache-enabled repositories for the upstream registry defined in the rule. For example, a
prefix of `prod` applies to all repositories beginning with
`prod/`. To apply a template to all repositories in your registry that
don't have an associated pull through cache rule, use `ROOT` as the
prefix.

###### Important

There is always an assumed `/` applied to the end of the prefix. If you
specify `ecr-public` as the prefix, Amazon ECR treats that as
`ecr-public/`.

The **upstream repository prefix** matches the upstream repository
name. By default, it's set to `ROOT`, which allows matching with any upstream
repository. You can set the **upstream repository prefix** only when
the Amazon ECR repository prefix has a non- `ROOT` value.

The following table shows the mapping between cache repository names and upstream
repository names based on their prefix configurations in pull through cache
rules.
