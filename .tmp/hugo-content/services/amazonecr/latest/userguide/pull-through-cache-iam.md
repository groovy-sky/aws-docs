# IAM permissions required to sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private registry

In addition to the Amazon ECR API permissions needed to authenticate to a private
registry and to push and pull images, the following additional permissions are
needed to use pull through cache rules effectively.

- `ecr:CreatePullThroughCacheRule` – Grants permission to
create a pull through cache rule. This permission must be granted via an
identity-based IAM policy.

- `ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage` – Grants permission to
retrieve the external image and import it to your private registry. This
permission can be granted by using the private registry permissions policy,
an identity-based IAM policy, or by using the resource-based repository
permissions policy. For more information about using repository permissions,
see [Private repository policies in Amazon ECR](repository-policies.md).

- `ecr:CreateRepository` – Grants permission to create a
repository in a private registry. This permission is required if the
repository storing the cached images doesn't already exist. This permission
can be granted by either an identity-based IAM policy or the private
registry permissions policy.

## Using registry permissions

Amazon ECR private registry permissions may be used to scope the permissions of
individual IAM entities to use pull through cache. If an IAM entity has more
permissions granted by an IAM policy than the registry permissions policy is
granting, the IAM policy takes precedence. For example, if user has
`ecr:*` permissions granted, no additional permissions are needed
at the registry level.

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to configure your
    private registry permissions statement in.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Private**
**registry**, **Registry**
**permissions**.

4. On the **Registry permissions** page, choose
    **Generate statement**.

5. For each pull through cache permissions policy statement you
    want to create, do the following.
1. For **Policy type**, choose
       **Pull through cache**
      **policy**.

2. For **Statement id**, provide a name
       for the pull through cache statement policy.

3. For **IAM entities**, specify the
       users, groups, or roles to include in the policy.

4. For **Repository namespace**, select
       the pull through cache rule to associate the policy
       with.

5. For **Repository names**, specify the
       repository base name to apply the rule for. For example,
       if you want to specify the Amazon Linux repository on Amazon ECR
       Public, the repository name would be
       `amazonlinux`.

Use the following AWS CLI command to specify the private registry
permissions using the AWS CLI.

1. Create a local file named
    `ptc-registry-policy.json` with the contents of
    your registry policy. The following example grants the
    `ecr-pull-through-cache-user` permission to
    create a repository and pull an image from Amazon ECR Public, which
    is the upstream source associated with the previously created
    pull through cache rule.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "PullThroughCacheFromReadOnlyRole",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/ecr-pull-through-cache-user"
         },
         "Action": [
           "ecr:CreateRepository",
           "ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:111122223333:repository/ecr-public/*"
       }
     ]
}

```

###### Important

The `ecr-CreateRepository` permission is only
required if the repository storing the cached images doesn't
already exist. For example, if the repository creation
action and the image pull actions are being done by separate
IAM principals such as an administrator and a
developer.

2. Use the [put-registry-policy](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/put-registry-policy.md) command to set the registry
    policy.

```nohighlight

aws ecr put-registry-policy \
        --policy-text file://ptc-registry.policy.json
```

## Next steps

Once you are ready to start using pull through cache rules, the following are the
next steps.

- Create a pull through cache rule. For more information, see [Creating a pull through cache rule in Amazon ECR](pull-through-cache-creating-rule.md).

- Create a repository creation template. A repository creation template
gives you control to define the settings to use for new repositories created
by Amazon ECR on your behalf during a pull through cache action. For more
information, see [Templates to control repositories created during a pull through cache, create on push, or replication action](repository-creation-templates.md).
