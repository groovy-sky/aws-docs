# Updating registry settings in Amazon ECR public

Your public registry provides settings to configure a custom alias and display
name.

By default, your public registry is assigned a **default alias**
after your first public repository is created. You can request a **custom**
**alias** for your registry, and if approved, both the default alias and
custom alias can be used to access your public repositories. The registry
**display name** appears on each repository in the
Amazon ECR Public Gallery as well.

When requesting a custom alias, the following words or phrases should be
avoided:

- An alias that includes `aws`, `amazon`, or the name of
an AWS service

- An alias using a company name for which you do not have permission to
use

- Generic names, such as `test`, `public`, and
`marketplace`

- Offensive, inappropriate, or non-inclusive words and phrases
