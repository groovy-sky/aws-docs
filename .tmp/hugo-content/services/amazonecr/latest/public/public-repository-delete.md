# Deleting a public repository policy statement Amazon ECR public

If you're finished using a repository, you can delete it. When you delete a repository
in the AWS Management Console, all of the images that are contained in the repository are also
deleted. This action can't be undone.

###### To delete a public repository

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the AWS Region that contains the repository
    to delete.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Repositories**.

4. On the **Repositories** page, select the
    **Public** tab, and then select the repository to delete
    and choose **Delete**.

5. In the **Delete `repository_name`**
    window, double check the repositories that you selected to delete and choose
    **Delete**.

###### Important

Any images in the selected repositories are also deleted.
