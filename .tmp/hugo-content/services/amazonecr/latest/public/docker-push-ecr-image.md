# Pushing an image to a public repository in Amazon ECR public

You can push your Docker images to an Amazon ECR public repository with the **docker**
**push** command.

###### Important

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
`ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken` and `sts:GetServiceBearerToken` API through an IAM policy before they
can authenticate to a registry and push any images to an Amazon ECR
repository.

Amazon ECR Public also supports creating and pushing Docker manifest lists which are used
for multi-architecture images. Each image referenced in a manifest list must already be
pushed to your repository. For more information, see [Pushing a multi-architecture image to a public repository in Amazon ECR public](docker-push-multi-architecture-image.md).

###### To push a Docker image to an Amazon ECR public repository

1. Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR public registry to which you
    intend to push your image. Authentication tokens are valid for 12 hours. For
    more information, see [Registry authentication in Amazon ECR public](public-registry-auth.md).

2. If your public repository does not exist in the registry you intend to push to
    yet, create it. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon ECR public repository to store images](public-repository-create.md).

3. Identify the image to push. Run the **docker images** command
    to list the images on your system.

```nohighlight

docker images
```

You can identify an image with the `repository:tag`
    value or the image ID in the resulting command output.

4. Tag your image with the Amazon ECR public registry, public repository, and optional
    image tag name combination to use. The public registry format is
    `public.ecr.aws/registry_alias`.
    The public repository name should match the repository that you created for your
    image. If you omit the image tag, we assume that the tag is
    `latest`.

```nohighlight

docker tag e9ae3c220b23 public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/my-web-app:image-tag
```

For this example command, note the following:

- Image ID is `e9ae3c220b23`

- Public registry is
`public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/`

- Repository is `my-web-app`

- Image tag is `image-tag`

5. Push the image using the **docker push** command (again,
    ( `my-web-app` is the name of the
    repository, and `image-tag` is the image tag):

```nohighlight

docker push public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/my-web-app:image-tag
```

6. (Optional) Apply any additional tags to your image and push those tags to
    Amazon ECR Public by repeating [Step 4](#image-tag-step) and [Step 5](#image-push-step). You can apply up to 1000 tags per image in
    Amazon ECR Public.
