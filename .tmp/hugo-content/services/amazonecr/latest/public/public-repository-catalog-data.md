# Specifying the repository catalog data in Amazon ECR public

When you create a public repository, you specify the catalog data that helps users
find, understand, and use the images in the repository. The catalog data that you
configure for a public repository includes a short description, the operating system and
system architecture compatibilities, an optional logo, an **About**
section that provides a more detailed description, and an **Usage**
section that provides details on how to use the images.

When
you
specify a logo, the logo is specified as a blob
that's
a base64-encoded string. The supported image dimensions for both height and width
must be at least
60
pixels
but
can be up to 2048
pixels
long. The maximum file size is 500 KB. To generate a blob from an
existing PNG file, run the following command.

```nohighlight

cat myrepoimage.png | base64
```

The text for the **About** and **Usage**
must
be
in the
GitHub Flavored Markdown format. When using the API, SDK, or AWS CLI to
format the text, use `/n` to indicate a line break.

The following table provides examples for specifying certain element types in the
`About` and `Usage` sections of your repository catalog
data.

## Examples

The following are examples of how to format the **About** and
**Usage** repository catalog data so that it appears properly
on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

- [Example: Headings](#example-headings)

- [Example: Text formatting](#example-textformatting)

- [Example: Code formatting](#example-codeformatting)

- [Example: Links](#example-links)

- [Example: Lists](#example-lists)

- [Example: Full About description](#example-abouttext)

- [Example: Full Usage description](#example-usagetext)

### Example: Headings

Headings are designated by the number sign ( `#`). A single number
sign and a space indicate a top-level heading, two number signs create a
second-level heading, and three number signs create a third-level heading. This
is illustrated in the following examples.

###### AWS Management Console

The following example is the format for headings in the console.

```markdown

# Heading level one

Body text

## Heading level two

Body text

### Heading level three

Body text
```

###### AWS CLI

The following example is the format to use for headings in the
AWS CLI.

```markdown

# Heading level one\n\nBody text\n\n## Heading level two\n\nBody text\n\n### Heading level three\n\nBody text\n\n#### Heading level four\n\nBody text
```

### Example: Text formatting

You can use the following syntax to apply italics, bold, or strikethrough to
text. The syntax is the same for both the console and the AWS CLI.

```markdown

*This text appears in italics*
```

```markdown

**This text appears in bold**
```

```markdown

~~This text appears in strikethrough~~
```

### Example: Code formatting

You
can use the following syntax
for
single-line
and
multi-line code
blocks. The syntax is the same for both the console and the
AWS CLI.

```markdown

`code text`
```

````markdown

```
multi-line
codeblock
```
````

### Example: Links

You can create a clickable web link by surrounding the `link_text`
with square brackets and surrounding the full URL with parentheses. The syntax
for is the same for both the console and the AWS CLI.

```markdown

[What is Amazon Elastic Container Registry?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html)
```

### Example: Lists

To format lines as part of a bulleted list,
enter
them on separate lines with a single asterisk and then a space at the beginning
of the line. To format lines as part of a numbered list,
enter
them on separate lines with a number, period, and space at the beginning of the
line.

###### AWS Management Console

The following example is the format to use for lists in the
console.

```markdown

* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
* Bullet 3
```

```markdown

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
```

###### AWS CLI

The following example is the format to use for lists in the AWS CLI.

```markdown

* Bullet 1\n* Bullet 2\n* Bullet 3
```

```markdown

1. Step one\n2. Step two\n3. Step three
```

### Example: Full **About** description

The following screenshot from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery displays how an
**About** section is constructed. This section covers the
format to use for this text when using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI.

## What is Amazon Linux?

Amazon Linux is provided by Amazon Web Services. It is designed to provide a stable, secure, and high-performance execution environment for applications running on Amazon EC2. The full distribution includes packages that enable easy integration with Amazon Web Services, including launch configuration tools and many popular AWS libraries and tools. AWS provides ongoing security and maintenance updates to all instances running Amazon Linux.

The Amazon Linux container image contains a minimal set of packages. To install additional packages, [use `yum`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-software.html).

Amazon Web Services provides two versions of Amazon Linux: [Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/) and [Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/).

For information on security updates for Amazon Linux, please refer to [Amazon Linux 2 Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/alas2.html) and [Amazon Linux AMI Security Advisories](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/). Note that Docker Hub's vulnerability scanning for Amazon Linux is currently based on RPM versions, which does not reflect the state of backported patches for vulnerabilities.

## Where can I run Amazon Linux container images?

You can run Amazon Linux container images in any Docker based environment. Examples include, your laptop, in Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon ECS clusters.

## License
