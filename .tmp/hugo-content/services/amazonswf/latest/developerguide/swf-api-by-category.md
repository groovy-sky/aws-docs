## Actions Related to Activities

Activity workers use `PollForActivityTask` to get new activity tasks. After a
worker receives an activity task from Amazon SWF, it performs the task and responds using
`RespondActivityTaskCompleted` if successful or
`RespondActivityTaskFailed` if unsuccessful.

The following are actions that are performed by activity workers.

- `PollForActivityTask`

- `RespondActivityTaskCompleted`

- `RespondActivityTaskFailed`

- `RespondActivityTaskCanceled`

- `RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat`

## Actions Related to Deciders

Deciders use `PollForDecisionTask` to get decision tasks. After a decider
receives a decision task from Amazon SWF, it examines its workflow execution history and decides
what to do next. It calls `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` to complete the
decision task and provides zero or more next decisions.

The following are actions that are performed by deciders.

- `PollForDecisionTask`

- `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted`

## Actions Related to Workflow Executions

The following actions operate on a workflow execution.

- `RequestCancelWorkflowExecution`

- `StartWorkflowExecution`

- `SignalWorkflowExecution`

- `TerminateWorkflowExecution`

## Actions Related to Administration

section to automate functions or build your own administrative tools.

### Activity Management

- `RegisterActivityType`

- `DeprecateActivityType`
