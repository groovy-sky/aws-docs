# Life cycle of a Amazon SWF workflow

From the start of a workflow execution to its completion, Amazon SWF interacts with actors by assigning them
appropriate tasks, either activity tasks or decision tasks.

The following diagram shows the life cycle of an order-processing workflow execution from the perspective of
components that act on it.

`StartWorkflowExecution` action.

2\. Amazon SWF receives the start workflow execution request and then schedules
the first decision task.

`WorkflowExecutionStarted` event and `DecisionTaskScheduled` event.

3\. The decider receives the task from Amazon SWF, reviews the history, applies
the coordination logic to determine that no previous activities occurred, makes
a decision to schedule the Verify Order activity with the information the
activity worker needs to process the task, and returns the decision to
Amazon SWF.

`PollForDecisionTask` action. `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` action and `ScheduleActivityTask` decision.

4\. Amazon SWF receives the decision, schedules the Verify Order activity task,
and waits for the activity task to complete or time out.

`ActivityTaskScheduled` event

5\. An activity worker that can perform the Verify Order activity receives
the task, performs it, and returns the results to Amazon SWF.

`PollForActivityTask`
action and `RespondActivityTaskCompleted`
action.

6\. Amazon SWF receives the results of the Verify Order activity, adds them to the
workflow history, and schedules a decision task.

`ActivityTaskCompleted` event and `DecisionTaskScheduled` event.

7\. The decider receives the task from Amazon SWF, reviews the history, applies
the coordination logic, makes a decision to schedule a ChargeCreditCard
activity task with the information the activity worker needs to process the
task, and returns the decision to Amazon SWF.

`PollForDecisionTask` action. `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` action with `ScheduleActivityTask` decision.

8\. Amazon SWF receives the decision, schedules the ChargeCreditCard activity
task, and waits for it to complete or time out.

`DecisionTaskCompleted` event and `ActivityTaskScheduled` event.

9\. An activity worker that can perform the ChargeCreditCard activity receives
the task, performs it, and returns the results to Amazon SWF.

`PollForActivityTask`
and `RespondActivityTaskCompleted`
action.

10\. Amazon SWF receives the results of the ChargeCreditCard activity task, adds
them to the workflow history, and schedules a decision task.

`ActivityTaskCompleted` event and `DecisionTaskScheduled` event.

11\. The decider receives the task from Amazon SWF, reviews the history, applies
the coordination logic, makes a decision to schedule a ShipOrder activity task
with the information the activity worker needs to perform the task, and returns
the decision to Amazon SWF.

`PollForDecisionTask` action. `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` with `ScheduleActivityTask` decision.

12\. Amazon SWF receives the decision, schedules a ShipOrder activity task, and
waits for it to complete or time out.

`DecisionTaskCompleted` event and `ActivityTaskScheduled` event.

13\. An activity worker that can perform the ShipOrder activity receives the
task, performs it, and returns the results to Amazon SWF.

`PollForActivityTask`
action and `RespondActivityTaskCompleted`
action.

14\. Amazon SWF receives the results of the ShipOrder activity task, adds them to
the workflow history, and schedules a decision task.

`ActivityTaskCompleted` event and `DecisionTaskScheduled` event.

15\. The decider receives the task from Amazon SWF, reviews the history, applies
the coordination logic, makes a decision to schedule a RecordCompletion
activity task with the information the activity worker needs to perform the
task, and returns the decision to Amazon SWF.

`PollForDecisionTask` action. `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` action with `ScheduleActivityTask` decision.

16\. Amazon SWF receives the decision, schedules a RecordCompletion activity task,
and waits for it to complete or time out.

`DecisionTaskCompleted` event and `ActivityTaskScheduled` event.

17\. An activity worker that can perform the RecordCompletion activity
receives the task, performs it, and returns the results to Amazon SWF.

`PollForActivityTask`
action and `RespondActivityTaskCompleted`
action.

18\. Amazon SWF receives the results of the RecordCompletion activity task, adds
them to the workflow history, and schedules a decision task.

`ActivityTaskCompleted` event and `DecisionTaskScheduled` event.

19\. The decider receives the task from Amazon SWF, reviews the history, applies
the coordination logic, makes a decision to close the workflow execution and
