Gets the voice enhancement mode of the user that's currently logged in to Amazon
Connect agent workspace. The voice enhancement mode can have the following values:

- `VOICE_ISOLATION`: it suppresses background noise and isolates the
agent's voice. This mode should only be enabled if the agent uses a wired
headsets.

- `NOISE_SUPPRESSION`: it suppresses the background noise. We
recommend using this mode with any type of headset.
