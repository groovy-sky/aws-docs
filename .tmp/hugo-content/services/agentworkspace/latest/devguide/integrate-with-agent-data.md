# Integrate application with Amazon Connect Agent Workspace agent data

To integrate your application with agent data from the Amazon Connect agent workspace,
instantiate
the agent client as follows:

```typescript

import { AgentClient } from "@amazon-connect/contact";

const agentClient = new AgentClient({ provider });

```

###### Note

You must first instantiate the [AmazonConnectApp](../../../../reference/agentworkspace/latest/devguide/getting-started-initialize-sdk.md) which initializes the default AmazonConnectProvider and
returns ` { provider } `. This is the recommended option.

Alternatively, see the [API\
reference](api-reference-3p-apps-agent-client.md) to customize your client’s configuration.

Once the agent client is instantiated, you can use it to subscribe to events and
make requests.

## Example agent event

The code sample below subscribes a callback to the state change event topic.
Whenever the agent’s state is modified, the agent workspace will invoke your
provided
callback, passing in the event data payload for your function to operate on. In
this example, it logs the event data to the console.

```typescript

import { AgentStateChanged } from "@amazon-connect/contact";

// A simple callback that just console logs the state change event data
// returned by the agent workspace whenever the logged-in agent's state changes
const handler = async (data: AgentStateChanged) => {
    console.log(data);
};

// Subscribe to the state change topic using the above handler
agentClient.onStateChanged(handler);

```

## Example agent request

The following code sample submits a `getARN` request and then logs
the returned data to the console.

```typescript

const arn = await agentClient.getARN();

console.log(`Got the arn value: ${arn}`);

```

The above agent event and request are non-exhaustive. For a full list of
available agent events and requests, see the [API\
Reference](api-reference-3p-apps-events-and-requests.md).
