# Example IAM policies for AWS Artifact in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions

These policies are ONLY applicable in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. For policies applicable to commercial AWS [Regions](../../../glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.md#region),
see [Example IAM policies for AWS Artifact in commercial AWS Regions](example-iam-policies.md)

You can create permissions policies that grant permissions to IAM users. You can
grant users access to AWS Artifact reports and the ability to accept and download agreements
on behalf of either a single account or an organization.

The following example policies show permissions that you can assign to IAM users
based on the level of access that they need.
