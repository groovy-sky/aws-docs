# Instagram Ads connector for Amazon AppFlow

Instagram Ads is an advertising solution for Instagram. If you run ads on Instagram,
your account contains data about your ads, campaigns, ad images, and more. You can use Amazon AppFlow to
transfer data from Instagram Ads to certain AWS services or other supported
applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Instagram Ads

Amazon AppFlow supports Instagram Ads as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Instagram Ads.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Instagram Ads.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Instagram Ads to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an Instagram business account that you use to run your ads. For more
information about the Instagram Ads data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#instagram-ads-objects).

- You've connected your Instagram business account to a Facebook Page. This connection
makes it possible for third-party applications like Amazon AppFlow to access your Instagram data.
For the steps to connect, see [Add or Remove an\
Instagram Account From Your Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/connect-instagram-to-page) in the Meta Business Help
Center.

- You have a Meta for Developers account.

- Your Meta for Developers account contains an app with its type set to _Business_. For information about how to create an app, see
[Create an\
App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) in the Meta for Developers App Development documentation.

- Your Meta for Developers app includes the _Facebook_
_Login_ product, and you've configured the product to meet the following
additional requirements:

- Client OAuth login is enabled.

- Web OAuth login is enabled.

- One or more OAuth redirect URIs are present for Amazon AppFlow. Each of these URIs has the
following form:

`https://region.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth`

In this URI, _region_ is the code for the AWS Region
where you use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from the Marketing API. For example, if you use Amazon AppFlow
in the US East (N. Virginia) region, the URI is
`https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth`.

For the AWS Regions that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Amazon AppFlow endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/appflow.md) in the _AWS General Reference._

For more information about Facebook Login, see [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login) in the Meta
For Developers documentation.

- Your app includes the _Marketing API_ product, and you
use this product to manage the ads that Amazon AppFlow transfers data about.

- You've configured your app with the following permissions:

- `ads_management`

- `ads_read`

- `business_management`

- `read_insights`

For more information about these permissions, see [Permissions\
Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference) in the Meta for Developers Graph API documentation.

Each of these permissions must be approved for _Advanced_
_Access_ through the _App Review_ process. For
the steps to create an App Review submission, see Submitting For Review in
the Meta for Developers App Review documentation.

From the settings for your app, note the app ID and app secret. You provide these values
to Amazon AppFlow when you connect to your account.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to Instagram Ads

To connect Amazon AppFlow to Instagram Ads, provide the app credentials from your Meta for
Developers app so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured an app for
Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#instagram-ads-prereqs).

###### To connect to Instagram Ads

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Instagram Ads**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Instagram Ads** window, enter the following
    information:

- **Client ID** – The app ID from your Meta for Developers
app.

- **Client secret** – The app secret from your Meta for
Developers app.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Continue**.

9. In the window that appears, sign in to your account, and grant access to
    Amazon AppFlow.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Instagram Ads as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Instagram Ads with a flow

To transfer data from Instagram Ads, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Instagram Ads as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).
