# AWS managed policies for Amazon AppFlow

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed
to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because
they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining
[customer managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS
managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is
most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for
existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonAppFlowFullAccess

You can attach the `AmazonAppFlowFullAccess` policy to your IAM
identities.

This policy grants administrative permissions that allow you to view, create,
update, run, and delete flows, and also to list, create, and delete connections. In
addition, this policy grants access to the API actions that are required to
configure other AWS services as a source or destinations. This policy also
provides access to AWS Key Management Service to allow use of customer managed CMKs for encryption.
It does not grant the ability to add other users.

###### Note

This policy automatically grants read and write permissions to S3 buckets with
an `appflow-` prefix only. You will not have access rights to any
other S3 buckets without this prefix.

**Permissions details**

This policy includes the following permissions.

- `appflow` – Allows principals to have full access to
Amazon AppFlow. This is required so that you can view, create, update, run, and
delete flows, in addition to list, create, and delete connections.

- `iam` – Allows principals to list IAM roles from Amazon Redshift.
This is required so that you can use Amazon Redshift as a flow destination.

- `s3` – Allows principals to access buckets, bucket
locations, and bucket policies for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). This is required so that
you can use Amazon S3 as a flow source or destination (or use it to support the
use of another source or destination).

- `kms` – Allows principals to view the key ID and Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of all the customer master keys (CMKs) in the account,
view detailed information about a CMK, view the aliases that are defined in
the account, and add a grant to a CMK. This is required so that you can use
customer managed CMKs for encryption.

- `secretsmanager` – Allows principals to create secrets
in Secrets Manager. This is required so that Amazon AppFlow can store the encrypted
credentials that you use to connect to flow source and destination
applications in your Secrets Manager account.

- `lambda` – Allows principals to list all the functions
in customer account. This is required so that you can register new
connectors
