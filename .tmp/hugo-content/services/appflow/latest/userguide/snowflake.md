# Snowflake

The following are the requirements and connection instructions for using Snowflake with
Amazon AppFlow.

###### Note

You can use Snowflake as a destination only.

###### Topics

- [Requirements](#snowflake-requirements)

- [Connection instructions](#snowflake-setup)

- [Related resources](#snowflake-resources)

## Requirements

- Amazon AppFlow uses the Snowflake COPY command to move data using an S3 bucket. To configure
the integration, see [Configuring\
Secure Access to Amazon S3](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/data-load-s3-config.html) in the Snowflake documentation.

- You must also add access to the `kms:Decrypt` action so that Snowflake can
access the encrypted data that Amazon AppFlow stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.

```json

{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
      "Resource": "*"
}
```

- You must provide Amazon AppFlow with the following information:

- the name of the stage and the S3 bucket for the stage

- the user name and password for your Snowflake account

- the S3 bucket prefix

- the warehouse that you want to use to move the data

## Connection instructions

###### To connect to Snowflake while creating a flow

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. Choose **Create flow**.

3. For **Flow details**, enter a name and description for the flow.

4. (Optional) To use a customer managed CMK instead of the default AWS managed CMK, choose
    **Data encryption**, **Customize encryption settings** and
    then choose an existing CMK or create a new one.

5. (Optional) To add a tag, choose **Tags**, **Add tag**
    and then enter the key name and value.

6. Choose **Next**.

7. Choose **Snowflake** from the **Destination name**
    dropdown list.

8. Choose **Connect** or **Connect with PrivateLink** to
    open the **Connect to Snowflake** dialog box.

1. Under **Warehouse**, enter the Snowflake warehouse that you want to use
       to move the data.

2. Under **Stage name**, enter the Amazon S3 stage name in the following
       format: <Database> <Schema> <Stage name>

3. Under **Bucket details**, select the S3 bucket where Amazon AppFlow will
       write data prior to copying it.

4. Under **Account name**, enter your Snowflake account name. You can find
       your account name in the URL of your Snowflake instance. For example, if your Snowflake URL
       is https://vna33034.snowflakecomputing.com, your account name is vna33034.

5. Under **User name**, enter the user name you use to log into
       Snowflake.

6. Under **Data encryption**, enter your AWS KMS key.
