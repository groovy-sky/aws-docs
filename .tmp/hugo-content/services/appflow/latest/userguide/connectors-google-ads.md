# Google Ads connector for Amazon AppFlow

Google Ads is a platform that advertisers use to display ads on the web, such as in Google
search results, YouTube videos, mobile apps, and on websites. If you are a Google Ads user, you
can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data about your account, ad campaigns, and ad groups to certain
AWS services or other supported applications.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Google Ads to AWS services, you'll need to meet these
requirements:

- You have a Google Cloud Platform account and a Google Cloud project.

- In your Google Cloud project, you've enabled the Google Ads API. For information on how
to enable APIs, see [Enable and\
disable APIs](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841) in the API Console Help for Google Cloud Platform.

- You have a Google Ads developer token. For information on how to retrieve or create a
developer token, see [Obtain Your\
Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token) in the Google Ads API documentation.

- In your Google Cloud project, you've configured an OAuth consent screen for external users
that meets the following requirements:

- You've set _amazon.com_ as an authorized domain.

- You've set _Google Ads API_ as an authorized
scope.

For information about the OAuth consent screen, see [Setting up your OAuth consent\
screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615) in the Google Cloud Platform Console Help.

- In your Google Cloud project, you've configured an OAuth 2.0 client ID. For information on
how to create one, see [Setting up OAuth\
2.0](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) in the Google Cloud Platform Console Help.

The OAuth 2.0 client ID must have one or more authorized redirect URLs for Amazon AppFlow.

Redirect URLs have the following format:

```nohighlight

https://region.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

In this URL, _region_ is the code for the AWS Region
where you use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Google Ads. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia)
Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the URL is the following:

```nohighlight

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

For the AWS Regions that Amazon AppFlow supports, and their codes, see [Amazon AppFlow endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/appflow.md)
in the _AWS General Reference._

From your Google Ads settings, note your developer token. From the settings for your OAuth
2.0 client ID in your Google Cloud project, note your client ID and client secret. You will
provide these values to Amazon AppFlow when you connect to your Google Cloud project.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Google Ads account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Google Ads account, provide details from the Google Cloud project
so that Amazon AppFlow can access your Google Ads data. If you haven't yet configured your Google Cloud
project for Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#google-ads-prereqs).

###### To connect to Google Ads

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

02. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

03. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
     choose **Google Ads**.

04. Choose **Create connection**.

05. In the **Connect to Google Ads** window, enter the following
     information:

- **Access type** – Choose **offline**.

- **Client ID** – The client ID of the OAuth 2.0 client ID in your
Google Cloud project.

- **Client secret** – The client secret of the OAuth 2.0 client ID
in your Google Cloud project.

- **Google Ads developer token** – The developer token from your
Google Ads account.

- **Google Ads instance URL** – Choose
**https://googleads.googleapis.com**.

- **Google Ads API version** – Choose the Google Ads API version
that you use. For the versions that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Google Ads support](#google-ads-support).

- **Manager account ID** – Optionally, the account ID of a Google
Ads manager account that you want to connect with Amazon AppFlow.

06. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
    **encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
     managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

    By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
     for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

    Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
     [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

    If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
     **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
     AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

07. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

08. Choose **Connect**. A **Sign in with Google** window
     opens.

09. Choose your Google account, and sign in.

10. On the page titled **amazon.com wants to access your Google Account**,
     choose Continue.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Google Ads as the data source, you can select this connection.
