# Intercom connector for Amazon AppFlow

Intercom is a customer engagement solution. It helps organizations learn who is
using a website or product so that the organization can engage those users with targeted messages
and support. If you're an Intercom user, then your account contains data about your
contacts, conversations, customer segments, and more. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from
Intercom to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Intercom

Amazon AppFlow supports Intercom as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Intercom.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Intercom.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Intercom to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an account with Intercom that contains the data that you want to transfer. For more
information about the Intercom data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#intercom-objects).

- In your Intercom account, you've created an app for Amazon AppFlow. The app provides
the credentials that Amazon AppFlow uses to access your data securely when it makes authenticated calls
to your account. For the steps to create an app, see [How do I create\
an app?](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/1827298-how-do-i-create-an-app) in the Intercom Help Center.

- You've configured the app with a redirect URL for Amazon AppFlow.

Redirect URLs have the following format:

```nohighlight

https://region.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

In this URL, _region_ is the code for the AWS Region
where you use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Intercom. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia)
Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the URL is the following:

```nohighlight

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

For the AWS Regions that Amazon AppFlow supports, and their codes, see [Amazon AppFlow endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/appflow.md)
in the _AWS General Reference._

###### Note

You must add your connecting profile region redirect URL (or URLs) to the list of redirect URLs in your Intercom app. If you don’t make this addition, the app defaults to the first redirect URL in the list, and your connection will fail. For more information, see
[Redirect URLs](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication/setting-up-oauth)
in the Intercom Developer Platform Help Center.

From the settings for your app, note the client ID and client Secret. You provide these
values to Amazon AppFlow when you connect to your Intercom account.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Intercom account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Intercom account, provide the client credentials from
your Intercom app so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured
your Intercom account for Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#intercom-prereqs).

###### To connect to Intercom

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Intercom**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Intercom** window, enter the following
    information:

- **Authorization tokens URL** — Choose the URL based on the data
host region where you use Intercom (Europe, US, Australia).

- **Authorization code URL** — Choose the URL based on the data
host region where you use Intercom (Europe, US, Australia).

- **Client ID** — The client ID from your Intercom
app.

- **Client secret** — The client secret from your
Intercom app.

- **Instance URL** — Choose the
URL based on the data host region where you use Intercom (Europe, US,
Australia).

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

9. In the window that appears, sign in to your Intercom account, and grant access
    to Amazon AppFlow.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Intercom as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Intercom with a flow

To transfer data from Intercom, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Intercom as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose the data object that you want to transfer. For the objects
that Amazon AppFlow supports for Intercom, see [Supported objects](#intercom-objects).

Also, choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information about how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#intercom-destinations).

## Supported destinations

When you create a flow that uses Intercom as the data source, you can set the destination to any of the following connectors:

- [Amazon Lookout for Metrics](lookout.md)

- [Amazon Redshift](redshift.md)

- [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](connectors-amazon-rds-postgres-sql.md)

- [Amazon S3](s3.md)
