# Oracle HCM connector for Amazon AppFlow

Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) is a cloud-based application for human resources (HR)
processes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from
Oracle HCM to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Oracle HCM

Amazon AppFlow supports Oracle HCM as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Oracle HCM.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Oracle HCM.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Oracle HCM to supported destinations, you must
have an account with Oracle HCM that contains the data that you want to transfer.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Oracle HCM account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Oracle HCM account, provide your account credentials and
instance URL.

###### To connect to Oracle HCM

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Oracle HCM**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Oracle HCM** window, enter the following
    information:

- **User name** – The user name for your Oracle HCM
account.

- **Password** – The password for your Oracle HCM
account.

- **Oraclehcm Instance URL** – The URL of your Oracle HCM
instance.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Oracle HCM as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Oracle HCM with a flow

To transfer data from Oracle HCM, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Oracle HCM as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).
