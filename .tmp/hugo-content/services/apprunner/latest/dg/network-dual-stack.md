AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting April 30, 2026. If you would like to use
App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS App Runner availability\
change](apprunner-availability-change.md).

# Enabling IPv6 for incoming traffic

If you want your service to receive incoming network traffic from IPv6 addresses, or from
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, choose the **Dual-stack** address type for the
endpoint. When you’re creating a new application, you can find this setting under
**Configure service** \> **Networking** section. The
following procedures explain how to enable IPv4 or dual-stack (IPv6 and IPv4) using the App Runner
console or the App Runner API.

## Managing dual stack for incoming traffic

Manage the dual-stack address type for incoming traffic using one of the following
methods:

- [App Runner console](#network-dual-stack-manage.console)

- [App Runner API or AWS CLI](#network-dual-stack-manage.api)

###### Note

The following procedures explain how to manage the network address type for **public** incoming traffic. For information about managing dual-stack
or IPv4 address types for **private** endpoints, see [Managing Private endpoints](network-pl-manage.md).

### App Runner console

You can choose dual-stack address type for the incoming internet traffic, when you
create a service using the App Runner console, or when you update its configuration later.

###### To enable dual-stack address type

1. When [creating](manage-create.md) or [updating](manage-configure.md) a service, expand the
    **Networking** section under **Configure service**.

2. Choose **Public endpoint** for **Incoming network**
**traffic**. If you select **Public endpoint**, the
    **Endpoint IP address type** option opens.

See [Managing Private endpoints](network-pl-manage.md) for a procedure to manage dual-stack or IPv4
    address types for private endpoints.

3. Expand **Endpoint IP address type** to view the following IP
    address types.

- **IPv4**

- **Dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6)**

###### Note

If you do not expand **Endpoint IP address type** to make a
selection, then App Runner assigns IPv4 as the default configuration.

4. Choose **Dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6)**.

5. Choose **Next** and then **Create & Deploy**
    if you are creating a service. Else, choose **Save changes** if you are
    updating a service.

When the service is deployed, your application starts receiving network traffic from
    both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.

###### To change the address type

1. Follow the steps to [update](manage-configure.md) a service and
    navigate to Networking.

2. Navigate to **Endpoint IP address type** under **Incoming**
**network traffic** and select the required address type.

3. Choose **Save changes.** Your service is updated with your
    selection.

### App Runner API or AWS CLI

When you call the [CreateService](../api/api-createservice.md)
or [UpdateService](../api/api-updateservice.md) App Runner API actions,
use the `IpAddressType` member of the `NetworkConfiguration` parameter
to specify the address type. The supported values that you can specify are `IPv4`
and `DUAL_STACK`. Specify `DUAL_STACK` if you want your service to
receive internet traffic from IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints. If you do not specify any value for
`IpAddressType`, by default IPv4 is applied.

###### Note

For private endpoint examples, see [App Runner API or AWS CLI](network-pl-manage.md#network-pl-manage.api).

The following is the example to create a service with the dual stack as IP address. This
example calls an `input.json` file.

###### Example Request to create a service with dual stack support

```sh

aws apprunner create-service \
 --cli-input-json file://input.json
```

###### Example Contents of `input.json`

```json

{
  "ServiceName": "example-service",
  "SourceConfiguration": {
    "ImageRepository": {
      "ImageIdentifier": "public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/hello-app-runner:latest",
