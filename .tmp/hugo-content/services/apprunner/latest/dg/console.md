AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting April 30, 2026. If you would like to use
App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS App Runner availability\
change](apprunner-availability-change.md).

# Using the App Runner console

Use the AWS App Runner console to create, manage, and monitor your App Runner services and related resources, such as connected accounts. You can view existing
services, create new ones, and configure a service. You can view the status of an App Runner service as well as view logs, monitor activity, and track metrics.
You can also navigate to the website of your service or to your source repository.

The following sections describe the layout and functionality of the console, and point you to related information.

## Overall console layout

The App Runner console has three areas. From left to right:

- Navigation pane – A side pane that can be collapsed or expanded. Use it to choose the top-level console page
you want to use.

- Content pane – The main part of the console page. Use it to view information and perform your tasks.

- Help pane – A side pane for more information. Expand it to get help about the page you're on. Or choose any
**Info** link on a console page to get contextual help.

## The Services page

The **Services** page lists App Runner services in your account. You can scope the list down by using the filter text box.

###### To get to the **Services** page

1. Open the [App Runner console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner), and in the **Regions** list, select your AWS Region.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Services**.

Things you can do here:

- Create an App Runner service. For more information, see [Creating an App Runner service](manage-create.md).

- Choose a service name to go to the service dashboard console page.

- Choose a service domain to open the service web app page.

## The service dashboard page

You can view information about an App Runner service and manage it from the service dashbaord page. At the top of the page, you can see the service
name.

To get to the service dashboard, navigate to the **Services** page (see previous section), and then choose your App Runner service.

![App Runner service dashboard page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/apprunner/latest/dg/images/console-dashboard.png)

The **Service overview** section provides basic details about the App Runner service and your application. Things you can do here:

- View service details such as status, health, and ARN.

- Navigate to the **Default domain**—the domain that App Runner provides for the web application running in your service. This is a
subdomain in the `awsapprunner.com` domain owned by App Runner.

- Navigate to the source repository deployed to the service.

- Start a source repository deployment to your service.

- Pause, resume, and delete your service.

The tabs below the service overview are for service [management](manage.md) and [observability](monitor.md).

## The Connected accounts page

The **Connected accounts** page lists App Runner connections to source code repository providers in your account. You can scope the list
down by using the filter text box. For more information about connected accounts, see [Managing App Runner connections](manage-connections.md).

###### To get to the **Connected accounts** page

1. Open the [App Runner console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner), and in the **Regions** list, select your AWS Region.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Connected accounts**.

- Choose a connection name to go to the related provider account or organization.

- Select a connection to complete the handshake for a connection that you just established (as part of creating a service), or to delete the
connection.

## The Auto scaling configurations page

The **Auto scaling configurations** page lists the auto scaling configurations that you have set up in your account. You can
configure a few parameters to adjust auto scaling behavior and save them in different configurations that you can later assign to one or more App Runner
services. You can scope the list down by using the filter text box. For more information about auto scaling configurations, see [Manage auto scaling for a service](manage-autoscaling.md#manage-autoscaling.manage).
