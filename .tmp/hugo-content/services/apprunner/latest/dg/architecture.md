AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting April 30, 2026. If you would like to use
App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS App Runner availability\
change](apprunner-availability-change.md).

# App Runner architecture and concepts

AWS App Runner takes your source code or source image from a repository, and creates and maintains a running web service for you in the AWS Cloud.
Typically, you need to call just one App Runner action, [CreateService](../api/api-createservice.md), to create your service.

With a source image repository, you provide a ready-to-use container image that App Runner can deploy to run your web service. With a source code repository,
you provide your code and instructions for building and running a web service, and you target a specific runtime environment. App Runner supports several
programming platforms, each with one or more managed runtimes for platform major versions.

At this time, App Runner can retrieve your source code from either a [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, or it can retrieve your source image from [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)](../../../amazonecr/latest/userguide.md) in your AWS account.

The following diagram shows an overview of the App Runner service architecture. In the diagram, there are two example services: one deploys source code from
GitHub, and the other deploys a source image from Amazon ECR. The same flow applies to the Bitbucket repository.

## App Runner concepts

The following are key concepts related to your web service that's running in App Runner:

- _App Runner service_ – An AWS resource that App Runner uses to deploy and manage your application based on its source code
repository or container image. An App Runner service is a running version of your application. For more information about creating a service, see [Creating an App Runner service](manage-create.md).

- _Source type_ – The type of source repository that you provide for deploying your App Runner service: [source code](service-source-code.md) or [source image](service-source-image.md).

- _Repository provider_ – The repository service that contains your application source (for example, [GitHub](service-source-code.md#service-source-code.providers.github), [Bitbucket](service-source-code.md#service-source-code.providers.github), or [Amazon ECR](service-source-image.md#service-source-image.providers.ecr)).

- _App Runner connection_ – An AWS resource that lets App Runner access a repository provider account (for example, a GitHub account
or organization). For more information about connections, see [Managing App Runner connections](manage-connections.md).

- _Runtime_ – A base image for deploying a source code repository. App Runner provides a variety of _managed_
_runtimes_ for different programming platforms and versions.

For more information, see [App Runner service based on source code](service-source-code.md).

- _Deployment_ – An action that applies a version of your source repository (code or image) to an App Runner service. The first
deployment to the service occurs as part of service creation. Later deployments can occur in one of two ways:

- _Automatic deployment_ – A CI/CD capability. You can configure an App Runner service to automatically build (for source
code) and deploy each version of your application as it appears in the repository. This can be a new commit in a source code repository or a new
image version in a source image repository.

- _Manual deployment_ – A deployment to your App Runner service that you explicitly start.

- _Custom domain_ – A domain that you associate with your App Runner service. Users of your web application can use this domain
to access your web service instead of the default App Runner subdomain. For more information, see [Managing custom domain names for an App Runner service](manage-custom-domains.md).

###### Note

To augment the security of your App Runner applications, the _\*.awsapprunner.com_ domain is registered in the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/). For further security, we recommend that you use cookies with a `__Host-`
prefix if you ever need to set sensitive cookies in the default domain name for your App Runner applications.
This practice will help to defend your domain against cross-site request
forgery attempts (CSRF). For more information see the [Set-Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) page in the Mozilla Developer Network.

- _Maintenance_ – An activity that App Runner occasionally performs on the infrastructure that runs your App Runner service. When
maintenance is in progress, service status temporarily changes to `OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS` ( **Operation in progress** in
the console) for a few minutes. Actions on your service (for example, deployment, configuration update, pause/resume, or deletion) are blocked during
this time. Try the action again a few minutes later, when the service status returns to `RUNNING`.

###### Note

If your action fails, it doesn't mean that your App Runner service is down. Your application is active and keeps handling requests. It's unlikely for
your service to experience any downtime.

In particular, App Runner migrates your service if it detects issues in the underlying hardware hosting the service. To prevent any service downtime,
App Runner deploys your service to a new set of instances and shifts traffic to them (a blue-green deployment). You might occasionally see a slight
temporary increase in charges.

## App Runner supported configurations

When you configure an App Runner service, you specify the virtual CPU and memory configuration to allocate to your service.
You pay based on the compute configuration that you select. For more information on pricing, see [AWS Resource Groups\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/pricing).

## App Runner resources

When you use App Runner, you create and manage a few types of resources in your AWS account. These resources are used to access your code and manage your
services.

The following table provides an overview of these resources:

**Resource name****Description**

Service

Represents a running version of your application. Much of the rest of this guide describes service types, management, configuration, and
monitoring.

ARN:
`arn:aws:apprunner:region:account-id:service/service-name[/service-id]`

Connection

Provides your App Runner services with access to private repositories stored with third-party providers. Exists as a separate resource for sharing
across multiple services. For more information about connections, see [Managing App Runner connections](manage-connections.md).

ARN:
`arn:aws:apprunner:region:account-id:connection/connection-name[/connection-id]`

AutoScalingConfiguration

Provides your App Runner services with settings that control the automatic scaling of your application. Exists as a separate resource for sharing
across multiple services. For more information about automatic scaling, see [Managing App Runner automatic scaling](manage-autoscaling.md).

ARN:
`arn:aws:apprunner:region:account-id:autoscalingconfiguration/config-name[/config-revision[/config-id]]`

ObservabilityConfiguration

Configures additional application observability features for your App Runner services. Exists as a separate resource for sharing across multiple
services. For more information about observability configuration, see [Configuring observability for your service](manage-configure-observability.md).

ARN:
`arn:aws:apprunner:region:account-id:observabilityconfiguration/config-name[/config-revision[/config-id]]`

VpcConnector

Configures VPC settings for your App Runner services. Exists as a separate resource for sharing across multiple services. For more information
about VPC functionality, see [Enabling VPC access for outgoing traffic](network-vpc.md).

ARN:
`arn:aws:apprunner:region:account-id:vpcconnector/connector-name[/connector-revision[/connector-id]]`

VpcIngressConnection

It's an AWS App Runner resource used to configure incoming traffic. It establishes a connection between a VPC interface endpoint and App Runner service,
to make your App Runner service accessible from only within an Amazon VPC. For more information about functionality of VPCIngressConnection, see [Enabling Private endpoint for incoming traffic](network-pl.md).

ARN:
`arn:aws:apprunner:region:account-id:vpcingressconnection/vpc-ingress-connection-name[/connector-id]]`
