# Infrastructure security in AWS App Runner

As a managed service, AWS App Runner is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper.

You use AWS published API calls to manage and operate App Runner through the network. Clients that call App Runner APIs must support Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or later. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic
Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes. These requirements do not apply to endpoints from App Runner applications.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the
[AWS Security Token Service](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/welcome.md) (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign
requests.

For other App Runner security topics, see [Security in App Runner](security.md).
