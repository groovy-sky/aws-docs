# Virtual services

###### Important

End of support notice: On September 30, 2026, AWS will discontinue support for AWS App Mesh. After September 30, 2026, you will no longer be able to access the AWS App Mesh console or AWS App Mesh resources. For more information, visit this blog post [Migrating from AWS App Mesh to Amazon ECS Service Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrating-from-aws-app-mesh-to-amazon-ecs-service-connect).

A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node
directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router. Dependent services call your virtual
service by its `virtualServiceName`, and those requests are routed to the virtual
node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual service.

## Creating a virtual service

AWS Management Console

###### To create a virtual service using the AWS Management Console

1. Open the App Mesh console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh).

2. Choose the mesh in which you want to create the virtual service.
    All of the meshes that you own and that have been [shared](sharing.md) with you are listed.

3. Choose **Virtual services** in the left
    navigation.

4. Choose **Create virtual service**.

5. For **Virtual service name**, choose a name for
    your virtual service. You can choose any name, but the service
    discovery name of the real service that you're targeting, such as
    `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`, is
    recommended to make it easier to correlate your virtual services to
    real services. This way you don't need to change your code to
    reference a different name than your code currently references. The
    name that you specify must resolve to a non-loopback IP address
    because the app container must be able to successfully resolve the
    name before the request is sent to the Envoy proxy. You can use any
    non-loopback IP address because neither the app or proxy containers
    communicate with this IP address. The proxy communicates with other
    virtual services through the names you’ve configured for them in App
    Mesh, not through IP addresses to which the names resolve.

6. For **Provider**, choose the provider type for
    your virtual service:

- If you want the virtual service to spread traffic across
multiple virtual nodes, select **Virtual**
**router** and then choose the virtual router to
use from the drop-down menu.

- If you want the virtual service to reach a virtual node
directly without a virtual router, select **Virtual**
**node** and then choose the virtual node to use
from the drop-down menu.

###### Note

App Mesh may automatically create a default Envoy route
retry policy for each virtual node provider that you
define on or after July 29, 2020,
even though you can't define such a policy through the
App Mesh API. For more information, see [Default route retry policy](envoy-defaults.md#default-retry-policy).

- If you don't want the virtual service to route traffic at
this time (for example, if your virtual nodes or virtual
router doesn't exist yet), choose **None**.
You can update the provider for this virtual service
later.

7. Choose **Create virtual service** to
    finish.

AWS CLI

**To create a virtual service using the**
**AWS CLI.**

Create a virtual service with a virtual node provider using the following
command and an input JSON file (replace the `red`
values with your own):

1. ```

aws appmesh create-virtual-service \
   --cli-input-json file://create-virtual-service-virtual-node.json
```

2. Contents of **example**
    create-virtual-service-virtual-node.json:

```

{
       "meshName": "meshName",
       "spec": {
           "provider": {
               "virtualNode": {
                   "virtualNodeName": "nodeName"
               }
           }
       },
       "virtualServiceName": "serviceA.svc.cluster.local"
}
```

3. Example output:

```nohighlight

{
       "virtualService": {
           "meshName": "meshName",
           "metadata": {
               "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:210987654321:mesh/meshName/virtualService/serviceA.svc.cluster.local",
               "createdAt": "2022-04-06T09:45:35.890000-05:00",
               "lastUpdatedAt": "2022-04-06T09:45:35.890000-05:00",
               "meshOwner": "123456789012",
               "resourceOwner": "210987654321",

               "version": 1
           },
           "spec": {
               "provider": {
                   "virtualNode": {
                       "virtualNodeName": "nodeName"
                   }
               }
           },
           "status": {
               "status": "ACTIVE"
           },
           "virtualServiceName": "serviceA.svc.cluster.local"
       }
}

```

## Deleting a virtual service

###### Note

You can't delete a virtual service that is referenced by a gateway route. You need
to delete the gateway route first.

AWS Management Console

###### To delete a virtual service using the AWS Management Console

1. Open the App Mesh console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh).

2. Choose the mesh from which you want to delete a virtual service.
    All of the meshes that you own and that have been [shared](sharing.md) with you are listed.

3. Choose **Virtual services** in the left
    navigation.

4. Choose the virtual service that you want to delete and click on
    **Delete** in the top right corner. You can
    only delete a virtual gateway where your account is listed as
    **Resource owner**.

5. In the confirmation box, type `delete` and
    then click on **Delete**.

AWS CLI

###### To delete a virtual service using the AWS CLI

1. Use the following command to delete your virtual service (replace the
    `red` values with your own):

```nohighlight

aws appmesh delete-virtual-service \
        --mesh-name meshName \
        --virtual-service-name serviceA.svc.cluster.local
```

2. Example output:

```nohighlight

{
       "virtualService": {
           "meshName": "meshName",
           "metadata": {
               "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:210987654321:mesh/meshName/virtualService/serviceA.svc.cluster.local",
               "createdAt": "2022-04-06T09:45:35.890000-05:00",
