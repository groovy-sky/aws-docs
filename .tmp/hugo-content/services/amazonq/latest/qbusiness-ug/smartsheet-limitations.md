# Known limitations for the Smartsheet connector

The Smartsheet connector has the following known limitations:

- If you remove users’ access to a Smartsheet data source but not to Amazon Q
Business, they will be able to receive responses from the data source when they
query Amazon Q Business.

- The Smartsheet connector will provide responses from the most
applicable single sheet. That is, it will search across all sheets and find the
sheet with the most relevant answer and provide that instead of aggregating data
across multiple sheets. For example, it can't answer questions like: "Show me
tasks that are past due across all my sheets."

- For hierarchical sheets, Amazon Q Business accuracy can drop when
queries are directly related to the hierarchical structure.

For example, if a sheet has hierarchical structure about high-level tasks and
its subtasks, and a user asks "What's the amount of time needed to finish all
tasks?" then Amazon Q Business might add up all times assigned to both
high-level tasks and the sub-tasks. This calculation is wrong as the amount of
time to finish the high-level task is just a sum up of the sub-tasks.

However, if the user asks a query such as "How many tasks are assigned to Mary
Major?", they would get an accurate response.

- For sheets with similar names—(for example, “Blockchain Integration -
Project Plan” and “Blockchain Integration - Impact Tracker”)—if a query
mentions just “Blockchain Integration” then you might not get an accurate
response. To get accurate responses, we recommend:

- providing clearer titles/descriptions of the sheets, or

- providing more detailed questions to reduce ambiguity.
