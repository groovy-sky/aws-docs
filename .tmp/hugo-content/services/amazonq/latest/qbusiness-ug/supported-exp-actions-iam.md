# Managing Amazon Q Business web experiences

To manage Amazon Q Business web experiences, you can take the following
actions:

###### Actions

- [Creating a web experience](#create-experience-iam)

- [Deleting a web experience](#delete-web-experience-iam)

- [Getting properties of a web experience](#describe-web-experience-iam)

- [Listing web experiences](#list-web-experiences-iam)

- [Updating a web experience](#update-web-experience-idp-iam)

## Creating a web experience

To create an Amazon Q Business web experience, you can use the console
or the [CreateWebExperience](../api-reference/api-createwebexperience.md) API operation.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

Console

If you use the console, this action is spread across two steps:
[Creating an Amazon Q Business application using Identity Federation through IAM](create-application-iam.md) and [Customizing web experience](customizing-web-experience-app.md). To
create a web experience, you must create an application environment.

AWS CLI

**To create an Amazon Q Business web**
**experience**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness create-web-experience \
--application-id application-id \
--sample-prompts-control-mode sample-prompts \
--subtitle subtitle \
--tags tags \
--title title \
--welcome-message welcome-message \

```

## Deleting a web experience

To delete an Amazon Q Business web experience, you can use the console
or the [DeleteWebExperience](../api-reference/api-deletewebexperience.md) API operation.

If you're using the API, you can delete a web experience without deleting the
application environment that it's a part of.

If you're using the console, the only way to delete your Amazon Q Business web experience is to delete the Amazon Q Business application environment that
it's attached to.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

Console

**To delete an Amazon Q Business web**
**experience**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business console.

2. In **Applications**, choose
    **Actions**.

3. Choose **Delete**.

4. In the dialog box that opens, type
    `Delete` to confirm deletion, and
    then choose **Delete**.

You are returned to the service console while your
    application environment is deleted. When the deletion process is
    complete, the console displays a message confirming
    successful deletion. Both the application environment and the web
    experience are deleted.
