# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Smartsheet

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

- **In Smartsheet, make sure you**
**have:**

- Access to the Smartsheet Event Reporting API. Use the [Events API Access Request](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5db2cf1b981f445cabaa22d9421cc19d) form to request access for your
organization.

- An Smartsheet system admin user or a licensed user for
Smartsheet who can generate an access token. With this access
token, your connector will have access to crawl all sheets and
workspaces created by or shared with this user.

- A Smartsheet access token. You need this to connect
Smartsheet to Amazon Q Business. For information on how to
generate this token in Smartsheet, see [Authentication and Access Tokens](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/) in the
_Smartsheet API Reference_.

- **In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Smartsheet authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [Data source connector configuration best practices](connector-best-practices.md).
