# Adding document metadata in Amazon S3

To customize chat results for your end users, you can add metadata or document attributes
to documents in an Amazon S3 bucket by using a metadata file. Metadata is additional
information about a document, such as its title and the date and time it was created. To
learn more about metadata in Amazon Q Business, see [Document\
attributes in Amazon Q Business](doc-attributes.md).

Amazon Q Business supports source attribution with citations. If you
specify the `_source_uri` metadata field when you add metadata to your
Amazon S3 bucket, the source attribution links returned by Amazon Q Business in the
chat results will direct users to the configured URL. If you don't specify a `_source_uri`,
users can still access the source documents through clickable citation links that will
download the file at query time. This allows users to verify information even when
no source URI is configured.

## Document metadata location

In Amazon S3, each metadata file can be associated with an indexed document. Your metadata
files must be stored in the same Amazon S3 bucket as your indexed files. You can
specify a location within the Amazon S3 bucket for your metadata files by using the
AWS Management Console. Or, you can use the `metadataFilesPrefix` field of the Amazon S3
`configuration` parameter using the JSON schema when you create an Amazon S3 data source using the [CreateDataSource](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md) API.

If you don't specify an Amazon S3 prefix, your metadata files must be stored
in the same location as your indexed documents. If you specify an Amazon S3
prefix for your metadata files, they must be in a directory structure parallel to your
indexed documents. Amazon Q looks only in the specified directory for your
metadata. If the metadata isn't read, check that the directory location matches the
location of your metadata.

The following examples show how the indexed document location maps to the metadata
file location. The document's Amazon S3 key is appended to the metadata's
Amazon S3 prefix and then suffixed with `.metadata.json` to form
the metadata file's Amazon S3 path.

###### Note

The combined Amazon S3 key, the metadata's Amazon S3 prefix, and
the `.metadata.json` suffix must be no more than a total of 1,024
characters. We recommend that your Amazon S3 key is less than 1,000
characters to account for additional characters when combining your key with the
prefix and suffix.

## Document metadata structure

You define your document metadata itself in a JSON file. The file must be a UTF-8 text
file without a BOM marker. The file name of the JSON file must be
`<document>.<extension>.metadata.json`.
In this example, `document` is the name of the document that
the metadata applies to and `extension` is the file extension
for the document. The document ID must be unique in
`<document>.<extension>.metadata.json`.

The content of the JSON file uses the following template:

```json

{
    "DocumentId": "document ID",
    "Attributes": {
        "_category": "document category",
        "_created_at": "ISO 8601 encoded string",
        "_last_updated_at": "ISO 8601 encoded string",
        "_source_uri": "document URI",
        "_version": "file version",
        "_view_count": number of times document has been viewed,
        "custom attribute key": "custom attribute value",
        additional custom attributes
    },
    "AccessControlList": [
         {
             "Name": "user name",
             "Type": "GROUP | USER",
             "Access": "ALLOW | DENY"
         }
    ],
    "Title": "document title",
    "ContentType": "PDF | HTML | MS_WORD | PLAIN_TEXT | PPT | RTF | XML | XSLT | MS_EXCEL | CSV | JSON | MD"
}
```

If you provide a Metadata path, make sure that directory structure inside the metadata
directory exactly matches the directory structure of data file.

For example, if the data file location is at
`s3://bucketName/documents/legal/file.txt`, the metadata file location should be at
`s3://bucketName/metadata/documents/legal/file.txt.metadata.json`.

All of the attributes and fields are optional, so it's not necessary to include all
attributes. However, you must provide a value for each attribute that you want to
include; the value can't be empty.

The `_created_at` and `_last_updated_at` metadata fields are ISO
8601 encoded dates. For example, 2012-03-25T12:30:10+01:00 is the ISO 8601 date-time
format for March 25, 2012, at 12:30PM (plus 10 seconds) in the Central European Time
time zone.

You can use the `AccessControlList` field to filter the response from a
query. This way, only certain users and groups have access to documents.
