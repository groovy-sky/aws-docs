# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q Business to Box

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

**In Box, make sure you have:**

- A Box Enterprise or Box Enterprise Plus
account.

- Created a Box custom app in the Box Developer Console and
configured it to use **Server Authentication (with JWT)**.

- Set your **App Access Level** to **App + Enterprise**
**Access** and allowed it to **Make API calls using the**
**as-user header**.

- Used the admin user to add the following **Application**
**Scopes** in your Box app:

- Write all files and folders stored in a Box

- Manage users

- Manage groups

- Manage enterprise properties

- Generated and downloaded Public/Private key pair including a client ID, a
client secret, a public key ID, private key ID, a pass phrase, and an enterprise
ID to use as authentication credentials. See [Public and private keypair](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/jwt-setup) for more details.

- Copied your Box enterprise ID either from your
Box Developer Console settings or from your Box
app. For example, `801234567`.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Box authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.
