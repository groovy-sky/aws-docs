# Connecting Amazon Q Business to Zendesk using the console

The following procedure outlines how to connect Amazon Q Business to
Zendesk using the AWS Management Console.

###### Connecting Amazon Q to Zendesk

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
    **sources**.

03. From the **Data sources** page, choose
     **Add data source**.

04. Then, on the **Add data sources** page, from
     **Data sources**, add the **Zendesk** data source to your Amazon Q application.

05. Then, on the **Zendesk** data source page, enter
     the following information:

06. **Name and description**, do the following:

- For **Data source name** – Name your data
source for easy tracking.

###### Note

You can include hyphens (-) but
not spaces. Maximum of 1,000 alphanumeric characters.

- **Description –**
**_optional_** – Add an optional
description for your data source. This text is viewed only by Amazon Q Business administrators and can be edited later.

07. **Source** – Enter your **Zendesk**
    **URL**. For example,
     `https://{sub-domain}.zendesk.com/`.

08. **Authorization** – Amazon Q Business crawls ACL information by default to ensure responses are generated only from
     documents your end users have access to. If supported for your connector, you can manage ACLs by selecting **Enable ACLs** to enable ACLs or **Disable ACLs** to disable them.
     To manage ACLs, you need specific IAM permissions. See [Grant permission to create data sources with ACLs disabled](setting-up.md#DisableAclOnDataSource) for more details.

     See [Authorization](connector-concepts.md#connector-authorization) for more details.

09. Authentication for existing Zendesk customers: Enter a name for your secret, a client
     ID, client secret, username, and password.

10. Authentication for new customers since 30 July 2024:
    1. Register the application with Zendesk and follow their procedure: [Using OAuth authentication with your application](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210-Using-OAuth-authentication-with-your-application)

    2. Set Client kind to Confidential.

    3. For Redirect URL Enter the URL that Zendesk should use to grant access to the
        application. The URLs must be absolute and not relative. You can use localhost:
        `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`.

    4. Implement an OAuth authorization flow:

1. Zendesk supports the authorization code grant flow to get access tokens.
    (Other grant flows have been deprecated.)

2. The flow doesn't use refresh tokens. The access token doesn't expire.

    5. To get an authorization code, register users on the Zendesk authorization page:
        `https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new`. Use the
        following parameters:

1. `response_type` \- Zendesk returns an authorization code in the
    response, so specify code as the response type. For example:
    response\_type=code.

2. `redirect_url` \- The URL, which can be local, that Zendesk should
    use to send the user's decision to grant access to your application. For example:
    `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`.

3. `client_id` \- The unique identifier obtained after registering the
    application with Zendesk.

4. `scope` \- A space-separated list of scopes that control access to
    the Zendesk resources.

    6. After this, Zendesk will ask for user approval. Once approved it will respond with
        an authorization code.

    7. Obtain an access token from Zendesk. Include the following parameters in the
        request:

1. `grant_type` \- Specify `authorization_code` as the
    value.

2. `code` \- Use the authorization code received from Zendesk after the
    user has been granted access.

3. `client_id` \- Use the unique identifier specified in an OAuth
    client in the Support admin interface Admin > Channels > API > OAuth
    Clients.

4. `client_secret` \- Use the secret specified in an OAuth client in
    the Support admin interface Admin > Channels > API > OAuth Clients).

5. `redirect_uri` \- The URL, which can be local, that Zendesk should
    use to send the user's decision to grant access to your application. For example:
    `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`.

6. `scope` – A space-separated list of scopes that control access to
    the Zendesk resources.

For example:

```nohighlight

curl https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com/oauth/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grant_type": "authorization_code", "code": "{your_code}",
    "client_id": "{your_client_id}", "client_secret": "{your_client_secret}",
    "redirect_uri": "{your_redirect_url}", "scope": "read" }' \
  -X POST
```

    8. Use the access token in API calls.
11. **Configure VPC and security group –**
    **_optional_** – Choose
     whether you want to use a VPC. If you do, enter the following
     information:

    1. **Subnets** – Select up to 6
        repository subnets that define the subnets and IP ranges
        the repository instance uses in the selected VPC.

    2. **VPC security groups** –
        Choose up to 10 security groups that allow access to
        your data source. Ensure that the security group allows
        incoming traffic from Amazon EC2 instances and
        devices outside your VPC. For databases, security group
        instances are required.

For more information, see [VPC](connector-concepts.md#connector-vpc).

12. **IAM role** – Choose
     an existing IAM role or create an IAM role to access your repository credentials and
     index content.

    ###### Note

    Creating a new service IAM role is recommended.

    For more information, see [IAM role](zendesk-connector.md#zendesk-iam).

13. **Sync scope** – Set the content that you want to sync.

14. For **Maximum file size** – Specify the file size limit in MBs
     that Amazon Q will crawl. Amazon Q will crawl only the files within the size limit you
     define. The default file size is 50MB. The maximum file size should be greater than 0MB
     and less than or equal to 50MB.

15. **Additional configuration – optional** – Configure the
     following settings:

- **Change log** – Select to update your index instead of
syncing all your files.

- **Organization name** – Enter the Zendesk
organization names to filter your sync.

- **Sync start date** – The date from which you want to
index your content.

- **Regex patterns** – Regular expression patterns to
include or exclude certain files. You can add up to 100 patterns.

16. **Advanced settings**

    **Document deletion safeguard** \- _optional_–To safeguard
     your documents from deletion during a sync job, select **On** and enter an integer between 0 - 100. If
     the percentage of documents to be deleted in your sync job exceeds the percentage you selected, the
     delete phase will be skipped and no documents from this data source will be deleted from your index. For more information, see
     [Document deletion safeguard](connector-concepts.md#document-deletion-safeguard).

17. In **Sync run schedule**, for
     **Frequency** – Choose how often
     Amazon Q will sync with your data
     source. For more details, see [Sync run schedule](connector-concepts.md#connector-sync-run). To learn how to start a data sync job,
     see [Starting data source connector sync jobs](supported-datasource-actions.md#start-datasource-sync-jobs).

18. **Tags - _optional_** –
     Add tags to search and filter your resources or track your AWS costs. See [Tags](tagging.md) for more details.

19. **Field mappings** – A list of data source document
     attributes to map to your index fields.

    ###### Note

    Add or update the fields from the **Data**
    **source details** page after you finish adding your data source.

    You can choose from two types of fields:

    1. **Default** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can't edit these.

    2. **Custom** – Automatically created by
        Amazon Q on your behalf based on common fields in your data source. You
        can edit these. You can also create and add new custom fields.

       ###### Note

       Support for adding custom fields varies by connector. You
       won't see the **Add field** option if your
       connector doesn't support adding custom fields.

For more information, see [Field mappings](connector-concepts.md#connector-field-mappings).

20. In **Data source details**, choose **Sync**
    **now** to allow Amazon Q to begin syncing (crawling and
     ingesting) data from your data source. When the sync job finishes, your data
     source is ready to use.

    ###### Note

    View CloudWatch logs for your data source sync job by selecting **View**
    **CloudWatch logs**. If you encounter a `Resource not found
                                exception` error, wait and try again as logs may not be available
    immediately.

    You can also view a detailed document-level report by selecting
    **View Report**. This report shows the status of each
    document during the crawl, sync, and index stages, including any errors. If
    the report is empty for an in-progress job, check back later as data is
    emitted to the report as events occur during the sync process.

    For more information, see [Troubleshooting data source\
    connectors](troubleshooting-data-sources.md#troubleshooting-data-sources-not-indexed).
