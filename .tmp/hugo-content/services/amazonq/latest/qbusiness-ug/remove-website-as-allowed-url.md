# Remove your website as an allowed URL

To remove a website(s) from list of allowed websites, you can use the Amazon Q Business console or the Amazon Q Business API.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon\
    Amazon Q Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/business).

2. Choose **Applications**, then select the name of your
    application from the list.

3. From the left navigation, choose **Amazon Q**
**embedded** under the **Enhancements**
    section.

4. On the main page, select the website that you want to remove and
    choose **Remove** and confirm your choice.

To remove the website from the list of allowed websites, you will need to use
the `get-web-experience` operation to get a list of all your allowed
website URLs `origins` and remove the website that you no longer want
to work with Amazon Q embedded and resubmit the rest of the URLs
using the `update-web-experience` operation. Otherwise, all your
other allowed websites will also be removed.

```nohighlight

 aws qbusiness get-web-experience \
  --application-id application-id \
  --web-experience-id web-experience-id \

aws qbusiness update-web-experience \
  --application-id application-id \
  --web-experience-id web-experience-id \
  --origins origins

```

###### Note

You will need to remove the `<iframe>` element from that website
as it will no longer work.
