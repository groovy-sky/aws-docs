# Admin controls and guardrails in Amazon Q Business

With Amazon Q Business, you can customize your application environment to your
organizational needs. Amazon Q Business offers application environment
_guardrails_ or _chat controls_ that you can
configure to control the end user chat experience.

Using the guardrails feature, you can define global controls and topic-level controls
for your application environment like the following:

- Control whether end users can upload files in chat to generate responses from
uploaded files.

- Control whether chat responses will be personalized to end users based on
information (address and job related information) associated with them in your
IAM Identity Center instance.

- Specify whether all Amazon Q Business chat responses will be generated
using only enterprise data or whether your application environment can also use its
underlying large language model (LLM) to generate responses when it can’t find
answers in your enterprise data.

- Allow Amazon Q Business to automatically orchestrate end user chat
requests across any Amazon Q Business plugins and data sources you’ve
configured.

- Allow Amazon Q Business to check its responses for
hallucinations.

- Control how Amazon Q Business responds to specific topics in
chat.

- Customize which users and groups Amazon Q Business topic-level controls
apply to.
