## Prerequisites for using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only authentication

**If you're using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only authentication, make sure**
**you've completed the following steps in SharePoint (Online):**

- Copied your SharePoint (Online) instance URLs. The format for the host URL
you enter is
`https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`
or `https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com`. Your URL
must start with `https` and contain
`sharepoint.com`.

- Copied the domain name of your SharePoint (Online) instance URL.

- Copied the tenant ID of your Microsoft SharePoint (Online) instance. For
details on how to find your tenant ID, see [Find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/find-your-office-365-tenant-id) on the Microsoft
website.

- Generated an X.509 certificate. For more information on how to create and
configure an X.509 certificate, see [Granting access via Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread) and [New-PnPAzureCertificate](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/New-PnPAzureCertificate.html) in _Microsoft_
_developer documentation_.

- After generating the X.509 certificate, upload your .CRT file (the public
certificate) to an Amazon S3 bucket. Note the file path to a X.509 certificate
you have created and stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. (Ex.
`s3://bucket-name/path/to/certificate.crt`). Ensure that your
Amazon Q Business IAM role has permissions to read from this
Amazon S3 bucket.

- Noted the private key and the Client ID you generated after
SharePoint (Online) Azure App registration.

- Configured a Sharepoint (Online) Azure App using one of the two options
below and noted its Client ID and Client secret.

###### Note

If you want to crawl specific sites, you can choose to restrict
permissions to specific sites rather than all sites available in the
domain. To do this, use the Sites.Selected (Application) permission.
With this API permission, you need to set access permission on every
site explicitly through the Microsoft Graph API. For more information,
see [Microsoft's blog on Sites.Selected permissions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/develop-applications-that-use-sites-selected-permissions-for-spo/ba-p/3790476).

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your SharePoint (Online) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [Data source connector configuration best practices](connector-best-practices.md).

_Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only Option 1: Global Read Access_

If you anticipate that you will be indexing several Sharepoint sites and would
like to simplify your setup process, you can take the following steps to provide the
Q Business Sharepoint connector global access. Otherwise, skip to section 2
below.

1. Create a Sharepoint client app to which we will assign the permissions
    needed by your Q Business connector. To register the app:
1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

      01. Provide the name for your application. In the example we
                 are using the name TargetApp. The Amazon Q Business
                 application uses TargetApp to connect to the SharePoint
                 Online site to crawl and index the data.

      02. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant
           name only - Single tenant).

      03. Choose "Register".

      04. Note down the application (client ID and the directory
           (tenant) on the Overview page, as you'll need them when
           prompted for "TargetApp-ClientId" and "TenantId".

      05. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation
           pane

      06. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application
           permissions" to allow the application to read data in your
           organization's directory regarding the signed-in
           user.

      07. Search "AllSites.Read".

      08. Choose "Add permissions".

      09. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph >
           Application permissions"

      10. Search and add the following permissions:

- "Notes.Read.All"

- "Sites.Read.All"

- "Sites.FullControl.All (Application)" (required only
if you intend to enable ACLs)

- "Sites.Read.All (Application)"(required only if
you intend to enable ACLs)

- "Sites.FullControl.All" (required only if you
intend to enable ACLs)

- "GroupMember.Read.All" (required only if you
intend to enable ACLs)

- "User.Read.All" (required only if you intend to
enable ACLs)

      11. Navigate to "Remove permission"

      12. Remove the original "User.Read - Delegated"
           permission

      13. Choose "Grant admin consent" for the default
           directory

      14. Save the client ID generated from this app for when you
           configure the Sharepoint connector in the Q Business console
           or API

          The following tables summarize all the permissions your
           application should have.

- If you're not using ACL, your application should
have the permission:

**Microsoft**
**Graph**

**Sharepoint**

Notes.Read.All (Application) – Read all
OneNote notebooks

AllSites.Read (Delegated) - Read items in
all site collections

Sites.Read.All (Application) - Read items in
all site collections

###### Note

Read.All and Sites.Read.All are required only if you
want to crawl OneNote Documents.

- If you're using ACL, your application should have
the following permissions:

Microsoft Graph

Sharepoint

GroupMember.Read.All (Application) –
Read all group memberships

AllSites.Read (Delegated) – Read
items in all site collections

Notes.Read.All (Application) – Read

2. Create a client secret for your Sharepoint App:
1. Within your client App navigate to "Clients and secrets > Client
       secrets"

2. Click on create a new secret.
3. Generate a new Certificate to be shared between Q Business SharePoint
    Connector and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App:
1. Use the example command below to generate your own x509
       certificate.

2. Run the following command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048
                                          -noenc -sha1 -keyout /tmp/private.key -out /tmp/sharepoint.crt
                                          -nodes -set_serial 1 -days 365 -subj
                                          "/CN=amazon/emailAddress=example@aws.com/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Dallas/O=amazon/OU=amazon`

3. Save the generated private key located in /tmp/private.key for
       later when you configure the Q Business Sharepoint connector via the
       Q Business console or API.

_Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App-Only Option 2: Read Access for only Selected_
_Sites_

If you anticipate that you will be indexing a manageable number of Sharepoint
sites and would prefer to limit the permissions of the Q Business connector to just
the Sharepoint sites you intend to index, you can take the following steps:

1. Create a Sharepoint client app: Create a Sharepoint client app to which we
    will assign the permissions needed by your Q Business connector. To register
    the app:
1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

2. Choose "New Registration":
      01. Provide the name for your application. In the example we
           are using the name TargetApp. The Amazon Q Business
           application uses TargetApp to connect to the SharePoint
           Online site to crawl and index the data.

      02. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant
           name only - Single tenant).

      03. Choose "Register".

      04. Note down the application (client ID and the directory
           (tenant) on the Overview page, as you'll need them when
           prompted for "TargetApp-ClientId" and "TenantId".

      05. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation
           pane

      06. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application
           permissions" to allow the application to read data in your
           organization's directory regarding the signed-in
           user.

      07. Search "Sites.Selected".

      08. Choose "Add permissions".

      09. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph >
           Application permissions"

      10. Search and add the following permissions:

- "Notes.Read.All"

- "Sites.Selected"

- "GroupMember.Read.All" (required only if you
intend to enable ACLs)

- "User.Read.All" (required only if you intend to
enable ACLs)

      11. Navigate to "Remove permission"

      12. Remove the original "User.Read - Delegated"
           permission

      13. Choose "Grant admin consent" for the default
           directory

      14. Save the client ID generated from this app for when you
           configure the Sharepoint connector in the Q Business console
           or API

          The following tables summarize all the permissions your
           application should have.

- If you're not using ACL, your application should
have the permissions:

**Microsoft**

sites
2. Create a client secret for your Sharepoint App:
1. Within your client App navigate to "Clients and secrets > Client
       secrets"

2. Click on create a new secret.
3. Generate a new Certificate to be shared between Q Business SharePoint
    Connector and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) App:
1. Run the following command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey
                                          rsa:2048 -noenc -sha1 -keyout /tmp/private.key -out
                                          /tmp/sharepoint.crt -nodes -set_serial 1 -days 365 -subj
                                          "/CN=amazon/emailAddress=example@aws.com/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Dallas/O=amazon/OU=amazon"`

2. Save the generated private key located in /tmp/private.key for
       later when you configure the Q Business Sharepoint connector via the
       Q Business console or API.

3. Upload the generated certificate located in /tmp/sharepoint.crt to
       an S3 bucket so you can use it later when you configure the Q
       Business Sharepoint connector via the Q Business console or API. You
       will also need this certificate for the next step.
4. Update your Sharepoint Client App’s Certificate:
1. Navigate to the Sharepoint client app you created in step 1.

2. Navigate to “Certificates and secrets > Certificates > Upload
       certificate” and upload the certificate (.crt file) you generated in
       step 4.
5. Create a Sharepoint admin app: This app will be used to provide the
    necessary site read permissions for the client OAuth App you created in the
    previous step. You can delete this admin app after you have completed all
    the steps. To register the app:
1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

2. Choose “New Registration”:
      01. Provide the name for your application.

      02. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant
           name only - Single tenant).

      03. Choose "Register".

      04. Locate your app ID, app secret, and tenant ID for your
           admin app and save them for the next step.

      05. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation
           pane

      06. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application
           permissions" to allow the application to read data in your
           organization's directory regarding the signed-in
           user.

      07. Search "Sites.FullControl.All".

      08. Choose "Add permissions".

      09. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph >
           Application permissions"

      10. Search "Sites.Read.All".

      11. Choose "Add permissions".
6. Generate an access token for your Sharepoint admin app: Now use the
    following code snippet to generate an access token for your app, but replace
    adminAppID, adminAppSecret, and tenantID with the values you saved from step
    2.
1. ```

      adminAppId=$1
      adminAppSecret=$2
      tenantId=$3

      tokenResponse=$(curl -s --location \
      "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
      --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
      --data-urlencode "client_id=$adminAppId" \
      --data-urlencode "client_secret=$adminAppSecret" \
      --data-urlencode "scope=offline_access https://graph.microsoft.com/.default")

      adminAppToken=$(echo $tokenResponse | jq -r '.access_token')
      echo $adminAppToken
      ```
7. Obtain a Site ID for each of your Sharepoint sites: Repeat the following
    steps for each of the Sharepoint sites you want your Q Business connector to
    crawl:
1. Visit
       `https://{yourcompany}.sharepoint.com/sites/{SiteName}` in
       a browser. Enter the appropriate login credentials if needed.
       Validate that you are able to see your SharePoint site

2. Now append /\_api/site/id at the end of {SiteName}. You should see
       a response something similar to below containing your site id
       (96a47524-4b21-446f-bf96-96d2f6fe4aa7)

      ```

      <d:Id m:type="Edm.Guid" xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices" xmlns:georss="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata">96a47524-4b21-446f-bf96-96d2f6fe4aa7</d:Id>
      ```
8. Grant your Sharepoint client app permissions to your selected sites: Now
    that you have created your Sharepoint admin app, Sharepoint client app, and
    have a list of site ids, you are ready to grant your client app the
    necessary permissions to access these sites. Repeat the following steps for
    each of the site ids you obtained from step 4.
1. Modify the code snippet below to provide the following:
      1. clientAppId: The Application (client) ID from step
          1.

      2. clientAppName: The display name of your Sharepoint client
          app from step 1.

      3. adminToken: The access token you generated in step
          6.

      4. siteId: One of the site ids you obtained from step
          7.
2. Run the following command:

      ```

      clientAppId=$1
      clientAppName=$2
      clientAppId=$1
      clientAppName=$2
      adminToken=$3
      siteToGivePermissionTo=$4

      grantPermissionResponse=$(curl -s --location "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/$siteToGivePermissionTo/permissions" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $adminToken" \
          --data '{
               "roles": ["fullcontrol"],
               "grantedToIdentities": [{
                  "application": {
                    "id": "'${clientAppId}'",
                    "displayName": "'${clientAppName}'"
                  }
                }]
              }')

      echo $grantPermissionResponse
      ```

3. If the command was successful, you'll see a response as
       follows:

      ```

      {
        "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#sites('awsplatodemo.sharepoint.com%2C96a47524-4b21-446f-bf96-96d2f6fe4aa7')/permissions/$entity",
        "id": "aTowaS50fG1zLnNwLmV4dHxjMDY5YjhlMi03NGFhLTQzZTQtODljYi1kNmZkMzU4ZmVjZThAZjIwNDQ2OTItZGMwOS00MjZlLWFlMGQtNGFlZDljMTI3ODA2",
        "roles": [
          "fullcontrol"
        ],
        "grantedToIdentitiesV2": [
          {
            "application": {
              "displayName": "demo-client-app",
              "id": "c069b8e2-74aa-43e4-89cb-d6fd358fece8"
            }
          }
        ],
        "grantedToIdentities": [
          {
            "application": {
              "displayName": "demo-client-app",
              "id": "c069b8e2-74aa-43e4-89cb-d6fd358fece8"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

## Prerequisites for using OAuth 2.0 authentication

**If you're using OAuth 2.0 authentication, make sure you've**
**completed the following steps in SharePoint (Online):**

- Copied your SharePoint (Online) instance URLs. The format for the host URL
you enter is
`https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`
or `https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com`. Your URL
must start with `https` and contain
`sharepoint.com`.

- Copied the domain name of your SharePoint (Online) instance URL.

- Copied the tenant ID of your Microsoft SharePoint (Online) instance. For
details on how to find your tenant ID, see [Find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/find-your-office-365-tenant-id) on the Microsoft
website.

- Noted the username and password that you use to connect to
SharePoint (Online).

- Noted the Client ID and Client secret generated after SharePoint (Online)
Azure App registration.

- Deactivate multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your SharePoint account,
so that Amazon Q is not blocked from crawling your SharePoint
content.

- Configured a Sharepoint (Online) Azure App using one of the two options
below and noted its Client ID and Client secret.

_OAuth2.0 Option 1: Global Read Access_

If you anticipate that you will be indexing several Sharepoint sites and would
like to simplify your setup process, you can take the following steps to provide the
Q Business Sharepoint connector global access. Otherwise, skip to section 2
below.

To register the app:

1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

2. Choose "New Registration":
01. Provide the name for your application. In the example we are using
        the name TargetApp. The Amazon Q Business application uses
        TargetApp to connect to the SharePoint Online site to crawl and
        index the data.

02. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant name
        only - Single tenant).

03. Choose "Register".

04. Note down the application (client ID and the directory (tenant) on
        the Overview page, as you'll need them when prompted for
        "TargetApp-ClientId" and "TenantId".

05. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation
        pane

06. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application
        permissions" to allow the application to read data in your
        organization's directory regarding the signed-in user.

07. Search "AllSites.Read".

08. Choose "Add permissions".

09. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application
        permissions"

10. Search and add the following permissions:

- "Notes.Read.All"

- "Sites.Read.All"

- "Sites.FullControl.All" (required only if you intend to
enable ACLs)

- "GroupMember.Read.All" (required only if you intend to
enable ACLs)

- "User.Read.All" (required only if you intend to enable
ACLs)

11. Navigate to "Remove permission".

12. Remove the original "User.Read - Delegated" permission.

13. Choose "Grant admin consent" for the default directory.

14. Save the client ID generated from this app for when you configure
        the Sharepoint connector in the Q Business console or API.

       The following tables summarize all the permissions your
        application should have.

- If you're not using ACL, your application should have the
permissions:

**Microsoft**
**Graph**

**Sharepoint**

Notes.Read.All (Application) – Read
all OneNote notebooks

AllSites.Read (Delegated) - Read
items in all site collections

Site.Read.All (Application) - Read
items in all site collections

###### Note

Note.Read.All and Sites.Read.All are required only if
you want to crawl OneNote Documents.

- If you're using ACL, your application should have the
following permissions:

**Microsoft**
**Graph**

**Sharepoint**

GroupMember.Read.All (Application) –
Read all group memberships

AllSites.Read (Delegated) – Read
items in all site collections

Notes.Read.All (Application) – Read
all OneNote notebooks

Sites.FullControl.All (Application) –
Have full control of all site
collections

Sites.Read.All (Application) – Read
items in all site collections

User.Read.All (Application) – Read
all users' full profiles

###### Note

GroupMember.Read.All and User.Read.All are required
only if Identity crawler is activated.
3. Create a client secret for your Sharepoint App:
1. Within your client App navigate to "Clients and secrets > Client
       secrets"

2. Click on create a new secret.

_OAuth2.0 Option 2: Read Access Only for Selected Sites_

For organizations planning to index a manageable number of Sharepoint sites with
limited permissions, the following steps provide the necessary setup:

1. Create a Sharepoint client app for OAuth: Now create a Sharepoint client
    OAuth app to which we will assign the permissions needed by your Q Business
    connector. To register the app:
1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

2. Choose "New Registration":

      01. Provide the name for your application. In the example we
           are using the name TargetApp. The Amazon Q Business
           application uses TargetApp to connect to the SharePoint
           Online site to crawl and index the data.

      02. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant
           name only - Single tenant).

      03. Choose "Register".

      04. Note down the application (client ID and the directory
           (tenant) on the Overview page, as you'll need them when
           prompted for "TargetApp-ClientId" and "TenantId".

      05. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation
           pane

      06. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application
           permissions" to allow the application to read data in your
           organization's directory regarding the signed-in
           user.

      07. Search "Sites.Selected".

      08. Choose "Add permissions".

      09. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph >
           Application permissions"

      10. Search and add the following permissions:

- "Notes.Read.All"

- "Sites.Selected"

- "GroupMember.Read.All" (required only if you
intend to enable ACLs)

- "User.Read.All" (required only if you intend to
enable ACLs)

      11. Navigate to "Remove permission"

      12. Remove the original "User.Read - Delegated"
           permission

      13. Choose "Grant admin consent" for the default
           directory

      14. Save the client ID generated from this app for when you
           configure the Sharepoint connector in the Q Business console
           or API

The following tables summarize all the permissions your
application should have.

- If you're not using ACL, your application should have the
permissions:

**Microsoft**
**Graph**

**Sharepoint**

Notes.Read.All (Application) – Read
all OneNote notebooks

Sites.Selected (Application) - Read
items in selected site collections

Sites.Selected (Application) - Read
items in selected site collections

###### Note

Note.Read.All and Sites.Read.All are required only if
you want to crawl OneNote Documents.

- If you're using ACL, your application should have the
following permissions:

Microsoft Graph

Sharepoint

GroupMember.Read.All (Application) –
Read all group memberships

AllSites.Read (Delegated) – Read
items in all site collections

Notes.Read.All (Application) – Read
all OneNote notebooks

Sites.FullControl.All (Application) –
Have full control of all site
collections

Sites.Read.All (Application) – Read
items in all site collections

User.Read.All (Application) – Read
all users' full profiles

###### Note

Note. GroupMember.Read.All and User.Read.All are
required only if Identity crawler is activated.
2. Create a client secret for your Sharepoint App:
1. Within your client App navigate to "Clients and secrets > Client
       secrets"

2. Click on create a new secret.
3. Create a Sharepoint admin app: This app will be used to provide the
    necessary site read permissions for the client OAuth App you created in the
    previous step. You can delete this admin app after you have completed all
    the steps. To register the app:
1. Log in to the Azure Portal with your Microsoft account.

2. Choose "New Registration":
      01. Provide the name for your application.

      02. Choose "Accounts" in the organizational directory. (Tenant
           name only - Single tenant).

      03. Choose "Register".

      04. Locate your app ID, app secret, and tenant ID for your
           admin app and save them for the next step.

      05. Navigate to "Manage > API Permissions" in the navigation
           pane

      06. Navigate to "Add a permission > Sharepoint > Application
           permissions" to allow the application to read data in your
           organization's directory regarding the signed-in
           user.

      07. Search "Sites.FullControl.All".

      08. Choose "Add permissions".

      09. Navigate to "Add a permission > Microsoft Graph >
           Application permissions"

      10. Search "Sites.Read.All".

      11. Choose "Add permissions".
4. Generate an access token for your Sharepoint admin app: Now use the
    following code snippet to generate an access token for your app, but replace
    adminAppID, adminAppSecret, and tenantID with the values you saved from step
    2.
1. ```

      adminAppId=$1
      adminAppSecret=$2
      tenantId=$3

      tokenResponse=$(curl -s --location \
      "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
      --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
      --data-urlencode "client_id=$adminAppId" \
      --data-urlencode "client_secret=$adminAppSecret" \
      --data-urlencode "scope=offline_access https://graph.microsoft.com/.default")

      adminAppToken=$(echo $tokenResponse | jq -r '.access_token')
      echo $adminAppToken
      ```
5. Obtain a Site ID for each of your Sharepoint sites: Repeat the following
    steps for each of the Sharepoint sites you want your Q Business connector to
    crawl:
1. Visit https://{yourcompany}.sharepoint.com/sites/{SiteName} in a
       browser. Enter the appropriate login credentials if needed. Validate
       that you are able to see your SharePoint site

2. Now append /\_api/site/id at the end of {SiteName}. You should see
       a response something similar to below containing your site id
       (\[IP\_ADDRESS\]a7)

      ```

      <d:Id m:type="Edm.Guid" xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices" xmlns:georss="http://www.georss.org/georss" xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata">[IP_ADDRESS]a7</d:Id>
      ```
6. Grant your Sharepoint client app permissions to your selected sites: Now
    that you have created your Sharepoint admin app, Sharepoint client app, and
    have a list of site ids, you are ready to grant your client app the
    necessary permissions to access these sites. Repeat the following steps for
    each of the site ids you obtained from step 4.
1. Modify the code snippet below to provide the following:
      1. clientAppId: The Application (client) ID from step
          1

      2. clientAppName: The display name of your Sharepoint client
          app from step 1

      3. adminToken: The adminAppToken you generated in step
          3

      4. siteId: One of the site ids you obtained from step
          4.
2. ```

      clientAppId=$1
      clientAppName=$2
      adminToken=$3
      siteToGivePermissionTo=$4

      grantPermissionResponse=$(curl -s --location "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/$siteToGivePermissionTo/permissions" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $adminToken" \
      --data '{
      "roles": ["fullcontrol"],
      "grantedToIdentities": [{
      "application": {
      "id": "'${clientAppId}'",
      "displayName": "'${clientAppName}'"
      }
      }]
      }')

      echo $grantPermissionResponse
      ```

3. If the command was successful, you'll see a response as
       follows:

      ```

      {
      "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#sites('awsplatodemo.sharepoint.com%2C[IP_ADDRESS]a7')/permissions/$entity",
      "id": "aTowaS50fG1zLnNwLmV4dHxjMDY5YjhlMi03NGFhLTQzZTQtODljYi1kNmZkMzU4ZmVjZThAZjIwNDQ2OTItZGMwOS00MjZlLWFlMGQtNGFlZDljMTI3ODA2",
      "roles": [
      "fullcontrol"
      ],
      "grantedToIdentitiesV2": [
      {
      "application": {
      "displayName": "demo-client-app",
      "id": "c069b8e2-74aa-43e4-89cb-d6fd358fece8"
      }
      }
      ],
      "grantedToIdentities": [
      {
      "application": {
      "displayName": "demo-client-app",
      "id": "c069b8e2-74aa-43e4-89cb-d6fd358fece8"
      }
      }
      ]
      }
      ```

## Prerequisites for using SharePoint App-Only authentication

**If you're using SharePoint App-Only authentication, make**
**sure you've completed the following steps in**
**SharePoint (Online):**

- Copied your SharePoint (Online) instance URLs. The format for the host URL
you enter is
`https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`
or `https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com`. Your URL
must start with `https` and contain
`sharepoint.com`.

- Copied the domain name of your SharePoint (Online) instance URL.

- Copied the tenant ID of your Microsoft SharePoint (Online) instance. For
details on how to find your tenant ID, see [Find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/find-your-office-365-tenant-id) on the Microsoft
website.

- Noted your SharePoint (Online) client ID and client secret generated while
granting permission to SharePoint App-Only, and your Client
ID and Client secret generated after SharePoint (Online) Azure App
registration.

- **If you're crawling OneNote documents and using**
**Identity crawler**, added the
following permissions:

**Microsoft**
**Graph**

- GroupMember.Read.All (Application) –
Read all group memberships

- Notes.Read.All (Application) – Read all
OneNote notebooks

- Sites.Read.All (Application) – Read
items in all site collections

- User.Read.All (Application) – Read all
users' full profiles

###### Note

No API permissions are required for crawling entities using
SharePoint (Online) **App-Only authentication**.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your SharePoint (Online) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.

For a list of things to consider while configuring your data source, see [Data source connector configuration best practices](connector-best-practices.md).

## Prerequisites for using basic authentication

**If you're using basic authentication, make sure you've**
**completed the following steps in SharePoint (Online):**

- Copied your SharePoint (Online) instance URLs. The format for the host URL
you enter is
`https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite`
or `https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com`. Your URL
must start with `https` and contain
`sharepoint.com`.

- Copied the domain name of your SharePoint (Online) instance URL.

- Noted your basic authentication credentials containing the username and
password that you use to connect to SharePoint (Online) Online.

- Deactivated **Security Defaults** in your Azure portal
using an administrative user. For more information on managing security
default settings in the Azure portal, see [Microsoft documentation on how to enable/disable security\
defaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/101179/how-to-disable-the-two-factor-authentication-from).

- Deactivated multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your SharePoint account,
so that Amazon Q is not blocked from crawling your SharePoint
content.

###### Note

No API permissions are required for crawling entities using **Basic**
**authentication**.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your SharePoint (Online) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.
