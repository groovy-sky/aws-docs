# Using global controls in Amazon Q Business

You can use Amazon Q Business global controls to configure settings that
apply to conversations in your application environment.

###### Note

You can't create or delete guardrail global controls. You can only update
existing global controls in your application environment.

The following are the global features that you can customize:

###### Global controls

- [Response settings](#guardrails-global-response)

- [Chat orchestration settings](#guardrails-global-orchestration)

- [Feature settings](#guardrails-global-feature)

- [Blocked phrases](#guardrails-global-blocked)

- [Customizing global controls](#guardrails-global-controls-customizing)

## Response settings

###### Important

If you're changing response settings for an Amazon Q Business
application environment created and deployed before 16 April, 2024, you need to update
your web experience service role. For information on service role
permissions needed, see [IAM role for an Amazon Q Business web\
experience](iam-roles.md#deploy-experience-iam-role). For information on how to update your web experience
service role, see [Updating a web experience](supported-exp-actions.md#update-web-experience).

###### Note

Displaying sample prompts to your end user using the Amazon Q Business
[Quick prompts](quick-prompts.md) feature might not work if you
choose to restrict response generation to enterprise data.

When you update your application environment guardrails, you can use **Response**
**settings** to change this behavior in the following ways:

- **Allow end users to send queries directly to the**
**LLM** – Give end users the option to either generate
LLM-only responses or only generate responses from connected data
sources. If you choose to activate this option, end users will be able
to toggle between generating responses from either the data sources you
have connected to your application environment or use only the LLM to generate
responses.

If you choose to activate this feature for your end users, they will
see the option to turn **All data sources off** or
**Respond from approved sources** in their web
experience. If you turn this feature off, then this option won't be
available—or displayed—to end users in a web
experience.

###### Note

As of Oct 31, 2024, once you have created a new Amazon Q Business application environment, this setting will be
_enabled by default_, even if the Admin has
not yet connected any enterprise data sources.

For existing application environments, this setting will _remain as_
_previously configured_.

- **Allow Amazon Q Business to fall back to**
**LLM knowledge** – Allow Amazon Q Business to
use its LLM knowledge to generate responses when it can’t find responses
from your connected data sources. If you choose to activate this mode,
and haven't given your end users the option to choose how responses are
generated, your application environment will default to producing responses using
the LLM when it can't find information in your data sources.

- **Personalize responses** – Allow
Amazon Q Business to customize chat responses to end users
using metadata associated with them—specifically address and job
related information—in your IAM Identity Center instance.

You must have already added this information in IAM Identity Center for response
personalization to work as intended. For more information on how to
configure your IAM Identity Center instance for personalization see [Personalizing chat responses](personalizing-chat-responses.md).

- **Enable hallucination mitigation** – Allow
Amazon Q Business to check the chat responses it generates for
[hallucinations](concepts-terms.md#hallucination). If a hallucination is
detected with high confidence, Amazon Q Business corrects the
inconsistencies in its response real-time during chat and generates a
new, edited message.

The hallucination mitigation feature is only available for retrieval
augmented generation (RAG) responses from data connected to the
application—either through connected data sources, or files
uploaded during chat (up to 100,000 characters).

Hallucination mitigation isn't supported for the following use
cases:

- Applications where [chat orchestration](guardrails-global-controls.md#guardrails-global-orchestration) is
enabled.

- [Plugin](plugins.md) workflows.

- Responses generated from tabular data, or from transcripts of
images, audio and video. Hallucination mitigation applies only
to responses generated from textual data.

###### Important

Activating hallucination mitigation will increase chat response
latency.

Global controls apply to all supported conversation interactions, except when
it conflicts with a specific topic-level control. In that case, a topic-level
control takes precedence.

## Chat orchestration settings

You can use **Chat orchestration settings** to automatically
manage chat requests across configured plugins and data sources in your Amazon Q Business application. If you activate chat orchestration, Amazon Q Business automatically routes chat requests to [plugins](plugins.md), integrating enterprise data and relevant actions within a
single chat response. Users get direct responses without manual plugin
selection.

###### Note

Chat orchestration is optimized to work for English language content. For
more details on language support in Amazon Q Business, see [Supported languages](supported-languages.md). Additionally, the
[hallucination mitigation](hallucination-reduction.md) feature won't work if chat
orchestration controls are enabled for your application.

The following are the key features of chat orchestration:

- **Unified response integration** –
Lets Amazon Q Business combine its [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\
workflow](concepts-terms.md#retrieval-augmented-generation) with plugin actions. This allows Amazon Q Business to provide comprehensive answers in natural language
during conversations. For example, Amazon Q Business can explain
paid time-off (PTO) policy from company data and create a time-off
request at the same time.

- **Intelligent action detection** –
Allows Amazon Q Business to automatically identify read-only chat
requests (like checking ticket counts) and write actions (like creating
a ticket) and present forms for user validation.

- **Smart plugin management** –
Allows Amazon Q Business to automatically select appropriate
plugins without manual user selection while managing multiple complex
plugin interactions.

- **User driven experience** –
Enables Amazon Q Business to ask for user clarification when
multiple actions are possible, validating actions before taking them,
and guiding the user through the information needed to perform an
action.

If you deactivate chat orchestration, Amazon Q Business won't relay
queries across data sources and plugins. Users must manually select to use
plugin mode to invoke a plugin action from chat.

If you're using an [Quick plugin](quicksight-plugin.md) (fully-integrated with
Amazon Q Business and not available for manual selection by users
during chat), activating chat orchestration affects its behavior. With chat
orchestration enabled, an Quick plugin only activates if:

- No other plugin actions (read or write requests requiring additional
end user input through forms) are detected, or, in progress.

- No end user authentication requests are pending.

## Feature settings

You can control whether end users can upload files during chat to ask
questions based on the uploaded document. By default, your application environment allows
your end users to directly upload files in chat.

You can also choose whether to allow end users in a web experience to create
and use Amazon Q Apps. Amazon Q Apps relies on LLM knowledge to work.

## Blocked phrases

You can define blocked phrases for your application environment. Amazon Q Business
ensures that chat responses don't include these words. You can choose up to 20
words.

Additionally, you can optionally configure a custom message to be displayed to
your end users in response to any mention of blocked phrases during chat. You
can use this message to inform them that word is blocked and provide them with
further guidance on next steps.

By default, your application environment doesn't define any blocked words. You can
choose to add these words when you edit and update your global control
guardrails.

## Customizing global controls

When you create an Amazon Q Business application environment, it's assigned the
following default global controls:

- An option to generate responses from either enterprise data or
LLMs.

- Response personalization is activated.

- Automatic orchestration of end user chat requests across any Amazon Q Business plugins and data sources you’ve configured.

- File upload by end user during chat is activated.

- Q Apps creation is activated.

- Hallucination mitigation is deactivated. To turn hallucination
mitigation on, you must first deactivate chat orchestration.

To update global topic controls for your web experience chat, you can use the
AWS Management Console or the [UpdateChatControlsConfiguration](../api-reference/api-updatechatcontrolsconfiguration.md)
API operation. The following tabs provide a procedure for the console and code
examples for the AWS CLI.

###### Note

You can't create or delete guardrail global controls. You can only update
existing global controls in your application environment.

Console

**To update a global control**
**guardrail**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business console.

2. In **Applications**, select the name of
    your application environment from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose
    **Enhancements**, and then choose
    **Guardrails**.

4. In **Guardrails**, from **Global**
**controls**, choose
    **Edit**.

5. In **Application guardrails**, do the
    following:

- For **Response settings** do the
following:

- **Allow end users to send queries directly**
**to the LLM** – If you choose to
activate this option, end users will be able to
toggle between generating responses from either
the data sources you have connected to your
application environment or use only the LLM to generate
responses.

###### Note

If you choose to enable this option, your
end users will have the option to generate
LLM-only responses even if you don't allow Amazon Q to user LLM knowledge to generate
responses.

For more information, see [Using global controls in\
Amazon Q Business](guardrails-global-controls.md).

- **Allow Amazon Q Business to fall**
**back to LLM knowledge** – Choose
this option if you want to generate responses from
your application environment's LLM world knowledge when it
can't find information in your connected data
sources. The default is to restrict responses to
enterprise data. For more information, see [Using global controls in\
Amazon Q Business](guardrails-global-controls.md).

- **Personalize**
**responses** – Allow Amazon Q Business to customize chat responses to end
users using metadata associated with
them—specifically address and job related
information—in your IAM Identity Center instance.

###### Note

You must have already added this information
in IAM Identity Center for response personalization to work as
intended. For more information on how to configure
your IAM Identity Center instance for personalization see [Personalizing chat\
responses](personalizing-chat-responses.md).

- **Enable hallucination**
**mitigation** – Allow Amazon Q Business to check the chat responses it
generates for [hallucinations](concepts-terms.md#hallucination). If a
hallucination is detected with high confidence,
Amazon Q Business corrects the
inconsistencies in its response real-time during
chat and generates a new, edited message.

###### Note

You must deactivate **Chat**
**orchestration settings** before you can
activate hallucination mitigation.

6. For **Chat orchestration settings**,
    activate to automatically manage chat requests across
    configured plugins and data sources in your Amazon Q Business application. If you activate chat
    orchestration, Amazon Q Business automatically routes
    chat requests to [plugins](plugins.md), integrating
    enterprise data and relevant actions within a single chat
    response. Users get direct responses without manual plugin
    selection.

###### Note

You must deactivate **Enable hallucination**
**mitigation** before you can activate chat
orchestration.

7. For **Feature settings**, choose whether
    your end users will be allowed to upload files directly in
    chat to ask questions based on file content and whether
    Amazon Q Apps will be enabled for your application environment.

8. - For **Blocked words** –
      Define blocked words for the application environment. The
      application environment will not respond to questions that
      contain these words or mention them in any
      responses.

- For **Messaging shown for blocked**
**words** – Choose to create a
custom response for your end users informing them of
blocked word usage and any next steps to
take.

9. Choose **Save**.
