**In Microsoft Exchange, make sure you**
**have:**

- Copied your Microsoft 365 tenant ID. You can find your tenant ID in the
**Properties** of your Azure Active Directory Portal or in the Microsoft Entra Admin portal. For
more information, see [Find your Microsoft 365 tenant ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/find-your-office-365-tenant-id) on the Microsoft website.

- Configured an OAuth 2.0 credential token containing a client ID and client
secret.

- Added the following permissions for the connector application:

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- Stored your Microsoft Exchange authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.
