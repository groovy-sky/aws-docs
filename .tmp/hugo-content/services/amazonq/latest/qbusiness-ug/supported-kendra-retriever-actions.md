## Detaching an Amazon Kendra index

To detach an Amazon Kendra index, you can use the console or the [DeleteRetriever](../api-reference/api-deleteretriever.md) API
operation.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

```

## Updating an Amazon Kendra index

To update an Amazon Kendra index, you can use the Amazon Q Business console or
the Amazon Kendra [UpdateIndex](../../../../reference/kendra/latest/apireference/api-updateindex.md) API
operation.

###### Note

You can't update an Amazon Kendra Developer edition index. You can only update an
Amazon Kendra Enterprise Edition index or Amazon Kendra GenAI Enterprise Edition
index.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

Console

**To update an Amazon Kendra**
**index**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business console.

2. In **Applications**, select the name of
    your application from the list of applications.

3. From the left navigation menu, choose **Data**
**sources**.

4. In the **Data sources** page, from
    **Index**, select
    **Edit**.

5. In **Edit index**, choose between the
    following values to update"

- **Storage capacity** –
Update your storage capacity to a value between 1-50
units. Each unit contains 20,000 documents. Index
capacity must be more than the data stored in your
index. If you need to, delete data and re-sync your
data sources before adjusting capacity.

- **Query capacity** –
Update your query capacity between 1-100 units. Each
unit is 0.1 queries per second (QPS), or about 8000
queries per day.

6. Select **Update** to save your
    changes.

AWS CLI

**To update an Amazon Kendra**
**index**

```nohighlight

aws kendra update-index \
--id index-id \
--capacity-units '{"QueryCapacityUnits": 2, "StorageCapacityUnits": 1}'

```

## Deleting an Amazon Kendra index

To detach an Amazon Kendra index, you can use the Amazon Kendra console or the Amazon Kendra [DeleteIndex](../../../../reference/kendra/latest/apireference/api-deleteindex.md) API operation.

Deleting an index removes the index and all associated data sources and
document data. Deleting an index doesn't remove the original documents from your
storage.

Deleting an index is an asynchronous operation. When you start deleting an
index, the index status changes to `DELETING`. It remains in the
`DELETING` state until all of the information related to the
index is removed. Once the index is deleted, it no longer appears in the results
of a call to the Amazon Kendra [ListIndices](../../../../reference/kendra/latest/apireference/api-listindices.md)
API. If you call the Amazon Kendra [DescribeIndex](../../../../reference/kendra/latest/apireference/api-describeindex.md) API with the deleted index's identifier, you receive
and `ResourceNotFound` exception.

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

Console

**To delete an Amazon Kendra**
**index**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Kendra console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/kendra/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kendra).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Indexes**, and then choose the index
    to delete.

3. Choose **Delete** to delete the selected
    index.

the AWS CLI for the second scenario.
