# Add a data accessor (ISV) to connect to your Amazon Q index

After setting up your application environment and connecting your data source(s), Amazon Q Business
begins indexing your enterprise data. You still need to add the software providers
(ISVs) as a data accessor and provide configuration details to the ISV to retrieve
content from your Amazon Q index. By adding a data accessor, you grant their AWS account
to access the Amazon Q index via the `SearchRelevantContent` API
operation.

You can grant data accessor permissions to your Amazon Q index using either the
Amazon Q Business console or the Amazon Q Business API. The following procedures show how to do this
using the Amazon Q Business console or the AWS CLI.

###### Important

You must provide the setup details generated when adding your ISV as a data
accessor to your ISV so they can access your Amazon Q index. You can find
this information at any time in the **Information for data**
**accessor** tab in the **data accessor details** page
which is accessed by choosing the accessor **Name** from the
**Data accessors** table on the **Data**
**accessors** page.

The following tabs provide the instructions for how to retrieve your `Tenant
                ID` for each ISV. In data accessors, the `External Id` is the same
as `Tenant Id`.

## Add a data accessor using the console

Prerequisite for both Auth code and TTI configurations.

`tenantID`

The `tenantID` is a unique identifier for your application tenant. Each
application might have different terms for a tenant such as Workspace ID for Slack
or Domain ID for Asana. You can review the [Prerequisites](isv-prerequisites.md)
page to see how to retrieve the `TenantId` for your application.

01. Sign in to the Amazon Q Business console.

02. Choose **Applications**, then select the name of your
     application environment from the list.

03. From the left navigation, choose **Data**
    **accessors**.

04. Choose the authentication method, **Auth Code** or
     **Trusted Token Issuer (TTI)** from the list of
     options.

05. Choose from the list of approved and supported data accessors
     (ISVs).

06. Choose a **Name** for this data accessor's instance, for
     example `<your
                                application-name>-<accessor-name>`.

    If you chose TTI, follow these steps to configure the
     authentication:

1. Enter your **External Id (same as Tenant Id)**,
    **Trust Token Issuer name**, **Identity**
**provider attribute**, and **IAM Identity Center**
**attribute**.

2. Select, **Create trusted token issuer**.

07. Choose **Data source access** between **Allow**
    **all** or **Allow specific data sources**
     depending on whether you want to provide the ISV access to all or certain
     data sources from your Amazon Q index.

08. Choose the end **User access**. These are the end users
     that will connect with and use the Amazon Q index data from within the ISV's
     application. You can choose between all users that have access to the
     Amazon Q Business application environment or a subset of users and groups that you can
     define.

09. Choose **Add data accessor** to confirm your choices and
     add the data accessor.

    ###### Note

    You must provide the setup details generated when adding your ISV as a
    data accessor to your ISV so they can access your Amazon Q
    index. You can find this information at any time in the
    **Information for data accessor** tab in the
    **data accessor details** page which is accessed by
    choosing the accessor **Name** from the **Data**
    **accessors** table on the **Data**
    **accessors** page.

10. The data accessor you have added will now appear as an entry in the table
     on the main **Data accessors** page.

## Adding a data accessor using the AWS CLI

In order to add an ISV as a data accessor you will need to call 3 APIs. First, the
`CreateDataAccessor` API operation will create a data accessor and
associate your application ID. `AssociatePolicy` operation API to attach
the resource based policy for cross account API calls. Finally, you will set your
user assignment for the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Data Center
(IDC) application environment with `PutApplicationAssignment` API. For granular
user access control, use the Amazon Q Business console.

Prerequisite for both Auth code and TTI configurations.

`tenantID`

The `tenantID` is a unique identifier for your application tenant. Each
application might have different terms for a tenant such as Workspace ID for Slack
or Domain ID for Asana. You can review the [Prerequisites](isv-prerequisites.md)
page to see how to retrieve the `TenantId` for your application.

- `action` — Only
`qbusiness:SearchRelevantContent` is supported now

- `filterConfiguration`: Specifies the data source id of the
Amazon Q application environment. The ISV will only have access to the data from the
specified data source id. If there is no data source id specified, the
ISV will have access to all the data sources.

```json

# CreateDataAccessor actionConfigurations example
[
   {
        "action": "qbusiness:SearchRelevantContent",
        "filterConfiguration": {
        "documentAttributeFilter": {
          "equalsTo": {
            "name": "_data_source_id",
            "value": {
              "stringValue": "your_datasource_id"
            }
          }
        }
      }
   }
]

```

### CLI example

The following CLI example shows how to create a data accessor and associate
the necessary permissions with all end users enabled for this data
accessor:

```bash

aws qbusiness create-data-accessor \
 --application-id ${qbusiness_application_id} \
 --principal ${isv_data_accessor_role_arn} \
 --action-configurations  ${action_configuration} \
 --display-name ${qbusiness_data_accessor_name} \
 --authentication-detail ${authentication_detail}

aws qbusiness associate-permission \
 --application-id ${qbusiness_application_id} \
 --statement-id ${statement_id} \
 --actions ${actions} \
 --principal ${isv_data_accessor_role_arn} \
 --conditions ${conditions}

aws sso-admin put-application-assignment-configuration \
 --application-arn ${qbusiness_data_accessor_idc_application_arn}\
 --no-assignment-required\
 --region ${idc_region}

```

The following CLI example shows how to add authentication details in your
request:

```bash

# For tti based dataaccessor
"authenticationDetail": {
    "authenticationType": "AWS_IAM_IDC_TTI",
    "authenticationConfiguration": {
        "idcTrustedTokenIssuerConfiguration": {
            "idcTrustedTokenIssuerArn": "${IDC trusted token issuer created using ISV issuer URL}"
        }
    },
    "externalIds": [
        "${ISV tenantId}"
    ]
}

# For Authcode based dataaccessor
"authenticationDetail": {
    "authenticationType": "AWS_IAM_IDC_AUTH_CODE",
    "externalIds": [
        "${ISV tenantId}"
    ]
}

```
