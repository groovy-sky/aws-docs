# Connecting Gmail to Amazon Q Business

With Amazon Q Business, you can connect your Gmail enterprise email
system to unlock valuable organizational knowledge stored in email communications. When you
connect Gmail to Amazon Q Business, your users can search and get
answers from email content and conversations directly through the Amazon Q web
experience.

You can connect your Gmail instance to Amazon Q Business using either the AWS Management Console or the [CreateDataSource](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md) API. This connection enables your organization to leverage email-based knowledge for improved decision-making and faster information discovery.
