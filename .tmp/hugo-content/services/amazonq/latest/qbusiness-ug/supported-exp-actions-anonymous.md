# Managing Amazon Q Business web experiences for anonymous access

To manage Amazon Q Business web experiences for anonymous access, you can
take the following actions:

###### Actions

- [Share an anonymous web experience](#create-experience-anonymous-url)

- [Deleting a web experience](#delete-web-experience-anonymous)

- [Getting properties of a web experience](#describe-web-experience-anonymous)

- [Listing web experiences](#list-web-experiences-anonymous)

- [Updating a web experience](#update-web-experience-anonymous)

## Share an anonymous web experience

If you created a web experience when you created your application, you can
preview that Amazon Q Business web experience for anonymous access, using
the console or the [CreateAnonymousWebExperienceUrl](../api-reference/api-createanonymouswebexperienceurl.md) API
operation.

###### Note

- The preview URL for the web experience is for one-time use only
and has to be regenerated every time. This URL must be accessed
within 5 minutes of creation. Once accessed, the session remains
active for the configured duration. To use the web experience in
your applications, you must use the [Amazon Q embedded](embed-amazon-q-business.md)
feature and call the [CreateAnonymousWebExperienceUrl](../api-reference/api-createanonymouswebexperienceurl.md) API
operation whenever you need a new application session or after one
hour whichever comes first.

- All anonymous web experience URLs generated are able to process
billable chat requests until the sessions expire. For more
information, see [Amazon Q Business pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/q/business/pricing).

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

Console

1. After [Creating an anonymous access\
    application environment](create-anonymous-application.md#create-anonymous-app) in the
    console with a web experience, you can navigate to your
    anonymous application.

2. In the **Web experience settings**
    section in the console, you can **Preview web**
**experience** to view the web experience.

3. Alternatively, you can choose to **Share the web**
**experience URL** to share the web experience.
    To do this, you can choose the duration your
    **Testing link is valid for** and
    choose **Create URL**. The URL will be
    automatically copied to your clipboard.

**anonymous web experience url**

After [Creating an anonymous access\
application environment](create-anonymous-application.md#create-anonymous-app) with a web
experience, you can do the following.

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness create-anonymous-web-experience-url \
--application-id <your-application-id> \
--web-experience-id <web-experience-id>
--session-duration-in-minutes<x-minutes >

```

## Deleting a web experience

To delete an Amazon Q Business web experience, you can use the console
or the [DeleteWebExperience](../api-reference/api-deletewebexperience.md) API operation.

If you're using the API, you can delete a web experience without deleting the
application environment that it's a part of.

If you're using the console, the only way to delete your Amazon Q Business web experience is to delete the Amazon Q Business application environment that
it's attached to.

###### Note

Even after deleting the web experience all URLs connected to this web
experience continue to process billable chat requests until their sessions
expire. For more information, see [Share an anonymous web experience](#create-experience-anonymous-url).

The following tabs provide a procedure for the AWS Management Console and code examples for
the AWS CLI.

4. In the dialog box that opens, type
    `Delete` to confirm deletion, and
    then choose **Delete**.

You are returned to the service console while your
    application environment is deleted. When the deletion process is
    complete, the console displays a message confirming
    successful deletion. Both the application environment and the web
    experience are deleted.
