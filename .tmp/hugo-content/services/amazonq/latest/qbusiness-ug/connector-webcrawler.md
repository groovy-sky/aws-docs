# Connecting Web Crawler to Amazon Q Business

An Amazon Q Business Web Crawler connector crawls and indexes either public facing
websites or internal company websites that use HTTPS. With Amazon Q web crawler,
you can create a generative AI web experience for your end users based on the website data
you crawl using either the AWS Management Console or the [`CreateDataSource`](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md) API.

###### Note

Amazon Q Web Crawler supports only HTTPS enabled sites. It doesn't
support HTTP or self-signed certificate enabled websites.

###### Important

When selecting websites to index, you must adhere to the [Amazon Acceptable Use Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/aup) and all other
Amazon terms. Remember that you must only use Amazon Q Web Crawler to index
your own webpages, or webpages that you have authorization to index. To learn how to
stop Amazon Q Web Crawler from indexing your websites, see [Configuring a robots.txt file for Amazon Q Business Web Crawler](stop-web-crawler.md).

If you receive an error when crawling a website, it could be that the website is blocked
from crawling. To crawl internal websites, you can set up a web proxy. The web proxy must be
public facing. You can also use authentication to access and crawl websites.

###### Note

Amazon Q Web Crawler connector does _not_ support
AWS KMS encrypted Amazon S3 buckets. It supports only server-side
encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys.
