# Prerequisites for connecting Amazon Q to Confluence (Server/Data Center)

Before you begin, make sure that you have completed the following
prerequisites.

**In Confluence Server/Data Center, make sure you**
**have:**

- Copied your Confluence instance URL. For example:
`https://example.confluence.com`. You need your
Confluence instance URL to connect to Amazon Q.

- Configured basic authentication credentials containing a username (username
used to log into Confluence) and password (Confluence Server/Data Center password) to
allow Amazon Q to connect to your Confluence Server/Data Center
instance.

- **Optional:** Configured OAuth 2.0 credentials
containing a Confluence app key, Confluence app secret, Confluence access token, and Confluence
refresh token to allow Amazon Q to connect to your Confluence instance.
If your access token expires, you can either use the refresh token to regenerate
your access token and refresh token pair, or you can repeat the authorization
process.

- **Optional:** Configured a Personal Access Token
(PAT) containing a Confluence token to allow Amazon Q to connect to your
Confluence Server/Data Center instance. For information about how to create a PAT
token, see [Using Personal Access Tokens](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html) on the Atlassian
website.

**In your AWS account, make sure you have:**

- Created a Amazon Q Business application.

- Created a [Amazon Q Business retriever and added an index](select-retriever.md).

- Created an [IAM role](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds) for your data source and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the IAM role.

- If you want to have Amazon Q automatically rotate your secret,
ensure that your IAM role includes the
`secretsmanager:PutSecretValue` and
`secretsmanager:UpdateSecret` permissions.

- Stored your Confluence (Server/Data Center) authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager
secret and, if using the Amazon Q API, noted the ARN of the
secret.

###### Note

If you’re a console user, you can create the IAM role and Secrets Manager
secret as part of configuring your Amazon Q application on the
console.
