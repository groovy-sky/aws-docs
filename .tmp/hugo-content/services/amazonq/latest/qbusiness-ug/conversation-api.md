# Chat and conversation management for an Amazon Q Business application using APIs

Chatting in an Amazon Q Business web experience preview and a deployed Amazon Q Business web experience uses the following API operations.

###### Important

Amazon Q Business Chat and ChatSync APIs are intended to be activated by end
user interactions, not programmatic access. To protect availability, requests
exceeding normal user patterns may be throttled. If throttling occurs, first wait
and retry later as it is often temporary. However, if throttling persists—or
if you believe the throttling is in error—contact AWS Support for
troubleshooting assistance.

## Setting up a streaming Amazon Q Business chat using APIs

Amazon Q Business provides a streaming [Chat](../api-reference/api-chat.md) API that you can use to deliver chat responses to your end users
as a continuing series of partial results. When you use the streaming API, chat
responses are transmitted using sequential data packets.

You can configure streaming for your Amazon Q Business application environment in two
ways: using WebSockets directly, or using an AWS SDK. The information in this
section can be used to for both methods.

If you use WebSockets to configure streaming, a secure WebSockets connection is
created to a [supported Amazon Q Business endpoint](quotas-regions.md#regions). An example endpoint
may look like this:
`wss://qbusiness-websocket.us-west-2.api.aws:443/chat`.

###### Important

We strongly recommend using SDKs to configure streaming instead of using
WebSockets directly. SDKs are the simplest and most reliable method for chat
streams. To start streaming using an AWS SDK, see [Chat](../api-reference/api-chat.md) in the Amazon Q Business API Reference.

###### Note

The `qbusiness.<region>.api.aws:8443` has been deprecated in
favor of qbusiness-websocket. Use the
`qbusiness-websocket.<region>.api.aws:443` endpoint.
Although the `qbusiness.<region>.api.aws:8443` endpoint will
continue to work it, we recommend using—or migrating to—the new
endpoint.

### Setting up a WebSocket stream

The key components for a [WebSocket\
protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) for streaming requests with Amazon Q Business
are:

- The upgrade request. This contains the query parameters for your
request, and a signature that Amazon Q Business uses as a seed
signature.

- One or more messages in event stream encoding that contain metadata
and chat bytes.

The following section outlines the steps to set up your WebSocket
stream.

1. Attach the following policy to the IAM role that makes the request.
    See [Adding IAM policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-attach-detach.md#add-policy-api) for more
    information.
JSON

```json

{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "MyQBusinessWebsocketPolicy",
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Action": "qbusiness:Chat",
                   "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
}

```

2. To start the session, create a presigned URL in the following format.
    Line breaks have been added for readability.

```nohighlight

GET wss://qbusiness-websocket.us-west-2.api.aws:443/chat?
&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
&X-Amz-Credential=access-key%2FYYYYMMDD%2Fus-west-2%2Fqbusiness-websocket%2Faws4_request
&X-Amz-Date=YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ
&X-Amz-Expires=300
&X-Amz-Security-Token=security-token
&X-Amz-Signature=string
&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host
&chat-input={"applicationId":"application_id","userId":"test_user@amazon.com","userGroups":null,"clientToken":str(uuid.uuid4())}
```

###### Note

The maximum value for `X-Amz-Expires` is 300 seconds (5
minutes).

Additional operations and parameters are listed in the [API Reference](../api-reference/welcome.md); parameters common to all AWS
    API operations are listed in the [Common\
    Parameters](../api-reference/commonparameters.md) section.

To construct the URL for your request and create the [Signature\
    Version 4 signature](../../../../general/latest/gr/signing-aws-api-requests.md), refer to the following steps. Examples
    are in pseudocode.
1. Create a canonical request. A canonical request is a string
       that includes information from your request in a standardized
       format. This ensures that when AWS receives the
       request, it can calculate the same signature you created for
       your URL. For more information, see [Create a Canonical Request for Signature Version\
       4](../../../../general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-canonical-request.md).

      ```http

      # HTTP verb
      method = "GET"
      # Service name
      service = "qbusiness"
      # Region
      region = "us-west-2"
      # Amazon Q Business streaming endpoint
      endpoint = "wss://qbusiness-websocket.us-west-2.api.aws:443"
      # Host
      host = "qbusiness-websocket.us-west-2.api.aws"
      # Date and time of request
      amz-date = YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ
      # Date without time for credential scope
      datestamp = YYYYMMDD
      ```

2. Create a canonical URI, which is the part of the URI between
       the domain and the query string.

      ```nohighlight

      canonical_uri = "/chat"
      ```

3. Create the canonical headers and signed headers. Note the
       trailing `\n` in the canonical headers.

- Append the lowercase header name followed by a colon (
: ).

- Append a comma-separated list of values for that
header. Do not sort values in headers that have multiple
values.

- Append a new line ( `\n`).

```nohighlight

canonical_headers = "host:" + host + "\n"
signed_headers = "host"
```

4. Match the algorithm to the hashing algorithm. Use
       `SHA-256`.

      ```nohighlight

      algorithm = "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256"
      ```

5. Create the credential scope, which scopes the derived key to
       the date, AWS Region, and service. For example,
       `20240415/us-west-2/qbusiness/aws4_request`.

      ```nohighlight

      credential_scope = datestamp + "/" + region + "/" + service + "/" + "aws4_request"
      ```

6. Create the canonical query string. Query string values must be
       URI-encoded and sorted by name.

- Sort the parameter names by character code point in
ascending order. Parameters with duplicate names should
be sorted by value. For example, a parameter name that
begins with the uppercase letter F precedes a parameter
name that begins with the lowercase letter b.

- Do not URI-encode any of the unreserved characters
that RFC 3986 defines: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, hyphen ( - ),
underscore ( \_ ), period ( . ), and tilde ( ~ ).

- Percent-encode all other characters with %XY, where X
and Y are hexadecimal characters (0-9 and uppercase
A-F). For example, the space character must be encoded
as %20 (don't include '+', as some encoding schemes do);
extended UTF-8 characters must be in the form
%XY%ZA%BC.

- Double-encode any equals ( = ) characters in parameter
values.

```nohighlight

canonical_querystring  = "X-Amz-Algorithm=" + algorithm
canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Credential="+ access key + "%2F" + credential_scope
canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Date=" + amz_date
canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Expires=300"
canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Security-Token=" + URI-Encode(token, 'UTF-8', safe='')
canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=" + signed_headers
chat_input_string = {
    "applicationId": "application_id",
    "userId": "testuser@amazon.com",
    "userGroups": None,
    "clientToken": str(uuid.uuid4()),
    "conversationId": None,
    "parentMessageId": None
}
canonical_querystring += "&" + "chat-input" + "=" + URI-Encode(json.dumps(chat_input_string), 'UTF-8')
```

7. Create a hash of the payload. For a `GET` request,
       the payload is an empty string.

      ```nohighlight

      payload_hash = HashSHA256(("").Encode("utf-8")).Digest()
      ```

8. Combine the following elements to create the canonical
       request.

      ```nohighlight

      canonical_request = method + '\n'
         + canonical_uri + '\n'
         + canonical_querystring + '\n'
         + canonical_headers + '\n'
         + signed_headers + '\n'
         + payload_hash

       string_to_sign =  algorithm + '\n'
         + amz_date + '\n'
         + new_credential_scope + '\n'
         + hashed_canonical_request
      ```
3. Create the string to sign, which contains meta information about your
    request. You use the string to sign in the next step when you calculate
    the request signature. For more information, see [Create a\
    String to Sign for Signature Version 4](../../../../general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-string-to-sign.md).

```nohighlight

hashed_canonical_request = HashSHA256(canonical_request.Encode("utf-8")).HexDigest()
new_credential_scope = datestamp + '/' + region + '/qbusiness/aws4_request'
string_to_sign=algorithm + "\n"
      + amz_date + "\n"
      + new_credential_scope + "\n"
      + HashSHA256(canonical_request.Encode("utf-8")).HexDigest()
```

4. Calculate the signature. To do this, derive a signing key from your
    AWS secret access key. For a greater degree of
    protection, the derived key is specific to the date, service, and
    AWS Region. Use this derived key to sign the request.
    For more information, see [Calculate the\
    Signature for AWS Signature Version 4](../../../../general/latest/gr/sigv4-calculate-signature.md).

Make sure you implement the `GetSignatureKey` function to
    derive your signing key. If you have not yet derived a signing key,
    refer to [Examples of how\
    to derive a signing key for Signature Version 4](../../../../general/latest/gr/signature-v4-examples.md).

```nohighlight

#Create the signing key
signing_key = GetSignatureKey(secret_key, datestamp, region, service)

# Sign the string_to_sign using the signing key
signature = HMAC.new(signing_key, (string_to_sign).Encode("utf-8"), Sha256()).HexDigest
```

The function `HMAC(key, data)` represents an HMAC-SHA256
    function that returns results in binary format.

5. Add signing information to the request and create the request
    URL.

After you calculate the signature, add it to the query string. For
    more information, see [Add the\
    Signature to the Request](../../../../general/latest/gr/sigv4-add-signature-to-request.md).

First, add the authentication information to the query string.

```nohighlight

canonical_querystring += "&X-Amz-Signature=" + signature
```

Second, create the URL for the request.

```nohighlight

request_url = endpoint + canonical_uri + "?" + canonical_querystring
```

Use the request URL with your WebSocket library to make the request to
    Amazon Q Business.

6. The request to Amazon Q Business must include the following
    headers. Typically these headers are managed by your WebSocket client
    library.

```nohighlight

Host: qbusiness-websocketus-west-2.amazonaws.com
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Origin: URI-of-WebSocket-client
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Sec-WebSocket-Key: randomly-generated-string <calculated at runtime>
```

7. When Amazon Q Business receives your WebSocket request, it
    responds with a WebSocket upgrade response. Typically your WebSocket
    library manages this response and sets up a socket for communications
    with Amazon Q Business.

The following is the response from Amazon Q Business. Line
    breaks have been added for readability.

```http

HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake

&X-Amz-Signature=Signature Version 4 signature
x-amzn-RequestId: RequestId
sec-websocket-accept: hash-of-the-Sec-WebSocket-Key-header
```

8. Make your WebSocket streaming request.

After the WebSocket connection is established, the client can start
    sending a sequence of chat frames, each encoded using event stream
    encoding.

Each data frame contains three headers combined with a chunk of raw
    text bytes; the following table describes these headers.

Header name byte lengthHeader name (string)Header value typeValue string byte lengthValue string (UTF-8)13:content-type724application/json11:event-type710textEvent13:message-type75event

9. To end the data stream, send an end of input event in an event stream
    encoded message.

Header name byte lengthHeader name (string)Header value typeValue string byte lengthValue string (UTF-8)13:content-type716application/json11:event-type715endOfInputEvent13:message-type75event

When you decode the binary response, you end up with a JSON structure
    containing the chat output.

### Handling WebSocket streaming errors

If an exception occurs while processing your request, Amazon Q Business
responds with a terminal WebSocket frame containing an event stream encoded
response. This response contains the headers described in the following table;
the body of the response contains a descriptive error message.

Header name byte lengthHeader name (string)Header value typeValue string byte lengthValue string (UTF-8)13:content-type716application/json15:exception-type7variesvaries, see below13:message-type79exception

The `exception-type` header contains one of the following
values:

- `BadRequestException`: There was a
client error when the stream was created, or an error occurred while
streaming data. Make sure that your client is ready to accept data and
try your request again.

- `InternalFailureException`: Amazon Q Business had a problem during the handshake with the client.
Try your request again.

Amazon Q Business can also return any of the common service errors. For
a list, see [Common\
Errors](../api-reference/commonerrors.md).

### Event stream encoding

Amazon Q Business uses a format called event stream encoding for
streaming chat.

Event stream encoding provides bidirectional communication between a client
and a server. Chats sent to the Amazon Q Business service are encoded in
this format. The response from Amazon Q Business also uses this
encoding.

Each message consists of two sections: the prelude and the data. The prelude
consists of:

1. The total byte length of the message

2. The combined byte length of all headers

The data section consists of:

1. Headers

2. Payload

Each section ends with a 4-byte big-endian integer cyclic redundancy check
(CRC) checksum. The message CRC checksum is for both the prelude section and the
data section. Amazon Q Business uses CRC32 (often referred to as GZIP
CRC32) to calculate both CRCs. For more information about CRC32, see [_GZIP file format_\
_specification version 4.3_](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt).

Total message overhead, including the prelude and both checksums, is 16
bytes.

The following diagram shows the components that make up a message and a
header. There are multiple headers per message.

![A schematic of the components of a message and a header for a streaming transcription.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/images/frame-diagram-frame-overview.png)

Each message contains the following components:

- **Prelude**: Consists of two, 4-byte fields, for a
fixed total of 8 bytes.

- _First 4 bytes_: The big-endian integer
byte-length of the entire message, inclusive of this 4-byte
length field.

- _Second 4 bytes_: The big-endian integer
byte-length of the 'headers' portion of the message, excluding
the 'headers' length field itself.

- **Prelude CRC**: The 4-byte CRC checksum for the
prelude portion of the message, excluding the CRC itself. The prelude
has a separate CRC from the message CRC. That ensures that Amazon Q Business can detect corrupted byte-length information
immediately without causing errors, such as buffer overruns.

- **Headers**: Metadata annotating the message; for
example, message type and content type. Messages have multiple headers,
which are key:value pairs, where the key is a UTF-8 string. Headers can
appear in any order in the 'headers' portion of the message, and each
header can appear only once.

- **Payload**: The streaming chat content to be
transcribed.

- **Message CRC**: The 4-byte CRC checksum from the
start of the message to the start of the checksum. That is, everything
in the message except the CRC itself.

The header frame is the authorization frame for the streaming chat. Amazon Q Business uses the authorization header's value as the seed for
generating a chain of authorization headers for the data frames in the
request.

Each header contains the following components; there are multiple headers per
frame.

- **Header name byte-length**: The byte-length of the
header name.

- **Header name**: The name of the header that
indicates the header type. For valid values, see the following frame
descriptions.

- **Header value type**: A number indicating the header
value. The following list shows the possible values for the header and
what they indicate.

- `0` – TRUE

- `1` – FALSE

- `2` – BYTE

- `3` – SHORT

- `4` – INTEGER

- `5` – LONG

- `6` – BYTE ARRAY

- `7` – STRING

- `8` – TIMESTAMP

- `9` – UUID

- **Value string byte length**: The byte length of the
header value string.

- **Header value**: The value of the header string.
Valid values for this field depend on the type of header.

### Data frames

Each streaming request contains one or more data frames. There are two steps
to creating a data frame:

1. Combine raw `ChatInput` data with metadata to create the
    payload of your request.

2. Combine the payload with a signature to form the event message that is
    sent to Amazon Q Business.
