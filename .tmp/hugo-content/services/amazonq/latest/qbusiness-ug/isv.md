# Amazon Q index for independent software vendors (ISVs)

As an ISV, you can leverage Amazon Q index to access and integrate your
customers' enterprise data into your applications. This integration enables you to enhance
your applications with generative AI capabilities powered by your customers' data, without
having to directly connect to or index individual data sources. Your customers simply need
to add you as a data accessor and provide you with the configuration details, allowing you
to retrieve relevant content through the `SearchRelevantContent` API operation.

Alternatively, you can create a Amazon Q application environment on behalf of the
customer and add their data sources yourself. The Amazon Q index will then be
able to retrieve the relevant content through the `SearchRelevantContent` API
operation. For more information, see [Creating an\
Amazon Q index on behalf of a customer](isv-creating-index.md).

## Accessing a customer's Amazon Q index as a data accessor using cross-account access

After Amazon Q Business customers give an independent software provider or vendor's (ISV)
_data accessor_ permissions to retrieve data from their Amazon Q
index, the customer or the ISV must connect with one another to get the following
configuration details. These configuration parameters are required inputs when they use
the `SearchRelevantContent` API operation to perform cross-account access to
relevant data from the customer's Amazon Q index. These parameters are accessed from the
customer's Amazon Q console in the **Information for data**
**accessor** tab in the **data accessor details** page which
is accessed by choosing the accessor **Name** from the **Data**
**accessors** table on the **Data accessors** page of their
application environment.

1. Amazon Q Business application ID — This is unique identifier of the Amazon Q Business
    application environment. It tells the ISV what Amazon Q application environment is associated with the
    Amazon Q index.

2. The Amazon Q Business application Region — This is the AWS Region where the
    Amazon Q Business application environment is created.

3. Amazon Q Business retriever ID — This is unique identifier for the retriever. The
    retriever gets the data from the Amazon Q index configured by the Amazon Q
    customer.

4. Data accessor application ARN — This is the ISV Amazon Resource Name (ARN). It
    is used to identify the ISV when it is accessing a customer's Amazon Q
    index.

5. The Region for the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center (IDC)
    instance — This is the AWS Region where the IDC instance of the customer has
    been created.

With these parameters, the ISV can begin retrieving content from the Amazon Q index by
calling the `SearchRelevantContent` API operation. The
`SearchRelevantContent` API operation follows Amazon Q Business access control
standards by only retrieving data that the customer's end users have been given access
to.

### Retrieving data from a customer's Amazon Q index as a data accessor using the SearchRelevantContent API

With valid configuration parameters from the customer, the ISV can use the
`SearchRelevantContent` API operation to retrieve user-specific
content from the customer's Amazon Q index.

The following are examples of how to use either Auth Code or Trusted Token Issuer
based authentication (TTI) to complete this task:

The following tabs provide a procedure to boost document attributes using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.

Auth code

Use the Authentication code method to retrieve user-specific content
from the customer's Amazon Q index.

1. The Amazon Q index customer's end user will login to the ISV's
    application using the existing user login flow.

###### Note

The ISV doesn't need to change their existing login
flow.

2. After the end user successfully logs in, the ISV instructs the
    user to authenticate to their Amazon Q index through their OIDC
    providers. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Q Business application using AWS\
    IAM Identity Center](create-application.md).

1. `https://oidc.${idc_region}.amazonaws.com/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=${isv_redirect_url}&state={oauth_state}&client_id=${idc_application_arn}`

2. `isv_redirect_uri` — This is the
    _redirect URL_ that's registered
    at the ISV registration process. For more information,
    see [Information to be provided to the Amazon Q Business\
    team](isv-info-to-provide.md).

3. `oauth_state` — This random string prevents
    cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. For more
    detail about state parameters in oauth, see [Prevent Attacks and Redirect Users with OAuth 2.0\
    State Parameters](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/state-parameters) in the auth by Okta
    guide.

4. `idc_application_arn` — This is the
    Amazon Q Business DataAccessor IAM Identity Center application ID that's
    provided by the customer to the ISV.

3. The end user logs in using the method configured by the
    customer's Amazon Q administrator. For example, the user's company
    SSO.

4. The ISV application receives an _auth code_
    in their _redirect URL_.

5. The ISV application calls the `CreateTokenWithIAM`
    API operation to get a token with an authorization code. The ISV
    needs to use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that they created
    during the onboarding process with `tenantId`
    information in the tags like the following:

```bash

aws sts assume-role \
         --role-arn ${your_iam_role} \
         --role-session-name test-session \
         --tags Key=qbusiness-dataaccessor:ExternalId,Value=${isv tenantId}

aws sso-oidc create-token-with-iam --client-id "${idc_application_arn}" \
         --redirect-uri "{your_redirect_uri}" \
         --grant-type "authorization_code" \
         --code "${CODE}" --region ${idc_region}

```

6. Get
    the `idToken` field from the
    response of `CreateTokenWithIAM`. Then, decode the
    `idToken` and extract
    `"sts:identity_context"` field from it.

Using command line:

```

export ID_TOKEN_I = "${response_json_of_create-token-with-iam}"
export ID_CONTEXT=`jq -R 'split(".") | .[1] | @base64d | fromjson' <<< "$ID_TOKEN_I" | jq -r '."sts:identity_context"'`
echo "ID_CONTEXT=$ID_CONTEXT\n"
```

Using Python:

```python

import json
import base64

body = "${response_json_of_create-token-with-iam}"
body_json = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(body.split(".")[1] + '==')
data = json.loads(body_json)
print(f"{data['sts:identity_context']}")

```

7. Call the [AssumeRole](../../../../reference/sts/latest/apireference/api-assumerole.md) API with the extracted
    `sts:identity_context` and the ISV
    `tenantId` information.

```bash

aws sts assume-role \
         --role-arn ${your_iam_role} \
         --role-session-name test-session \
         --provided-contexts '[{"ProviderArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/IdentityCenter", "ContextAssertion": "${value from sts:identity_context}"}]' \
         --tags Key=qbusiness-dataaccessor:ExternalId,Value=${isv tenantId}

```

8. Use the AWS Sig V4 credentials returned from the previous
    step to call `SearchRelevantContent` API.

```bash

aws qbusiness search-relevant-content \
         --application-id ${qbusiness_application_id} \
         --query-text "What is Amazon Q?" \
         --content-source '{"retriever": {"retrieverId": "${retriever_id}"}}'

```

TTI

Use the Trusted Token Issuer based authentication (TTI) method to
retrieve user-specific content from the customer's Amazon Q index.

1. The Amazon Q index customer's end user will log in to the ISV's
    application using the existing user login flow.

2. After the end user successfully logs in, ISV issues a token
    for the end user using the OIDC client as audience, provided
    during the onboarding process.

3. The ISV application calls the `CreateTokenWithIAM`
    API operation with the token from step 2. The ISV needs to use
    the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that they
    created during the onboarding process with `tenantId`
    information in the tags like the following:

```

aws sts assume-role \
         --role-arn ${your_iam_role} \
         --role-session-name test-session \
         --tags Key=qbusiness-dataaccessor:ExternalId,Value=${isv tenantId}

aws sso-oidc create-token-with-iam --client-id "${idc_application_arn}" \
         --grant-type "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer" \
         --assertion "${isv token generated using oidc client provided during onboarding}" --region ${idc_region}

```

4. Retrieve the `idToken` field from the response of
    `CreateTokenWithIAM`. Then, decode the
    `idToken` and extract
    `sts:identity_context` field from it.

1. Using command line:

```

export ID_TOKEN_I = "${response_json_of_create-token-with-iam}"
export ID_CONTEXT=`jq -R 'split(".") | .[1] | @base64d | fromjson' <<< "$ID_TOKEN_I" | jq -r '."sts:identity_context"'`
echo "ID_CONTEXT=$ID_CONTEXT\n"

```

2. Using Python:

```

                                               import json
import base64

body = "${response_json_of_create-token-with-iam}"
body_json = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(body.split(".")[1] + '==')
data = json.loads(body_json)
print(f"{data['sts:identity_context']}")

```

5. Call the `AssumeRole` API with the extracted
    `sts:identity_context` and the ISV
    `tenantId` information.

```

aws sts assume-role \
         --role-arn ${your_iam_role} \
         --role-session-name test-session \
         --provided-contexts '[{"ProviderArn": "arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/IdentityCenter", "ContextAssertion": "${value from sts:identity_context}"}]' \
         --tags Key=qbusiness-dataaccessor:ExternalId,Value=${isv tenantId}

```

    Use the AWS Sig V4 credentials returned from the previous
    step to call `SearchRelevantContent` API.

```

aws qbusiness search-relevant-content \
         --application-id ${qbusiness_application_id} \
         --query-text "What is Amazon Q?" \
         --content-source '{"retriever": {"retrieverId": "${retriever_id}"}}'

```
