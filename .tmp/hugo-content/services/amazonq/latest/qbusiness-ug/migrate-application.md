# Migrating an Amazon Q Business direct SAML 2.0 application to IAM Identity Center

###### Important

This content applies only to Amazon Q Business applications that need to migrate
from using legacy SAML identity management to using IAM Identity Center for user access
management.

To migrate an Amazon Q Business application connected directly to an external
identity provider (IdP) to IAM Identity Center for user access management, follow the steps in this
section.

If your existing external IdP application is connected to a [supported\
Amazon Q Business data source connector](connectors-list.md) that already has access
control (ACL) and identity crawling enabled, it's ready to migrate to IAM Identity Center. If your
existing external IdP application is connected to a [supported\
Amazon Q Business data source connector](connectors-list.md) that doesn't already have ACL
or identity crawling enabled, you need to first enable these before you can begin migrating
your application to IAM Identity Center. You do this by [updating your application](supported-app-actions.md#update-app).

If you've not used IAM Identity Center before, Amazon Q Business will give you the option to
create an IAM Identity Center instance from the Amazon Q Business console as part of the migration
path. However, we recommend configuring an IAM Identity Center instance before migrating your existing
SAML 2.0 compliant application to IAM Identity Center, especially if you're planning to connect your IAM Identity Center
to an Active Directory or external identity provider. If you're managing users and groups in
one identity source, changing to a different identity source might remove all user and group
assignments.

For important information on creating an IAM Identity Center instance for your Amazon Q Business
application, see [Configuring an IAM Identity Center instance](idc-setup.md).

The following tabs provide a procedure for migrating an existing, legacy SAML 2.0 based
Amazon Q Business application to IAM Identity Center using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI.

## Migrating an application

The following tabs provide a procedure for migrating your application on the AWS Management Console
and code examples for the AWS CLI.

Console

**To migrate an Amazon Q Business**
**application**

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q Business
     console.

02. In **Applications**, select the name of your SAML
     2.0 integrated application from the list of applications.

03. In **Advanced IAM Identity Center settings**, activate
     **Enable cross-region calls** to access
     resources to allow Amazon Q Business to connect to an IAM Identity Center
     instance that exists in a region not already supported by Amazon Q Business. For more information, see [Creating a cross-region IAM Identity Center\
     integration](idc-setup.md#cross-region-idc).

04. Then, depending on your Amazon Q Business application
     configuration you will see one of the following:
    1. If the **Connect to IAM Identity Center** banner on the
        top of the page asks you to activate your ACL and identity
        crawling in preparation for migrating your application, you
        will need to activate ACL and identity crawling for the data
        sources connected to your application before migrating your
        application to IAM Identity Center. To do this, [update your application](supported-datasource-actions.md#update-datasources).
        Then, move to the next step.

    2. If the **Connect to IAM Identity Center** banner on the
        top of the page displays a **Connect to**
       **IAM Identity Center** option, it means ACL and identity
        crawling are already enabled for your application and it's
        ready to migrate to IAM Identity Center. You can move to the next
        step.
05. From the **Connect to IAM Identity Center** banner on the top
     of the page, select **Connect to IAM Identity Center**.

06. In **Connect Amazon Q Business to IAM Identity Center**,
     you will see the following options based on whether you have an
     IAM Identity Center instance already configured, or need to create one.

1. If you don't have an IAM Identity Center instance configured, you see
    the following:

- The region your Amazon Q Business
application is in. This is so you can make sure that
the region for your Amazon Q Business
application and IAM Identity Center instance match.

- **Specify tags for IAM Identity Center**
– Add tags to keep track of your IAM Identity Center
instance.

- **Create IAM Identity Center** – Select
to create a minimally-configured IAM Identity Center instance. The
console will display an ARN for your newly created
resource after it's created.

2. If you have _both_ an IAM Identity Center
    organization instance and an account instance configured,
    your instances will be auto-detected, and you see the
    following options:

- **[Connect to organization\**
**instance of IAM Identity Center](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/organization-instances-identity-center.md)** –
Select this option to manage access to Amazon Q Business by assigning users and groups from
the Identity Center directory for your
organization.

- **[Connect to account instance\**
**of IAM Identity Center](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/organization-instances-identity-center.md)** – Select this
option to manage access to Amazon Q Business
by assigning existing users and groups from your
Identity Center directory.

- The region your Amazon Q Business
application is in. This is so you can make sure that
the region for your Amazon Q Business
application and IAM Identity Center instance match.

- **IAM Identity Center** – The ARN for
your IAM Identity Center instance.

3. If you have an IAM Identity Center account instance configured, your
    account instance will be auto-detected and you will see the
    following:

- The region your Amazon Q Business
application is in. This is so you can make sure that
the region for your Amazon Q Business
application and IAM Identity Center instance match.

- **IAM Identity Center** – The ARN for
your IAM Identity Center instance.

4. If you have an IAM Identity Center organization instance configured, you
    will see a message asking you to tell your admin to give you
    access to IAM Identity Center. You will need access to IAM Identity Center before you
    can proceed.

###### Note

If you plan to connect your IAM Identity Center to an Active Directory or
external identity provider we recommend canceling this setup and
configuring IAM Identity Center from the IAM Identity Center console. If you're managing
users and groups in one identity source, changing to a different
identity source might remove all user and group
assignments.

07. From the application summary page, select **Groups and**
    **users**, and add users.

    ###### Note

    If you plan to add groups to your application create these
    groups in IAM Identity Center before you create your application. If you don't
    have already configured IAM Identity Center groups, Amazon Q Business
    will redirect you to the IAM Identity Center console to configure groups
    before you can add them to your applicaton.

08. Then, from the application summary page, select **Migrate**
    **application** from the banner on the top of the
     page.

09. In the **Migrate application traffic** dialog box
     that opens, for **Service access**, choose an
     existing service role or create a new one. Amazon Q Business
     needs these permissions to access the resources it needs to migrate
     your application. For more information on the permissions required,
     see [IAM role for Amazon Q Business data source\
     connectors](iam-roles.md).

10. Select **Migrate**.

    When the migration is complete, the console displays a
     **Successfully migrated application traffic to**
    **IAM Identity Center** message.

AWS CLI

**To migrate an Amazon Q Business**
**application**

**Before starting the migration process, confirm the**
**presence of you web experience using the following**
**command:**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness list-web-experiences \
--application-id application-id

```

If the `list-web-experiences` command returns a
`webExperienceId`, you can proceed with migrating your
application regardless of the status of the web experience.

**If the `list-web-experiences` command**
**doesn't return a `webExperienceId`, you**
**_must_ create a new web experience before**
**proceeding with migration using the following command:**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness create-web-experience \
--application-id application-id

```

**Then, update your Amazon Q Business**
**application using the following command:**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness update-application \
--application-id application-id \
--identity-center-instance-arn idc-instance-arn

```

**Wait for your application status to change from**
**`UPDATING` to `ACTIVE`. The response should**
**include the `identityCenterApplicationArn` as one of the**
**response fields. Check this is the case using the following**
**command:**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness get-application \
--application-id application-id

```

**After your application status changes to**
**`UPDATING`, add users and groups to your application**
**using the following commands:**

To add users to an application

```nohighlight

aws sso-admin create-application-assignment \
--application-arn idc-app-arn \
--principal-id idc-user-ID \
--principal-type USER
```

To add groups to an application

```nohighlight

aws sso-admin create-application-assignment \
--application-arn idc-app-arn \
--principal-id idc-group-ID \
--principal-type GROUP
```

**Then, update your Amazon Q Business web**
**experience using the following command:**

```nohighlight

aws qbusiness update-web-experience \
--role-arn role-arn-value \
--application-id application-id \
--web-experience-id web-experience-id

```
