# Connecting Amazon Q Business data sources

A _data source_ allows you to combine data from different
places into one central index for your Amazon Q Business application. Amazon Q Business provides several easy ways to connect your data.

Before adding any data, you need to set up a retriever and an index for your application.
Once that's done, you can add data in three ways:

- **Upload documents directly** – Upload
documents directly using the console or using the [BatchPutDocument](../api-reference/api-batchputdocument.md) API
operation.

- **Connecting a Amazon Q Business data source**
– Use the AWS Management Console or the the [CreateDataSource](../api-reference/api-createdatasource.md) API operation to
connect a supported data source connector to your Amazon Q Business
application.

###### Note

You must create an Amazon Q Business index to store your data before you connect a
data source to your application.

- **Connecting Amazon Kendra data sources** – Use
existing Amazon Kendra data sources by connecting a [Amazon Kendra\
index](../../../kendra/latest/dg/create-index.md) as a retriever.

If you're connecting a Amazon Kendra GenAI Enterprise Edition index from an Amazon Q Business
application, you can detach it and use it with other AWS Gen AI services, like
Amazon Bedrock. Detaching an Amazon Kendra index automatically deletes the retriever
Amazon Q Business created for it. For a list of features supported by Amazon Kendra GenAI
Enterprise indices, see [Amazon Kendra GenAI Enterprise Edition\
index](../../../kendra/latest/dg/hiw-index-types.md#kendra-gen-ai-index).

###### Note

Amazon Q Business uses user email ID to determine end user access to
documents in an index. When you connect an Amazon Kendra index to Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q Business relays the user’s identifying email ID to Amazon Kendra to
enable document filtering for end users. If data sources connected to your Amazon Kendra
index don’t use email-ID based document filtering, or the email ID is not
present, Amazon Q Business generates responses only from public
documents.
