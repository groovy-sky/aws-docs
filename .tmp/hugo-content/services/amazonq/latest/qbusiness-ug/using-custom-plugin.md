# Using an Amazon Q Business custom plugin

Once a custom plugin is deployed, end users can launch it from the menu icon in the
Amazon Q Business web experience.

###### Note

If your [Admin controls and guardrails](guardrails.md) settings allow
Amazon Q to automatically orchestrate end user chat queries across
plugins and data sources, plugin actions will be automatically activated by Amazon Q for your end user during chat. In that case, your end user won't
have to follow the steps below.

End users can then type a prompt.

If it is the first time an end user is accessing the custom plugin or their past login
has expired, they will need to authenticate. After authenticating successfully, Amazon Q Business will perform the requested task. For a write API operation, end
users will always get a confirmation form that allows them to confirm or correct
parameters that were populated based on the request or past actions.

Once the user confirms the action, Amazon Q Business will submit the request and
give the user confirmation once it is complete.
