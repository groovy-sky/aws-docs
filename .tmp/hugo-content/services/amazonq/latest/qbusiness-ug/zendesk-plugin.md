# Configuring a Zendesk plugin for Amazon Q Business

Zendesk is a customer relationship management system that helps businesses
automate and enhance customer support interactions by creating tickets to track work. If
you’re a Zendesk user, you can create an Amazon Q Business plugin to allow
your end users to create Zendesk cases from within their web experience
chat.

To create a Zendesk plugin, you need configuration information from your
Zendesk instance to set up a connection between Amazon Q and
Zendesk and allow Amazon Q to perform actions in Zendesk.

For more information on how to use plugins during your web experience chat, see [Using\
plugins](using-plugins.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you configure your Amazon Q Zendesk plugin, you must do
the following:

- As an admin, set up a new user in your Zendesk instance with scoped
permissions for performing actions in Amazon Q.

- (Optional) [Create an API token](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408831452954-How-can-I-authenticate-API-requests-) for that new user.

- Note your Zendesk username and Zendesk password/API
token. You will need this basic authentication information for creating an
AWS Secrets Manager secret during the plugin configuration process.

- Note the base URL of your Zendesk instance. For example:
`https://yoursubdomain.zendesk.com`.

## Service access roles

To successfully connect Amazon Q to Zendesk, you need to give Amazon Q
the following permission to access your Secrets Manager secret to get your Zendesk
credentials. Amazon Q assumes this role to access
your Zendesk credentials.

The following is the service access IAM role required:

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:{{your-region}}:{{your-account-id}}:secret:[[secret-id]]"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

To allow Amazon Q to assume a role, use the following trust policy:

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "QBusinessApplicationTrustPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "qbusiness.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "{{source_account}}"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:qbusiness:{{your-region}}:{{source_account}}:application/{{application_id}}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use the console and choose to create a new IAM role,
Amazon Q creates the role for you. If you use the console and choose
to use an existing secret, or you use the API, make sure your IAM role contains these
permissions.

## Creating a plugin

To create a Zendesk plugin for your web experience chat, you can use
AWS Management Console or the [CreatePlugin](../api-reference/api-createplugin.md) API operation. The
following tabs provide a procedure for creating a Zendesk plugin using the
console and code examples for the AWS CLI.

Console

**To create a Zendesk plugin**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Q console
    at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/business/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/business?region=us-east-1).

2. From the Amazon Q console, in
    **Applications**, select the name of your
    application from the list of applications.
