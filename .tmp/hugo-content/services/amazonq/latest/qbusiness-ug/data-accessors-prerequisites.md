# Prerequisites

To add an ISV as a data accessor, complete the following prerequisites:

1. [Get started with\
    Amazon Q Business](getting-started.md)

2. [Create an Identity\
    and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center-integrated application](create-application.md)
    (IAM Federated application environments are not supported at this time).

3. Set up the retriever and connect your data sources. For a complete list of
    data source connectors (see [supported\
    connectors](connectors-list.md)). You need the relevant credentials from each connector
    that you want to retrieve data from. For more information, see [Creating a retriever for an Amazon Q Business application environment](select-retriever.md) and [Connecting Amazon Q Business data sources](data-sources.md).

4. If you are using a customer managed key in your Amazon Q Business Application, you
    must set your key policy to allow the ISV principal access to the KMS key with
    the following policy:
