desks.

## Benefits of Amazon Q Business

Some of the benefits of Amazon Q Business include:

**Accurate and comprehensive answers**

Amazon Q Business generates comprehensive responses to natural language
queries from users by analyzing information across all enterprise content that it has
access to. It can avoid incorrect statements by confining its generated responses to
existing enterprise data, and provides citations to the sources that it used to generate
its response. When a query results in conflicting or inconsistent answers, Amazon Q Business lists the details for each answer. With [hallucination mitigation](guardrails-global-controls.md#guardrails-global-response), Amazon Q Business checks
supported chat responses for inconsistencies and automatically corrects them in
real-time during conversations.

**Simple to deploy and manage**

Amazon Q Business takes care of the complex task of developing and managing
machine learning infrastructure and models so that you can build your chat solution
quickly. Amazon Q Business connects to your data and ingests it for processing
using its pre-built connectors, document retrievers, document upload
capabilities.

**Configurable and customizable**

Amazon Q Business provides you with the flexibility of choosing what sources
should be used to respond to user queries. You can control whether the responses should
only use your enterprise data, or use both enterprise data and model knowledge. For
public-facing scenarios, you can create [anonymous applications](create-anonymous-application.md) that don't require user
authentication, allowing you to serve a broader audience. You can [customize your chat interface](customize-web-experience.md) with your organization's branding, visual
themes, and conversation starters to create a tailored user interface.

**Data and application security**

Amazon Q Business supports access control for your data so that the right
users can access the right content. Its responses to questions are based on the content
that your end user has permissions to access. You can use AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS Identity and Access Management to
manage end user access for Amazon Q Business.

**Broad connectivity**

Amazon Q Business offers out-of-the-box connections to [multiple supported data sources](supported-connectors.md). You can also connect Amazon Q to
any third-party application using [plugins](plugins.md) to perform actions and query application data.
With [data accessors](data-accessors.md), you can securely share your enterprise data with verified
ISVs, allowing them to retrieve relevant content from your Amazon Q index.
