## Prerequisites for integrating the Amazon Q Microsoft Outlook Add-in

As admins, before you can integrate the Amazon Q Business Microsoft
Outlook (Outlook) Add-in, you must complete the following steps.

1. You must have a Microsoft 365 Business subscription and be a
    _Global Admin_ or someone with administrative
    permissions, specifically
    `AppCatalog`. `ReadWrite`. `All`.

2. You need your Microsoft 365 tenant ID. For more information, see
    [How to find your tenant ID - Microsoft Entra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-find-tenant) in the
    _Microsoft Learn portal_.

3. [Get started with Amazon Q Business](getting-started.md)

4. [Create an IAM Identity Center-integrated\
    application](create-application.md) and create your Amazon Q Business web
    experience.

###### Note

[IAM federated application environments](create-application-iam.md) do not
support integrations with Outlook.

5. Add the two IAM roles and trust policies for adding integrations. For
    more information, see [IAM roles and trust policy for your integrations](amazon-q-business-integrations-iam.md).

6. To use this feature, you must enable **Allow end users to send**
**queries directly to the LLM** in your Admin controls and
    guardrails. For more information, see the [Response settings](guardrails-global-controls.md#guardrails-global-response) topic in [Admin controls and guardrails](guardrails.md) and
    [`chatMode`](../api-reference/api-chatsync.md#qbusiness-ChatSync-request-chatMode) if you are
    configuring programmatically.
