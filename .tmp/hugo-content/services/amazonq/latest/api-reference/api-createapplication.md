# CreateApplication

Creates an Amazon Q Business application.

###### Note

There are new tiers for Amazon Q Business. Not all features in Amazon Q Business Pro are
also available in Amazon Q Business Lite. For information on what's included in
Amazon Q Business Lite and what's included in Amazon Q Business Pro, see [Amazon Q Business tiers](../qbusiness-ug/tiers.md#user-sub-tiers). You must use the Amazon Q Business console to assign
subscription tiers to users.

An Amazon Q Apps service linked role will be created if it's absent in the
AWS account when `QAppsConfiguration` is enabled in
the request. For more information, see [Using\
service-linked roles for Q Apps](../qbusiness-ug/using-service-linked-roles-qapps.md).

When you create an application, Amazon Q Business may securely transmit data for
processing from your selected AWS region, but within your geography.
For more information, see [Cross region\
inference in Amazon Q Business](../qbusiness-ug/cross-region-inference.md).
