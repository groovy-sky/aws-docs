# GetDocumentContent

Retrieves the content of a document that was ingested into Amazon Q Business. This API validates user authorization against document ACLs before returning a pre-signed URL for secure document access.
You can download or view source documents referenced in chat responses through the URL.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /applications/applicationId/index/indexId/documents/documentId/content?dataSourceId=dataSourceId&outputFormat=outputFormat HTTP/1.1
