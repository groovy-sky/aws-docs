       **Roles**.

3. Choose the name of the role that you want to modify.

      **permissions** and **Attach**
      **policies**.

6. Select **AmazonQDeveloperAccess**.

7. Choose **Add permissions**.
2. Add the `AmazonQDeveloperAccess` managed policy to your channel
    guardrails:

       console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/chatbot).

2. Choose a configured client.
