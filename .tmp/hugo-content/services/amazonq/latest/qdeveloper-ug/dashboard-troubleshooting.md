# Troubleshooting the Amazon Q Developer dashboard

If the Amazon Q Developer dashboard page is not available, do the following:

- **Verify your permissions**. To view the dashboard, you need the
following permissions:

- `q:ListDashboardMetrics`

- `codewhisperer:ListProfiles`

- `sso:ListInstances`

- `user-subscriptions:ListUserSubscriptions`

- To see metrics generated before November 22, 2024, you also need:
`cloudwatch:GetMetricData` and `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`

For more information about permissions, see [Allow administrators to use the Amazon Q Developer console](id-based-policy-examples-admins.md#q-admin-setup-admin-users).

- **Verify your settings**. In the Amazon Q Developer console, choose
**Settings** and make sure that the **Amazon Q Developer usage dashboard**
toggle is enabled.

For more information about the dashboard, see [Viewing usage metrics (dashboard)](dashboard.md).
