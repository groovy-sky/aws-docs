# Users unable to use their subscription in the IDE

**Problem: IAM Identity Center workforce users are unable to use their Pro subscriptions**
**in the IDE**

**Solutions:**

- Check that the user has an active Amazon Q Developer Pro subscription. For more information, see
[Amazon Q Developer subscription statuses](q-admin-setup-subscribe-status.md).

- If the user recently switched from the Free tier to the Pro tier, have them sign out of
Amazon Q in the IDE and sign back in again.

- If you subscribed the user as part of a group, allow up to 24 hours for their
subscription to be activated. There might be a delay between the time the user is added to
the group and the time their subscription becomes active.

- Verify that the user's access to the Amazon Q Developer Pro managed application was not revoked or
that the managed application was not deleted. Restore access to the managed application if
needed.

- Have users sign in with a Builder ID to use the Free tier while they wait for their
subscription to become active. For more information, see [Installing the Amazon Q Developer extension or plugin in your IDE](q-in-ide-setup.md).
