# Opt out of data sharing in the IDE and command line

This page explains how to opt out of sharing your data in the IDE or command line where
you use Amazon Q, including third-party IDEs and AWS coding environments. For information
on how Amazon Q uses this data, see [Amazon Q Developer service improvement](service-improvement.md).

## Opting out of sharing your client-side telemetry

Your client-side telemetry quantifies your usage of the service. For example, AWS
may track whether you accept or reject a recommendation. Your client-side telemetry does
not contain actual code.

To learn more about the telemetry data collected by Amazon Q in the IDE, see the [commonDefinitions.json](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-common/blob/main/telemetry/definitions/commonDefinitions.json) document in the
`aws-toolkit-common` Github repository.

For detailed information about the telemetry data collected by each IDE where you use
Amazon Q, reference the resource documents in the following GitHub repositories:

- [Amazon Q extension for VS Code](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/master/packages/core/src/shared/telemetry/vscodeTelemetry.json)

- [Amazon Q plugin for JetBrains](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-jetbrains/blob/main/plugins/core/jetbrains-community/resources/telemetryOverride.json)

- [Amazon Q plugin for Eclipse](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-eclipse/blob/main/plugin/codegen-resources/definitions/commonDefinitions.json)

- [AWS Visual Studio Toolkit with Amazon Q](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-visual-studio/blob/main/Telemetry/vs-telemetry-definitions.json)

To learn more about the telemetry data collected by the Q CLI, see the [telemetry\_definitions.json](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli/blob/main/crates/chat-cli/telemetry_definitions.json) document in the
`amazon-q-developer-cli` Github repository.

Telemetry collection helps AWS understand how the Q command line transformation tool
is performing, learn how features are used, and improve our services. For
transformations on the command line, we collect telemetry on your tool version and Maven
plugin version.
