# Configuring the Amazon Q Developer Datadog plugin

Datadog is a monitoring and security platform that provides infrastructure, application,
and network monitoring and analytics. If you use Datadog to monitor your AWS applications,
you can use the Datadog plugin in Amazon Q Developer chat to access monitoring information without
leaving the AWS Management Console.

You can use the Datadog plugin to learn about Datadog, understand how it works with AWS services, and ask
about your Datadog cases and monitors. After you receive a response, you can ask follow up
questions, including how to address an issue or for details about Datadog resources.

To configure the plugin, you provide authentication credentials from your Datadog account to
enable a connection between Amazon Q and Datadog. After you configure the plugin, you can
access Datadog metrics by adding `@datadog` to the beginning of your question in Amazon Q
chat.

###### Warning

Datadog user permissions are not detected by the Datadog plugin in Amazon Q. When an
administrator configures the Datadog plugin in an AWS account, users with plugin
permissions in that account have access to any resources in the Datadog account
retrievable by the plugin.

You can configure IAM policies to restrict which plugins users have access to. For
more information, see
[Configure user permissions](#datadog-configure-user-permissions).

## Prerequisites

### Add permissions

To configure plugins, the following administrator level permissions are required:

- Permissions to access the Amazon Q Developer console. For an example IAM policy
that grants needed permissions, see [Allow administrators to use the Amazon Q Developer console](id-based-policy-examples-admins.md#q-admin-setup-admin-users).

- Permissions to configure plugins. For an example IAM policy that grants
the needed permissions, see [Allow administrators to configure plugins](id-based-policy-examples-admins.md#id-based-policy-examples-admin-plugins).

### Acquire credentials

Before you begin, note the following information from your Datadog account. These
authentication credentials will be stored in an AWS Secrets Manager secret when you
configure the plugin.

- **Site parameter** – The Datadog site
parameter you use. For example, `us3.datadoghq.com`. For more
information, see [Getting Started\
with Datadog Sites](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site) in the Datadog documentation.

- **API key and application key** –
Access keys that allow Amazon Q to call the Datadog API to access events and
metrics. You can find these under **Organization Settings** in your Datadog
account. For more information, see
[API\
and Application Keys](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys) in the Datadog
documentation.

## Secrets and service roles

### AWS Secrets Manager secret

When you configure the plugin, Amazon Q creates a new AWS Secrets Manager secret for you to store
Datadog authentication credentials. Alternatively, you can use an existing secret
that you create yourself.

If you create a secret yourself, make sure it includes the following credentials
and uses the following JSON format:

```nohighlight

{
   "ApiKey": "<your-api-key>",
   "AppKey": "<your-applicaiton-key>"
}
```

For more information about creating secrets, see
[Create a secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create-secret.md) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

### Service roles

To configure the Datadog plugin in Amazon Q Developer, you need to create a service
role that gives Amazon Q permission to access your Secrets Manager secret. Amazon Q
assumes this role to access the secret where your Datadog credentials are stored.

When you configure the plugin in the AWS console, you have the option to create
a new secret or use an existing one. If you create a new secret, the associated
service role is created for you. If you use an existing secret and an existing
service role, make sure your service role contains the following permissions, and
has the following trust policy attached. The service role required depends on your
secret encryption method.

If your secret is encrypted with an AWS
managed KMS key, the following IAM service role is required:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:secret:secret-id"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

If your secret is encrypted with a customer
managed AWS KMS key, the following IAM service role is required:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:secret:secret-id"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/key-id",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "kms:ViaService": "secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

To allow Amazon Q to assume the service role, the service role needs the following
trust policy:

## Configure the Datadog plugin

You configure plugins in the Amazon Q Developer console. Amazon Q uses credentials stored in
AWS Secrets Manager to enable interactions with Datadog.

To configure the Datadog plugin, complete the following procedure:

1. Open the Amazon Q Developer console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/developer/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/developer/home)

2. On the Amazon Q Developer console home page, choose **Settings**.

3. In the navigation bar, choose **Plugins**.

4. On the plugins page, choose the plus sign on the **Datadog** panel. The plugin configuration page
    opens.

5. For **Site URL**, enter the URL of the Datadog site you use.

6. For **Configure AWS Secrets Manager**, choose either
    **Create a new secret** or **Use an**
**existing secret**. The Secrets Manager secret is where your Datadog authentication
    credentials will be stored.

If you create a new secret, enter the following information:

1. For **Datadog API key**, enter the API key for your Datadog organization.

2. For **Datadog application key**, enter the application key for your Datadog account.

3. A service role will be created that Amazon Q will use to access the
       secret where your Datadog credentials are stored. Do not edit the
       service role that is created for you.

If you use an existing secret, choose a secret from the **AWS Secrets Manager**
**secret** dropdown menu. The secret should include the Datadog authentication
credentials specified in the previous step.

For more information about the required credentials, see
[Acquire credentials](#acquire-datadog-credentials).

7. For **Configure AWS IAM service role**, choose either **Create new service role** or
    **Use existing service role**.

###### Note

If you chose **Create a new secret** for step 6, you can’t use an existing
service role. A new role will be created for you.

If you create a new service role, a service role will be created that
    Amazon Q will use to access the secret where your Datadog credentials
    are stored. Do not edit the service role that is created for you.

If you use an existing service role, choose a role from the dropdown
    menu that appears. Make sure your service role has the permissions and
    trust policy defined in [Service roles](#datadog-service-role).

8. Choose **Save configuration**.

9. After the Datadog plugin panel appears in the **Configured plugins** section on the Plugins
    page, users will have access to the plugin.

If you want to update the credentials for a plugin, you must delete your current
plugin and configure a new one. Deleting a plugin removes all previous
specifications. Any time you configure a new plugin, a new plugin ARN is generated.

## Configure user permissions

To use plugins, the following permissions are required:

- Permissions to chat with Amazon Q in the console. For an example IAM
policy that grants permissions needed to chat, see
[Allow users to chat with Amazon Q](id-based-policy-examples-users.md#id-based-policy-examples-allow-chat).

- The `q:UsePlugin` permission.

When you grant an IAM identity access to a configured Datadog plugin, the identity
gains access to any resources in the Datadog account retrievable by the plugin. Datadog
user permissions are not detected by the plugin. If you want to control access to a
plugin, you can do so by specifying the plugin ARN in an IAM policy.

Each time you create or delete and re-configure a plugin, it is assigned a new ARN. If
you use a plugin ARN in a policy, it will need to be updated if you want to grant access
to the newly configured plugin.

To locate the Datadog plugin ARN, go to the **Plugins** page in the Amazon Q Developer
console and choose the configured Datadog plugin. On the plugin details page, copy the
plugin ARN. You can add this ARN to a policy to allow or deny access to the Datadog
plugin.

If you create a policy to control access to Datadog plugins, specify
`Datadog` for the plugin provider in the policy.

For examples of IAM policies that control plugin access, see
[Allow users to chat with plugins from one provider](id-based-policy-examples-users.md#id-based-policy-examples-allow-plugin-type).

## Chat with the Datadog plugin

To use the Datadog plugin, enter `@datadog` at the beginning of a
question about Datadog or your AWS application monitors and cases. Follow up questions
or responses to questions from Amazon Q must also include `@datadog`.

Following are some example use cases and associated questions you can ask to get the
most of out of the Amazon Q Datadog plugin:

- **Learn about using Datadog features in your AWS**
**workload** – Ask about how Datadog features work with
certain AWS services. Amazon Q might ask you for more information about what
you’re trying to do to provide the best answer.

- `@datadog how do I use APM on EC2?`

- **Retrieve and summarize cases and monitors**
– Ask about a specific case or monitor, or specify properties to get
information about monitors and cases like create date, status, or author. For
more information about properties, see
[Properties](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage/status) in the Datadog
documentation.

- `@datadog summarize the global outage case`

- `@datadog summarize my top cases`

- **Check monitors that are in an alarm state**
– Ask the Amazon Q Datadog plugin to find your AWS application monitors
that are in alarm. You can follow up with questions about the monitors it lists.

- `@datadog what monitors are in alarm?`

- `@datadog what is the status for monitor <monitor ID>?`
