# Identity and access management for Amazon Q Developer

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator
securely control access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who
can be _authenticated_ (signed in) and _authorized_ (have
permissions) to use Amazon Q Developer resources. IAM is an AWS service that you
can use with no additional charge.

## Audience

How you use IAM differs, depending on the work you do in Amazon Q.

**Service user** – If you use the Amazon Q service to do your job, then
your administrator provides you with the credentials and permissions that you need. As you use more
Amazon Q features to do your work, you might need additional permissions. Understanding how access is
managed can help you request the right permissions from your administrator.

**Service administrator** – If you’re in charge of Amazon Q resources at
your company, you probably have full access to Amazon Q. It’s your job to determine which Amazon Q
features and resources your service users should access. You must then submit requests to your
IAM administrator to change the permissions of your service users. Review the
information on this page to understand the basic concepts of IAM. To learn more about
how your company can use IAM with Amazon Q, see [How Amazon Q works with IAM](security-iam-service-with-iam.md).

**IAM administrator** – If you’re an IAM administrator, you
might want to learn details about how you can write policies to manage access to Amazon Q. If you’re an
IAM administrator, consider learning the details about how you can write policies to manage IAM
user access to services. For information that’s specific to Amazon Q, see [AWS Regions managed policies for Amazon Q](managed-policy.md).

## Authenticating with identities

Authentication is how you sign in to AWS using your identity credentials. You must
be _authenticated_ (signed in to AWS) as the AWS account root
user, an IAM user, or by assuming an IAM role.

You can sign in to AWS as a federated identity by using credentials provided
through an identity source. AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center) users, your company’s single
sign-on authentication, and your Google or Facebook credentials are
examples of federated identities. When you sign in as a federated identity, your administrator
previously set up identity federation using IAM roles. When you access AWS by using federation, you are indirectly assuming a role.

Depending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the
AWS access portal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see
[How to sign in to\
your AWS account](../../../signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.md) in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

Regardless of the authentication method that you use, you might also be required to provide
additional security information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor
authentication (MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see [Multi-factor\
authentication](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-mfa.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_ and [Using multi-factor\
authentication (MFA) in AWS](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-credentials-mfa.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

### AWS account root user

When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity
that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This
identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and
password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you don’t use the root
user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform tasks
that only the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as
the root user, see [Tasks that require root user\
credentials](../../../accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Federated identity

As a best practice, require human users, including users that require administrator access, to
use federation with an identity provider to access AWS services by using temporary
credentials.

A federated identity is a user from your enterprise user directory, a web identity provider,
the AWS Directory Service, the Identity Center directory, or any user that accesses AWS services by using credentials provided through an identity source. When federated
identities access AWS accounts, they assume roles, and the roles provide temporary
credentials.

For centralized access management, we recommend that you use AWS IAM Identity Center. You can
create users and groups in IAM Identity Center, or you can connect and synchronize to a set of users and groups
in your own identity source for use across all your AWS accounts and applications.
For information about IAM Identity Center, see [What is IAM Identity Center?](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.md) in the
_AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

### IAM users and groups

An _[IAM user](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-users.md)_ is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions
for a single person or application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials
instead of creating IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and
access keys. However, if you have specific use cases that require long-term credentials with
IAM users, we recommend that you rotate access keys. For more information, see
[Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-term credentials](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md#rotate-credentials) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

An [IAM group](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-groups.md) is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users. You can’t sign in as a group. You can use groups to specify permissions for
multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for large sets of users. For
example, you could have a group named _IAMAdmins_ and give that group
permissions to administer IAM resources.

Users are different from roles. A user is uniquely associated with one person or application,
but a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Users have permanent long-term
credentials, but roles provide temporary credentials. For more information, see [When to create an\
IAM user (instead of a role)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id.md#id_which-to-choose) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

### IAM roles

An _[IAM role](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles.md)_ is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user but is not associated with a specific person. You can temporarily assume an
IAM role in the AWS Management Console by [switching roles](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-use-switch-role-console.md). You
can assume a role by calling an AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API operation
or by using a custom URL. For more information about methods for using roles, see [Using IAM\
roles](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-use.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

IAM roles with temporary credentials are useful in the following situations:

- **Federated user access** – To assign permissions to a
federated identity, you create a role and define permissions for the role. When a federated
identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the
permissions that are defined by the role. For information about roles for federation, see
[Creating a role for a third-party Identity Provider](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-idp.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_. If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set.
To control what your identities can access after they authenticate, IAM Identity Center correlates the
permission set to a role in IAM. For information about permissions sets, see
[Permission sets](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.md) in
the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

- **Temporary IAM user permissions** – An
IAM user can assume an IAM role to temporarily take on
different permissions for a specific task.

- **Cross-account access** – You can use an IAM
role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a different account to access resources in
your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, with some
AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource (instead of
using a role as a proxy). For more information about the difference between roles and
resource-based policies for cross-account access, see [How IAM\
roles differ from resource-based policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-compare-resource-policies.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- **Cross-service access** – Some AWS services
use features in other AWS services. A service might do this using the calling
principal’s permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role.

- **Principal permissions** – When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are
considered a principal. Policies grant permissions to a principal. When you use some
services, you might perform an action that then triggers another action in a different
service. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions.

- **Service role** – A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An
IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from
within IAM. For more information, see [Creating a role to\
delegate permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- **Service-linked role** – A service-linked role is a
type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can
assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in
your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM
administrator can view but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

- **Applications running on Amazon EC2** – You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for
applications that are running on an Amazon EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the
Amazon EC2 instance. To assign an IAM role to an Amazon EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile
that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs
that are running on the Amazon EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more
information, see [Using an IAM\
role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-use-switch-role-ec2.md)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

For more information about whether to use IAM roles, see [When to create\
an IAM role (instead of a user)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id.md#id_which-to-choose_role) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Managing access using policies

You control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AWS identities or resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when
associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates
these policies when a principal (user, root user, or role session) makes a request. Permissions in the
policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. For more information about the structure and contents of JSON policy
documents, see [Overview of JSON\
policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies.md#access_policies-json) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That
is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

Every IAM entity (user or role) starts with no permissions. By default, users can
do nothing, not even change their own password. To give a user permission to do something, an
administrator must attach a permissions policy to a user. Or the administrator can add the user to a
group that has the intended permissions. When an administrator gives permissions to a group, all
users in that group are granted those permissions.

IAM policies define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to
perform the operation. For example, suppose that you have a policy that allows the
`iam:GetRole` action. A user with that policy can get role information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API.

### Identity-based policies

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an
identity, such as an IAM user, role, or group. These policies control what actions
users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. For more information
about how to create an identity-based policy, see [Creating IAM\
policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-create.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Identity-based policies can be further categorized as _inline policies_ or
_managed policies_. Inline policies are embedded directly into a single
user, group, or role. Managed policies are standalone policies that you can attach to multiple
users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. Managed policies include AWS managed policies and customer managed policies. For more information about how to
choose between a managed policy or an inline policy, see [Choosing between managed policies and inline policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#choosing-managed-or-inline) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

### Resource-based policies

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as an
Amazon S3 bucket. Service administrators can use these policies to define what actions
a specified principal (account member, user, or role) can perform on that resource and under what
conditions. Resource-based policies are inline policies. There are no managed resource-based
policies.

### Access control lists (ACLs)

Access control lists (ACLs) are a type of policy that controls which principals (account
members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are similar to
resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format. Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services that support ACLs. For
more information about ACLs, see [Access Control List (ACL) overview](../../../s3/latest/dev/acl-overview.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

### Other policy types

AWS supports additional, less-common policy types. These policy types can set the
maximum permissions granted to you by the more common policy types.

- **Permissions boundaries** – A permissions boundary is an
advanced feature in which you set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can
grant to an IAM entity (IAM user or role). You can set a
permissions boundary for an entity. The resulting permissions are the intersection of an
entity’s identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. Resource-based policies
that specify the user or role in the `Principal` field are not limited by the
permissions boundary. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For
more information about permissions boundaries, see [Permissions boundaries for\
IAM entities](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-boundaries.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- **Service control policies (SCPs)** – SCPs are JSON policies
that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU) in
AWS Organizations. AWS Organizations is a service for grouping and centrally
managing multiple AWS accounts that your business owns. If you enable all
features in an organization, then you can apply SCPs to any or all of your accounts. The SCP
limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. For
more information about Organizations and SCPs, see [How SCPs\
work](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-policies-about-scps.md) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

- **Session policies** – Session policies are advanced policies
that you pass as a parameter when you programmatically create a temporary session for a role
or federated user. The resulting session’s permissions are the intersection of the user or
role’s identity-based policies and the session policies. Permissions can also come from a
resource-based policy. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides the allow. For
more information, see [Session policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies.md#policies_session)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Multiple policy types

When multiple types of policies apply to a request, the resulting permissions are more
complicated to understand. To learn how AWS determines whether to allow a request
when multiple policy types are involved, see [Policy evaluation\
logic](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-evaluation-logic.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.
