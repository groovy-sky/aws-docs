# Enabling profile sharing in Amazon Q Developer

###### Note

This section does not apply to personal accounts (Builder IDs).

If you are a management account administrator within an organization managed by [AWS Organizations](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-introduction.md), you can enable the _profile sharing_ feature. When
profile sharing is enabled, the [Amazon Q Developer\
profile](subscribe-understanding-profile.md) that has been created in a management account will be shared with member
accounts. Sharing the profile has one benefit: it allows IAM Identity Center workforce users who are
subscribed to Amazon Q Developer Pro in a _management_ account to use their Amazon Q Developer Pro
subscription [in the AWS Management Console, and on AWS apps and websites](q-on-aws.md)
while signed in to a _member_ account. When profile sharing is disabled,
these users can still use Amazon Q in the AWS Management Console, and on AWS apps and websites, while signed
in to a member account, but they'll be subject to Free tier limits and features.

Enabling profile sharing has no effect on users' ability to use [Amazon Q\
in the integrated development environment (IDE)](q-in-ide.md) or [on\
the command line](command-line.md).

Use the following instructions to enable profile sharing.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure that:

- You are an administrator of an AWS _management_ account.

- You have an IAM Identity Center instance set up in your management account and connected to Amazon Q.
To check, sign in to your management account, go to the Amazon Q Developer console, choose
**Settings**, and make sure that a **Start URL**
appears.

- You have subscribed users to Amazon Q Developer Pro in your management account.

- You have the minimum permissions required to access the Amazon Q Developer console. For more
information, see [Allow administrators to use the Amazon Q Developer console](id-based-policy-examples-admins.md#q-admin-setup-admin-users).

###### To enable profile sharing

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using your AWS management account.

2. Switch to the Amazon Q Developer console.

3. Choose **Settings**.

4. Scroll to the **Member account settings** section and choose
    **Edit**.

5. Enable **Q Developer managed application and settings profile**.

6. Choose **Save**.

Users who are subscribed to Amazon Q Developer Pro in your management account will now be able to
    use their Amazon Q Developer Pro subscription in the AWS Management Console, and on AWS apps and websites
    while signed in to a member account.
