# Chatting about your telemetry and operations

Amazon Q analyzes your CloudWatch telemetry and operational data to help manage your AWS environment. It
retrieves resource health information, monitors alarms, and provides troubleshooting guidance. When
you ask questions, Amazon Q may prompt you for specific details like resource names and time ranges to
ensure accurate assistance.

**AWS service health check:** Evaluate the health of resources of
specified AWS services, assisting customers in troubleshooting and resolving issues or errors they
encounter with these resources.

- Is my Lambda function X healthy?

- Is anything wrong with my Amazon ECS clusters?

- Help me troubleshoot my DynamoDB tables between time X and Y.

- Investigate anomalies related to Amazon S3 between time X and Y.

**Alarm troubleshooting:** Identifies alarms in Alarm state and the
underlying telemetry that triggered the alarm, helping customers diagnose the reasons behind the
alarm/alert/pages.

- Why is my alarm with name X firing?

**Application Signals specific troubleshooting:** Analyzes
CloudWatch Application Signals service-level objectives and indicators to determine the overall health of a service,
enabling you to assess and maintain application performance.

- Is my Service X in environment Y healthy?
