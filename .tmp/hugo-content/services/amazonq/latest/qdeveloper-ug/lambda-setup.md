# Using Amazon Q Developer with AWS Lambda

This document describes how to set up and activate Amazon Q Developer for the Lambda console.
Once activated, Amazon Q can make code recommendations on demand in the Lambda code editor
as you develop your function.

###### Note

In the Lambda console, Amazon Q only supports functions using the Python and Node.js
runtimes.

## AWS Identity and Access Management permissions for Lambda

For Amazon Q to provide recommendations in the Lambda console, you must enable the correct IAM permissions
for either your IAM user or role. You must add the `codewhisperer:GenerateRecommendations` permission, as outlined
in the sample IAM policy below:

###### Note

The `codewhisperer` prefix is a legacy name from a service that merged
with Amazon Q Developer. For more information, see
[Amazon Q Developer rename - Summary of changes](service-rename.md).

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AmazonQDeveloperPermissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["codewhisperer:GenerateRecommendations"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

It is best practice to use IAM policies to grant restrictive permissions to IAM
principals. For details about working with IAM for AWS Lambda, see [Identity and access management in AWS Lambda](../../../lambda/latest/dg/security-iam.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

## Activating Amazon Q Developer with Lambda

To activate Amazon Q in the Lambda console code editor, complete these steps.

1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) of the Lambda console,
    and choose the function that you want to edit.

2. As you type in the code editor, automatic code suggestions from Amazon Q are enabled by
    default. To pause suggestions, choose **Amazon Q** in the bottom left
    corner of the **Code source** panel. The command palette opens at the top
    of the Code source panel. From there, choose **Pause auto-suggestions**.
