# Manage your data sources

You can use the **Data sources and catalogs** page of the Athena console to manage the
data sources that you create.

###### To view a data source

1. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

2. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
    on the left.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Data sources and catalogs**.

4. From the list of data sources, choose the name of the data source that you want to
    view.

###### Note

The items in the **Data source name** column correspond to
the output of the [ListDataCatalogs](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-listdatacatalogs.md) API action and the [list-data-catalogs](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/athena/list-data-catalogs.html) CLI command.

###### To edit a data source

1. On the **Data sources and catalogs** page, do one of the following:

- Select the button next to the catalog name, and then choose
**Actions**, **Edit**.

- Choose the name of the data source. Then on the details page, choose
**Actions**, **Edit**.

2. On the **Edit** page, you can choose a different Lambda function
    for the data source, change the description, or add custom tags. For more
    information about tags, see [Tag Athena resources](tags.md).

3. Choose **Save**.

4. To edit your **AwsDataCatalog** data source, choose the
    **AwsDataCatalog** link to open its details page. Then, on the
    details page, choose the link to the AWS Glue console where you can edit your
    catalog.

###### To share a data source

For information about sharing data sources, visit the following links.

- For non-Hive Lambda-based data sources, see [Enable cross-account federated queries](xacct-fed-query-enable.md).

- For AWS Glue Data Catalogs, see [Configure cross-account access to AWS Glue data catalogs](security-iam-cross-account-glue-catalog-access.md).

###### To delete a data source

1. On the **Data sources and catalogs** page, do one of the following:

- Select the button next to the catalog name, and then choose
**Actions**, **Delete**.

- Choose the name of the data source, and then, on the details page, choose
**Actions**, **Delete**.

###### Note

The **AwsDataCatalog** is the default data source in your
account and cannot be deleted.

You are warned that when you delete a data source, its corresponding data catalog,
tables, and views are removed from the query editor. Saved queries that used the
data source will no longer run in Athena.

2. To confirm the deletion, type the name of the data source, and then choose
    **Delete**.
