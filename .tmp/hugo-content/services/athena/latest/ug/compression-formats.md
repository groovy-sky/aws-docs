# Use compression in Athena

Athena supports a variety of compression formats for reading and writing data, including
reading from a table that uses multiple compression formats. For example, Athena can
successfully read the data in a table that uses Parquet file format when some Parquet files
are compressed with Snappy and other Parquet files are compressed with GZIP. The same
principle applies for ORC, text file, and JSON storage formats.

Athena supports the following compression formats:

- BZIP2 – Format that uses the Burrows-Wheeler
algorithm.

- DEFLATE – Compression algorithm based on
[LZSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Storer%E2%80%93Szymanski) and [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). [Deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate) is relevant only for the Avro file format.

- GZIP – Compression algorithm based on
Deflate. For Hive tables in Athena engine versions 2 and 3, and Iceberg tables in
Athena engine version 2, GZIP is the default write compression format for files in the Parquet and
text file storage formats. Files in the `tar.gz` format are not
supported.

- LZ4 – This member of the Lempel-Ziv 77 (LZ7)
family also focuses on compression and decompression speed rather than maximum
compression of data. LZ4 has the following framing formats:

- LZ4 Raw/Unframed – An
unframed, standard implementation of the LZ4 block compression
format. For more information, see the [LZ4 block format description](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Block_format.md) on GitHub.

- LZ4 framed – The usual
framing implementation of LZ4. For more information, see the [LZ4 frame format description](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Frame_format.md) on GitHub.

- LZ4 hadoop-compatible – The
Apache Hadoop implementation of LZ4. This implementation wraps LZ4
compression with the [BlockCompressorStream.java](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/f67237cbe7bc48a1b9088e990800b37529f1db2a/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/BlockCompressorStream.java) class.

- LZO – Format that uses the
Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer algorithm, which focuses on high
compression and decompression speed rather than the maximum compression of
data. LZO has two implementations:

- Standard LZO – For more
information, see the LZO [abstract](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo) on the Oberhumer website.

- LZO hadoop-compatible – This
implementation wraps the LZO algorithm with the [BlockCompressorStream.java](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/f67237cbe7bc48a1b9088e990800b37529f1db2a/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/BlockCompressorStream.java) class.

- SNAPPY – Compression algorithm that
is part of the Lempel-Ziv 77 (LZ7) family. Snappy focuses on high
compression and decompression speed rather than the maximum compression of
data.

- ZLIB – Based on Deflate, ZLIB is the
default write compression format for files in the ORC data storage format.
For more information, see the [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib) page on GitHub.

- ZSTD – The [Zstandard real-time data\
compression algorithm](http://facebook.github.io/zstd) is a fast compression algorithm that
provides high compression ratios. The Zstandard (ZSTD) library is provided
as open source software using a BSD license. ZSTD is the default compression
for Iceberg tables. When writing ZSTD compressed data, Athena uses ZSTD
compression level 3 by default. For more information about using ZSTD
compression levels in Athena, see [Use ZSTD compression levels](compression-support-zstd-levels.md).

###### Note

Athena does not support writing Parquet files compressed with LZ4 or LZO
formats. Reads for these compression formats are supported.

## Specify compression formats

When you write CREATE TABLE or CTAS statements, you can specify compression properties
that specify the compression type to use when Athena writes to those tables.

- For CTAS, see [CTAS table properties](create-table-as.md#ctas-table-properties). For examples, see [Examples of CTAS queries](ctas-examples.md).

- For CREATE TABLE, see [ALTER TABLE SET TBLPROPERTIES](alter-table-set-tblproperties.md) for a list of compression
table properties.

## Specify no compression

CREATE TABLE statements support writing uncompressed files. To write uncompressed
files, use the following syntax:

- CREATE TABLE (text file or JSON) – In `TBLPROPERTIES`,
specify `write.compression = NONE`.

- CREATE TABLE (Parquet) – In `TBLPROPERTIES`, specify
`parquet.compression = UNCOMPRESSED`.

- CREATE TABLE (ORC) – In `TBLPROPERTIES`, specify
`orc.compress = NONE`.

## Notes and resources

- Currently, uppercase file extensions such as `.GZ` or
`.BZIP2` are not recognized by Athena. Avoid using
datasets with uppercase file extensions, or rename the data file extensions to
lowercase.

- For data in CSV, TSV, and JSON, Athena determines the compression type from the
file extension. If no file extension is present, Athena treats the data as
uncompressed plain text. If your data is compressed, make sure the file name
includes the compression extension, such as `gz`.

- The ZIP file format is not supported.

- For querying Amazon Data Firehose logs from Athena, supported formats include GZIP
compression or ORC files with SNAPPY compression.

- For more information about using compression, see section 3 ("Compress and
split files") of the AWS Big Data Blog post [Top 10 performance tuning tips for Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/top-10-performance-tuning-tips-for-amazon-athena).
