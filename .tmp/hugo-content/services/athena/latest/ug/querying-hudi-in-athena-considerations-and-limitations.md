# Considerations and limitations

When you use Athena to read Apache Hudi tables, consider the following points.

- Read and write operations – Athena can
read compacted Hudi datasets but not write Hudi data.

- Hudi versions – Athena supports Hudi
version 0.14.0 (default) and 0.15.0. Athena cannot guarantee read compatibility
with tables that are created with later versions of Hudi. For more information
about Hudi features and versioning, see the [Hudi documentation](https://hudi.apache.org/) on the Apache website.
Note that version 0.15.0 of the Hudi connector on Athena does not support
bootstrapped tables. To use 0.15.0 of the
Hudi connector, set the following table property:

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('athena_enable_native_hudi_connector_implementation' = 'true')
```

- Cross account queries – Version 0.15.0
of the Hudi connector does not support cross account queries.

- Query types – Currently, Athena supports
snapshot queries and read optimized queries, but not incremental queries. On MoR
tables, all data exposed to read optimized queries are compacted. This provides
good performance but does not include the latest delta commits. Snapshot queries
contain the freshest data but incur some computational overhead, which makes
these queries less performant. For more information about the tradeoffs between
table and query types, see [Table & Query\
Types](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/table_types) in the Apache Hudi documentation.

- Incremental queries – Athena does not
support incremental queries.

- CTAS – Athena does not support [CTAS](ctas.md) or [INSERT INTO](insert-into.md) on Hudi data. If you
would like Athena support for writing Hudi datasets, send feedback to
`<athena-feedback@amazon.com>`.

For more information about writing Hudi data, see the following
resources:

- [Working with a Hudi dataset](../../../emr/latest/releaseguide/emr-hudi-work-with-dataset.md) in the [Amazon EMR Release Guide](../../../emr/latest/releaseguide.md).

- [Writing Data](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/0.8.0/writing_data.html) in the Apache Hudi documentation.

- MSCK REPAIR TABLE – Using MSCK REPAIR
TABLE on Hudi tables in Athena is not supported. If you need to load a Hudi table
not created in AWS Glue, use [ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION](alter-table-add-partition.md).

- Skipping Amazon Glacier objects not supported  –
If objects in the Apache Hudi table are in an Amazon Glacier storage class, setting the
`read_restored_glacier_objects` table property to
`false` has no effect.

For example, suppose you issue the following command:

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('read_restored_glacier_objects' = 'false')
```

For Iceberg and Delta Lake tables, the command produces the error
**`Unsupported table property key:**
**read_restored_glacier_objects`**. For Hudi tables, the `ALTER
                          TABLE` command does not produce an error, but Amazon Glacier objects are still
not skipped. Running `SELECT` queries after the `ALTER
                          TABLE` command continues to return all objects.

- Timestamp queries – Currently, queries
that attempt to read timestamp columns in Hudi real time tables either fail or
produce empty results. This limitation applies only to queries that read a
timestamp column. Queries that include only non-timestamp columns from the same
table succeed.

Failed queries return a message similar to the following:

**`GENERIC_INTERNAL_ERROR: class org.apache.hadoop.io.ArrayWritable**
**cannot be cast to class org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.TimestampWritableV2**
**(org.apache.hadoop.io.ArrayWritable and**
**org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.TimestampWritableV2 are in unnamed module**
**of loader io.trino.server.PluginClassLoader @75c67992)`**

- Lake Formation Permissions on 0.15.0 Hudi Connector – This limitation applies only when you opt in to using the native Hudi connector (version 0.15.0) by setting the table property `athena_enable_native_hudi_connector_implementation` to `true`. By default, Athena uses Hudi connector version 0.14.0, which does not require this additional permission. To query a Lake Formation protected table, you must grant Lake Formation permissions to both the table's data location and the `.hoodie` metadata directory. For example, if your Hudi table is located at `s3://bucket/hudi-table/`, you must register and grant permissions to both `s3://bucket/hudi-table/` and `s3://bucket/hudi-table/.hoodie/` in Lake Formation. The `.hoodie` directory contains metadata files (such as `hoodie.properties`) that Athena needs to read during query planning. Without permissions to the `.hoodie` directory, queries will fail with permission denied errors.
