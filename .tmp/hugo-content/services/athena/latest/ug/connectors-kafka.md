# Amazon Athena Apache Kafka connector

The Amazon Athena connector for Apache Kafka enables Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on your
Apache Kafka topics. Use this connector to view [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) topics as tables and messages as rows in Athena.

This connector does not use Glue Connections to centralize configuration properties in Glue. Connection configuration is done through Lambda.

## Prerequisites

Deploy the connector to your AWS account using the Athena console or the AWS Serverless Application Repository. For more information, see [Create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md) or [Use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md).

## Limitations

- Write DDL operations are not supported.

- Any relevant Lambda limits. For more information, see [Lambda quotas](../../../lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

- Date and timestamp data types in filter conditions must be cast to appropriate data types.

- Date and timestamp data types are not supported for the CSV file type and are
treated as varchar values.

- Mapping into nested JSON fields is not supported. The connector maps top-level
fields only.

- The connector does not support complex types. Complex types are interpreted as
strings.

- To extract or work with complex JSON values, use the JSON-related functions
available in Athena. For more information, see [Extract JSON data from strings](extracting-data-from-json.md).

- The connector does not support access to Kafka message metadata.

## Terms

- Metadata handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves metadata from your database instance.

- Record handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves data records from your database instance.

- Composite handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves both metadata and data records from your database instance.

- Kafka endpoint – A text string that
establishes a connection to a Kafka instance.

## Cluster compatibility

The Kafka connector can be used with the following cluster types.

- Standalone Kafka – A direct connection
to Kafka (authenticated or unauthenticated).

- Confluent – A direct connection to
Confluent Kafka. For information about using Athena with Confluent Kafka data,
see [Visualize Confluent data in Quick using Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/business-intelligence/visualize-confluent-data-in-amazon-quicksight-using-amazon-athena) in the _AWS Business Intelligence Blog_.

### Connecting to Confluent

Connecting to Confluent requires the following steps:

1. Generate an API key from Confluent.

2. Store the username and password for the Confluent API key into
    AWS Secrets Manager.

3. Provide the secret name for the `secrets_manager_secret`
    environment variable in the Kafka connector.

4. Follow the steps in the [Setting up the Kafka connector](#connectors-kafka-setup) section of this
    document.

## Supported authentication methods

The connector supports the following authentication methods.

- [SSL](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation)

- [SASL/SCRAM](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation)

- SASL/PLAIN

- SASL/PLAINTEXT

- NO\_AUTH

- Self-managed Kafka and Confluent Platform
– SSL, SASL/SCRAM, SASL/PLAINTEXT, NO\_AUTH

- Self-managed Kafka and Confluent Cloud –
SASL/PLAIN

For more information, see [Configuring authentication for the Athena Kafka connector](#connectors-kafka-setup-configuring-authentication).

## Supported input data formats

The connector supports the following input data formats.

- JSON

- CSV

- AVRO

- PROTOBUF (PROTOCOL BUFFERS)

## Parameters

Use the parameters in this section to configure the Athena Kafka connector.

- auth\_type – Specifies the authentication
type of the cluster. The connector supports the following types of
authentication:

- NO\_AUTH – Connect directly to
Kafka (for example, to a Kafka cluster deployed over an EC2 instance
that does not use authentication).

- SASL\_SSL\_PLAIN – This method
uses the `SASL_SSL` security protocol and the
`PLAIN` SASL mechanism. For more information, see [SASL configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) in the Apache Kafka
documentation.

- SASL\_PLAINTEXT\_PLAIN – This
method uses the `SASL_PLAINTEXT` security protocol and the
`PLAIN` SASL mechanism. For more information, see [SASL configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) in the Apache Kafka
documentation.

- SASL\_SSL\_SCRAM\_SHA512 – You can
use this authentication type to control access to your Apache Kafka
clusters. This method stores the user name and password in AWS Secrets Manager.
The secret must be associated with the Kafka cluster. For more
information, see [Authentication using SASL/SCRAM](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) in the Apache Kafka
documentation.

- SASL\_PLAINTEXT\_SCRAM\_SHA512 –
This method uses the `SASL_PLAINTEXT` security protocol and
the `SCRAM_SHA512 SASL` mechanism. This method uses your user
name and password stored in AWS Secrets Manager. For more information, see the
[SASL configuration](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) section of the Apache Kafka
documentation.

- SSL – SSL authentication uses
key store and trust store files to connect with the Apache Kafka
cluster. You must generate the trust store and key store files, upload
them to an Amazon S3 bucket, and provide the reference to Amazon S3 when you
deploy the connector. The key store, trust store, and SSL key are stored
in AWS Secrets Manager. Your client must provide the AWS secret key when the
connector is deployed. For more information, see [Encryption and Authentication using SSL](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) in the Apache Kafka
documentation.

For more information, see [Configuring authentication for the Athena Kafka connector](#connectors-kafka-setup-configuring-authentication).

- certificates\_s3\_reference – The Amazon S3
location that contains the certificates (the key store and trust store
files).

- disable\_spill\_encryption – (Optional)
When set to `True`, disables spill encryption. Defaults to
`False` so that data that is spilled to S3 is encrypted using
AES-GCM – either using a randomly generated key or KMS to generate keys.
Disabling spill encryption can improve performance, especially if your spill
location uses [server-side\
encryption](../../../s3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.md).

- kafka\_endpoint – The endpoint details to
provide to Kafka.

- schema\_registry\_url – The URL address
for the schema registry (for example,
`http://schema-registry.example.org:8081`). Applies to the
`AVRO` and `PROTOBUF` data formats. Athena only
supports Confluent schema registry.

- secrets\_manager\_secret – The name of the
AWS secret in which the credentials are saved.

- Spill parameters – Lambda functions
temporarily store ("spill") data that do not fit into memory to Amazon S3. All
database instances accessed by the same Lambda function spill to the same
location. Use the parameters in the following table to specify the spill
location.

ParameterDescription`spill_bucket`Required. The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the Lambda
function can spill data.`spill_prefix`Required. The prefix within the spill bucket where the Lambda
function can spill data.`spill_put_request_headers`(Optional) A JSON encoded map of request headers and values
for the Amazon S3 `putObject` request that is used for
spilling (for example, `{"x-amz-server-side-encryption" :
                                          "AES256"}`). For other possible headers, see [PutObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

- Subnet IDs – One or more subnet IDs that
correspond to the subnet that the Lambda function can use to access your data
source.

- Public Kafka cluster or standard Confluent Cloud
cluster – Associate the connector with a private
subnet that has a NAT Gateway.

- Confluent Cloud cluster with private
connectivity – Associate the connector with a
private subnet that has a route to the Confluent Cloud cluster.

- For [AWS Transit Gateway](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/aws-transit-gateway.html), the subnets must be in a VPC
that is attached to the same transit gateway that Confluent
Cloud uses.

- For [VPC Peering](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/peering/aws-peering.html), the subnets must be in a VPC that is
peered to Confluent Cloud VPC.

- For [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/private-links/aws-privatelink.html), the subnets must be in a VPC that a
has route to the VPC endpoints that connect to Confluent
Cloud.

###### Note

If you deploy the connector into a VPC in order to access private resources and
also want to connect to a publicly accessible service like Confluent, you must
associate the connector with a private subnet that has a NAT Gateway. For more
information, see [NAT gateways](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.md) in the
Amazon VPC User Guide.

## Data type support

The following table shows the corresponding data types supported for Kafka and Apache
Arrow.

KafkaArrowCHARVARCHARVARCHARVARCHARTIMESTAMPMILLISECONDDATEDAYBOOLEANBOOLSMALLINTSMALLINTINTEGERINTBIGINTBIGINTDECIMALFLOAT8DOUBLEFLOAT8

## Partitions and splits

Kafka topics are split into partitions. Each partition is ordered. Each message in a
partition has an incremental ID called an _offset_.
Each Kafka partition is further divided to multiple splits for parallel processing. Data
is available for the retention period configured in Kafka clusters.

## Best practices

As a best practice, use predicate pushdown when you query Athena, as in the following
examples.

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "kafka_catalog_name"."glue_schema_registry_name"."glue_schema_name"
WHERE integercol = 2147483647
```

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "kafka_catalog_name"."glue_schema_registry_name"."glue_schema_name"
WHERE timestampcol >= TIMESTAMP '2018-03-25 07:30:58.878'
```

## Setting up the Kafka connector

Before you can use the connector, you must set up your Apache Kafka cluster, use the
[AWS Glue Schema\
Registry](../../../glue/latest/dg/schema-registry.md) to define your schema, and configure authentication for the
connector.

When working with the AWS Glue Schema Registry, note the following points:

- Make sure that the text in **Description** field of the AWS Glue
Schema Registry includes the string `{AthenaFederationKafka}`. This
marker string is required for AWS Glue Registries that you use with the Amazon Athena
Kafka connector.

- For best performance, use only lowercase for your database names and table names. Using mixed casing causes the connector to perform a case insensitive search that is more computationally intensive.

###### To set up your Apache Kafka environment and AWS Glue Schema Registry

1. Set up your Apache Kafka environment.

2. Upload the Kafka topic description file (that is, its schema) in JSON format
    to the AWS Glue Schema Registry. For more information, see [Integrating with AWS Glue Schema Registry](../../../glue/latest/dg/schema-registry-integrations.md) in the
    AWS Glue Developer Guide.

3. To use the `AVRO` or `PROTOBUF` data format when you
    define the schema in the AWS Glue Schema Registry:

- For **Schema name**, enter the Kafka topic name in
the same casing as the original.

- For **Data format**, choose **Apache**
**Avro** or **Protocol Buffers**.

For example schemas, see the following section.

Use the format of the examples in this section when you upload your schema to
the [AWS Glue\
Schema Registry](../../../glue/latest/dg/schema-registry.md).

#### JSON type schema example

In the following example, the schema to be created in the AWS Glue Schema
Registry specifies `json` as the value for
`dataFormat` and uses `datatypejson` for
`topicName`.

###### Note

The value for `topicName` should use the same casing as the
topic name in Kafka.

```json

{
  "topicName": "datatypejson",
  "message": {
    "dataFormat": "json",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "intcol",
        "mapping": "intcol",
        "type": "INTEGER"
      },
      {
        "name": "varcharcol",
        "mapping": "varcharcol",
        "type": "VARCHAR"
      },
      {
        "name": "booleancol",
        "mapping": "booleancol",
        "type": "BOOLEAN"
      },
      {
        "name": "bigintcol",
        "mapping": "bigintcol",
        "type": "BIGINT"
      },
      {
        "name": "doublecol",
        "mapping": "doublecol",
        "type": "DOUBLE"
      },
      {
        "name": "smallintcol",
        "mapping": "smallintcol",
        "type": "SMALLINT"
      },
      {
        "name": "tinyintcol",
        "mapping": "tinyintcol",
        "type": "TINYINT"
      },
      {
        "name": "datecol",
        "mapping": "datecol",
        "type": "DATE",
        "formatHint": "yyyy-MM-dd"
      },
      {
        "name": "timestampcol",
        "mapping": "timestampcol",
        "type": "TIMESTAMP",
        "formatHint": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### CSV type schema example

In the following example, the schema to be created in the AWS Glue Schema
Registry specifies `csv` as the value for `dataFormat`
and uses `datatypecsvbulk` for `topicName`. The value
for `topicName` should use the same casing as the topic name in
Kafka.

```json

{
  "topicName": "datatypecsvbulk",
  "message": {
    "dataFormat": "csv",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "intcol",
        "type": "INTEGER",
        "mapping": "0"
      },
      {
        "name": "varcharcol",
        "type": "VARCHAR",
        "mapping": "1"
      },
      {
        "name": "booleancol",
        "type": "BOOLEAN",
        "mapping": "2"
      },
      {
        "name": "bigintcol",
        "type": "BIGINT",
        "mapping": "3"
      },
      {
        "name": "doublecol",
        "type": "DOUBLE",
        "mapping": "4"
      },
      {
        "name": "smallintcol",
        "type": "SMALLINT",
        "mapping": "5"
      },
      {
        "name": "tinyintcol",
        "type": "TINYINT",
        "mapping": "6"
      },
      {
        "name": "floatcol",
        "type": "DOUBLE",
        "mapping": "7"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### AVRO type schema example

The following example is used to create an AVRO-based schema in the AWS Glue
Schema Registry. When you define the schema in the AWS Glue Schema Registry,
for **Schema name**, you enter the Kafka topic name in the
same casing as the original, and for **Data format**, you
choose **Apache Avro**. Because you specify this
information directly in the registry, the `dataformat` and
`topicName` fields are not required.

```json

{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "avrotest",
    "namespace": "example.com",
    "fields": [{
            "name": "id",
            "type": "int"
        },
        {
            "name": "name",
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### PROTOBUF type schema example

The following example is used to create an PROTOBUF-based schema in the
AWS Glue Schema Registry. When you define the schema in the AWS Glue Schema
Registry, for **Schema name**, you enter the Kafka topic
name in the same casing as the original, and for **Data**
**format**, you choose **Protocol Buffers**.
Because you specify this information directly in the registry, the
`dataformat` and `topicName` fields are not
required. The first line defines the schema as PROTOBUF.

```nohighlight

syntax = "proto3";
message protobuftest {
string name = 1;
int64 calories = 2;
string colour = 3;
}
```

For more information about adding a registry and schemas in the AWS Glue
Schema Registry, see [Getting started with Schema\
Registry](../../../glue/latest/dg/schema-registry-gs.md) in the AWS Glue documentation.

### Configuring authentication for the Athena Kafka connector

You can use a variety of methods to authenticate to your Apache Kafka cluster,
including SSL, SASL/SCRAM, SASL/PLAIN, and SASL/PLAINTEXT.

The following table shows the authentication types for the connector and the
security protocol and SASL mechanism for each. For more information, see the [Security](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) section
of the Apache Kafka documentation.

#### SSL

If the cluster is SSL authenticated, you must generate the trust store and key
store files and upload them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You must provide this Amazon S3
reference when you deploy the connector. The key store, trust store, and SSL key
are stored in the AWS Secrets Manager. You provide the AWS secret key when you deploy
the connector.

For information on creating a secret in Secrets Manager, see [Create an AWS Secrets Manager\
secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create-secret.md).

To use this authentication type, set the environment variables as shown in the
following table.

ParameterValue`auth_type``SSL``certificates_s3_reference`The Amazon S3 location that contains the certificates.`secrets_manager_secret`The name of your AWS secret key.

After you create a secret in Secrets Manager, you can view it in the Secrets Manager
console.

###### To view your secret in Secrets Manager

1. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Secrets**.

3. On the **Secrets** page, choose the link to your
    secret.

4. On the details page for your secret, choose **Retrieve secret**
**value**.

The following image shows an example secret with three key/value
    pairs: `keystore_password`, `truststore_password`,
    and `ssl_key_password`.

![Retrieving an SSL secret in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-kafka-setup-1.png)

For more information about using SSL with Kafka, see [Encryption and\
Authentication using SSL](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) in the Apache Kafka documentation.

#### SASL/SCRAM

If your cluster uses SCRAM authentication, provide the Secrets Manager key that is
associated with the cluster when you deploy the connector. The user's AWS
credentials (secret key and access key) are used to authenticate with the
cluster.

Set the environment variables as shown in the following table.

ParameterValue`auth_type``SASL_SSL_SCRAM_SHA512``secrets_manager_secret`The name of your AWS secret key.

The following image shows an example secret in the Secrets Manager console with two
key/value pairs: one for `username`, and one for
`password`.

![Retrieving a SCRAM secret in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-kafka-setup-2.png)

For more information about using SASL/SCRAM with Kafka, see [Authentication using SASL/SCRAM](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation) in the Apache Kafka
documentation.
