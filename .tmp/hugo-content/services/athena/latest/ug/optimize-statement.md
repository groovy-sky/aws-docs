# OPTIMIZE

Optimizes rows in an Apache Iceberg table by rewriting data files into a more optimized
layout based on their size and number of associated delete files.

###### Note

`OPTIMIZE` is transactional and is supported only for Apache Iceberg
tables.

## Syntax

The following syntax summary shows how to optimize data layout for an Iceberg
table.

```sql

OPTIMIZE [db_name.]table_name REWRITE DATA USING BIN_PACK
  [WHERE predicate]
```

###### Note

Only partition columns are allowed in the `WHERE` clause
`predicate`. Specifying a non-partition column will
cause the query to fail.

The compaction action is charged by the amount of data scanned during the rewrite
process. The `REWRITE DATA` action uses predicates to select for files that
contain matching rows. If any row in the file matches the predicate, the file is
selected for optimization. Thus, to control the number of files affected by the
compaction operation, you can specify a `WHERE` clause.

## Configuring compaction properties

To control the size of the files to be selected for compaction and the resulting file
size after compaction, you can use table property parameters. You can use the [ALTER TABLE SET TBLPROPERTIES](querying-iceberg-alter-table-set-properties.md) command to configure
the related [table properties](querying-iceberg-creating-tables.md#querying-iceberg-table-properties).
