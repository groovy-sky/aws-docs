# Use AWS Glue Data Catalog to connect to your data

Athena uses the AWS Glue Data Catalog to store metadata such as table and column names for your data
stored in Amazon S3. This metadata information becomes the databases, tables, and views that you
see in the Athena query editor.

When using Athena with the AWS Glue Data Catalog, you can use AWS Glue to create databases and tables
(schema) to be queried in Athena, or you can use Athena to create schema and then use them in
AWS Glue and related services.

To define schema information for AWS Glue, you can use a form in the Athena console, use the
query editor in Athena, or create an AWS Glue crawler in the AWS Glue console. AWS Glue crawlers
automatically infer database and table schema from your data in Amazon S3. Using a form offers
more customization. Writing your own `CREATE TABLE` statements requires more
effort, but offers the most control. For more information, see [CREATE TABLE](create-table.md).
