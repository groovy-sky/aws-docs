# Create a workgroup

Creating a workgroup requires permissions to `CreateWorkgroup` API actions. See
[Configure access to workgroups and tags](workgroups-access.md) and [Use IAM policies to control workgroup access](workgroups-iam-policy.md). If you are
adding tags, you also need to add permissions to `TagResource`. See [Tag policy examples for workgroups](tags-access-control.md#tag-policy-examples-workgroups).

The following procedure shows how to use the Athena console to create a workgroup. To
create a workgroup using the Athena API, see [CreateWorkGroup](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-createworkgroup.md).

###### To create a workgroup in the Athena console

01. Decide which workgroups to create. A few factors to consider include:

- Who can run queries in each workgroup, and who owns workgroup
configuration. Use IAM policies to enforce workgroup permissions. For more
information, see [Use IAM policies to control workgroup access](workgroups-iam-policy.md).

- The location in Amazon S3 to use for the query results for the workgroup. All
users of the workgroup must have access to this location.

- Whether the workgroup query results must be encrypted. Because encryption
is per-workgroup (not per query), you should create separate workgroups for
encrypted and non-encrypted query results. For more information, see [Encrypt Athena query results stored in Amazon S3](encrypting-query-results-stored-in-s3.md).

02. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
     on the left.

    ![Choose the expansion menu.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/nav-pane-expansion.png)

03. In the Athena console navigation pane, choose
     **Workgroups**.

04. On the **Workgroups** page, choose **Create**
    **workgroup**.

05. On the **Create workgroup** page, fill in the fields as
     follows:

    FieldDescription**Workgroup name**Required. Enter a unique name for your workgroup. The name can
    contain from 1 to 128 characters, including alphanumeric characters,
    dashes, and underscores. After you create a workgroup, you cannot
    change its name.**Description**Optional. Enter a description for your workgroup. It can contain
    up to 1024 characters.**Choose the type of engine**

    Choose **Athena SQL** if you want to run
    ad-hoc SQL queries on [data in Amazon S3](data-sources-glue.md) or use
    a [prebuilt data source\
    connector](connectors-available.md) to run [federated\
    queries](federated-queries.md) on a variety of data sources external to
    Amazon S3. You can run queries using the Athena query editor, [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/athena/index.html), or [Athena\
    APIs](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/welcome.md).

    Choose **Apache Spark** if you want to
    create, edit, and run Jupyter notebook applications using Python
    and Apache Spark. Jupyter notebooks contain a list of cells that
    can include code, text, Markdown, mathematics, plots and rich
    media. Cells are run in order as calculations in an interactive
    notebook session in Athena. For information about creating and
    configuring a Spark-enabled workgroup, see [Step 1: Create a Spark enabled workgroup in Athena](notebooks-spark-getting-started.md#notebooks-spark-getting-started-creating-a-spark-enabled-workgroup).

    After you create a workgroup, its analytics engine can be
    upgraded (for example, from Athena engine version 2 to Athena engine version 3), but its engine
    type cannot be changed. For example, an Athena engine version 3 workgroup cannot
    be changed to a PySpark engine version 3 workgroup.

    **Update query engine**Choose how you want to update your workgroup when a new Athena
    engine version is released. You can let Athena decide when to update
    your workgroup or manually choose an engine version. For more
    information, see [Athena engine versioning](engine-versions.md).**Authentication**Choose **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** to use IAM
    authentication or federation for the workgroup. Choose
    **IAM Identity Center** if you want to support workforce
    identities such as users and groups from SAML 2.0 identity providers
    such as Microsoft Active Directory. For more information, see [Use IAM Identity Center enabled Athena workgroups](workgroups-identity-center.md) and [Trusted identity propagation across applications](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation.md) in the
    _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_. You cannot change the
    type of authentication for the workgroup after the workgroup is
    created.**Service role for IAM Identity Center access**Athena requires IAM permissions to access IAM Identity Center on your behalf.
    For more information about IAM service roles, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS\
    service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.
    **Location of query result**

    Enter a path to an Amazon S3 bucket or prefix. This bucket and
    prefix must exist before you can specify them. For information
    about creating an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Create a\
    bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/creatingabucket.md).

    ###### Note

    If you don't specify a query results location for the
    workgroup or in **Settings**, the Athena
    query will fail. If you run queries with the API or the
    drivers, you must specify query results location in at least
    one of two places: for individual queries with [OutputLocation](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-resultconfiguration.md#athena-Type-ResultConfiguration-OutputLocation), or for the workgroup, with
    [WorkGroupConfiguration](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-workgroupconfiguration.md).

    **Expected bucket owner**Optional. Enter the ID of the AWS account that you expect to be
    the owner of the output location bucket. This is an added security
    measure. If the account ID of the bucket owner does not match the ID
    that you specify here, attempts to output to the bucket will fail.
    For in-depth information, see [Verifying bucket ownership with bucket owner\
    condition](../../../s3/latest/userguide/bucket-owner-condition.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

    ###### Note

    The expected bucket owner setting applies only to the Amazon S3
    output location that you specify for Athena query results. It does not
    apply to other Amazon S3 locations like data source locations
    in external Amazon S3 buckets, `CTAS` and
    `INSERT INTO` destination table
    locations, `UNLOAD` statement output
    locations, operations to spill buckets for federated
    queries, or `SELECT` queries run against a
    table in another account.

    **Assign bucket owner full control over query**
    **results**

    This field is unselected by default. If you select it and
    [ACLs are enabled](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md) for the query result location
    bucket, you grant full control access over query results to the
    bucket owner. For example, if your query result location is
    owned by another account, you can use this option to grant
    ownership and full control over your query results to the other
    account.

    If the bucket's S3 Object Ownership setting is **Bucket owner preferred**, the bucket
    owner also owns all query result objects written from this
    workgroup. For example, if an external account's workgroup
    enables this option and sets its query result location to your
    account's Amazon S3 bucket which has an S3 Object Ownership setting
    of **Bucket owner preferred**, you
    own and have full control access over the external workgroup's
    query results.

    Selecting this option when the query result bucket's S3 Object
    Ownership setting is **Bucket owner**
    **enforced** has no effect. For more information, see
    [Object ownership settings](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md#object-ownership-overview) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

    **Encrypt query results**

    Optional. For all workgroup queries, encrypt the query results
    in Amazon S3. Because you must encrypt all queries in a workgroup or
    none, we recommend that you create separate workgroups for
    encrypted and non-encrypted queries.

    If selected, you can select the **Encryption**
    **type**, the **Encryption key** and
    enter the **KMS Key ARN**.

    If you don't have the key, open the [AWS KMS\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms) to create it. For more information, see
    [Creating\
    keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.md) in the
    _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

    **Set `encryption_type` as**
    **minimum encryption**

    Optional. Select this option to enforce a minimum type of
    encryption for query results for all users of the workgroup.
    Selecting this option shows you a table with the hierarchy of
    encryption types. The table also shows you which encryption
    types workgroup users will be allowed to use when you specify a
    particular encryption type as the minimum. To use this option,
    the **Override client-side settings** must not
    be selected.

    For more information, see [Configure minimum encryption for a workgroup](workgroups-minimum-encryption.md).

    **Enable S3 Access Grants**This field is selected by default when you choose
    **IAM Identity Center** as the authentication mode. When
    selected, this option applies IAM Identity Center user or group based permissions
    to Amazon S3 locations.**Create user identity based S3 prefix**When this option is selected, Athena creates an Amazon S3 prefix when
    it stores query results. The prefix is based on the user's IAM Identity Center
    user identity. **Override client-side settings**This field is unselected by default. If you select it, workgroup
    settings apply to all queries in the workgroup and override
    client-side settings. For more information, see [Override client-side settings](workgroups-settings-override.md).**Publish query metrics to CloudWatch**This field is selected by default. Publish query metrics to CloudWatch.
    See [Monitor Athena query metrics with CloudWatch](query-metrics-viewing.md).**Requester Pays S3 buckets**

    Optional. Choose **Turn on queries on requester pays**
    **buckets in Amazon S3** if workgroup users will run
    queries on data stored in Amazon S3 buckets that are configured as
    Requester Pays. The account of the user running the query is
    charged for applicable data access and data transfer fees
    associated with the query. For more information, see [Requester Pays\
    buckets](../../../s3/latest/userguide/requesterpaysbuckets.md) in the
    _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

    **Workgroup data usage alerts**Optional. Set multiple alert thresholds when queries running in
    this workgroup scan a specified amount of data within a specific
    period. Alerts are implemented using Amazon CloudWatch alarms and applies to
    all queries in the workgroup. For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/alarmthatsendsemail.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.**Tags**Optional. Add one or more tags to a workgroup. A tag is a label
    that you assign to an Athena workgroup resource. It consists of a
    key and a value. Use AWS [tagging best practices](../../../whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.md) to create a consistent set of
    tags and categorize workgroups by purpose, owner, or environment.
    You can also use tags in IAM policies, and to control billing costs.
    Do not use duplicate tag keys the same workgroup. For more
    information, see [Tag Athena resources](tags.md).

06. Choose **Create workgroup**. The workgroup appears in the list on
     the **Workgroups** page.

    In the query editor, Athena displays the current workgroup in the
     **Workgroup** option on the upper right of the console. You can
     use this option to switch workgroups. When you run queries, they run in the current
     workgroup.

07. Create IAM policies for your users, groups, or roles to enable their access to
     workgroups. The policies establish the workgroup membership and access to actions on
     a `workgroup` resource. For more information, see [Use IAM policies to control workgroup access](workgroups-iam-policy.md). For
     example JSON policies, see [Configure access to workgroups and tags](workgroups-access.md).

08. (Optional) Configure a minimal level of encryption in Amazon S3 for all query results
     from the workgroup when workgroup-wide encryption is not enforced by the override
     client-side settings option. You can use this feature to ensure that query results
     are never stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in an unencrypted state. For more information,
     see [Configure minimum encryption for a workgroup](workgroups-minimum-encryption.md).

09. (Optional) Use Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon EventBridge to monitor your workgroup's queries and
     control costs. For more information, see [Use CloudWatch and EventBridge to monitor queries and control costs](workgroups-control-limits.md).

10. (Optional) Use the Billing and Cost Management console to tag the workgroup with
     cost allocation tags. For more information, see [Using user-defined cost\
     allocation tags](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.md) in the _AWS Billing User Guide_.

11. (Optional) To get dedicated processing capacity for the queries in the workgroup,
     add the workgroup to a capacity reservation. You can assign one or more workgroups
     to a reservation. For more information, see [Manage query processing capacity](capacity-management.md).
