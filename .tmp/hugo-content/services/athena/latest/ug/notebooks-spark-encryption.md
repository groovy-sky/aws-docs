# Enable Apache Spark encryption

You can enable Apache Spark encryption on Athena. Doing so encrypts data in transit
between Spark nodes and also encrypts data at rest stored locally by Spark. To enhance
security for this data, Athena uses the following encryption configuration:

```nohighlight

spark.io.encryption.keySizeBits="256"
spark.io.encryption.keygen.algorithm="HmacSHA384"
```

To enable Spark encryption, you can use the Athena console, the AWS CLI, or the Athena
API.

###### To create a new notebook that has Spark encryption enabled

1. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

2. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
    on the left.

3. Do one of the following:

- In **Notebook explorer**, choose **Create**
**notebook**.

- In **Notebook editor**, choose **Create**
**notebook**, or choose the plus icon
( **+**) to add a notebook.

4. For **Notebook name**, enter a name for the
    notebook.

5. Expand the **Spark properties** option.

6. Select **Turn on Spark encryption**.

7. Choose **Create**.

The notebook session that you create is encrypted. Use the new notebook as you
normally would. When you later launch new sessions that use the notebook, the new
sessions will also be encrypted.

You can also use the Athena console to enable Spark encryption for an existing
notebook.

###### To enable encryption for an existing notebook

1. [Open a new session](notebooks-spark-managing.md#opening-a-previously-created-notebook) for a previously
    created notebook.

2. In the notebook editor, from the **Session** menu on the
    upper right, choose **Edit session**.

3. In the **Edit session details** dialog box, expand
    **Spark properties**.

4. Select **Turn on Spark encryption**.

5. Choose **Save**.

The console launches a new session that has encryption enabled. Later sessions
that you create for this notebook will also have encryption enabled.

You can use the AWS CLI to enable encryption when you launch a session by specifying
the appropriate Spark properties.

###### To use the AWS CLI to enable Spark encryption

1. Use a command like the following to create an engine configuration JSON
    object that specifies Spark encryption properties.

```JSON

ENGINE_CONFIGURATION_JSON=$(
     cat <<EOF
{
       "CoordinatorDpuSize": 1,
       "MaxConcurrentDpus": 20,
       "DefaultExecutorDpuSize": 1,
       "SparkProperties": {
         "spark.authenticate": "true",
         "spark.io.encryption.enabled": "true",
         "spark.network.crypto.enabled": "true"
       }
}
EOF
)
```

2. In the AWS CLI, use the `athena start-session` command and pass
    in the JSON object that you created to the
    `--engine-configuration` argument, as in the following
    example:

```shell

aws athena start-session \
      --region "region" \
      --work-group "your-work-group" \
      --engine-configuration "$ENGINE_CONFIGURATION_JSON"
```

To enable Spark encryption with the Athena API, use the [StartSession](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-startsession.md)
action and its [EngineConfiguration](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-engineconfiguration.md) `SparkProperties` parameter to specify the encryption configuration in
your `StartSession` request.
