# Service Quotas

###### Note

The Service Quotas console provides information about Amazon Athena quotas. You can also use the
Service Quotas console to [request quota increases](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1) for the quotas that are adjustable. For AWS Glue
related schema limitations, see the [AWS Glue endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/glue.md) page. For
general information about AWS service quotas, see [AWS service quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md) in the
_AWS General Reference_.

## Queries

Your account has the following query-related quotas for Amazon Athena. For details, see
the [Amazon Athena endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/athena.md#amazon-athena-limits) page of the AWS General Reference.

- **Active DDL queries** – The number of active DDL
queries. DDL queries include `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE ADD
                          PARTITION` queries.

- **DDL query timeout** – The maximum amount of time in
minutes a DDL query can run before it gets cancelled.

- **Active DML queries** – The number of active DML
queries. DML queries include `SELECT`, `CREATE TABLE AS`
(CTAS), and `INSERT INTO` queries. The specific quotas vary by AWS
Region.

- **DML query timeout** – The maximum amount of time in
minutes a DML query can run before it gets cancelled. You can request an
increase in this timeout up to a maximum of 240 minutes.

To request quota increases, you can use the [Athena Service Quotas](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1) console.

Athena processes queries by assigning resources based on the overall service load and
the number of incoming requests. Your queries may be temporarily queued before they run.
Asynchronous processes pick up the queries from queues and run them on physical
resources as soon as the resources become available and for as long as your account
configuration permits.

The Active DML queries and Active DDL queries quotas include both running and queued
queries. For example, if your Active DML query quota is 25 and your total of running and
queued queries is 26, query 26 will result in a
**`TooManyRequestsException`** error.

###### Note

If you would like to control concurrency directly for the queries you run in
Athena, you can use capacity reservations. For more information, see [Manage query processing capacity](capacity-management.md).

### Query string length

The maximum allowed query string length is 262144 bytes, where the strings are
encoded in UTF-8. This is not an adjustable quota. However, you can work around this
limitation by splitting long queries into multiple smaller queries. For more
information, see [How can I\
increase the maximum query string length in Athena?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/athena-query-string-length) in the AWS
Knowledge Center.

## Workgroups

When you work with Athena workgroups, remember the following points:

- Athena service quotas are shared across all workgroups in an account.

- The maximum number of workgroups you can create per Region in an account is
1000.

- The maximum number of prepared statements in a workgroup is 1000.

- The maximum number of tags per workgroup is 50. For more information, see
[Tag restrictions](tags.md#tag-restrictions).

## Databases, tables, and partitions

Athena uses the AWS Glue Data Catalog. For service quotas on tables, databases, and partitions
(for example, the maximum number of databases or tables per account), see [AWS Glue endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/glue.md). Note that, although
Athena supports querying AWS Glue tables that have 10 million partitions, Athena cannot read
more than 1 million partitions in a single scan.

## Amazon S3 buckets

When you work with Amazon S3 buckets, remember the following points:

- Amazon S3 has a default service quota of 10,000 buckets per account.

- Athena requires a separate bucket to log results.

- You can request a quota increase of up to one million Amazon S3 buckets per AWS
account.

## Per account API call quotas

Athena APIs have default quotas for the number of calls to the API per account (not per
query). For a complete list of the default quotas, see [Service quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/athena.md#amazon-athena-limits)
table in the AWS General Reference guide.

If you use any of these APIs and exceed the default quota for the number of calls per
second, or the burst capacity in your account, the Athena API issues an error similar to
the following: " **`"ClientError: An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when**
**calling the <API_name> operation: Rate**
**exceeded."`** Reduce the number of calls per second, or the burst capacity
for the API for this account.

You can change the Athena quota for per account API calls in the [Athena Service Quotas\
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1).
