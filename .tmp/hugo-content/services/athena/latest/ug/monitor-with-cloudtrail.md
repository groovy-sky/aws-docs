# Log Amazon Athena API calls with AWS CloudTrail

Athena is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a
user, role, or an AWS service in Athena.

CloudTrail captures all API calls for Athena as events. The calls captured include calls from the
Athena console and code calls to the Athena API operations. If you create a trail, you can
enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Athena. If
you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console
in **Event history**.

Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to
Athena, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was
made, and additional details.

To learn more about CloudTrail, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md).

You can use Athena to query CloudTrail log files from Athena itself and from other AWS services.
For more information, see [Query AWS CloudTrail logs](cloudtrail-logs.md),
[Hive JSON SerDe](hive-json-serde.md), and the AWS Big
Data Blog post [Use CTAS statements with Amazon Athena to reduce cost and improve performance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/using-ctas-statements-with-amazon-athena-to-reduce-cost-and-improve-performance),
which uses CloudTrail to provide insight into Athena usage.

## About Athena information in CloudTrail

CloudTrail is enabled on your Amazon Web Services account when you create the account. When activity
occurs in Athena, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS
service events in **Event history**. You can view, search, and download
recent events in your Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see [Viewing events with CloudTrail event\
history](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md).

For an ongoing record of events in your Amazon Web Services account, including events for Athena,
create a trail. A _trail_ enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an
Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to
all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and
delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can
configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected
in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

- [Overview\
for creating a trail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.md)

- [CloudTrail supported services and integrations](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.md#cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics-integrations)

- [Configuring\
Amazon SNS notifications for CloudTrail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/getting-notifications-top-level.md)

- [Receiving CloudTrail log files from multiple regions](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.md) and [Receiving CloudTrail log files from multiple accounts](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.md)

All Athena actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the [Amazon Athena API Reference](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference.md). For example, calls to the [StartQueryExecution](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-startqueryexecution.md) and
[GetQueryResults](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-startqueryexecution.md)
actions generate entries in the CloudTrail log files.

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The
identity information helps you determine the following:

- Whether the request was made with root or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user
credentials.

- Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or
federated user.

- Whether the request was made by another AWS service.

For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity\
element](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md).

## Understand Athena log file entries

A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3
bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event
represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested
action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files
aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't appear in any
specific order.

###### Note

To prevent unintended disclosure of sensitive information, the
`queryString` entry in both the `StartQueryExecution` and
`CreateNamedQuery` logs has a value of `***OMITTED***`.
This is by design. To access the actual query string, you can use the Athena [GetQueryExecution](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getqueryexecution.md) API and pass in the value of
`responseElements.queryExecutionId` from the CloudTrail log.

The following examples demonstrate CloudTrail log entries for:

- [StartQueryExecution\
(Successful)](#startqueryexecution-successful)

- [StartQueryExecution (Failed)](#startqueryexecution-failed)

- [CreateNamedQuery](#createnamedquery)
