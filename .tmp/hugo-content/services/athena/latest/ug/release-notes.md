To learn more, see [Query AWS Glue Data Catalog materialized views](querying-iceberg-gdc-mv.md) and [Using materialized views](../../../emr/latest/releaseguide/emr-spark-materialized-views.md).

### November 21, 2025

Published on 2025-11-21

Athena announces the following features and improvements.

- **Amazon Athena for Apache Spark is now available in notebooks** –
Provides data engineers, analysts, and data scientists with a unified workspace to query data, develop jobs, train models, and work with AI. Athena for Apache Spark runs on Spark 3.5.6 and has new debugging features, real-time monitoring through Spark UI, Spark Connect for secure cluster interaction, and AWS Lake Formation table-level access controls. Learn more at the [SageMaker user guide](../../../sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/notebooks.md).

- **Capacity Reservations cost and performance controls** –
You can now set Data Processing Unit (DPU) usage limits at the workgroup or query level and get DPU usage details for queries that you run on Capacity Reservations. These controls help you fine-tune query performance and manage costs by controlling resource usage for your most important SQL workloads. To learn more, see [Control capacity usage](capacity-management-control-capacity-usage.md).

- **Capacity Reservations auto-scaling solution** –
You can now automatically adjust Capacity Reservations based on utilization. Athena's solution uses CloudFormation and Step Functions to remove the need for manual capacity adjustments, helping you balance performance requirements with cost optimization, and is customizable for different needs. To learn more, see [Automatically adjust capacity](capacity-management-automatically-adjust-capacity.md).

- **Optimization with Iceberg statistics** –
Athena has enhanced how it uses Iceberg statistics to make intelligent decisions about join ordering, filters, and aggregation behavior that can improve query performance and reduce costs. To learn more, see [Use Iceberg table statistics](querying-iceberg-data-optimization.md#querying-iceberg-data-optimization-statistics).

- **Iceberg Parquet column indexing** –
Athena now supports Parquet column indexing on Iceberg tables for precise data pruning during query execution. It leverages page-level min/max statistics to reduce the amount of data scanned, improving query performance and lowering costs, particularly for queries with selective filter predicates on sorted columns. To learn more, see [Use Parquet column indexing](querying-iceberg-data-optimization.md#querying-iceberg-data-optimization-parquet-column-indexing).

- **Iceberg performance enhancements with Lake Formation** –
Athena has added new partition pruning behaviors for Iceberg tables that have Lake Formation row filters and column masks, and additional predicate pushdown behaviors for all other table types that have Lake Formation row filters and column masks. This update enhances query performance while maintaining security protections.

- **Query result reuse** –
Athena has improved query result reuse to enable more queries to benefit from cached results. Athena now treats semantically equivalent queries as identical regardless of formatting differences. Customers who use query result reuse will automatically benefit from increased cache hit rates, resulting in faster query execution and reduced costs, with no action needed. To learn more, see [Reuse query results in Athena](reusing-query-results.md).

- **Upgraded data lake file SerDes** –
Athena has upgraded its SerDes for Parquet, JSON, CSV, and text files. This improves query performance and reliability while correcting for scenarios where previous SerDes returned non-deterministic or incorrect results. Customers will automatically benefit from these improvements without any action needed as they are upgraded based on compatibility checks performed by Athena.

- **Hudi 0.15.0 upgrade** –
You can now use Athena to query Hudi 0.15.0 tables. For more information, see [Query Apache Hudi datasets](querying-hudi.md).

- **Browser trusted identity propagation integration** – Athena added a new authentication plugin to support JWT trusted identity propagation
integration with JDBC and ODBC drivers. This authentication type allows you to fetch a
JSON web token (JWT) from an external identity provider and authenticates with Athena.

### August 15, 2025

Published on 2025-08-15

Athena announces the following features and improvements.

- **CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) queries for S3 Tables** –
Athena now supports CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) queries for S3 Tables. For more
information, see [Create S3 Tables in Athena](gdc-register-s3-table-bucket-cat.md#gdc-create-s3-tables-athena).

- **Removal of legacy Iceberg table statistics support** –
We've removed support for tracking legacy Iceberg table statistics in Athena. If
you have tables that were written before May 7, 2023, you must re-analyze them.

### August 11, 2025

Published on 2025-08-11

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements:

- We've changed the behavior of `lead()` and `lag()` with
respect to handling of `NULL` offsets. Prior to this change, passing
in `NULL` offset to `lead()` and `lag()` would
produce `NULL` as output. Now, Athena returns the error
**Offset must not be null**.

This is done to make the behavior compliant with SQL standards and to prevent
unexpected `NULL` in the output by proactively preventing them in the
input. With this, you are advised to not pass `NULL` as offset to
`lead()` and `lag()`. While it's not recommended, you
can preserve the old behavior by rewriting as shown in the following
example:

**Original query pattern**

```sql

lead(column1, column_containing_nulls) OVER (...) as transformed
```

**Updated query pattern**

```sql

CASE
      WHEN column_containing_nulls IS NULL THEN NULL
      ELSE (lead(column1, coalesce(column_containing_nulls, 1)) OVER (...))
    END as transformed
```

### June 03, 2025

Published on 2025-06-03

Athena introduces managed query results, a new feature that automatically stores,
secures, and manages query result data for you at no cost. Managed query results helps
you get started in fewer steps by removing the need for Amazon S3 buckets to store query
results and clean up processes to delete query results you no longer need. Managed query
results is generally available in [all regions where Athena is available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services) except AWS GovCloud (US) Region and China Regions.

When you use managed query results, you can continue to access query results through
the same interfaces as with traditional S3 bucket storage. To get started, use the
AWS Management Console, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI to configure your new or existing workgroups to use managed
query results. For more information, see [Managed query results](managed-results.md).

### December 3, 2024

Published on 2024-12-03

Athena announces the following features and improvements.

- **Data source connections**– Amazon Athena
announces a streamlined console and API workflow for creating data source
connections. You can now create and manage Athena data connections entirely
within the Athena console, and the properties for your connections are now
centrally stored in the [AWS Glue Data Catalog](../../../glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.md).

Storing connection properties in AWS Glue lets you reuse the connections across
other AWS services. For example, after you configure an [Athena\
connector to Amazon DynamoDB](connectors-dynamodb.md), you can reuse the properties and permissions
that you specified for the connection for an AWS Glue ETL job that accesses your
data in DynamoDB. For more information, see [Use the Athena console to connect to a data source](connect-to-a-data-source-console-steps.md) in the

### April 16, 2024

Published on 2024-04-16

Use the new Amazon Athena federated query passthrough feature to run entire queries
directly on the underlying data source. Federated passthrough queries help you take
advantage of the unique functions, query language, and performance capabilities of the
original data source. For example, you can run Athena queries on DynamoDB using the [PartiQL\
language](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference-select.md). Federated passthrough queries are also useful when you want to run
`SELECT` queries that aggregate, join, or invoke functions of your data
source that are not available in Athena. Using passthrough queries can reduce the amount
of data processed by Athena and result in faster query times.

For more information, see [Use federated passthrough queries](federated-query-passthrough.md). To upgrade the connectors that you
use today to the latest version, see [Update a data source connector](connectors-updating.md).

### April 10, 2024

## Athena release notes for 2023

### December 14, 2023

Published on 2023-12-14

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements.

Athena releases JDBC driver version 2.1.3. The driver resolves the following
issues:

- Logging has been improved to avoid conflicts with Spring Boot and Gradle
application logging.

- When using the `executeBatch()` JDBC method to insert records, the
driver incorrectly inserted only one record. Because Athena does not support
batch execution of queries, the driver now reports an error when you use
`executeBatch()`. To work around the limitation, you can submit
single queries in a loop.

You can now query data in the [Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/express-one-zone) for fast query
results. S3 Express One Zone is a high-performance, single-Availability Zone storage class
purpose-built to deliver consistent, single-digit millisecond data access for your most
frequently accessed data and latency-sensitive applications. To get started, move your
data to S3 Express One Zone storage and catalog the data with [AWS Glue Data Catalog](../../../glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.md) for a seamless
query experience in Athena.

For more information, see [Query S3 Express One Zone data](querying-express-one-zone.md).

### November 27, 2023

Published on 2023-11-27

Athena announces the following features and improvements.

- Glue Data Catalog views – Glue Data Catalog views
provide a single common view across AWS services like Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift. In
Glue Data Catalog views, access permissions are defined by the user who created the
view instead of the user who queries the view. These views provide greater
access control, help to ensure complete records, offer enhanced security, and
can prevent access to underlying tables.

For more information, see [Use Data Catalog views in Athena](views-glue.md).

- CloudTrail Lake support – You can now use
Amazon Athena to analyze data in [AWS CloudTrail\
Lake](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake.md). AWS CloudTrail Lake is a managed data lake for CloudTrail that you can use
to aggregate, immutably store, and analyze activity logs for audit, security,
and operational investigations. To query your CloudTrail Lake activity logs from
Athena, you do not have to move data or build separate data processing pipelines.
No ETL operations are required.

To get started, enable data federation in CloudTrail Lake. When you share your CloudTrail
Lake event data store metadata with AWS Glue Data Catalog, CloudTrail creates the necessary
AWS Glue Data Catalog resources and registers the data with AWS Lake Formation. In Lake Formation, you can
specify the users and roles that can use Athena to query your event data
store.

For more information, see [Enable Lake query\
federation](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-federation.md) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

### November 17, 2023

Published on 2023-11-17

Athena announces the following features and improvements.

#### Features

- Cost-based optimizer – Athena
announces general availability of cost-based optimization using statistics
from AWS Glue. To optimize your queries in Athena SQL, you can request that
Athena gather table or column-level statistics for your tables in AWS Glue. If
all of the tables in your query have statistics, Athena uses the statistics
to examine alternate execution plans and select the one that is most likely
to be the fastest.

For more information, see [Use the cost-based optimizer](cost-based-optimizer.md).

- Amazon EMR Studio integration – You can
now use Athena in an Amazon EMR Studio without having to use the Athena console
directly. With the Athena integration in Amazon EMR, you can perform the following
tasks:

- Perform Athena SQL queries

- View query results

- View query history

- View saved queries

- Perform parameterized queries

- View databases, tables, and views for a data catalog

For more information, see Amazon EMR Studio in the [AWS service integrations with Athena](athena-aws-service-integrations.md) topic.

- Nested access control – Athena
announces support for Lake Formation access control for nested data. In Lake Formation, you can
define and apply data filters on nested columns that have
`struct` data types. You can use data filtering to restrict
user access to sub-structures of nested columns. For information on how to
create data filters for nested data, see [Creating a\
data filter](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/creating-data-filters.md) in the _AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide_.

- Provisioned capacity usage metrics –
Athena announces new CloudWatch metrics for capacity reservations. You can use the
new metrics to keep track of the number of DPUs you have provisioned and the
number of DPUs being used by your queries. When queries finish, you can also
view the number of DPUs the query consumed.

For more information, see [Monitor Athena query metrics with CloudWatch](query-metrics-viewing.md).

#### Improvements

- Error message change – The
`Insufficient Lake Formation permissions` error message now reads
`Table not found` or `Schema not found`. This
change was made to prevent malicious actors from inferring the existence of
table or database resources from the error message.

### November 16, 2023

Published on 2023-11-16

Athena releases a new JDBC driver that improves the experience of connecting to,

For more information, see [Athena JDBC 3.x driver](jdbc-v3-driver.md).

### October 31, 2023

Published on 2023-10-31

Amazon Athena announces 1-hour reservations for provisioned capacity. Starting today, you
can reserve and release provisioned capacity after one hour. This change makes it
simpler to optimize cost for workloads whose demand changes over time.

Provisioned capacity is a feature of Athena that provides workload management
capabilities that help you prioritize, control, and scale your most important
interactive workloads. You can add capacity at any time to increase the number of
queries that you run concurrently, control which workloads use the capacity, and share
capacity among workloads.

### July 3, 2023

Published on 2023-07-25

As of July 3, 2023, Athena started redacting the query strings from CloudTrail logs. The
query string now has a value of `***OMITTED***`. This change has been made to
prevent unintended disclosure of table names or filter values that could include
sensitive information. If you previously relied on CloudTrail logs to access full query
strings, we recommend using the `Athena::GetQueryExecution` API and passing
in the value of `responseElements.queryExecutionId` from the CloudTrail log. For
more information, see the [GetQueryExecution](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getqueryexecution.md) action in the
_Amazon Athena API Reference_.

### June 30, 2023

You can now use AWS PrivateLink for IPv6 inbound connections to Amazon Athena.

Amazon Athena has expanded its support for inbound connections through Internet Protocol
Version 6 (IPv6) endpoints to include [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink). Starting today, you can connect to Athena securely and
privately using AWS PrivateLink from your [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.md), in
addition to the public IPv6 endpoints that were [previously available](#release-note-2022-11-14).

The rapid growth of the Internet is exhausting the availability of Internet Protocol
version 4 (IPv4) addresses. IPv6 increases the number of available addresses by several
times so that you no longer have to manage overlapping address spaces in your VPCs. With
this release, you can now combine the benefits of IPv6 addressing with the security and
performance advantages of AWS PrivateLink.

To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/index.html) or [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools)
to specify an endpoint. For more information on service endpoints and Athena service

- Failure to return data when `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN
                          ANALYZE` queries used `SQLPrepare()` and
`SQLExecute()`.

For more information, and to download the new drivers, release notes, and
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md).

### May 8, 2023

Published on 2023-05-08

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements.

- Updated Hudi integration – Athena has
updated its integration with Apache Hudi. You can now use Athena to query Hudi
0.12.2 tables, and Hudi metadata listing for Hudi tables is now supported. For
information, see [Query Apache Hudi datasets](querying-hudi.md)
and [Use Hudi metadata for improved performance](querying-hudi-metadata-table.md).

- Timestamp conversion fix – Corrected the
handling of timestamp conversions to a lower precision data type. Previously,
Athena engine version 3 incorrectly rounded the value to the target type instead of truncating
it during casting.

The following examples illustrate the incorrect handling prior to the
fix.

###### Example 1: Casting from a timestamp in microseconds to milliseconds

Sample data

```nohighlight

A, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383
B, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.382
C, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383345
D, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383945
E, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383345734
F, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383945278
```

The following query tries to retrieve the timestamps that match a specific
value.

```sql

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE timestamps.col = timestamp'2020-06-10 15:55:23.383'
```

The query returned the following results.

```nohighlight

A, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383
C, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383
E, 2020-06-10 15:55:23.383
```

Prior to the fix, Athena did not include the values `2020-06-10
                          15:55:23.383945` or `2020-06-10 15:55:23.383945278` because
they got rounded to `2020-06-10 15:55:23.384`.

###### Example 2: Casting from a timestamp to date

The following query returned an erroneous result.

```sql

SELECT date(timestamp '2020-12-31 23:59:59.999')
```

Result

`2021-01-01`

Prior to the fix, Athena rounded up the value, therefore moving the day
forward. Such values are now truncated rather than rounded up.

### April 28, 2023

resolved an issue.

#### New features

- You can now use customizable relying party identifiers with AD FS
authentication.

- You can now add the name of the application that is using the connector to
the user agent string.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed an error that occurred when `getSchema()` was used to
retrieve a non-existent schema.

For more information, and to download the new drivers, release notes, and
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

### April 14, 2023

Published on 2023-06-20

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements.

- When you cast a string to timestamp, a space is required between the day and
time or timezone. For more information, see [Space required between date and time values when casting from string to timestamp](engine-versions-reference-0003.md#engine-versions-reference-0003-timestamp-cast-space).

- Removed a breaking change in the way timestamp precision was handled. To
maintain consistency between previous engine versions and Athena engine version 3, timestamp precision now
defaults to milliseconds rather than microseconds.

- Athena now consistently enforces access for the query output bucket when it
runs queries. Please make sure that all IAM principals that run the [StartQueryExecution](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-startqueryexecution.md) action have the [S3:GetBucketLocation](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getbucketlocation.md) permission on the query output bucket.

### April 4, 2023

Published on 2023-04-04

You can now use Amazon Athena to create and query views on federated data sources. Use a
single federated view to query multiple external tables or subsets of data. This

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements.

- In the responses to the `GetQueryExecution` and
`BatchGetQueryExecution` Athena API actions, the new
`subStatementType` field shows the type of query that ran (for
example, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UNLOAD`,
`CREATE_TABLE`, or `CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT`).

- Fixed a bug in which manifest files were not encrypted correctly for Apache
Hive write operations.

- Athena engine version 3 now correctly handles `NaN` and `Infinity`
values in the `approx_percentile` function. The
`approx_percentile` function returns the approximate percentile
for a dataset at the given percentage.

Athena engine version 2 incorrectly treats `NaN` as a value greater than
`Infinity`. Athena engine version 3 now handles `NaN` and
`Infinity` in accordance with the treatment of these values in
other analytic and statistical functions. The following points describe the new
behavior in greater detail.

- If `NaN` is present in the dataset, Athena returns
`NaN`.

- If `NaN` is not present, but `Infinity` is
present, Athena treats `Infinity` as a very large
number.

- If multiple `Infinity` values are present, Athena treats
them as the same very large number. If necessary, Athena outputs
`Infinity`.

- If a single dataset has both - `Infinity` and
`-Double.MAX_VALUE`, and a percentile result is
`-Double.MAX_VALUE`, Athena returns
`-Infinity`.

- If a single dataset has both `Infinity` and
`Double.MAX_VALUE`, and a percentile result is
`Double.MAX_VALUE`, Athena returns
`Infinity`.

- To exclude `Infinity` and `NaN` from a
calculation, use the `is_finite()` function, as in the
following example.

```sql

approx_percentile(x, 0.5) FILTER (WHERE is_finite(x))
```

### March 27, 2023

Published on 2023-03-27

You can now specify a minimum level of encryption for Athena SQL workgroups in
Amazon Athena. This feature ensures that the results from all queries in the Athena SQL
workgroup are encrypted at or above the level of encryption that you specify. You can
choose among several levels of encryption strength to safeguard your data. To configure
the minimum level of encryption that you want, you can use the Athena console, AWS CLI,
API, or SDK.

The minimum encryption feature is not available for Apache Spark enabled workgroups.
For more information, see [Configure minimum encryption for a workgroup](workgroups-minimum-encryption.md).

### March 17, 2023

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements.

- Fixed an issue with the Amazon Athena DynamoDB connector that caused queries to fail
with the error message **`KeyConditionExpressions must only contain one**
**condition per key`**.

This issue occurs because Athena engine version 3 recognizes the opportunity to push down more
kinds of predicates than Athena engine version 2. In Athena engine version 3, clauses like `some_column
                          LIKE 'someprefix%` are pushed down as filter predicates that apply a
lower and upper bound on a given column. Athena engine version 2 did not push these predicates
down. In Athena engine version 3, when `some_column` is a sort key column, the engine
pushes the filter predicate down to the DynamoDB connector. The filter predicate
then gets further pushed down to the DynamoDB service. Because DynamoDB does not
support more than one filter condition on a sort key, DynamoDB returns the
error.

To correct this issue, update your Amazon Athena DynamoDB connector to version
2023.11.1. For instructions on updating the connector, see [Update a data source connector](connectors-updating.md).

### March 8, 2023

Published on 2023-03-08

Apache Iceberg support in Athena engine version 3 now offers the following enhanced ACID transaction
features:

- ORC and Avro support – Create Iceberg
tables using the [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) and
[Apache ORC](https://orc.apache.org/) row and column-based
file formats. Support for these formats is in addition to the existing support
for Parquet.

- MERGE INTO – Use the `MERGE
                          INTO` command to merge data at scale efficiently. `MERGE
                          INTO` combines the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and
`DELETE` operations into one transaction. This reduces the
processing overhead in your data pipeline and takes less SQL to write. For more
information, see [Update Iceberg table data](querying-iceberg-updating-iceberg-table-data.md) and [MERGE INTO](merge-into-statement.md).

- CTAS and VIEW support – Use the
`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) and `CREATE VIEW`
statements with Iceberg tables. For more information, see [CREATE TABLE AS](create-table-as.md) and [CREATE VIEW and CREATE PROTECTED MULTI DIALECT VIEW](create-view.md).

- VACUUM support – You can use the
`VACUUM` statement to optimize your data lake by deleting
snapshots and data that are no longer required. You can use this feature to
improve read performance and meet regulatory requirements like [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation). For more information, see [Optimize Iceberg tables](querying-iceberg-data-optimization.md) and [VACUUM](vacuum-statement.md).

These new features require Athena engine version 3 and are available in all Regions where Athena is
supported. You can use them with the [Athena\
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home), [drivers](athena-bi-tools-jdbc-odbc.md), or [API](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/welcome.md).

For information about using Iceberg in Athena, see [Query Apache Iceberg tables](querying-iceberg.md).

### November 14, 2022

Published on 2022-11-14

Amazon Athena now supports IPv6 endpoints for inbound connections that you can use to
invoke Athena functions over IPv6. You can use this feature to meet IPv6 compliance
requirements. It also removes the need for additional networking equipment to handle
address translation between IPv4 and IPv6.

To use this feature, configure your applications to use the new Athena dual-stack
endpoints, which support both IPv4 and IPv6. Dual-stack endpoints use the format
`athena.region.api.aws`. For example, the
dual-stack endpoint in the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `athena.us-east-1.api.aws`.

When you make a request to a dual-stack Athena endpoint, the endpoint resolves to an
IPv6 or an IPv4 address depending on the protocol used by your network and client. To
connect programmatically to an AWS service, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/index.html) or [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools)
to specify an endpoint.

For more information on service endpoints, see [AWS service endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md). To learn more
about Athena's service endpoints, see [Amazon Athena endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/athena.md) in the
AWS documentation.

You can use the new Athena dual-stack endpoints for inbound connections at no
additional cost. Dual-stack endpoints are generally available in all
AWS Regions.

### November 11, 2022

Published on 2022-11-11

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements.

- Expanded Lake Formation fine-grained access control
– You can now use [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation) fine-grained access control policies in Athena queries for
data stored in any supported file or table format. You can use fine-grained
access control in Lake Formation to restrict access to data in query results using data
filters to achieve column-level, row-level, and cell-level security. Supported
table formats in Athena include Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Apache Hive.
Expanded fine-grained access control is available in all regions supported by
Athena. The expanded table and file format support requires [Athena engine version 3](engine-versions-reference-0003.md), which [offers new features and improved query performance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/upgrade-to-athena-engine-version-3-to-increase-query-performance-and-access-more-analytics-features), but does not
change how you set up fine-grained access control policies in Lake Formation.

Use of this expanded fine-grained access control in Athena has the following
considerations:

- EXPLAIN – Row or cell filtering
information defined in Lake Formation and query statistics information are not
shown in the output of `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN
                                  ANALYZE`. For information about `EXPLAIN` in Athena,
see [Using EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE in Athena](athena-explain-statement.md).

- External Hive metastores –
Apache Hive hidden columns cannot be used for fine-grained access
control filtering, and Apache Hive hidden system tables are not
supported by fine-grained access control. For more information, see
[Considerations and limitations](connect-to-data-source-hive.md#connect-to-a-data-source-hive-considerations) in
the topic [Use an external Hive metastore](connect-to-data-source-hive.md).

- Query statistics – Stage-level
input and output row count and data size information are not shown in
Athena query statistics when a query has row-level filters defined in
Lake Formation. For information about seeing statistics for Athena queries, see
[View statistics and execution details for completed queries](query-stats.md) and [GetQueryRuntimeStatistics](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getqueryruntimestatistics.md).

- Workgroups – Users in the same
Athena workgroup can see the data that Lake Formation fine-grained access control
has configured to be accessible to the workgroup. For information about
using Athena to query data registered with Lake Formation, see [Use Athena to query data registered with AWS Lake Formation](security-athena-lake-formation.md).

For information about using fine-grained access control in Lake Formation, see [Manage fine-grained access control using AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/manage-fine-grained-access-control-using-aws-lake-formation) in the _AWS Big Data Blog_.

- Athena Federated Query – Athena Federated Query now preserves the
original casing of field names in `struct` objects. Previously,
`struct` field names were automatically made lower case.

### November 8, 2022

Published on 2022-11-08

You can now use the query result reuse caching feature to accelerate repeat queries in
Athena. A repeat query is a SQL query identical to one submitted just recently that
produces the same results. When you need to run identical multiple queries, result reuse
caching can decrease the time required to produce results. Result reuse caching also
lowers costs by reducing the number of bytes scanned.

For more information, see [Reuse query results in Athena](reusing-query-results.md).

### October 13, 2022

Published on 2022-10-13

Athena announces Athena engine version 3.

supporting all the features of Athena engine version 2, Athena engine version 3 includes over 50 new SQL
functions, 30 new features, and more than 90 query performance improvements. With
today’s launch, Athena is also introducing a continuous integration approach to open
source software management that improves currency with the Trino and [Presto](https://prestodb.io/) projects so that you get faster access to
community improvements, integrated and tuned within the Athena engine.

For more information, see [Athena engine version 3](engine-versions-reference-0003.md).

### October 10, 2022

following changes:

- New driver version, JDBC version, and plugin name properties were added to the
user-agent string in the credentials provider class.

- Error messages were corrected and necessary information added.

- Prepared statements are now deallocated if the connection is closed or the
Athena prepared statement execution fails.

For more information, and to download the new drivers, release notes, and
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

### September 23, 2022

Published on 2022-09-26

The Amazon Athena Neptune connector now supports case insensitive matching on column and
table names.

- The Neptune data source connector can resolve column names on Neptune tables
that use casing even if the column names are all lower cased in the table in
AWS Glue. To enable this behavior, set the `enable_caseinsensitivematch`
environment variable to `true` on the Neptune connector Lambda
function.

- Because AWS Glue supports only lower case table names, when you create a AWS Glue
table for Neptune, specify the AWS Glue table parameter `"glabel" =
                              table_name`.

For more information about the Neptune connector, see [Amazon Athena Neptune connector](connectors-neptune.md).

### September 13, 2022

Published on 2022-09-13

Athena announces the following fixes and improvements.

- External Hive metastore – Athena now
returns `NULL` instead of throwing an exception when a
`WHERE` clause includes a partition that doesn't exist in an
[external Hive metastore](connect-to-data-source-hive.md)
(EHMS). The new behavior matches that of the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

- Parameterized queries – Values in [parameterized\
queries](querying-with-prepared-statements.md) can now be cast to the `DOUBLE` data type.

- Apache Iceberg – Write operations to
[Iceberg\
tables](querying-iceberg.md) now succeed when [Object Lock](../../../s3/latest/userguide/object-lock.md) is
enabled on an Amazon S3 bucket.

Published on 2022-02-23

Athena announces the following fixes and performance improvements.

- Memory handling improvements to enhance performance and reduce memory
errors.

- Athena now reads ORC timestamp columns with time zone information stored in
stripe footers and writes ORC files with time zone (UTC) in footers. This only
impacts the behavior of ORC timestamp reads if the ORC file to be read was
created in a non-UTC time zone environment.

- Fixed incorrect symlink table size estimates that resulted in suboptimal query
plans.

- Lateral exploded views can now be queried in the Athena console from Hive
metastore data sources.

- Improved Amazon S3 read error messages to include more detailed [Amazon S3 error\
code](../../../s3/latest/api/errorresponses.md#ErrorCodeList) information.

- Fixed an issue that caused output files in ORC format to become incompatible
with Apache Hive 3.1.

- Fixed an issue that caused table names with quotes to fail in certain DML and
DDL queries.

### February 15, 2022

Published on 2022-02-15

Amazon Athena has increased the active DML query quota in all AWS Regions. Active
queries include both running and queued queries. With this change, you can now have more
DML queries in an active state than before.

For information about Athena service quotas, see [Service Quotas](service-limits.md). For the query quotas in the Region where you use
Athena, see [Amazon Athena endpoints and\
quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/athena.md#amazon-athena-limits) in the _AWS General Reference_.

To monitor your quota usage, you can use CloudWatch usage metrics. Athena publishes the
`ActiveQueryCount` metric in the `AWS/Usage` namespace. For
more information, see [Monitor Athena usage metrics with CloudWatch](monitoring-athena-usage-metrics.md).

After reviewing your usage, you can use the [Service Quotas](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) console to request a quota
increase. If you previously requested a quota increase for your account, your requested
quota still applies if it exceeds the new default active DML query quota. Otherwise, all
accounts use the new default.

### February 14, 2022

Published on 2022-02-14

This release adds the `ErrorType` subfield to the [AthenaError](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-athenaerror.md) response object in the Athena [GetQueryExecution](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-getqueryexecution.md) API action.

While the existing `ErrorCategory` field indicates the general source of a
failed query (system, user, or other), the new `ErrorType` field provides
more granular information about the error that occurred. Combine the information from
both fields to gain insight into the causes of query failure.

For more information, see [Athena error catalog](error-reference.md).

### February 9, 2022

Published on 2022-02-09

The old Athena console is no longer available. Athena's new console supports all of the

Expected bucket owner – As an added security
measure, you can now optionally specify the AWS account ID that you expect to be the
owner of your query results output location bucket in Athena. If the account ID of the
query results bucket owner does not match the account ID that you specify, attempts to
output to the bucket will fail with an Amazon S3 permissions error. You can make this setting
at the client or workgroup level.

For more information, see [Specify a query result location](query-results-specify-location.md).

### January 28, 2022

Published on 2022-01-28

## Athena release notes for 2021

### November 26, 2021

Published on 2021-11-26

Athena announces the public preview of Athena ACID transactions, which add write,
delete, update, and time travel operations to Athena's SQL data manipulation language
(DML). Athena ACID transactions enable multiple concurrent users to make reliable,
row-level modifications to Amazon S3 data. Built on the [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) table format, Athena ACID
transactions are compatible with other services and engines such as [Amazon EMR](../../../emr/latest/managementguide/emr-what-is-emr.md) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) that
also support the Iceberg table formats.

Athena ACID transactions and familiar SQL syntax simplify updates to your business and
regulatory data. For example, to respond to a data erasure request, you can perform a
SQL `DELETE` operation. To make manual record corrections, you can use a
single `UPDATE` statement. To recover data that was recently deleted, you can
issue time travel queries using a `SELECT` statement. Athena transactions are
available through Athena's console, API operations, and ODBC and JDBC drivers.

For more information, see [Use Athena ACID transactions](acid-transactions.md).

### November 24, 2021

Published on 2021-11-24

Athena announces support for reading and writing [ZStandard](http://facebook.github.io/zstd) compressed ORC, Parquet, and
textfile data. Athena uses ZStandard compression level 3 when writing ZStandard
compressed data.

For information about data compression in Athena, see [Use compression in Athena](compression-formats.md).

### November 22, 2021

Published on 2021-11-22

You can now manage AWS Step Functions workflows from the Amazon Athena console, making it easier to
build scalable data processing pipelines, execute queries based on custom business
logic, automate administrative and alerting tasks, and more.

Step Functions is now integrated with Athena's upgraded console, and you can use it to view an
interactive workflow diagram of your state machines that invoke Athena. To get started,
select **Workflows** from the left navigation panel. If you have
existing state machines with Athena queries, select a state machine to view an
interactive diagram of the workflow. If you are new to Step Functions, you can get started by
launching a sample project from the Athena console and customizing it to suit your use
cases.

For more information, see [Build and orchestrate ETL pipelines using Amazon Athena and AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/build-and-orchestrate-etl-pipelines-using-amazon-athena-and-aws-step-functions), or
consult the [Step Functions\
documentation](../../../step-functions/latest/dg/connect-athena.md).

### November 18, 2021

Published on 2021-11-18

Athena announces new features and improvements.

- Support for spill-to-disk for aggregation queries that contain
`DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, or both, as in the following
example:

```sql

SELECT array_agg(orderstatus ORDER BY orderstatus)
FROM orders
GROUP BY orderpriority, custkey
```

- Addressed memory handling issues for queries that use `DISTINCT`.
To avoid error messages like **`Query exhausted resources at this scale**
**factor`** when you use `DISTINCT` queries, choose
columns that have a low cardinality for `DISTINCT`, or reduce the
data size of the query.

- In `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries that do not specify a specific column,
improved performance and memory usage by keeping only the count without row
buffering.

- Introduced the following string functions.

- `translate(source, from, to)` – Returns the
`source` string with the characters found in the
`from` string replaced by the corresponding characters in
the `to` string. If the `from` string contains
duplicates, only the first is used. If the `source` character
does not exist in the `from` string, the `source`
character is copied without translation. If the index of the matching
character in the `from` string is greater than the length of
the `to` string, the character is omitted from the resulting
string.

- `concat_ws(string0, array(varchar))` – Returns the
concatenation of elements in the array using `string0` as a
separator. If `string0` is null, then the return value is
null. Any null values in the array are skipped.

- Fixed a bug in which queries failed when trying to access a missing subfield
in a `struct`. Queries now return a null for the missing
subfield.

- Fixed an issue with inconsistent hashing for the decimal data type.

- Fixed an issue that caused exhausted resources when there were too many
columns in a partition.

### November 17, 2021

Published on 2021-11-17

[Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena) now supports partition
indexing to accelerate queries on partitioned tables in the [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue).

When querying partitioned tables, Athena retrieves and filters the available table
partitions to the subset relevant to your query. As new data and partitions are added,
more time is required to process the partitions and query runtime can increase. To
optimize partition processing and improve query performance on highly partitioned
tables, Athena now supports [AWS Glue partition indexes](../../../glue/latest/dg/partition-indexes.md).

For more information, see [Optimize queries with AWS Glue partition indexing and filtering](glue-best-practices-partition-index.md).

### November 16, 2021

navigation panel on the left.

### November 12, 2021

Published on 2021-11-12

You can now use Amazon Athena to run federated queries on data sources located in an AWS
account other than your own. Until today, querying this data required the data source
and its connector to use the same AWS account as the user that queried the
data.

As a data administrator, you can enable cross-account federated queries by sharing
your data connector with a data analyst's account. As a data analyst, you can add a data
connector that a data administrator has shared with you to your account. Configuration
changes to the connector in the originating account apply automatically to the shared
connector.

For information about enabling cross-account federated queries, see [Enable cross-account federated queries](xacct-fed-query-enable.md). To learn
about querying federated sources, see [Use Amazon Athena Federated Query](federated-queries.md) and [Run federated queries](running-federated-queries.md).

You can use the `UNLOAD` statement to write the output of a
`SELECT` query to the PARQUET, ORC, AVRO, and JSON formats.

For more information, see [UNLOAD](unload.md).

### July 30, 2021

Published on 2021-07-30

Athena announces the following feature enhancements and bug fixes.

- Dynamic filtering and partition pruning
– Improvements increase performance and reduce the amount of data scanned
in certain queries, as in the following example.

This example assumes that `Table_B` is an unpartitioned table that
has file sizes that add up to less than 20 MB. For queries like this, less data
is read from `Table_A` and the query completes more quickly.

```sql

SELECT *
FROM Table_A
JOIN Table_B ON Table_A.date = Table_B.date
WHERE Table_B.column_A = "value"
```

- ORDER BY with LIMIT, DISTINCT with LIMIT
– Performance improvements to queries that use `ORDER BY` or
`DISTINCT` followed by a `LIMIT` clause.

- Amazon Glacier Deep Archive files – When Athena
queries a table that contains a mix of [Amazon Glacier\
Deep Archive files](../../../s3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.md#sc-glacier) and non-Amazon Glacier files, Athena now skips the Amazon Glacier Deep
Archive files for you. Previously, you were required to manually move these
files from the query location or the query would fail. If you want to use Athena
to query objects in Amazon Glacier Deep Archive storage, you must restore them. For more
information, see [Restoring an archived\
object](../../../s3/latest/userguide/restoring-objects.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- Fixed a bug in which empty files created by the CTAS `bucketed_by` [table property](create-table-as.md#ctas-table-properties) were not encrypted correctly.

### July 21, 2021

Published on 2021-07-21

With the July 2021 release of [Microsoft Power BI\
Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop), you can create reports and dashboards using a native data source
connector for Amazon Athena. The connector for Amazon Athena is available as a standard
connector in Power BI, supports [DirectQuery](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery), and enables analysis on large datasets and content refresh
through [Power BI\
Gateway](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/gateway).

Because the connector uses your existing ODBC data source name (DSN) to connect to and
run queries on Athena, it requires the Athena ODBC driver. To download the latest ODBC
driver, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md).

For more information, see [Use the Amazon Athena Power BI connector](connect-with-odbc-and-power-bi.md).

### July 16, 2021

Published on 2021-07-16

Amazon Athena has updated its integration with Apache Hudi. Hudi is an open-source data
management framework used to simplify incremental data processing in Amazon S3 data lakes.
The updated integration enables you to use Athena to query Hudi 0.8.0 tables managed
through Amazon EMR, Apache Spark, Apache Hive or other compatible services. In addition,
Athena now supports two additional features: snapshot queries on Merge-on-Read (MoR)
tables and read support on bootstrapped tables.

Apache Hudi provides record-level data processing that can help you simplify
development of Change Data Capture (CDC) pipelines, comply with GDPR-driven updates and
deletes, and better manage streaming data from sensors or devices that require data
insertion and event updates. The 0.8.0 release makes it easier to migrate large Parquet
tables to Hudi without copying data so you can query and analyze them through Athena. You
can use Athena's new support for snapshot queries to have near real-time views of your
streaming table updates.

To learn more about using Hudi with Athena, see [Query Apache Hudi datasets](querying-hudi.md).

### July 8, 2021

longer have special status. You can continue to use
`AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality` workgroups to view, modify, organize,
and run queries. However, queries that use features that were formerly in preview are
now subject to standard Athena billing terms and conditions. For billing information, see
[Amazon Athena pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing).

### June 23, 2021

Published on 2021-06-23

Released JDBC 2.0.23 and ODBC 1.1.10 drivers for Athena. Both drivers offer improved
read performance and support [EXPLAIN](athena-explain-statement.md) statements and [parameterized queries](querying-with-prepared-statements.md).

`EXPLAIN` statements show the logical or distributed execution plan of a
SQL query. Parameterized queries enable the same query to be used multiple times with
different values supplied at run time.

The JDBC release also adds support for Active Directory Federation Services 2019 and a
custom endpoint override option for AWS STS. The ODBC release fixes an issue with IAM
profile credentials.

For more information and to download the new drivers, release notes, and
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md)

- For information about how to upgrade, see [Change Athena engine versions](engine-versions-changing.md).

- For information about testing queries, see [Test queries in advance of an engine version upgrade](engine-versions-changing.md#engine-versions-testing).

#### Federated SQL Queries

You can now use Athena's federated query in the US East (N. Virginia),
US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon) Regions without using the
`AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality` workgroup.

Use Federated SQL queries to run SQL queries across relational, non-relational,
object, and custom data sources. With federated querying, you can submit a single
SQL query that scans data from multiple sources running on premises or hosted in the
cloud.

Running analytics on data spread across applications can be complex and time
consuming for the following reasons:

- Data required for analytics is often spread across relational, key-value,
document, in-memory, search, graph, object, time-series and ledger data
stores.

- To analyze data across these sources, analysts build complex pipelines to
extract, transform, and load into a data warehouse so that the data can be
queried.

- Accessing data from various sources requires learning new programming
languages and data access constructs.

Federated SQL queries in Athena eliminate this complexity by allowing users to
query the data in-place from wherever it resides. Analysts can use familiar SQL
constructs to `JOIN` data across multiple data sources for quick
analysis, and store results in Amazon S3 for subsequent use.

##### Data Source Connectors

To process federated queries, Athena uses Athena Data Source Connectors that run
on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda). The following open
sourced, pre-built connectors were written and tested by Athena. Use them to run
SQL queries in Athena on their corresponding data sources.

- [CloudWatch](connectors-cloudwatch.md)

- [CloudWatch\
Metrics](connectors-cwmetrics.md)

- [DocumentDB](connectors-docdb.md)

- [DynamoDB](connectors-dynamodb.md)

- [OpenSearch](connectors-opensearch.md)

- [HBase](connectors-hbase.md)

- [Neptune](connectors-neptune.md)

- [Redis](connectors-redis.md)

- [Timestream](connectors-timestream.md)

- [TPC\
Benchmark DS (TPC-DS)](connectors-tpcds.md)

##### Custom Data Source Connectors

Using [Athena Query Federation SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/releases), developers can build connectors to
any data source to enable Athena to run SQL queries against that data source.
Athena Query Federation Connector extends the benefits of federated querying
beyond AWS provided connectors. Because connectors run on AWS Lambda, you
do not have to manage infrastructure or plan for scaling to peak
demands.

##### Next Steps

- To learn more about the federated query feature, see [Use Amazon Athena Federated Query](federated-queries.md).

- To get started with using an existing connector, see [Create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md).

- To learn how to build your own data source connector using the Athena
Query Federation SDK, see [Example Athena Connector](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/tree/master/athena-example) on GitHub.

Amazon Athena adds support for running SQL queries across relational, non-relational,
object, and custom data sources, invoking machine learning models in SQL queries, User
Defined Functions (UDFs) (Preview), using Apache Hive Metastore as a metadata catalog
with Amazon Athena (Preview), and four additional query-related metrics.

#### Federated SQL Queries

Use Federated SQL queries to run SQL queries across relational, non-relational,
object, and custom data sources.

You can now use Athena's federated query to scan data stored in relational,
non-relational, object, and custom data sources. With federated querying, you can
submit a single SQL query that scans data from multiple sources running on premises
or hosted in the cloud.

Running analytics on data spread across applications can be complex and time
consuming for the following reasons:

- Data required for analytics is often spread across relational, key-value,
document, in-memory, search, graph, object, time-series and ledger data
stores.

- To analyze data across these sources, analysts build complex pipelines to
extract, transform, and load into a data warehouse so that the data can be
queried.

- Accessing data from various sources requires learning new programming

Connector for External Hive Metastore (Preview)](connect-to-data-source-hive.md).

#### New Query-Related Metrics

Athena now publishes additional query metrics that can help you understand [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena) performance. Athena publishes
query-related metrics to [Amazon\
CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch). In this release, Athena publishes the following additional query
metrics:

- **Query Planning Time** – The time taken to plan
the query. This includes the time spent retrieving table partitions from the
data source.

- **Query Queuing Time** – The time that the query
was in a queue waiting for resources.

- **Service Processing Time** – The time taken to
write results after the query engine finishes processing.

- **Total Execution Time** – The time Athena took to
run the query.

To consume these new query metrics, you can create custom dashboards, set alarms
and triggers on metrics in CloudWatch, or use pre-populated dashboards directly from the
Athena console.

Amazon Athena adds support for inserting new data to an existing table using the
`INSERT INTO` statement. You can insert new rows into a destination table
based on a `SELECT` query statement that runs on a source table, or based on
a set of values that are provided as part of the query statement. Supported data formats
include Avro, JSON, ORC, Parquet, and text files.

`INSERT INTO` statements can also help you simplify your ETL process. For
example, you can use `INSERT INTO` in a single query to select data from a
source table that is in JSON format and write to a destination table in Parquet
format.

`INSERT INTO` statements are charged based on the number of bytes that are
scanned in the `SELECT` phase, similar to how Athena charges for
`SELECT` queries. For more information, see [Amazon Athena pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing).

For more information about using `INSERT INTO`, including supported
formats, SerDes and examples, see [INSERT\
INTO](insert-into.md) in the Athena User Guide.

owner, pays for the Amazon S3 request and data transfer costs. In Athena, workgroup
administrators can now configure workgroup settings to allow workgroup members to query
S3 Requester Pays buckets.

For information about how to configure the Requester Pays setting for your workgroup,
refer to [Create a\
Workgroup](workgroups-create-update-delete.md#creating-workgroups) in the Amazon Athena User Guide. For more information about Requester
Pays buckets, see [Requester Pays Buckets](../../../s3/latest/dev/requesterpaysbuckets.md) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.

Amazon Athena is now available in the Canada (Central) Region. For a list of
supported Regions, see [AWS Regions and\
Endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#athena). Released the new version of the ODBC driver with support for
Athena workgroups. For more information, see the [ODBC Driver Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/ODBC/SimbaAthenaODBC_1.0.5/release-notes.txt).

To download the ODBC driver version 1.0.5 and its
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md). For information about this version, see the [ODBC\
Driver Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/ODBC/SimbaAthenaODBC_1.0.5/release-notes.txt).

To use workgroups with the ODBC driver, set the new connection property,
`Workgroup`, in the connection string as shown in the following
example:

```

Driver=Simba Athena ODBC Driver;AwsRegion=[Region];S3OutputLocation=[S3Path];AuthenticationType=IAM Credentials;UID=[YourAccessKey];PWD=[YourSecretKey];Workgroup=[WorkgroupName]

```

For more information, search for "workgroup" in the
[ODBC Driver Installation and Configuration Guide version 1.0.5](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/ODBC/SimbaAthenaODBC_1.0.5/Simba+Athena+ODBC+Install+and+Configuration+Guide.pdf).
There are no changes to the ODBC driver connection string when you use tags on
workgroups. To use tags, upgrade to the latest version of the ODBC driver, which is this
current version.

This driver version lets you use [Athena API workgroup actions](workgroups-api-list.md) to create and
manage workgroups, and [Athena API tag actions](tags-operations.md) to add, list, or remove tags on workgroups. Before you
begin, make sure that you have resource-level permissions in IAM for actions on
workgroups and tags.

For more information, see:

- [Use workgroups to control query access and costs](workgroups-manage-queries-control-costs.md) and [Example workgroup policies](example-policies-workgroup.md).

- [Tag Athena resources](tags.md) and [Use tag-based IAM access control policies](tags-access-control.md).

If you use the JDBC driver or the AWS SDK, upgrade to the latest version of the
driver and SDK, both of which already include support for workgroups and tags in Athena.
For more information, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

### February 22, 2019

Published on _2019-02-22_

Added tag support for workgroups in Amazon Athena. A tag consists of a key and a value,
both of which you define. When you tag a workgroup, you assign custom metadata to it.
You can add tags to workgroups to help categorize them, using AWS [tagging\
best practices](../../../whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.md). You can use tags to restrict access to workgroups, and to
track costs. For example, create a workgroup for each cost center. Then, by adding tags
to these workgroups, you can track your Athena spending for each cost center. For more
information, see [Using Tags for\
Billing](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/custom-tags.md) in the _AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide_.

You can work with tags by using the Athena console or the API operations. For more
information, see [Tag Athena resources](tags.md).

In the Athena console, you can add one or more tags to each of your workgroups, and
search by tags. Workgroups are an IAM-controlled resource in Athena. In IAM, you can
restrict who can add, remove, or list tags on workgroups that you create. You can also
use the `CreateWorkGroup` API operation that has the optional tag parameter
for adding one or more tags to the workgroup. To add, remove, or list tags, use
`TagResource`, `UntagResource`, and
`ListTagsForResource`. For more information, see [Use API and AWS CLI tag operations](tags-operations.md).

To allow users to add tags when creating workgroups, ensure that you give each user
IAM permissions to both the `TagResource` and `CreateWorkGroup`
API actions. For more information and examples, see [Use tag-based IAM access control policies](tags-access-control.md).

There are no changes to the JDBC driver when you use tags on workgroups. If you create
new workgroups and use the JDBC driver or the AWS SDK, upgrade to the latest version
of the driver and SDK. For information, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

### February 18, 2019

Published on _2019-02-18_

Added ability to control query costs by running queries in workgroups. For
information, see [Use workgroups to control query access and costs](workgroups-manage-queries-control-costs.md). Improved the JSON OpenX
SerDe used in Athena, fixed an issue where Athena did not ignore objects transitioned to
the `GLACIER` storage class, and added examples for querying Network Load Balancer
logs.

Made the following changes:

- Added support for workgroups. Use workgroups to separate users, teams,
applications, or workloads, and to set limits on amount of data each query or
the entire workgroup can process. Because workgroups act as IAM resources, you
can use resource-level permissions to control access to a specific workgroup.
You can also view query-related metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, control query costs by
configuring limits on the amount of data scanned, create thresholds, and trigger
actions, such as Amazon SNS alarms, when these thresholds are breached. For more
information, see [Use workgroups to control query access and costs](workgroups-manage-queries-control-costs.md) and [Use CloudWatch and EventBridge to monitor queries and control costs](workgroups-control-limits.md).

Workgroups are an IAM resource. For a full list of workgroup-related
actions, resources, and conditions in IAM, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition\
Keys for Amazon Athena](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-amazonathena.md) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.
Before you create new workgroups, make sure that you use [workgroup IAM policies](workgroups-iam-policy.md), and the
[AWS managed policy: AmazonAthenaFullAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#amazonathenafullaccess-managed-policy).

You can use workgroups in the console, with [workgroup API operations](workgroups-api-list.md), or with the
JDBC driver. For information about creating workgroups, see [Create a workgroup](creating-workgroups.md). To
download the JDBC driver with workgroup support, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

If you use workgroups with the JDBC driver, you must set the workgroup name in
the connection string using the `Workgroup` configuration parameter
as in the following example:

```nohighlight

jdbc:awsathena://AwsRegion=<AWSREGION>;UID=<ACCESSKEY>;
PWD=<SECRETKEY>;S3OutputLocation=s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/<athena-output>-<AWSREGION>/;
Workgroup=<WORKGROUPNAME>;
```

There are no changes in the way you run SQL statements or make JDBC API calls
to the driver. The driver passes the workgroup name to Athena.

For information about differences introduced with workgroups, see [Use Athena workgroup APIs](workgroups-api-list.md) and
[Troubleshoot workgroup errors](workgroups-troubleshooting.md).

- Improved the JSON OpenX SerDe used in Athena. The improvements include, but are
not limited to, the following:

- Support for the `ConvertDotsInJsonKeysToUnderscores`
property. When set to `TRUE`, it allows the SerDe to replace
the dots in key names with underscores. For example, if the JSON dataset
contains a key with the name `"a.b"`, you can use this
property to define the column name to be `"a_b"` in Athena.
The default is `FALSE`. By default, Athena does not allow dots
in column names.

- Support for the `case.insensitive` property. By default,
Athena requires that all keys in your JSON dataset use lowercase. Using
`WITH SERDE PROPERTIES ("case.insensitive"= FALSE;)`
allows you to use case-sensitive key names in your data. The default is
`TRUE`. When set to `TRUE`, the SerDe converts
all uppercase columns to lowercase.

For more information, see [OpenX JSON SerDe](openx-json-serde.md).

- Fixed an issue where Athena returned `"access denied"` error
messages, when it processed Amazon S3 objects that were archived to Glacier by Amazon S3
lifecycle policies. As a result of fixing this issue, Athena ignores objects
transitioned to the `GLACIER` storage class. Athena does not support
querying data from the `GLACIER` storage class.

For more information, see [Amazon S3 considerations](creating-tables.md#s3-considerations) and [Transitioning to the GLACIER Storage Class (Object Archival)](../../../s3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md#before-deciding-to-archive-objects) in
the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

- Added examples for querying Network Load Balancer access logs that receive information about
the Transport Layer Security (TLS) requests. For more information, see [Query Network Load Balancer logs](networkloadbalancer-classic-logs.md).

## Athena release notes for 2018

### November 20, 2018

Published on _2018-11-20_

Released the new versions of the JDBC and ODBC driver with support for federated
access to Athena API with the AD FS and SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language
2.0). For details, see the [JDBC Driver Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.6/docs/release-notes.txt) and [ODBC Driver Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/ODBC/SimbaAthenaODBC_1.0.4/release-notes.txt).

With this release, federated access to Athena is supported for the Active Directory
Federation Service (AD FS 3.0). Access is established through the versions of JDBC or
ODBC drivers that support SAML 2.0. For information about configuring federated access
to the Athena API, see [Enable federated access to the Athena API](access-federation-saml.md).

To download the JDBC driver version 2.0.6 and its
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md). For information about this version, see [JDBC Driver Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.6/docs/release-notes.txt).

To download the ODBC driver version 1.0.4 and its
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md). For information about this version, [ODBC Driver Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/ODBC/SimbaAthenaODBC_1.0.4/release-notes.txt).

### October 15, 2018

Published on _2018-10-15_

If you have upgraded to the AWS Glue Data Catalog, there are two new features that provide
support for:

- Encryption of the Data Catalog metadata. If you choose to encrypt metadata in the
Data Catalog, you must add specific policies to Athena. For more information, see
[Access to Encrypted\
Metadata in the AWS Glue Data Catalog](access-encrypted-data-glue-data-catalog.md).

- Fine-grained permissions to access resources in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. You can now
define identity-based (IAM) policies that restrict or allow access to specific
databases and tables from the Data Catalog used in Athena. For more information, see
[Configure access to databases and tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog](fine-grained-access-to-glue-resources.md).

###### Note

Data resides in the Amazon S3 buckets, and access to it is controlled by
[Control access to Amazon S3 from Athena](s3-permissions.md). To
access data in databases and tables, continue to use access control policies
to Amazon S3 buckets that store the data.

### October 10, 2018

Published on _2018-10-10_

Athena supports `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, which creates a table from the
result of a `SELECT` query statement. For details, see [Creating a Table from\
Query Results (CTAS)](ctas.md).

Before you create CTAS queries, it is important to learn about their behavior in the
Athena documentation. It contains information about the location for saving query results
in Amazon S3, the list of supported formats for storing CTAS query results, the number of
partitions you can create, and supported compression formats. For more information, see
[Considerations and limitations for CTAS queries](ctas-considerations-limitations.md).

Use CTAS queries to:

- [Create a table from query results](ctas.md) in one
step.

- [Create CTAS queries in the Athena console](ctas-console.md),
using [Examples](ctas-examples.md). For information about
syntax, see [CREATE TABLE AS](create-table-as.md).

- Transform query results into other storage formats, such as PARQUET, ORC,
AVRO, JSON, and TEXTFILE. For more information, see [Considerations and limitations for CTAS queries](ctas-considerations-limitations.md) and
[Use columnar storage formats](columnar-storage.md).

### September 6, 2018

Published on _2018-09-06_

Released the new version of the ODBC driver (version 1.0.3). The new version of the
ODBC driver streams results by default, instead of paging through them, allowing
business intelligence tools to retrieve large data sets faster. This version also
includes improvements, bug fixes, and an updated documentation for _"Using SSL_
_with a Proxy Server"_. For details, see
the [Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/ODBC/SimbaAthenaODBC_1.0.3/release-notes.txt) for the driver.

For downloading the ODBC driver version 1.0.3 and its documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with ODBC](connect-with-odbc.md).

The streaming results feature is available with this new version of the ODBC driver.
It is also available with the JDBC driver. For
information about streaming results, see the [ODBC Driver Installation and Configuration Guide](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/ODBC/SimbaAthenaODBC_1.0.3/Simba+Athena+ODBC+Install+and+Configuration+Guide.pdf), and search for
**UseResultsetStreaming**.

The ODBC driver version 1.0.3 is a drop-in replacement for the previous version of the
driver. We recommend that you migrate to the current driver.

###### Important

To use the ODBC driver version 1.0.3, follow these requirements:

- Keep the port 444 open to outbound traffic.

- Add the `athena:GetQueryResultsStream` policy action to the
list of policies for Athena. This policy action is not exposed directly with
the API and is only used with the ODBC and JDBC drivers, as part of
streaming results support. For an example policy, see [AWS managed policy: AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy).

### August 23, 2018

Published on _2018-08-23_

Added support for these DDL-related features and fixed several bugs, as follows:

- Added support for `BINARY` and `DATE` data types for
data in Parquet, and for `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` data types
for data in Avro.

- Added support for `INT` and `DOUBLE` in DDL queries.
`INTEGER` is an alias to `INT`, and `DOUBLE
                          PRECISION` is an alias to `DOUBLE`.

- Improved performance of `DROP TABLE` and `DROP DATABASE`
queries.

- Removed the creation of `_$folder$` object in Amazon S3 when a data
bucket is empty.

- Fixed an issue where `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION` threw an error
when no partition value was provided.

- Fixed an issue where `DROP TABLE` ignored the database name when
checking partitions after the qualified name had been specified in the
statement.

For more about the data types supported in Athena, see [Data types in Amazon Athena](data-types.md).

For information about supported data type mappings between
types in Athena, the JDBC driver, and Java data types, see the _"Data_
_Types"_ section in the [JDBC Driver Installation and Configuration Guide](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.5/docs/Simba+Athena+JDBC+Driver+Install+and+Configuration+Guide.pdf).

### August 16, 2018

Published on _2018-08-16_

Released the JDBC driver version 2.0.5. The new version of the JDBC driver streams
results by default, instead of paging through them, allowing business intelligence tools
to retrieve large data sets faster. Compared to the previous version of the JDBC driver,
there are the following performance improvements:

- Approximately 2x performance increase when fetching less than 10K rows.

- Approximately 5-6x performance increase when fetching more than 10K rows.

The streaming results feature is available only with the JDBC driver. It is not
available with the ODBC driver. You cannot use it with the Athena API. For information about streaming results, see the [JDBC Driver Installation and Configuration Guide](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.5/docs/Simba+Athena+JDBC+Driver+Install+and+Configuration+Guide.pdf), and search for
**UseResultsetStreaming**.

For downloading the JDBC driver version 2.0.5 and its documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

The JDBC driver version 2.0.5 is a drop-in replacement for the previous version of the
driver (2.0.2). To ensure that you can use the JDBC driver version 2.0.5, add the
`athena:GetQueryResultsStream` policy action to the list of policies for
Athena. This policy action is not exposed directly with the API and is only used with the
JDBC driver, as part of streaming results support. For an example policy, see [AWS managed policy: AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy). For more information about migrating from version 2.0.2 to
version 2.0.5 of the driver, see the [JDBC Driver Migration Guide](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.5/docs/Simba+Athena+JDBC+Driver+Migration+Guide.pdf).

If you are migrating from a 1.x driver to a 2.x driver, you will need to migrate your
existing configurations to the new configuration. We highly recommend that you migrate
to the current version of the driver. For more information, see the [JDBC Driver Migration Guide](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.5/docs/Simba+Athena+JDBC+Driver+Migration+Guide.pdf).

### August 7, 2018

Published on _2018-08-07_

You can now store Amazon Virtual Private Cloud flow logs directly in Amazon S3 in a GZIP format, where you can
query them in Athena. For information, see [Query Amazon VPC flow logs](vpc-flow-logs.md) and [Amazon VPC Flow Logs can now be delivered to S3](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/08/amazon-vpc-flow-logs-can-now-be-delivered-to-s3).

### June 5, 2018

Published on _2018-06-05_

###### Topics

- [Support for Views](#support-for-views)

- [Improvements and Updates to Error Messages](#improvements)

- [Bug Fixes](#bug-fixes)

#### Support for Views

Added support for views. You can now use [CREATE VIEW and CREATE PROTECTED MULTI DIALECT VIEW](create-view.md), [DESCRIBE VIEW](describe-view.md), [DROP VIEW](drop-view.md), [SHOW CREATE VIEW](show-create-view.md), and [SHOW VIEWS](show-views.md) in Athena. The query that defines the view runs each
time you reference the view in your query. For more information, see [Work with views](views.md).

#### Improvements and Updates to Error Messages

- Included a GSON 2.8.0 library into the CloudTrail SerDe, to solve an issue
with the CloudTrail SerDe and enable parsing of JSON strings.

- Enhanced partition schema validation in Athena for Parquet, and, in some
cases, for ORC, by allowing reordering of columns. This enables Athena to
better deal with changes in schema evolution over time, and with tables
added by the AWS Glue Crawler. For more information, see [Handle schema updates](handling-schema-updates-chapter.md).

- Added parsing support for `SHOW VIEWS`.

- Made the following improvements to most common error messages:

- Replaced an **`Internal Error`** message with a
descriptive error message when a SerDe fails to parse the column in
an Athena query. Previously, Athena issued an internal error in cases
of parsing errors. The new error message reads:
**`"HIVE_BAD_DATA: Error parsing field value for field**
**0: java.lang.String cannot be cast to**
**org.openx.data.jsonserde.json.JSONObject"`**.

- Improved error messages about insufficient permissions by adding
more detail.

#### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following bugs:

- Fixed an issue that enables the internal translation of `REAL`
to `FLOAT` data types. This improves integration with the
AWS Glue crawler that returns `FLOAT` data types.

- Fixed an issue where Athena was not converting AVRO `DECIMAL` (a
logical type) to a `DECIMAL` type.

- Fixed an issue where Athena did not return results for queries on Parquet
data with `WHERE` clauses that referenced values in the
`TIMESTAMP` data type.

### May 17, 2018

Increased query concurrency quota in Athena from five to twenty. This means that you
can submit and run up to twenty `DDL` queries and twenty `SELECT`
queries at a time. Note that the concurrency quotas are separate for `DDL`
and `SELECT` queries.

Concurrency quotas in Athena are defined as the number of queries that can be submitted
to the service concurrently. You can submit up to twenty queries of the same type
( `DDL` or `SELECT`) at a time. If you submit a query that
exceeds the concurrent query quota, the Athena API displays an error message.

After you submit your queries to Athena, it processes the queries by assigning
resources based on the overall service load and the amount of incoming requests. We
continuously monitor and make adjustments to the service so that your queries process as
fast as possible.

For information, see [Service Quotas](service-limits.md).
This is an adjustable quota. You can use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1) to request a quota increase for concurrent
queries.

### April 19, 2018

Published on _2018-04-19_

Released the new version of the JDBC driver (version 2.0.2) with support for returning
the `ResultSet` data as an Array data type, improvements, and bug fixes.
For details, see the [Release Notes](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.2/docs/release-notes.txt) for the driver.

For information about downloading the new JDBC driver version 2.0.2 and its
documentation, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

The latest version of the JDBC driver is 2.0.2. If you are migrating from a 1.x driver
to a 2.x driver, you will need to migrate your existing configurations to the new
configuration. We highly recommend that you migrate to the current driver.

For information about the changes introduced in the new
version of the driver, the version differences, and examples, see the [JDBC Driver Migration Guide](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC_2.0.2/docs/Simba+Athena+JDBC+Driver+Migration+Guide.pdf).

Use auto-complete to type queries in the Athena console.

### March 15, 2018

Published on _2018-03-15_

Added an ability to automatically create Athena tables for CloudTrail log files directly
from the CloudTrail console. For information, see [Use the CloudTrail console to create an Athena table for CloudTrail logs](create-cloudtrail-table-ct.md).

### February 2, 2018

Published on _2018-02-12_

Added an ability to securely offload intermediate data to disk for memory-intensive
queries that use the `GROUP BY` clause. This improves the reliability of such
queries, preventing **`"Query resource exhausted"`** errors.

### January 19, 2018

Published on _2018-01-19_

Athena uses Presto, an open-source distributed query engine, to run queries.

With Athena, there are no versions to manage. We have transparently upgraded the
underlying engine in Athena to a version based on Presto version 0.172. No action is
required on your end.

With the upgrade, you can now use Presto 0.172 Functions and Operators, including
Presto 0.172 Lambda Expressions in Athena.

Major updates for this release, including the community-contributed fixes,
include:

- Support for ignoring headers. You can use the
`skip.header.line.count` property when defining tables, to allow
Athena to ignore headers. This is supported for queries that use the [LazySimpleSerDe](lazy-simple-serde.md) and [OpenCSV SerDe](csv-serde.md), and not for Grok or Regex
SerDes.

- Support for the `CHAR(n)` data type in `STRING`
functions. The range for `CHAR(n)` is `[1.255]`, while the
range for `VARCHAR(n)` is `[1,65535]`.

- Support for correlated subqueries.

- Support for Presto Lambda expressions and functions.

- Improved performance of the `DECIMAL` type and operators.

- Support for filtered aggregations, such as `SELECT sum(col_name)
                          FILTER`, where `id > 0`.

- Push-down predicates for the `DECIMAL`, `TINYINT`,
`SMALLINT`, and `REAL` data types.

- Support for quantified comparison predicates: `ALL`,
`ANY`, and `SOME`.

- Added functions: [`arrays_overlap()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/array.html), [`array_except()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/array.html), [`levenshtein_distance()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/string.html), [`codepoint()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/string.html), [`skewness()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/aggregate.html), [`kurtosis()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/aggregate.html), and [`typeof()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/conversion.html).

- Added a variant of the [`from_unixtime()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/datetime.html) function that takes a timezone
argument.

- Added the [`bitwise_and_agg()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/aggregate.html) and [`bitwise_or_agg()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/aggregate.html) aggregation functions.

- Added the [`xxhash64()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/binary.html) and [`to_big_endian_64()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/binary.html) functions.

- Added support for escaping double quotes or backslashes using a backslash with
a JSON path subscript to the [`json_extract()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/json.html) and [`json_extract_scalar()`](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/json.html) functions. This changes the
semantics of any invocation using a backslash, as backslashes were previously
treated as normal characters.

For more information about functions and operators, see [DML queries, functions, and operators](dml-queries-functions-operators.md) in this guide, and [Functions and\
operators](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions.html) in the Presto documentation.

Athena does not support all of Presto's features. For more information, see [Limitations](other-notable-limitations.md).

### May 19, 2017

Published on _2017-05-19_

Added an Amazon Athena API and AWS CLI support for Athena; updated JDBC driver to version
1.1.0; fixed various issues.

- Amazon Athena enables application programming for Athena. For more information, see
[Amazon Athena API Reference](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference.md). The latest AWS SDKs
include support for the Athena API. For links to documentation and downloads, see
the _SDKs_ section in [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools).

- The AWS CLI includes new commands for Athena. For more information, see the
[Amazon Athena API Reference](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference.md).

- A new JDBC driver 1.1.0 is available, which supports the new Athena API as
well as the latest features and bug fixes. Download the driver at [https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/AthenaJDBC41-1.1.0.jar](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/AthenaJDBC41-1.1.0.jar). We
recommend upgrading to the latest Athena JDBC driver; however, you may still use
the earlier driver version. Earlier driver versions do not support the Athena
API. For more information, see [Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md).

- Actions specific to policy statements in earlier versions of Athena have been
deprecated. If you upgrade to JDBC driver version 1.1.0 and have
customer-managed or inline IAM policies attached to JDBC users, you must
update the IAM policies. In contrast, earlier versions of the JDBC driver do
not support the Athena API, so you can specify only deprecated actions in
policies attached to earlier version JDBC users. For this reason, you shouldn't
need to update customer-managed or inline IAM policies.

- These policy-specific actions were used in Athena before the release of the
Athena API. Use these deprecated actions in policies **only** with JDBC drivers earlier than version 1.1.0. If you are
upgrading the JDBC driver, replace policy statements that allow or deny
deprecated actions with the appropriate API actions as listed or errors will
occur:

Deprecated Policy-Specific ActionCorresponding Athena API Action

```

athena:RunQuery
```

```

athena:StartQueryExecution
```

```

athena:CancelQueryExecution
```

```

athena:StopQueryExecution
```

```

athena:GetQueryExecutions
```

```

athena:ListQueryExecutions
```

#### Improvements

- Increased the query string length limit to 256 KB.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused query results to look malformed when scrolling
through results in the console.

- Fixed an issue where a `\u0000` character string in Amazon S3 data
files would cause errors.

- Fixed an issue that caused requests to cancel a query made through the
JDBC driver to fail.

- Fixed an issue that caused the AWS CloudTrail SerDe to fail with Amazon S3 data in
US East (Ohio).

- Fixed an issue that caused `DROP TABLE` to fail on a
partitioned table.

### April 4, 2017

Published on _2017-04-04_

Added support for Amazon S3 data encryption and released JDBC driver update (version 1.0.1)
with encryption support, improvements, and bug fixes.

#### Features

- A new version of the driver supports new encryption features, adds
improvements, and fixes issues.

- Added the ability to add, replace, and change columns using `ALTER
                              TABLE`. For more information, see [Alter Column](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL) in the Hive documentation.

- Added support for querying LZO-compressed data.

For more information, see [Encryption at rest](encryption.md).

#### Improvements

- Better JDBC query performance with page-size improvements, returning 1,000
rows instead of 100.

- Added ability to cancel a query using the JDBC driver interface.

- Added ability to specify JDBC options in the JDBC connection URL. See
[Connect to Amazon Athena with JDBC](connect-with-jdbc.md)
for the most current JDBC driver.

- Added PROXY setting in the driver, which can now be set using [ClientConfiguration](../../../../reference/awsjavasdk/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/clientconfiguration.md) in the AWS SDK for Java.

#### Bug Fixes

Fixed the following bugs:

- Throttling errors would occur when multiple queries were issued using the
JDBC driver interface.

- The JDBC driver would stop when projecting a decimal data type.

- The JDBC driver would return every data type as a string, regardless of
how the data type was defined in the table. For example, selecting a column
defined as an `INT` data type using
`resultSet.GetObject()` would return a `STRING`
data type instead of `INT`.

- The JDBC driver would verify credentials at the time a connection was
made, rather than at the time a query would run.

- Queries made through the JDBC driver would fail when a schema was
specified along with the URL.

Added the AWS CloudTrail SerDe, improved performance, fixed partition issues.

#### Features

- Added the AWS CloudTrail SerDe, which has since been superseded by the [Hive JSON SerDe](hive-json-serde.md) for reading
CloudTrail logs. For information about querying CloudTrail logs, see [Query AWS CloudTrail logs](cloudtrail-logs.md).

#### Improvements

- Improved performance when scanning a large number of partitions.

- Improved performance on `MSCK Repair Table` operation.

- Added ability to query Amazon S3 data stored in regions other than your primary
Region. Standard inter-region data transfer rates for Amazon S3 apply in addition
to standard Athena charges.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where a "table not found error" might occur if no partitions
are loaded.

- Fixed a bug to avoid throwing an exception with `ALTER TABLE ADD
                              PARTITION IF NOT EXISTS` queries.

- Fixed a bug in `DROP PARTITIONS`.
