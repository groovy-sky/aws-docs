# Logging options

###### Warning

Security: When logging is enabled at verbose levels
(DEBUG or TRACE), the AWS SDK used by the driver may log sensitive information such
as authentication tokens and credentials in plaintext. Use verbose logging only for
troubleshooting, and ensure log files are stored securely and deleted after use. Do
not enable verbose logging in production environments.

Administrator rights are required to modify the settings described here. To make the
changes, you can use the ODBC Data Source Administrator **Logging Options**
dialog box or modify the Windows registry directly.

## Log level

This option enables ODBC driver logs with different levels of detail. In Windows, you can
use the registry or a dialog box to configure logging. The option is located in the following
registry path:

```nohighlight

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Amazon Athena\ODBC\Driver
```

The following log levels are available:

- `OFF` \- Logging is disabled

- `ERROR` \- Only error messages are logged

- `WARN` \- Warning messages and errors are logged

- `INFO` \- Informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged

- `DEBUG` \- Detailed debug information plus all lower level messages are logged

- `TRACE` \- Most detailed level of logging, includes all messages

###### Note

Each log level includes all messages from the levels below it. Higher log levels may
impact performance and generate larger log files.
