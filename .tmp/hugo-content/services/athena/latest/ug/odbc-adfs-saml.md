# Configure federated access to Amazon Athena for Microsoft AD FS users using an ODBC client

To set up federated access to Amazon Athena for Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services
(AD FS) users using an ODBC client, you first establish trust between AD FS and your AWS
account. With this trust in place, your AD users can [federate](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-providers-saml.md#CreatingSAML-configuring-IdP) into AWS using their AD credentials and assume permissions of an
[AWS Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam) (IAM) role to access AWS
resources such as the Athena API.

To create this trust, you add AD FS as a SAML provider to your AWS account and create an
IAM role that federated users can assume. On the AD FS side, you add AWS as a relying
party and write SAML claim rules to send the right user attributes to AWS for
authorization (specifically, Athena and Amazon S3).

Configuring AD FS access to Athena involves the following major steps:

[1\. Setting up an IAM SAML provider and role](#odbc-adfs-saml-setting-up-an-iam-saml-provider-and-role)

[2\. Configuring AD FS](#odbc-adfs-saml-configuring-ad-fs)

[3\. Creating Active Directory users and groups](#odbc-adfs-saml-creating-active-directory-users-and-groups)

[4\. Configuring the AD FS ODBC connection to Athena](#odbc-adfs-saml-configuring-the-ad-fs-odbc-connection-to-athena)

## 1\. Setting up an IAM SAML provider and role

In this section, you add AD FS as a SAML provider to your AWS account and create an
IAM role that your federated users can assume.

###### To set up a SAML provider

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Identity providers**.

3. Choose **Add provider**.

4. For **Provider type**, choose
    **SAML**.

![Choose SAML.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-1.png)

5. For **Provider name**, enter
    `adfs-saml-provider`.

6. In a browser, enter the following address to download the federation XML file
    for your AD FS server. To perform this step, your browser must have access to
    the AD FS server.

```nohighlight

https://adfs-server-name/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml
```

7. In the IAM console, for **Metadata document**, choose
    **Choose file**, and then upload the federation metadata
    file to AWS.

8. To finish, choose **Add provider**.

Next, you create the IAM role that your federated users can assume.

###### To create an IAM role for federated users

01. In the IAM console navigation pane, choose
     **Roles**.

02. Choose **Create role**.

03. For **Trusted entity type**, choose **SAML 2.0**
    **federation**.

04. For **SAML 2.0-based provider**, choose the
     **adfs-saml-provider** provider that you created.

05. Choose **Allow programmatic and AWS Management Console**
    **access**, and then choose **Next**.

    ![Choosing SAML as the trusted entity type.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-2.png)

06. On the **Add permissions** page, filter for the IAM
     permissions policies that you require for this role, and then select the
     corresponding check boxes. This tutorial attaches the
     `AmazonAthenaFullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess`
     policies.

    ![Attaching the Athena full access policy to the role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-3.png)

    ![Attaching the Amazon S3 full access policy to the role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-4.png)

07. Choose **Next**.

08. On the **Name, review, and create** page, for **Role**
    **name**, enter a name for the role. This tutorial uses the name
     **adfs-data-access**.

    In **Step 1: Select trusted entities**, the
     **Principal** field should be automatically populated with
     `"Federated:"
                            "arn:aws:iam::account_id:saml-provider/adfs-saml-provider"`.
     The `Condition` field should contain `"SAML:aud"` and
     `"https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml"`.

    ![Trusted entities JSON.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-5.png)

    **Step 2: Add permissions** shows the policies that you have
     attached to the role.

    ![List of policies attached to the role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-6.png)

09. Choose **Create role**. A banner message confirms creation of
     the role.

10. On the **Roles** page, choose the name of the role that you
     just created. The summary page for the role shows the policies that have been
     attached.

    ![Summary page for the role.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-7.png)

## 2\. Configuring AD FS

Now you are ready to add AWS as a relying party and write SAML claim rules so that
you can send the right user attributes to AWS for authorization.

SAML-based federation has two participant parties: the IdP (Active Directory) and the
relying party (AWS), which is the service or application that uses authentication from
the IdP.

To configure AD FS, you first add a relying party trust, then you configure SAML claim
rules for the relying party. AD FS uses claim rules to form a SAML assertion that is
sent to a relying party. The SAML assertion states that the information about the AD
user is true, and that it has authenticated the user.

### Adding a relying party trust

To add a relying party trust in AD FS, you use the AD FS server manager.

###### To add a relying party trust in AD FS

01. Sign in to the AD FS server.

02. On the **Start** menu, open **Server**
    **Manager**.

03. Choose **Tools**, and then choose **AD FS**
    **Management**.

    ![Choose Tools, AD FS Management.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-8.png)

04. In the navigation pane, under **Trust Relationships**,
     choose **Relying Party Trusts**.

05. Under **Actions**, choose **Add Relying Party**
    **Trust**.

    ![Choose Add Relying Party Trust.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-9.png)

06. On the **Add Relying Party Trust Wizard** page, choose
     **Start**.

    ![Choose Start.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-10.png)

07. On the **Select Data Source** screen, select the option
     **Import data about the relying party published online or on a**
    **local network**.

08. For **Federation metadata address (host name or URL)**,
     enter the URL `
                                https://signin.aws.amazon.com/static/saml-metadata.xml`

09. Choose **Next.**

    ![Configuring the data source.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-11.png)

10. On the **Specify Display Name** page, for
     **Display name**, enter a display name for your relying
     party, and then choose **Next**.

    ![Enter a display name for the relying party.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-12.png)

11. On the **Configure Multi-factor Authentication Now**
     page, this tutorial selects **I do not want to configure**
    **multi-factor authentication for this relying party trust at this**
    **time**.

    For increased security, we recommend that you configure multi-factor
     authentication to help protect your AWS resources. Because it uses a
     sample dataset, this tutorial doesn't enable multi-factor
     authentication.

    ![Configuring multi-factor authentication.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-13.png)

12. Choose **Next**.

13. On the **Choose Issuance Authorization Rules** page,
     select **Permit all users to access this relying**
    **party**.

    This option allows all users in Active Directory to use AD FS with AWS
     as a relying party. You should consider your security requirements and
     adjust this configuration accordingly.

    ![Configuring user access to the relying party.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-14.png)

14. Choose **Next**.

15. On the **Ready to Add Trust** page, choose
     **Next** to add the relying party trust to the AD FS
     configuration database.

    ![Choose Next.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-15.png)

16. On the **Finish** page, choose
     **Close**.

    ![Choose Close.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-16.png)

### Configuring SAML claim rules for the relying party

In this task, you create two sets of claim rules.

The first set, rules 1–4, contains AD FS claim rules that are required to
assume an IAM role based on AD group membership. These are the same rules that you
create if you want to establish federated access to the [AWS Management Console](http://aws.amazon.com/console).

The second set, rules 5–6, are claim rules required for Athena access
control.

###### To create AD FS claim rules

1. In the AD FS Management console navigation pane, choose **Trust**
**Relationships**, **Relying Party**
**Trusts**.

2. Find the relying party that you created in the previous section.

3. Right-click the relying party and choose **Edit Claim**
**Rules**, or choose **Edit Claim Rules** from
    the **Actions** menu.

![Choose Edit Claim Rules.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-17.png)

4. Choose **Add Rule.**

5. On the **Configure Rule** page of the Add Transform Claim
    Rule Wizard, enter the following information to create claim rule 1, and
    then choose **Finish**.

## 3\. Creating Active Directory users and groups

Now you are ready to create AD users that will access Athena, and AD groups to place
them in so that you can control levels of access by group. After you create AD groups
that categorize patterns of data access, you add your users to those groups.

###### To create AD users for access to Athena

01. On the Server Manager dashboard, choose **Tools**, and then
     choose **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![Choose Tools, Active Directory Users and Computers.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-22.png)

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**.

03. On the **Active Directory Users and Computers** tool bar,
     choose the **Create user** option.

    ![Choose Create user.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-23.png)

4. Add one or more AD FS groups according to your requirements. This tutorial
    adds the **aws-adfs-data-access** group.

5. In the **Select Groups** dialog box, for **Enter**
**the object names to select**, enter the name of the AD FS group
    that you created (for example, `aws-adfs-data-access`),
    and then choose **Check Names**.

![Choose Check Names.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/odbc-adfs-saml-31.png)

6. Choose **OK**.

In the **Properties** dialog box for the user, the name
    of the AD group appears in the **Member of** list.
