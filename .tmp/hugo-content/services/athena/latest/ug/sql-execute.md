# EXECUTE

Runs a prepared statement with the name `statement_name`. Parameter values for
the question marks in the prepared statement are defined in the `USING` clause in
a comma separated list. To create a prepared statement, use [PREPARE](sql-prepare.md).

## Synopsis

```

EXECUTE statement_name [ USING parameter1[, parameter2, ... ] ]
```

## Examples

The following example prepares and executes a query with no parameters.

```sql

PREPARE my_select1 FROM
SELECT name FROM nation
EXECUTE my_select1
```

The following example prepares and executes a query with a single parameter.

```sql

PREPARE my_select2 FROM
SELECT * FROM "my_database"."my_table" WHERE year = ?
EXECUTE my_select2 USING 2012
```

This is equivalent to:

```sql

SELECT * FROM "my_database"."my_table" WHERE year = 2012
```

The following example prepares and executes a query with two parameters.

```sql

PREPARE my_select3 FROM
SELECT order FROM orders WHERE productid = ? and quantity < ?
EXECUTE my_select3 USING 346078, 12
```
