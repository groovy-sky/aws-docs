# INSERT INTO

Inserts new rows into a destination table based on a `SELECT` query statement
that runs on a source table, or based on a set of `VALUES` provided as part of
the statement. When the source table is based on underlying data in one format, such as CSV
or JSON, and the destination table is based on another format, such as Parquet or ORC, you
can use `INSERT INTO` queries to transform selected data into the destination
table's format.

## Considerations and limitations

Consider the following when using `INSERT` queries with Athena.

- When running an `INSERT` query on a table with underlying data that
is encrypted in Amazon S3, the output files that the `INSERT` query writes
are not encrypted by default. We recommend that you encrypt `INSERT`
query results if you are inserting into tables with encrypted data.

For more information about encrypting query results using the console, see
[Encrypt Athena query results stored in Amazon S3](encrypting-query-results-stored-in-s3.md). To enable
encryption using the AWS CLI or Athena API, use the
`EncryptionConfiguration` properties of the [StartQueryExecution](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-startqueryexecution.md) action to specify Amazon S3 encryption options
according to your requirements.

- For `INSERT INTO` statements, the expected bucket owner setting
does not apply to the destination table location in Amazon S3. The expected bucket owner setting applies only to the Amazon S3
output location that you specify for Athena query results. For
more information, see [Specify a query result location using the Athena console](query-results-specify-location-console.md).

- For ACID compliant `INSERT INTO` statements, see the `INSERT
                          INTO` section of [Update Iceberg table data](querying-iceberg-updating-iceberg-table-data.md).

###### Note

Writes are only supported for string types. From Athena,
you cannot write to any tables that contain non-string types
in Glue schema. For more information, see [CSV SerDe](csv-serde.md#csv-serde-opencsvserde-considerations-non-string).

### Bucketed tables not supported

`INSERT INTO` is not supported on bucketed tables. For more
information, see [Use partitioning and bucketing](ctas-partitioning-and-bucketing.md).

### Federated queries not supported

`INSERT INTO` is not supported for federated queries. Attempting to do
so may result in the error message **`This operation is currently not**
**supported for external catalogs`**. For information about federated
queries, see [Use Amazon Athena Federated Query](federated-queries.md).

### Partitioning

Consider the points in this section when using partitioning with `INSERT
                    INTO` or `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` queries.

#### Limits

The `INSERT INTO` statement supports writing a maximum of 100
partitions to the destination table. If you run the `SELECT` clause
on a table with more than 100 partitions, the query fails unless the
`SELECT` query is limited to 100 partitions or fewer.

For information about working around this limitation, see [Use CTAS and INSERT INTO to work around the 100 partition limit](ctas-insert-into.md).

#### Column ordering

`INSERT INTO` or `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements
expect the partitioned column to be the last column in the list of projected
columns in a `SELECT` statement.

If the source table is non-partitioned, or partitioned on different columns
compared to the destination table, queries like `INSERT INTO
                            destination_table SELECT * FROM
                            source_table` consider the values in
the last column of the source table to be values for a partition column in the
destination table. Keep this in mind when trying to create a partitioned table
from a non-partitioned table.

#### Resources

For more information about using `INSERT INTO` with partitioning,
see the following resources.

- For inserting partitioned data into a partitioned table, see [Use CTAS and INSERT INTO to work around the 100 partition limit](ctas-insert-into.md).

- For inserting unpartitioned data into a partitioned table, see [Use CTAS and INSERT INTO for ETL and data analysis](ctas-insert-into-etl.md).

### Files written to Amazon S3

Athena writes files to source data locations in Amazon S3 as a result of the
`INSERT` command. Each `INSERT` operation creates a new
file, rather than appending to an existing file. The file locations depend on the
structure of the table and the `SELECT` query, if present. Athena
generates a data manifest file for each `INSERT` query. The manifest
tracks the files that the query wrote. It is saved to the Athena query result
location in Amazon S3. For more information, see [Identify query output files](querying-finding-output-files.md#querying-identifying-output-files).

### Avoid highly transactional updates

When you use `INSERT INTO` to add rows to a table in Amazon S3, Athena does
not rewrite or modify existing files. Instead, it writes the rows as one or more new
files. Because tables with [many small files\
result in lower query performance](performance-tuning-data-optimization-techniques.md#performance-tuning-avoid-having-too-many-files), and write and read operations such as
`PutObject` and `GetObject` result in higher costs from
Amazon S3, consider the following options when using `INSERT INTO`:

- Run `INSERT INTO` operations less frequently on larger batches
of rows.

- For large data ingestion volumes, consider using a service like [Amazon Data Firehose](../../../firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.md).

- Avoid using `INSERT INTO` altogether. Instead, accumulate rows
into larger files and upload them directly to Amazon S3 where they can be queried
by Athena.

### Locating orphaned files

If a `CTAS` or `INSERT INTO` statement fails, orphaned data
can be left in the data location and might be read in subsequent queries. To locate
orphaned files for inspection or deletion, you can use the data manifest file that
Athena provides to track the list of files to be written. For more information, see
[Identify query output files](querying-finding-output-files.md#querying-identifying-output-files) and [DataManifestLocation](../../../../reference/athena/latest/apireference/api-queryexecutionstatistics.md#athena-Type-QueryExecutionStatistics-DataManifestLocation).

## INSERT INTO...SELECT

Specifies the query to run on one table, `source_table`, which determines
rows to insert into a second table, `destination_table`. If the
`SELECT` query specifies columns in the `source_table`, the
columns must precisely match those in the `destination_table`.

For more information about `SELECT` queries, see [SELECT](select.md).

### Synopsis

```sql

INSERT INTO destination_table
SELECT select_query
FROM source_table_or_view
```

### Examples

Select all rows in the `vancouver_pageviews` table and insert them into
the `canada_pageviews` table:

```sql

INSERT INTO canada_pageviews
SELECT *
FROM vancouver_pageviews;
```

Select only those rows in the `vancouver_pageviews` table where the
`date` column has a value between `2019-07-01` and
`2019-07-31`, and then insert them into
`canada_july_pageviews`:

```sql

INSERT INTO canada_july_pageviews
SELECT *
FROM vancouver_pageviews
WHERE date
    BETWEEN date '2019-07-01'
        AND '2019-07-31';
```

Select the values in the `city` and `state` columns in the
`cities_world` table only from those rows with a value of
`usa` in the `country` column and insert them into the
`city` and `state` columns in the `cities_usa`
table:

```sql

INSERT INTO cities_usa (city,state)
SELECT city,state
FROM cities_world
    WHERE country='usa'
```

## INSERT INTO...VALUES

Inserts rows into an existing table by specifying columns and values. Specified
columns and associated data types must precisely match the columns and data types in the
destination table.

###### Important

We do not recommend inserting rows using `VALUES` because Athena
generates files for each `INSERT` operation. This can cause many small
files to be created and degrade the table's query performance. To identify files
that an `INSERT` query creates, examine the data manifest file. For more
information, see [Work with query results and recent queries](querying.md).

### Synopsis

```sql

INSERT INTO destination_table [(col1,col2,...)]
VALUES (col1value,col2value,...)[,
       (col1value,col2value,...)][,
       ...]
```

### Examples

In the following examples, the cities table has three columns: `id`,
`city`, `state`, `state_motto`. The
`id` column is type `INT` and all other columns are type
`VARCHAR`.

Insert a single row into the `cities` table, with all column values
specified:

```sql

INSERT INTO cities
VALUES (1,'Lansing','MI','Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice')
```

Insert two rows into the `cities` table:

```sql

INSERT INTO cities
VALUES (1,'Lansing','MI','Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice'),
       (3,'Boise','ID','Esto perpetua')
```
