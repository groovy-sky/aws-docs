# Amazon Athena MSK connector

The Amazon Athena connector for [Amazon MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/msk) enables
Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on your Apache Kafka topics. Use this connector to view [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) topics as tables and messages as
rows in Athena. For additional information, see [Analyze real-time streaming data in Amazon MSK with Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/analyze-real-time-streaming-data-in-amazon-msk-with-amazon-athena) in the AWS Big Data
Blog.

This connector does not use Glue Connections to centralize configuration properties in Glue. Connection configuration is done through Lambda.

## Prerequisites

Deploy the connector to your AWS account using the Athena console or the AWS Serverless Application Repository. For more information, see [Create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md) or [Use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md).

## Limitations

- Write DDL operations are not supported.

- Any relevant Lambda limits. For more information, see [Lambda quotas](../../../lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

- Date and timestamp data types in filter conditions must be cast to appropriate data types.

- Date and timestamp data types are not supported for the CSV file type and are
treated as varchar values.

- Mapping into nested JSON fields is not supported. The connector maps top-level
fields only.

- The connector does not support complex types. Complex types are interpreted as
strings.

- To extract or work with complex JSON values, use the JSON-related functions
available in Athena. For more information, see [Extract JSON data from strings](extracting-data-from-json.md).

- The connector does not support access to Kafka message metadata.

## Terms

- Metadata handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves metadata from your database instance.

- Record handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves data records from your database instance.

- Composite handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves both metadata and data records from your database instance.

- Kafka endpoint – A text string that
establishes a connection to a Kafka instance.

## Cluster compatibility

The MSK connector can be used with the following cluster types.

- MSK Provisioned cluster – You manually
specify, monitor, and scale cluster capacity.

- MSK Serverless cluster – Provides
on-demand capacity that scales automatically as application I/O scales.

- Standalone Kafka – A direct connection
to Kafka (authenticated or unauthenticated).

## Supported authentication methods

The connector supports the following authentication methods.

- [SASL/IAM](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.md)

- [SSL](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/msk-authentication.md)

- [SASL/SCRAM](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/msk-password.md)

- SASL/PLAIN

- SASL/PLAINTEXT

- NO\_AUTH

For more information, see [Configuring authentication for the Athena MSK connector](#connectors-msk-setup-configuring-authentication).

## Supported input data formats

The connector supports the following input data formats.

- JSON

- CSV

## Parameters

Use the parameters in this section to configure the Athena
MSK connector.

- auth\_type – Specifies the authentication
type of the cluster. The connector supports the following types of
authentication:

- NO\_AUTH – Connect directly to
Kafka with no authentication (for example, to a Kafka cluster deployed
over an EC2 instance that does not use authentication).

- SASL\_SSL\_PLAIN – This method
uses the `SASL_SSL` security protocol and the
`PLAIN` SASL mechanism.

- SASL\_PLAINTEXT\_PLAIN – This
method uses the `SASL_PLAINTEXT` security protocol and the
`PLAIN` SASL mechanism.

###### Note

The `SASL_SSL_PLAIN` and
`SASL_PLAINTEXT_PLAIN` authentication types are
supported by Apache Kafka but not by Amazon MSK.

- SASL\_SSL\_AWS\_MSK\_IAM – IAM
access control for Amazon MSK enables you to handle both authentication and
authorization for your MSK cluster. Your user's AWS credentials
(secret key and access key) are used to connect with the cluster. For
more information, see [IAM access\
control](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.md) in the Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide.

- SASL\_SSL\_SCRAM\_SHA512 – You can
use this authentication type to control access to your Amazon MSK clusters.
This method stores the user name and password on AWS Secrets Manager. The secret
must be associated with the Amazon MSK cluster. For more information, see
[Setting up SASL/SCRAM authentication for an Amazon MSK cluster](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/msk-password.md#msk-password-tutorial)
in the Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide.

- SSL – SSL authentication uses
key store and trust store files to connect with the Amazon MSK cluster. You
must generate the trust store and key store files, upload them to an
Amazon S3 bucket, and provide the reference to Amazon S3 when you deploy the
connector. The key store, trust store, and SSL key are stored in
AWS Secrets Manager. Your client must provide the AWS secret key when the
connector is deployed. For more information, see [Mutual TLS\
authentication](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/msk-authentication.md) in the Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide.

For more information, see [Configuring authentication for the Athena MSK connector](#connectors-msk-setup-configuring-authentication).

- certificates\_s3\_reference – The Amazon S3
location that contains the certificates (the key store and trust store
files).

- disable\_spill\_encryption – (Optional)
When set to `True`, disables spill encryption. Defaults to
`False` so that data that is spilled to S3 is encrypted using
AES-GCM – either using a randomly generated key or KMS to generate keys.
Disabling spill encryption can improve performance, especially if your spill
location uses [server-side\
encryption](../../../s3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.md).

- kafka\_endpoint – The endpoint details to
provide to Kafka. For example, for an Amazon MSK cluster, you provide a [bootstrap\
URL](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/msk-get-bootstrap-brokers.md) for the cluster.

- secrets\_manager\_secret – The name of the
AWS secret in which the credentials are saved. This parameter is not required
for IAM authentication.

- Spill parameters – Lambda functions
temporarily store ("spill") data that do not fit into memory to Amazon S3. All
database instances accessed by the same Lambda function spill to the same
location. Use the parameters in the following table to specify the spill
location.

ParameterDescription`spill_bucket`Required. The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the Lambda
function can spill data.`spill_prefix`Required. The prefix within the spill bucket where the Lambda
function can spill data.`spill_put_request_headers`(Optional) A JSON encoded map of request headers and values
for the Amazon S3 `putObject` request that is used for
spilling (for example, `{"x-amz-server-side-encryption" :
                                          "AES256"}`). For other possible headers, see [PutObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Data type support

The following table shows the corresponding data types supported for Kafka and Apache
Arrow.

KafkaArrowCHARVARCHARVARCHARVARCHARTIMESTAMPMILLISECONDDATEDAYBOOLEANBOOLSMALLINTSMALLINTINTEGERINTBIGINTBIGINTDECIMALFLOAT8DOUBLEFLOAT8

## Partitions and splits

Kafka topics are split into partitions. Each partition is ordered. Each message in a
partition has an incremental ID called an _offset_.
Each Kafka partition is further divided to multiple splits for parallel processing. Data
is available for the retention period configured in Kafka clusters.

## Best practices

As a best practice, use predicate pushdown when you query Athena, as in the following
examples.

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "msk_catalog_name"."glue_schema_registry_name"."glue_schema_name"
WHERE integercol = 2147483647
```

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "msk_catalog_name"."glue_schema_registry_name"."glue_schema_name"
WHERE timestampcol >= TIMESTAMP '2018-03-25 07:30:58.878'
```

## Setting up the MSK connector

Before you can use the connector, you must set up your Amazon MSK cluster, use the [AWS Glue Schema\
Registry](../../../glue/latest/dg/schema-registry.md) to define your schema, and configure authentication for the
connector.

###### Note

If you deploy the connector into a VPC in order to access private resources and
also want to connect to a publicly accessible service like Confluent, you must
associate the connector with a private subnet that has a NAT Gateway. For more
information, see [NAT gateways](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.md) in the
Amazon VPC User Guide.

When working with the AWS Glue Schema Registry, note the following points:

- Make sure that the text in **Description** field of the AWS Glue
Schema Registry includes the string `{AthenaFederationMSK}`. This
marker string is required for AWS Glue Registries that you use with the Amazon Athena
MSK connector.

- For best performance, use only lowercase for your database names and table names. Using mixed casing causes the connector to perform a case insensitive search that is more computationally intensive.

###### To set up your Amazon MSK environment and AWS Glue Schema Registry

1. Set up your Amazon MSK environment. For information and steps, see [Setting up Amazon MSK](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/before-you-begin.md) and [Getting started using\
    Amazon MSK](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/getting-started.md) in the Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide.

2. Upload the Kafka topic description file (that is, its schema) in JSON format
    to the AWS Glue Schema Registry. For more information, see [Integrating with AWS Glue Schema Registry](../../../glue/latest/dg/schema-registry-integrations.md) in the AWS Glue Developer Guide. For
    example schemas, see the following section.

Use the format of the examples in this section when you upload your schema to
the [AWS Glue\
Schema Registry](../../../glue/latest/dg/schema-registry.md).

#### JSON type schema example

In the following example, the schema to be created in the AWS Glue Schema
Registry specifies `json` as the value for
`dataFormat` and uses `datatypejson` for
`topicName`.

###### Note

The value for `topicName` should use the same casing as the
topic name in Kafka.

```json

{
  "topicName": "datatypejson",
  "message": {
    "dataFormat": "json",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "intcol",
        "mapping": "intcol",
        "type": "INTEGER"
      },
      {
        "name": "varcharcol",
        "mapping": "varcharcol",
        "type": "VARCHAR"
      },
      {
        "name": "booleancol",
        "mapping": "booleancol",
        "type": "BOOLEAN"
      },
      {
        "name": "bigintcol",
        "mapping": "bigintcol",
        "type": "BIGINT"
      },
      {
        "name": "doublecol",
        "mapping": "doublecol",
        "type": "DOUBLE"
      },
      {
        "name": "smallintcol",
        "mapping": "smallintcol",
        "type": "SMALLINT"
      },
      {
        "name": "tinyintcol",
        "mapping": "tinyintcol",
        "type": "TINYINT"
      },
      {
        "name": "datecol",
        "mapping": "datecol",
        "type": "DATE",
        "formatHint": "yyyy-MM-dd"
      },
      {
        "name": "timestampcol",
        "mapping": "timestampcol",
        "type": "TIMESTAMP",
        "formatHint": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### CSV type schema example

In the following example, the schema to be created in the AWS Glue Schema
Registry specifies `csv` as the value for `dataFormat`
and uses `datatypecsvbulk` for `topicName`. The value
for `topicName` should use the same casing as the topic name in
Kafka.

```json

{
  "topicName": "datatypecsvbulk",
  "message": {
    "dataFormat": "csv",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "intcol",
        "type": "INTEGER",
        "mapping": "0"
      },
      {
        "name": "varcharcol",
        "type": "VARCHAR",
        "mapping": "1"
      },
      {
        "name": "booleancol",
        "type": "BOOLEAN",
        "mapping": "2"
      },
      {
        "name": "bigintcol",
        "type": "BIGINT",
        "mapping": "3"
      },
      {
        "name": "doublecol",
        "type": "DOUBLE",
        "mapping": "4"
      },
      {
        "name": "smallintcol",
        "type": "SMALLINT",
        "mapping": "5"
      },
      {
        "name": "tinyintcol",
        "type": "TINYINT",
        "mapping": "6"
      },
      {
        "name": "floatcol",
        "type": "DOUBLE",
        "mapping": "7"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuring authentication for the Athena MSK connector

You can use a variety of methods to authenticate to your Amazon MSK cluster, including
IAM, SSL, SCRAM, and standalone Kafka.

The following table shows the authentication types for the connector and the
security protocol and SASL mechanism for each. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization for Apache Kafka APIs](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/kafka-apis-iam.md) in the
Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide.

auth\_typesecurity.protocolsasl.mechanism`SASL_SSL_PLAIN``SASL_SSL``PLAIN``SASL_PLAINTEXT_PLAIN``SASL_PLAINTEXT``PLAIN``SASL_SSL_AWS_MSK_IAM``SASL_SSL``AWS_MSK_IAM``SASL_SSL_SCRAM_SHA512``SASL_SSL``SCRAM-SHA-512``SSL``SSL`N/A

###### Note

The `SASL_SSL_PLAIN` and `SASL_PLAINTEXT_PLAIN`
authentication types are supported by Apache Kafka but not by Amazon MSK.

#### SASL/IAM

If the cluster uses IAM authentication, you must configure the IAM policy
for the user when you set up the cluster. For more information, see [IAM access control](../../../msk/latest/developerguide/iam-access-control.md) in the Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka Developer Guide.

To use this authentication type, set the `auth_type` Lambda
environment variable for the connector to `SASL_SSL_AWS_MSK_IAM`.

#### SSL

If the cluster is SSL authenticated, you must generate the trust store and key
store files and upload them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You must provide this Amazon S3
reference when you deploy the connector. The key store, trust store, and SSL key
are stored in the AWS Secrets Manager. You provide the AWS secret key when you deploy
the connector.

For information on creating a secret in Secrets Manager, see [Create an AWS Secrets Manager\
secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create-secret.md).

To use this authentication type, set the environment variables as shown in the
following table.

ParameterValue`auth_type``SSL``certificates_s3_reference`The Amazon S3 location that contains the certificates.`secrets_manager_secret`The name of your AWS secret key.

After you create a secret in Secrets Manager, you can view it in the Secrets Manager
console.

###### To view your secret in Secrets Manager

1. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Secrets**.

3. On the **Secrets** page, choose the link to your
    secret.

4. On the details page for your secret, choose **Retrieve secret**
**value**.

The following image shows an example secret with three key/value
    pairs: `keystore_password`, `truststore_password`,
    and `ssl_key_password`.

![Retrieving an SSL secret in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-msk-setup-1.png)

#### SASL/SCRAM

If your cluster uses SCRAM authentication, provide the Secrets Manager key that is
associated with the cluster when you deploy the connector. The user's AWS
credentials (secret key and access key) are used to authenticate with the
cluster.

Set the environment variables as shown in the following table.

ParameterValue`auth_type``SASL_SSL_SCRAM_SHA512``secrets_manager_secret`The name of your AWS secret key.

The following image shows an example secret in the Secrets Manager console with two
key/value pairs: one for `username`, and one for
`password`.
