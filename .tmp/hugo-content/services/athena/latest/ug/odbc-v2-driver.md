# Amazon Athena ODBC 2.x

You can use an ODBC connection to connect to Amazon Athena from many third-party SQL client
tools and applications. You set up the ODBC connection on your client computer.

## Considerations and limitations

For information on migrating from the Athena ODBC 1.x driver to the Athena 2.x
ODBC driver, see [Migrate to the ODBC 2.x driver](odbc-v2-driver-migrating.md).

## ODBC 2.x driver download

To download the Amazon Athena 2.x ODBC driver, visit the links on this page.

###### Important

When you use the ODBC 2.x driver, be sure to note the following
requirements:

- Open port 444 – Keep port 444, which
Athena uses to stream query results, open to outbound traffic. When you use a
PrivateLink endpoint to connect to Athena, ensure that the security group
attached to the PrivateLink endpoint is open to inbound traffic on port 444.

- athena:GetQueryResultsStream policy
– Add the `athena:GetQueryResultsStream` policy action to
the IAM principals that use the ODBC driver. This policy action is not
exposed directly with the API. It is used only with the ODBC and JDBC
drivers as part of streaming results support. For an example policy, see
[AWS managed policy: AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy).

###### Important

Security update: Version 2.1.0.0 includes security
enhancements to authentication, query processing, and transport security components.
We recommend upgrading to this version to benefit from these improvements. For details,
see the [Amazon Athena ODBC 2.x release notes](odbc-v2-driver-release-notes.md).

## Trusted identity propagation with ODBC

You can now connect to Amazon Athena using ODBC drivers with single sign-on capabilities through AWS Identity and Access Management Identity Center.
When you access Athena from tools like PowerBI, Tableau, or DBeaver, your identity and
permissions automatically propagate to Athena through IAM Identity Center. For more
information, see [Use Trusted identity propagation with Amazon Athena drivers](using-trusted-identity-propagation.md).
