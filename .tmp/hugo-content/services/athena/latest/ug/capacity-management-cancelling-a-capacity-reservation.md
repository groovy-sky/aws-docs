# Cancel a capacity reservation

If you no longer want to use a capacity reservation, you can cancel it. Queries
that are still running in the workgroups that were using the reservation will be
allowed to finish, but other queries in the workgroup will no longer use the
reservation.

###### Note

Cancelled capacity is not guaranteed to be re-reservable at a future date.
Capacity cannot be transferred to another reservation, AWS account or
AWS Region.

###### To cancel a capacity reservation

1. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

2. If the console navigation pane is not visible, choose the expansion menu
    on the left.

3. Choose **Administration**, **Capacity**
**reservations**.

4. In the list of capacity reservations, do one of the following:

- Select the button next to the reservation, and then choose
**Cancel**.

- Choose the reservation link, and then choose **Cancel**
**capacity reservation**.

5. At the **Cancel capacity reservation?** prompt, enter
    **cancel**, and then choose **Cancel capacity**
**reservation**.

The reservation's status changes to **Cancelling**, and a
    progress banner informs you that the cancellation is in progress.

When the cancellation is complete, the capacity reservation remains, but
    its status shows as **Cancelled**. The reservation will be
    deleted 45 days after cancellation. During the 45 days, you cannot
    re-purpose or reuse a reservation that has been cancelled, but you can refer
    to its tags and view it for historical reference.
