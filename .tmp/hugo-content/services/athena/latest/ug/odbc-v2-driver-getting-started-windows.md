# Windows

If you want to use a Windows client computer to access Amazon Athena, the Amazon Athena ODBC driver
is required.

## Windows system requirements

Install the Amazon Athena ODBC driver on client computers that will access Amazon Athena
databases directly instead of using a web browser.

The Windows system you use must meet the following requirements:

- You have administrator rights

- One of the following operating systems:

- Windows 11, 10, or 8.1

- Windows Server 2019, 2016, or 2012

- Supported processor architecture : x86\_64 (64-bit)

- At least 100 MB of available disk space

- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) for 64-bit
Windows is installed.

## Installing the Amazon Athena ODBC driver

###### To download and install the Amazon Athena ODBC driver for Windows

1. [Download](odbc-v2-driver.md#odbc-v2-driver-download) the
    `AmazonAthenaODBC-2.x.x.x.msi`
    installation file.

2. Launch the installation file, and then choose
    **Next**.

3. To accept the terms of the license agreement, select the check box, and then
    choose **Next**.

4. To change the installation location, choose **Browse**,
    browse to the desired folder, and then choose **OK**.

5. To accept the installation location, choose **Next**.

6. Choose **Install**.

7. When the installation completes, choose **Finish**.

## Ways to set driver configuration options

To control the behavior of the Amazon Athena ODBC driver in Windows, you can set driver
configuration options in the following ways:

- In the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** program when you
configure a data source name (DSN).

- By adding or changing Windows registry keys in the following location:

```nohighlight

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC.INI\YOUR_DSN_NAME
```

- By setting driver options in the connection string when you connect
programmatically.

## Configuring a data source name on Windows

After you download and install the ODBC driver, you must add a data source name (DSN)
entry to the client computer or Amazon EC2 instance. SQL client tools use this data source to
connect to and query Amazon Athena.

###### To create a system DSN entry

01. From the Windows **Start** menu, right-click **ODBC**
    **Data Sources (64 bit)**, and then choose **More**,
     **Run as administrator**.

02. In the **ODBC Data Source Administrator**, choose the
     **Drivers** tab.

03. In the **Name** column, verify that **Amazon Athena ODBC**
    **(x64)** is present.

04. Do one of the following:

- To configure the driver for all users on the computer, choose the
**System DSN** tab. Because applications that use a
different account to load data might not be able to detect user DSNs
from another account, we recommend the system DSN configuration
option.

###### Note

Using the **System DSN** option requires
administrative privileges.

- To configure the driver for your user account only, choose the
**User DSN** tab.

05. Choose **Add**. The **Create New Data**
    **Source** dialog box opens.

06. Choose **Amazon Athena ODBC (x64)**, and then choose
     **Finish**.

07. In the **Amazon Athena ODBC Configuration** dialog box, enter the
     following information. For detailed information about these options, see [Main ODBC 2.x connection parameters](odbc-v2-driver-main-connection-parameters.md).

- For **Data Source Name**, enter a name that you want
to use to identify the data source.

- For **Description**, enter a description to help you
identify the data source.

- For **Region**, enter the name of the AWS Region
that you will use Athena in (for example, `
                              us-west-1`).

- For **Catalog**, enter the name of the Amazon Athena
catalog. The default is **AwsDataCatalog**, which is
used by AWS Glue.

- For **Database**, enter the name of the Amazon Athena
database. The default is **default**.

- For **Workgroup**, enter the name of the Amazon Athena
workgroup. The default is **primary**.

- For **S3 Output Location**, enter the location in
Amazon S3 where the query results will be stored (for example,
`s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/`).

- (Optional) For **Encryption Options**, choose an
encryption option. The default is `NOT_SET`.

- (Optional) For **KMS Key**, choose an encryption KMS
key if required.

08. To specify configuration options for IAM authentication, choose
     **Authentication Options.**

09. Enter the following information:

- For **Authentication Type**, choose **IAM**
**Credentials**. This is the default. For more information
about available authentication types, see [Authentication options](odbc-v2-driver-authentication-options.md).

- For **Username**, enter a user name.

- For **Password**, enter a password.

- For **Session Token**, enter a session token if you
want to use temporary AWS credentials. For information about temporary
credentials, see [Using temporary credentials with AWS resources](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-credentials-temp-use-resources.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

10. Choose **OK**.

11. At the bottom of the **Amazon Athena ODBC Configuration**
     dialog box, choose **Test**. If the client computer connects
     successfully to Amazon Athena, the **Connection test** box reports
     **Connection successful**. If not, the box reports
     **Connection failed** with corresponding error
     information.

12. Choose **OK** to close the connection test. The data source
     that you created now appears in the list of data source names.

## Using a DSN-less connection on Windows

You can use a DSN-less connection to connect to a database without a Data Source Name
(DSN). The following example shows a connection string for the Amazon Athena ODBC (x64) ODBC
driver that connects to Amazon Athena.

```nohighlight

DRIVER={Amazon Athena ODBC (x64)};Catalog=AwsDataCatalog;AwsRegion=us-west-1;Schema=test_schema;S3OutputLocation=
s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/;AuthenticationType=IAM Credentials;UID=YOUR_UID;PWD=YOUR_PWD;
```
