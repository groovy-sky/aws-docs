# Considerations and limitations

Consider the following points when you use user defined function (UDFs) in
Athena.

- **Built-in Athena functions** – Built-in
functions in Athena are designed to be highly performant. We recommend that you
use built-in functions over UDFs when possible. For more information about
built-in functions, see [Functions in Amazon Athena](functions.md).

- **Scalar UDFs only** – Athena only supports
scalar UDFs, which process one row at a time and return a single column value.
Athena passes a batch of rows, potentially in parallel, to the UDF each time it
invokes Lambda. When designing UDFs and queries, be mindful of the potential
impact to network traffic of this processing.

- UDF handler functions use abbreviated format
– Use abbreviated format (not full format), for your UDF functions (for
example, `package.Class` instead of
`package.Class::method`).

- UDF methods must be lowercase – UDF
methods must be in lowercase; camel case is not permitted.

- UDF methods require parameters – UDF
methods must have at least one input parameter. Attempting to invoke a UDF
defined without input parameters causes a runtime exception. UDFs are meant to
perform functions against data records, but a UDF without arguments takes in no
data, so an exception occurs.

- **Java runtime support** – Currently,
Athena UDFs support the Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17 runtimes for Lambda. For more
information, see [Building Lambda functions with\
Java](../../../lambda/latest/dg/lambda-java.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

###### Note

For Java 17, you must set the value of `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable as `--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED` in your Lambda.

- **IAM permissions** – To run and create
UDF query statements in Athena, the IAM principal running the query must be
allowed to perform actions in addition to Athena functions. For more information,
see [Allow access to Athena UDFs: Example policies](udf-iam-access.md).

- **Lambda quotas** – Lambda quotas apply to
UDFs. For more information, see [Lambda quotas](../../../lambda/latest/dg/limits.md) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

- Row-level filtering – Lake Formation row-level
filtering is not supported for UDFs.

- Views – You cannot use views with UDFs.

- **Known issues** – For the most up-to-date
list of known issues, see [Limitations and issues](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation/wiki/Limitations_And_Issues) in the awslabs/aws-athena-query-federation
section of GitHub.
