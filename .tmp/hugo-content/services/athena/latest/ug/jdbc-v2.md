# Athena JDBC 2.x driver

You can use a JDBC connection to connect Athena to business intelligence tools and other
applications, such as [SQL workbench](http://www.sql-workbench.eu/downloads.html). To
do this, use the Amazon S3 links on this page to download, install, and configure the Athena JDBC
2.x driver. For information about building the JDBC connection URL, see the downloadable
[JDBC driver installation and configuration guide](https://downloads.athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/drivers/JDBC/SimbaAthenaJDBC-2.2.2.1000/docs/Simba+Amazon+Athena+JDBC+Connector+Install+and+Configuration+Guide.pdf). For permissions information,
see [Control access through JDBC and ODBC connections](policy-actions.md). To submit feedback
regarding the JDBC driver, email [athena-feedback@amazon.com](mailto:athena-feedback@amazon.com). Starting with version 2.0.24, two versions of the
driver are available: one that includes the AWS SDK, and one that does not.

###### Important

When you use the JDBC driver, be sure to note the following requirements:

- Open port 444 – Keep port 444, which
Athena uses to stream query results, open to outbound traffic. When you use a
PrivateLink endpoint to connect to Athena, ensure that the security group
attached to the PrivateLink endpoint is open to inbound traffic on port 444. If
port 444 is blocked, you may receive the error message
**`[Simba][AthenaJDBC](100123) An error has occurred. Exception**
**during column initialization`**.

- athena:GetQueryResultsStream policy –
Add the `athena:GetQueryResultsStream` policy action to the IAM
principals that use the JDBC driver. This policy action is not exposed directly
with the API. It is used only with the ODBC and JDBC drivers as part of
streaming results support. For an example policy, see [AWS managed policy: AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#awsquicksightathenaaccess-managed-policy).

- Using the JDBC driver for multiple data
catalogs – To use the JDBC driver for multiple data catalogs
with Athena (for example, when using an [external Hive metastore](connect-to-data-source-hive.md)
or [federated queries](federated-queries.md)), include
`MetadataRetrievalMethod=ProxyAPI` in your JDBC connection
string.

- 4.1 drivers – Starting in 2023, driver
support for JDBC version 4.1 is discontinued. No further updates will be
released. If you are using a JDBC 4.1 driver, migration to the 4.2 driver is
highly recommended.

## JDBC 2.x driver with AWS SDK

The JDBC driver version 2.2.2 complies with the JDBC API 4.2 data standard and
requires JDK 8.0 or later. For information about checking the version of Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) that you use, see the Java [documentation](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html).

Use the following link to download the JDBC 4.2 driver `.jar`
file.
