# Create a `ROW`

###### Note

The examples in this section use `ROW` as a means to create sample data
to work with. When you query tables within Athena, you do not need to create
`ROW` data types, as they are already created from your data source.
When you use `CREATE_TABLE`, Athena defines a `STRUCT` in it,
populates it with data, and creates the `ROW` data type for you, for each
row in the dataset. The underlying `ROW` data type consists of named
fields of any supported SQL data types.

```sql

WITH dataset AS (
 SELECT
   ROW('Bob', 38) AS users
 )
SELECT * FROM dataset
```

This query returns:

```

+-------------------------+
| users                   |
+-------------------------+
| {field0=Bob, field1=38} |
+-------------------------+
```
