# Amazon Athena Hortonworks connector

The Amazon Athena connector for Hortonworks enables Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on the
Cloudera [Hortonworks](https://www.cloudera.com/products/hdp.html) data
platform. The connector transforms your Athena SQL queries to their equivalent HiveQL
syntax.

This connector does not use Glue Connections to centralize configuration properties in Glue. Connection configuration is done through Lambda.

## Prerequisites

- Deploy the connector to your AWS account using the Athena console or the AWS Serverless Application Repository. For more information, see [Create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md) or [Use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md).

## Limitations

- Write DDL operations are not supported.

- In a multiplexer setup, the spill bucket and prefix are shared across all
database instances.

- Any relevant Lambda limits. For more information, see [Lambda quotas](../../../lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

## Terms

The following terms relate to the Hortonworks Hive connector.

- Database instance – Any instance of a
database deployed on premises, on Amazon EC2, or on Amazon RDS.

- Handler – A Lambda handler that accesses
your database instance. A handler can be for metadata or for data
records.

- Metadata handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves metadata from your database instance.

- Record handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves data records from your database instance.

- Composite handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves both metadata and data records from your database instance.

- Property or parameter – A database
property used by handlers to extract database information. You configure these
properties as Lambda environment variables.

- Connection String – A string of text
used to establish a connection to a database instance.

- Catalog – A non-AWS Glue catalog registered
with Athena that is a required prefix for the `connection_string`
property.

- Multiplexing handler – A Lambda handler
that can accept and use multiple database connections.

## Parameters

Use the parameters in this section to configure the Hortonworks Hive connector.

### Connection string

Use a JDBC connection string in the following format to connect to a database
instance.

```nohighlight

hive://${jdbc_connection_string}
```

### Using a multiplexing handler

You can use a multiplexer to connect to multiple database instances with a single
Lambda function. Requests are routed by catalog name. Use the following classes in
Lambda.

HandlerClassComposite handler`HiveMuxCompositeHandler`Metadata handler`HiveMuxMetadataHandler`Record handler`HiveMuxRecordHandler`

#### Multiplexing handler parameters

ParameterDescription`$catalog_connection_string`Required. A database instance connection string. Prefix the
environment variable with the name of the catalog used in Athena. For example,
if the catalog registered with Athena is
`myhivecatalog`, then the environment
variable name is
`myhivecatalog_connection_string`.`default`Required. The default connection string. This string is used
when the catalog is
`lambda:${` `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` `}`.

The following example properties are for a Hive MUX Lambda function
that supports two database instances: `hive1` (the
default), and `hive2`.

PropertyValue`default``hive://jdbc:hive2://hive1:10000/default?${Test/RDS/hive1}``hive_catalog1_connection_string``hive://jdbc:hive2://hive1:10000/default?${Test/RDS/hive1}``hive_catalog2_connection_string``hive://jdbc:hive2://hive2:10000/default?UID=sample&PWD=sample`

#### Providing credentials

To provide a user name and password for your database in your JDBC connection
string, you can use connection string properties or AWS Secrets Manager.

- Connection String – A user name
and password can be specified as properties in the JDBC connection
string.

###### Important

As a security best practice, don't use hardcoded credentials in your
environment variables or connection strings. For information about moving
your hardcoded secrets to AWS Secrets Manager, see [Move hardcoded\
secrets to AWS Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/hardcoded.md) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

- AWS Secrets Manager – To use the Athena
Federated Query feature with AWS Secrets Manager, the VPC connected to your Lambda
function should have [internet access](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function) or a [VPC\
endpoint](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoint-overview.md) to connect to Secrets Manager.

You can put the name of a secret in AWS Secrets Manager in your JDBC connection
string. The connector replaces the secret name with the
`username` and `password` values from
Secrets Manager.

For Amazon RDS database instances, this support is tightly integrated. If
you use Amazon RDS, we highly recommend using AWS Secrets Manager and credential
rotation. If your database does not use Amazon RDS, store the credentials as
JSON in the following format:

```nohighlight

{"username": "${username}", "password": "${password}"}
```

###### Example connection string with secret name

The following string has the secret name
`${Test/RDS/hive1host}`.

```

hive://jdbc:hive2://hive1host:10000/default?...&${Test/RDS/hive1host}&...
```

The connector uses the secret name to retrieve secrets and provide the user name and password, as in the following example.

```

hive://jdbc:hive2://hive1host:10000/default?...&UID=sample2&PWD=sample2&...
```

Currently, the Hortonworks Hive connector recognizes the `UID` and
`PWD` JDBC properties.

### Using a single connection handler

You can use the following single connection metadata and record handlers to
connect to a single Hortonworks Hive instance.

Handler typeClassComposite handler`HiveCompositeHandler`Metadata handler`HiveMetadataHandler`Record handler`HiveRecordHandler`

#### Single connection handler parameters

ParameterDescription`default`Required. The default connection string.

The single connection handlers support one database instance and must provide a
`default` connection string parameter. All other connection
strings are ignored.

The following example property is for a single Hortonworks Hive instance supported by a Lambda function.

PropertyValue`default``hive://jdbc:hive2://hive1host:10000/default?secret=${Test/RDS/hive1host}`

### Spill parameters

The Lambda SDK can spill data to Amazon S3. All database instances accessed by the same
Lambda function spill to the same location.

ParameterDescription`spill_bucket`Required. Spill bucket name.`spill_prefix`Required. Spill bucket key
prefix.`spill_put_request_headers`(Optional) A JSON encoded map of request headers and values for
the Amazon S3 `putObject` request that is used for spilling
(for example, `{"x-amz-server-side-encryption" :
                                    "AES256"}`). For other possible headers, see [PutObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md)
in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

###### Note

Currently, Hortonworks Hive does not support the aggregate types
`ARRAY`, `MAP`, `STRUCT`, or
`UNIONTYPE`. Columns of aggregate types are treated as
`VARCHAR` columns in SQL.

## Partitions and splits

Partitions are used to determine how to generate splits for the connector. Athena constructs a synthetic column of type `varchar` that represents the partitioning scheme for the table to help the connector generate splits. The connector does not modify the actual table definition.

## Performance

Hortonworks Hive supports static partitions. The Athena Hortonworks Hive connector can
retrieve data from these partitions in parallel. If you want to query very large
datasets with uniform partition distribution, static partitioning is highly
recommended. Selecting a subset of columns significantly speeds up query runtime and reduces data scanned.
The Hortonworks Hive connector is resilient to throttling due to concurrency.

The Athena Hortonworks Hive connector performs predicate pushdown to decrease the data scanned by the query. `LIMIT` clauses, simple predicates, and complex expressions are pushed down to the connector to reduce the amount of data scanned and decrease query execution run time.

### LIMIT clauses

A `LIMIT N` statement reduces the data scanned by the query. With
`LIMIT N` pushdown, the connector returns only `N` rows to
Athena.

### Predicates

A predicate is an expression in the `WHERE` clause of a SQL query that
evaluates to a Boolean value and filters rows based on multiple conditions. The
Athena Hortonworks Hive connector can combine these expressions and push them directly to
Hortonworks Hive for enhanced functionality and to reduce the amount of data scanned.

The following Athena Hortonworks Hive connector operators support predicate
pushdown:

- Boolean: AND, OR, NOT

- Equality: EQUAL, NOT\_EQUAL, LESS\_THAN,
LESS\_THAN\_OR\_EQUAL, GREATER\_THAN, GREATER\_THAN\_OR\_EQUAL, IS\_NULL

- Arithmetic: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY,
DIVIDE, MODULUS, NEGATE

- Other: LIKE\_PATTERN, IN

### Combined pushdown example

For enhanced querying capabilities, combine the pushdown types, as in the following example:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE col_a > 10
    AND ((col_a + col_b) > (col_c % col_d))
    AND (col_e IN ('val1', 'val2', 'val3') OR col_f LIKE '%pattern%')
LIMIT 10;
```

## Passthrough queries

The Hortonworks Hive connector supports [passthrough queries](federated-query-passthrough.md). Passthrough
queries use a table function to push your full query down to the data source for
execution.

To use passthrough queries with Hortonworks Hive, you can use the following syntax:

```sql

SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => 'query string'
        ))
```

The following example query pushes down a query to a data source in Hortonworks Hive. The query
selects all columns in the `customer` table, limiting the results to 10.

```sql

SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => 'SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 10'
        ))
```
