# Amazon Athena ODBC 2.x release notes

These release notes provide details of enhancements, features, known issues, and workflow
changes in the Amazon Athena ODBC 2.x driver.

## 2.1.0.0

Released 2026-03-20

The Amazon Athena The Amazon Athena ODBC v2.1.0.0 driver includes security improvements.
This release enhances authentication flows, query processing, and transport security.
We recommend upgrading to this version as soon as possible.

### Breaking changes

- SSL certificate validation enabled by default
– The driver now enforces SSL certificate verification when connecting
to identity providers. If you use a local identity provider without a valid SSL certificate,
you must explicitly set `SSL_Insecure=1` in your connection string.
For more information, see [SSL insecure (IdP)](odbc-v2-driver-common-authentication-parameters.md#odbc-v2-driver-common-authentication-parameters-ssl-insecure-idp).

- TLS 1.2 minimum enforced – The driver
no longer accepts TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 connections to identity providers. All
IdP connections now require TLS 1.2 or later.

- BrowserSSOOIDC authentication flow updated
– The BrowserSSOOIDC plugin now uses Authorization Code with PKCE
instead of Device Code Authorization. A new optional parameter
`listen_port` (default 7890) is available for the OAuth 2.0
callback server. You may need to allowlist this port on your network. The
default scope has changed to `sso:account:access`. For more
information, see [Browser SSO OIDC](odbc-v2-driver-browser-sso-oidc.md).

### Improvements

- BrowserSSOOIDC – Migrated from Device
Code flow to Authorization Code with PKCE for improved security.

- BrowserAzureAD – Added PKCE (Proof Key
for Code Exchange) to the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to prevent authorization
code interception attacks.

- BrowserSAML – Added RelayState CSRF
protection to prevent SAML token injection attacks.

- Credentials cache – Starting in v2.1.0.0,
cached credentials are stored as plaintext JSON in the
`user-profile/.athena-odbc/` directory with file permissions
restricted to the owning user, consistent with how the AWS CLI
protects locally stored credentials.

- IAM Profile – Added support for
`EcsContainer` and `Environment` credential sources
in addition to the existing `Ec2InstanceMetadata`.

- Connection string parser – Implemented
proper ODBC `}}` escape handling.

- Catalog queries – Added SQL identifier
escaping for schema names and table patterns.

- ODBC pattern matching – Replaced
regex-based matching with direct ODBC LIKE wildcard matcher.

- XML parsing – Added recursion depth
limit (100 levels) and size limit (1MB) for SAML tokens.

- ADFS authentication – Added response
size limit (200KB) for ADFS server responses.

### Fixes

- Fixed improper neutralization of special elements in authentication
components that could allow code execution or authentication flow redirection
via crafted connection parameters. Affects BrowserSSOOIDC, BrowserAzureAD,
and BrowserSAML plugins.

- Fixed improper neutralization of special elements in query processing
components that could allow denial of service or SQL injection via crafted
table metadata.

- Fixed improper certificate validation when connecting to identity
providers.

- Fixed missing authentication security controls in browser-based
authentication flows, including PKCE for OAuth, CSRF protection for SAML,
secure credential caching, and exclusive callback port binding.

- Fixed uncontrolled resource consumption in parsing components that could
allow denial of service via crafted input patterns, unbounded server
responses, or deeply nested XML payloads.

- Fixed an issue where `SQLColumns` and `SQLTables`
returned no results when using `UseSingleCatalogAndSchema=1`
with cross-account federated catalogs in Power BI Import mode.

## 2.0.6.0

Released 2025-11-21

### Improvements

- Browser Trusted Identity Propagation authentication plugin
– Added a new authentication plugin to support browser-based OpenID Connect (OIDC)
authentication with trusted identity propagation. This plugin provides a seamless authentication experience by
handling the complete OAuth 2.0 flow through your default browser, automatically fetching
the JSON Web Token (JWT), and integrating with trusted identity propagation. The plugin is specifically designed
for single-user desktop environments. For information on enabling and using trusted identity propagation, see
[What is trusted identity propagation?](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-overview.md).

- Enhanced logging framework – Significantly
improved the driver's logging mechanism by:

- Introducing more granular log levels beyond basic 0/1 options

- Removing redundant log statements

- Optimizing the logging framework to include diagnostically relevant information

- Addressing performance issues that were causing operational delays

- Reducing excessive log file generation when logging is enabled

### Fixes

- Result fetcher optimization – Fixed an issue
where fetch size parameter limitations were incorrectly applied to both streaming and
non-streaming result fetchers. The limitation is now correctly applied only to
non-streaming result fetchers.

## 2.0.5.0

Released 2025-09-10

### Improvements

- JWT Trusted Identity Provider (TIP) authentication
plugin – Added a new authentication plugin to support
JWT Trusted Identity Provider (TIP) integration with ODBC drivers. This
authentication type allows you to use a JSON web token (JWT) obtained from
an external identity provider as a connection parameter to authenticate with
Athena. With TIP, identity context is added to an IAM role to identify the
user requesting access to AWS resources. For information on enabling and
using TIP, see [What is Trusted Identity Propagation?](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-overview.md).

- Custom SSO admin endpoints support –
Added support for custom SSO Admin endpoints in the ODBC driver. This
enhancement allows you to specify your own endpoints for SSO services when
running ODBC behind VPCs.

- AWS SDK version update – We have
updated the AWS SDK version used in the driver to 2.32.16 and have updated
the project dependencies for release 2.0.5.0.

## 2.0.4.0

Released 2025-06-17

The Amazon Athena ODBC v2.0.4.0 driver contains the following improvements and
fixes.

### Improvements

- **Result Fetcher** – The driver now
automatically selects the method to download query results. This removes the
need to manually configure the fetcher in most situations. For more
information, see [Result fetcher](odbc-v2-driver-advanced-options.md#odbc-v2-driver-advanced-options-result-fetcher).

- Curl Library has been updated to 8.12.1.

### Fixes

- Fixed proxy configuration for IAM profile when connecting to STS. The fix allows IAM Profile to be used for successful authentication.

- Read all additional configuration options for IAM profile with
authentication plugins. This includes `UseProxyForIdP`,
`SSL_Insecure`, `LakeformationEnabled`, and
`LoginToRP` to resolve misconfigurations for the affected
plugins.

- Fixed round function by allowing it to take in an optional 2nd parameter.
It successfully processes queries containing the escape syntax.

- Fixed column size for `TIME WITH TIME ZONE` and `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` data types. Values with timestamp and timezone data type will not get truncated.

`AmazonAthenaODBC-2.x.x.x.msi` installer for Windows
are now signed.

- Updated the CA certificate `cacert.pem` file that is
installed with the driver.

- Improved the time required to list tables under Lambda catalogs. For
`LAMBDA` catalog types, the ODBC driver can now submit a
[SHOW TABLES](show-tables.md) query to get a
list of available tables. For more information, see [Use query to list tables](odbc-v2-driver-advanced-options.md#odbc-v2-driver-advanced-options-use-query-to-list-tables).

- Introduced the `UseWCharForStringTypes` connection parameter to
report string data types using `SQL_WCHAR` and
`SQL_WVARCHAR`. For more information, see [Use WCHAR for string types](odbc-v2-driver-advanced-options.md#odbc-v2-driver-advanced-options-use-wchar-for-string-types).

### Fixes

- Fixed a registry corruption warning that occurred when the Get-OdbcDsn
PowerShell tool was used.

- Updated the parsing logic to handle comments at the start of query
strings.
