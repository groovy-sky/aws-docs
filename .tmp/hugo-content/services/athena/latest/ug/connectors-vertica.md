# Amazon Athena Vertica connector

Vertica is a columnar database platform that can be deployed in the cloud or on premises
that supports exabyte scale data warehouses. You can use the Amazon Athena Vertica connector in
federated queries to query Vertica data sources from Athena. For example, you can run
analytical queries over a data warehouse on Vertica and a data lake in Amazon S3.

This connector does not use Glue Connections to centralize configuration properties in Glue. Connection configuration is done through Lambda.

## Prerequisites

- Deploy the connector to your AWS account using the Athena console or the AWS Serverless Application Repository. For more information, see [Create a data source connection](connect-to-a-data-source.md) or [Use the AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy a data source connector](connect-data-source-serverless-app-repo.md).

- Set up a VPC and a security group before you use this connector. For more
information, see [Create a VPC for a data source connector or AWS Glue connection](athena-connectors-vpc-creation.md).

## Limitations

- Because the Athena Vertica connector reads exported Parquet files from Amazon S3,
performance of the connector can be slow. When you query large tables, we
recommend that you use a [CREATE TABLE\
AS (SELECT ...)](ctas.md) query and SQL predicates.

- Currently, due to a known issue in Athena Federated Query, the connector causes Vertica to
export all columns of the queried table to Amazon S3, but only the queried columns
are visible in the results on the Athena console.

- Write DDL operations are not supported.

- Any relevant Lambda limits. For more information, see [Lambda quotas](../../../lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

## Workflow

The following diagram shows the workflow of a query that uses the Vertica
connector.

![Workflow of a Vertica query from Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/connectors-vertica-1.png)

1. A SQL query is issued against one or more tables in Vertica.

2. The connector parses the SQL query to send the relevant portion to Vertica
    through the JDBC connection.

3. The connection strings use the user name and password stored in AWS Secrets Manager to
    gain access to Vertica.

4. The connector wraps the SQL query with a Vertica `EXPORT` command,
    as in the following example.

```sql

EXPORT TO PARQUET (directory = 's3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/folder_name,
      Compression='Snappy', fileSizeMB=64) OVER() as
SELECT
PATH_ID,
...
SOURCE_ITEMIZED,
SOURCE_OVERRIDE
FROM DELETED_OBJECT_SCHEMA.FORM_USAGE_DATA
WHERE PATH_ID <= 5;
```

5. Vertica processes the SQL query and sends the result set to an Amazon S3 bucket.
    For better throughput, Vertica uses the `EXPORT` option to
    parallelize the write operation of multiple Parquet files.

6. Athena scans the Amazon S3 bucket to determine the number of files to read for the
    result set.

7. Athena makes multiple calls to the Lambda function and uses an Apache
    `ArrowReader` to read the Parquet files from the resulting data
    set. Multiple calls enable Athena to parallelize the reading of the Amazon S3 files
    and achieve a throughput of up to 100GB per second.

8. Athena processes the data returned from Vertica with data scanned from the data
    lake and returns the result.

## Terms

The following terms relate to the Vertica connector.

- Database instance – Any instance of a
Vertica database deployed on Amazon EC2.

- Handler – A Lambda handler that accesses
your database instance. A handler can be for metadata or for data
records.

- Metadata handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves metadata from your database instance.

- Record handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves data records from your database instance.

- Composite handler – A Lambda handler that
retrieves both metadata and data records from your database instance.

- Property or parameter – A database
property used by handlers to extract database information. You configure these
properties as Lambda environment variables.

- Connection String – A string of text
used to establish a connection to a database instance.

- Catalog – A non-AWS Glue catalog registered
with Athena that is a required prefix for the `connection_string`
property.

## Parameters

Use the parameters in this section to configure the Vertica connector.

We recommend that you configure a Vertica connector by using a Glue
connections object. To do this, set the `glue_connection`
environment variable of the Vertica connector Lambda to the name of the Glue
connection to use.

**Glue connections properties**

Use the following command to get the schema for a Glue connection object. This schema contains all the parameters that you can use to control your connection.

```

aws glue describe-connection-type --connection-type VERTICA
```

**Lambda environment properties**

- glue\_connection – Specifies the name of the Glue connection associated with the federated connector.

- **casing\_mode** – (Optional) Specifies
how to handle casing for schema and table names. The
`casing_mode` parameter uses the following values to specify
the behavior of casing:

- **none** – Do not change case
of the given schema and table names. This is the default for
connectors that have an associated glue connection.

- **upper** –
Upper case all given schema and table names.

- **lower** –
Lower case all given schema and table names.

###### Note

- All connectors that use Glue connections must use AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.

- The Vertica connector created using Glue connections does not support the use of a multiplexing handler.

- The Vertica connector created using Glue connections only supports `ConnectionSchemaVersion` 2.

The Amazon Athena Vertica connector exposes configuration options through Lambda
environment variables. You can use the following Lambda environment variables to
configure the connector.

- AthenaCatalogName – Lambda function
name

- ExportBucket – The Amazon S3 bucket where the
Vertica query results are exported.

- SpillBucket – The name of the Amazon S3
bucket where this function can spill data.

- SpillPrefix – The prefix for the
`SpillBucket`
location where this function can spill data.

- SecurityGroupIds – One or more IDs that
correspond to the security group that should be applied to the Lambda function
(for example, `sg1`, `sg2`, or `sg3`).

- SubnetIds – One or more subnet IDs that
correspond to the subnet that the Lambda function can use to access your data
source (for example, `subnet1`, or `subnet2`).

- SecretNameOrPrefix – The name or prefix
of a set of names in Secrets Manager that this function has access to (for example,
`vertica-*`)

- VerticaConnectionString – The Vertica
connection details to use by default if no catalog specific connection is
defined. The string can optionally use AWS Secrets Manager syntax (for example,
`${secret_name}`).

- VPC ID – The VPC ID to be attached to
the Lambda function.

#### Connection string

Use a JDBC connection string in the following format to connect to a database
instance.

```nohighlight

vertica://jdbc:vertica://host_name:
                        port/database?user=vertica-username&password=
                        vertica-password

```

#### Using a single connection handler

You can use the following single connection metadata and record handlers to
connect to a single Vertica instance.

Handler typeClassComposite handler`VerticaCompositeHandler`Metadata handler`VerticaMetadataHandler`Record handler`VerticaRecordHandler`

#### Single connection handler parameters

ParameterDescription`default`Required. The default connection string.

The single connection handlers support one database instance and must provide a
`default` connection string parameter. All other connection
strings are ignored.

#### Providing credentials

To provide a user name and password for your database in your JDBC connection
string, you can use connection string properties or AWS Secrets Manager.

- Connection String – A user name
and password can be specified as properties in the JDBC connection
string.

###### Important

As a security best practice, don't use hardcoded credentials in your
environment variables or connection strings. For information about moving
your hardcoded secrets to AWS Secrets Manager, see [Move hardcoded\
secrets to AWS Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/hardcoded.md) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

- AWS Secrets Manager – To use the Athena
Federated Query feature with AWS Secrets Manager, the VPC connected to your Lambda
function should have [internet access](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function) or a [VPC\
endpoint](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoint-overview.md) to connect to Secrets Manager.

You can put the name of a secret in AWS Secrets Manager in your JDBC connection
string. The connector replaces the secret name with the
`username` and `password` values from
Secrets Manager.

For Amazon RDS database instances, this support is tightly integrated. If
you use Amazon RDS, we highly recommend using AWS Secrets Manager and credential
rotation. If your database does not use Amazon RDS, store the credentials as
JSON in the following format:

```nohighlight

{"username": "${username}", "password": "${password}"}
```

###### Example connection string with secret names

The following string has the secret names ${ `vertica-username`} and
`${vertica-password}`.

```nohighlight

vertica://jdbc:vertica://
                        host_name:port/database?user=${vertica-username}&password=${vertica-password}

```

The connector uses the secret name to retrieve secrets and provide the user name and password, as in the following example.

```nohighlight

vertica://jdbc:vertica://
                        host_name:port/database?user=sample-user&password=sample-password

```

Currently, the Vertica connector recognizes the `vertica-username` and
`vertica-password`
JDBC properties.

#### Spill parameters

The Lambda SDK can spill data to Amazon S3. All database instances accessed by the same
Lambda function spill to the same location.

ParameterDescription`spill_bucket`Required. Spill bucket name.`spill_prefix`Required. Spill bucket key
prefix.`spill_put_request_headers`(Optional) A JSON encoded map of request headers and values for
the Amazon S3 `putObject` request that is used for spilling
(for example, `{"x-amz-server-side-encryption" :
                                    "AES256"}`). For other possible headers, see [PutObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md)
in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Data type support

The following table shows the supported data types for the Vertica connector.

BooleanBigIntShortIntegerLongFloatDoubleDateVarcharBytesBigDecimalTimeStamp as Varchar

## Performance

The Lambda function performs projection pushdown to decrease the data scanned by the query. `LIMIT` clauses reduce the amount of data scanned, but if you don't provide a predicate, you should expect `SELECT` queries with a `LIMIT` clause to scan at least 16 MB of data. The Vertica connector is resilient to throttling due to concurrency.

## Passthrough queries

The Vertica connector supports [passthrough queries](federated-query-passthrough.md). Passthrough
queries use a table function to push your full query down to the data source for
execution.

To use passthrough queries with Vertica, you can use the following syntax:

```sql

SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => 'query string'
        ))
```

The following example query pushes down a query to a data source in Vertica. The query
selects all columns in the `customer` table, limiting the results to 10.

```sql

SELECT * FROM TABLE(
        system.query(
            query => 'SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 10'
        ))
```
