# Permissions to create and use a data source in Athena

To create and use a data source, you need the following sets of permissions.

- AmazonAthenaFullAccess that provides full access to Amazon Athena and scoped
access to the dependencies needed to enable querying, writing results, and data
management. For more information, see [AmazonAthenaFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonathenafullaccess.md) in the AWS Managed Policy Reference
Guide.

- Permissions to call the CreateDataCatalog API. These permissions are only
needed when you create a data source that integrates with Glue connections. For
more information on the example policy, see [Permissions required to create connector and Athena catalog](athena-catalog-access.md).

- If you want to use Lake Formation fine-grain access control, in addition to the
permissions listed above, you also need the following permissions.
