# Use cell magics

Magics that are written on several lines are preceded by a double percent sign
( `%%`) and are called _cell magic functions_ or
_cell magics_.

## %%sql

This cell magic allows to run SQL statements directly without having to decorate
it with Spark SQL statement. The command also displays the output by implicitly
calling `.show()` on the returned dataframe.

![Using %%sql.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/athena/latest/ug/images/notebooks-spark-magics-1.png)

The `%%sql` command auto truncates column outputs to a width of 20
characters. Currently, this setting is not configurable. To work around this
limitation, use the following full syntax and modify the parameters of the
`show` method accordingly.

```py

spark.sql("""YOUR_SQL""").show(n=number, truncate=number, vertical=bool)
```

- n `int`, optional. The number of rows to show.

- truncate – `bool` or
`int`, optional – If `true`, truncates
strings longer than 20 characters. When set to a number greater than 1,
truncates long strings to the length specified and right aligns
cells.

- vertical – `bool`,
optional. If `true`, prints output rows vertically (one line per
column value).
