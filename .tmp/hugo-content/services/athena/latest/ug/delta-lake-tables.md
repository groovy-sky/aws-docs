# Query Linux Foundation Delta Lake tables

Linux Foundation [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is a table format for
big data analytics. You can use Amazon Athena to read Delta Lake tables stored in Amazon S3 directly
without having to generate manifest files or run the `MSCK REPAIR`
statement.

The Delta Lake format stores the minimum and maximum values per column of each data file.
The Athena implementation makes use of this information to enable file-skipping on predicates
to eliminate unwanted files from consideration.

## Considerations and limitations

Delta Lake support in Athena has the following considerations and limitations:

- Tables with AWS Glue catalog only – Native
Delta Lake support is supported only through tables registered with AWS Glue. If
you have a Delta Lake table that is registered with another metastore, you can
still keep it and treat it as your primary metastore. Because Delta Lake
metadata is stored in the file system (for example, in Amazon S3) rather than in the
metastore, Athena requires only the location property in AWS Glue to read from your
Delta Lake tables.

- V3 engine only – Delta Lake queries are
supported only on Athena engine version 3. You must ensure that the workgroup you create is
configured to use Athena engine version 3.

- No time travel support – There is no
support for queries that use Delta Lake’s time travel capabilities.

- Read only – Write DML statements like
`UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` are not
supported.

- Lake Formation support – Lake Formation integration is
available for Delta Lake tables with their schema in sync with AWS Glue. For
more information, see [Using AWS Lake Formation with\
Amazon Athena](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/athena-lf.md) and [Set up permissions\
for a Delta Lake table](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/set-up-delta-table.md) in the
_AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide_.

- **Limited DDL support** – The following DDL statements are
supported: `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE`, `SHOW COLUMNS`,
`SHOW TBLPROPERTIES`, `SHOW PARTITIONS`, `SHOW
                          CREATE TABLE`, and `DESCRIBE`. For information on using the
`CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement, see the [Get started with Delta Lake tables](delta-lake-tables-getting-started.md) section.

- Skipping Amazon Glacier objects not supported  –
If objects in the Linux Foundation Delta Lake table are in an Amazon Glacier storage class, setting the
`read_restored_glacier_objects` table property to
`false` has no effect.

For example, suppose you issue the following command:

```sql

ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('read_restored_glacier_objects' = 'false')
```

For Iceberg and Delta Lake tables, the command produces the error
**`Unsupported table property key:**
**read_restored_glacier_objects`**. For Hudi tables, the `ALTER
                          TABLE` command does not produce an error, but Amazon Glacier objects are still
not skipped. Running `SELECT` queries after the `ALTER
                          TABLE` command continues to return all objects.

- Encrypted tables – Athena does not
support natively reading CSE-KMS encrypted Delta Lake tables. This includes
SELECT statements and DDL statements.

### Delta Lake versioning and Athena

Athena does not use the [versioning](https://docs.delta.io/latest/releases.html) listed in the Delta Lake documentation. To determine whether
your Delta Lake tables are compatible with Athena, consider the following two
characteristics:

- Reader version  – Every Delta Lake
table has a reader version. Currently, this is a number between 1 and 3.
Queries that include a table with a reader version that Athena does not
support will fail.

- Table features  – Every Delta Lake
table also can declare a set of reader/writer features. Because Athena's
support of Delta Lake is read-only, table writer feature compatibility does
not apply. However, queries on tables with unsupported table reader features
will fail.

The following table shows the Delta Lake reader versions and Delta Lake table
reader features that Athena supports.

Reader features can be declared only on tables
with a reader version of 2 or greater.
