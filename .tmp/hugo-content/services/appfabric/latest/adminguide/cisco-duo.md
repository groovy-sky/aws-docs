# Configure Cisco Duo for AppFabric

Cisco Duo protects against breaches with a leading access management suite
that provides strong multi-layered defenses and innovative capabilities that allow
legitimate users in and keep bad actors out. For any organization concerned about being
breached and needs a solution fast, Cisco Duo quickly enables strong security
while also improving user productivity.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from Cisco
Duo, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format,
and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Cisco Duo

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Cisco
Duo.

### Prerequisites

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Cisco Duo to supported
destinations, you must meet the following requirements:

- To access the audit logs, you need to have an active subscription to a Duo
Essentials, Duo Advantage, or Duo Premier edition. Alternatively, new
customers with an Advantage or Premier trial can also access. For more
information about Cisco Duo editions, see [Editions &\
Pricing](https://duo.com/editions-and-pricing).

- You need to be an Administrator with Owner role to create or modify Admin
API.

- You need to add Grant read log resource” permissions to access audit logs
in the admin API.

### Rate limit considerations

Cisco Duo imposes rate limits on the Cisco Duo API.
For more information about the Cisco Duo API rate limits, see the
rate limits under [Authentication Logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi). If the combination of AppFabric and your existing
Cisco Duo API applications exceed Cisco Duo's
limits, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed. Contact Cisco Duo if you
need a rate limit increase.

### Data delay considerations

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your
destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application
as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be
customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

## Connect AppFabric to your Cisco Duo account
