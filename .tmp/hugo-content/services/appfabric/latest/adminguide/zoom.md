# Configure Zoom for AppFabric

Zoom is an all-in-one intelligent collaboration platform that makes
connecting easier, more immersive, and more dynamic for businesses and individuals.
Zoom technology puts people at the center, enabling meaningful
connections, facilitating modern collaboration, and driving human innovation through
solutions like team chat, phone, meetings, omnichannel cloud contact center, smart
recordings, whiteboard, and more, in one offering.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from Zoom,
normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the
data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Zoom

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from
Zoom.

### Prerequisites

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Zoom to supported
destinations, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must have a Zoom Pro, Business, Education, or
Enterprise plan.

- Your Zoom
**Admin** role must have permission to create
server-to-server OAuth applications. For information about enabling
server-to-server OAuth applications, see the [Enable permissions](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/s2s-oauth) section of the _Server-to-Server OAuth_ page in the
_Zoom Developers Guide_ on the
Zoom website.

- Your Zoom
**Admin** role must have permission to view
admin activity logs and sign in/sign out audit activity. For more
information about enabling permission to view audit activity, see [Using role\
management](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001078646) and [Using Admin Activity Logs](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360032748331-Using-Admin-Activity-Logs) on the Zoom Support
website.

### Rate limit considerations

Zoom imposes rate limits on the Zoom API. For more
information about Zoom API rate limits, see [Rate limits](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/rate-limits)
in the _Zoom Developers Guide_. If the combination
of AppFabric and your existing Zoom applications exceed the limit, audit
logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations

You might see an approximately 24-hour delay for an audit event to be delivered to
your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the
application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss.

## Connecting AppFabric to your Zoom account

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, then you must authorize
AppFabric with Zoom. To find the information required to authorize
Zoom with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create a server-to-server OAuth application

AppFabric uses server-to-server OAuth with app credentials to integrate with
Zoom. To create a server-to-server OAuth application in
Zoom, follow the instructions in [Create a\
Server-to-Server OAuth app](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/create) in the _Zoom_
_Developers Guide_. AppFabric does not support Zoom
webhooks, and you can skip the section for adding webhook subscriptions.

### Required scopes

Zoom offers two types of scopes: granular scopes (for newly created
applications) and classic scopes (for previously-created applications).

You must add the following granular scopes to your Zoom
server-to-server OAuth application:

- `report:read:user_activities:admin`

- `report:read:operation_logs:admin`

- `user:read:email:admin`

- `user:read:user:admin`

If you are using a previously-created application, you need to add the following
classic scopes:

- `report:read:admin`

- `user:read:admin`

### App authorizations

#### Tenant ID

AppFabric will request your tenant ID. The tenant ID in AppFabric is the
Zoom account ID. To find your Zoom account ID,
use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Zoom marketplace.

2. Choose **Manage**.

3. Choose the server-to-server OAuth application that you use for
    AppFabric.

4. Enter the account ID from the **App Credentials**
    page into the **Tenant ID** field in AppFabric.

#### Tenant name

Enter a name that identifies this unique Zoom organization.
AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions
created from the app authorization.

#### Client ID

AppFabric will request your client ID. To find your Zoom client ID,
use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Zoom marketplace.

2. Choose **Manage**.

3. Choose the server-to-server OAuth application that you use for
    AppFabric.

4. Enter the client ID from the **App Credentials** page
    into the **Client ID** field in AppFabric.

#### Client secret

AppFabric will request your client secret. To find your Zoom client
secret, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Zoom marketplace.

2. Choose **Manage**.

3. Choose the server-to-server OAuth application that you use for
    AppFabric.

4. Enter the client secret from the **App Credentials**
    page into the **Client secret** field in AppFabric.

#### Audit log delivery

Zoom makes audit logs available by accessing the API every 24
hours. When viewing audit logs with AppFabric, the data that you see for
Zoom is for the previous day’s activities.
