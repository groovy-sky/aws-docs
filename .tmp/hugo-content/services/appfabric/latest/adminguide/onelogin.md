# Configure OneLogin by One Identity for AppFabric

OneLogin by One Identity is a modern, cloud-based access management
solution that seamlessly manages all digital identities for your workforce, customers and
partners. OneLogin provides secure single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor
authentication (MFA), adaptive authentication, desktop-level MFA, directory integration with
AD, LDAP, G Suite and other external directories, identity lifecycle management and much
more. With OneLogin, you can protect your organization from the most common
attacks, resulting in increased security, frictionless user experiences, and compliance with
regulatory requirements.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from
OneLogin, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework
(OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose
stream.

## AppFabric support for OneLogin by One Identity

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from OneLogin by One
Identity.

### Prerequisites

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from OneLogin by One Identity
to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must have a OneLogin Advanced or Professional
account.

- You must have a user with the Admin/Delegated Admin Privileges.

### Rate limit considerations

OneLogin by One Identity imposes rate limits on the
OneLogin API. For more information about the
OneLogin API rate limits, see [Get Rate Limit](https://developers.onelogin.com/api-docs/1/oauth20-tokens/get-rate-limit) in the _OneLogin API_
_Reference_. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing
OneLogin API applications exceed OneLogin's
limits, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed. However, the
OneLogin rate limit can be increased. For assistance, contact
your OneLogin by One Identity Account Manager or contact [One Identity](https://partners.amazonaws.com/contactpartner?partnerId=001E000000UfZycIAF&partnerName=One+Identity).

### Data delay considerations

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your
destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application
as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be
customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).
