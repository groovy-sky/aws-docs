# Configure Box for AppFabric

Box is the leading Content Cloud, a single platform that empowers
organizations to manage the entire content lifecycle, work securely from anywhere, and
integrate across best-of-breed apps.

You can use AWS AppFabric to receive audit logs and user data from Box,
normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the
data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for the Box

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from
Box.

### Prerequisites

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Box to supported
destinations, you must meet the following requirements:

- To access the audit logs, you need to have an active paid subscription to
[Business, Business Plus,\
Enterprise, or Enterprise Plus](https://www.box.com/pricing) plans.

- You must have a user with the [Admin Privileges](https://developer.box.com/guides/events/enterprise-events/for-enterprise).

- You must have [2-factor authentication](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043697154-Two-Factor-Authentication-Set-Up-for-Your-Account) enabled on your Box
account for viewing and copying the application's client secret from the
configuration tab.

### Rate limit considerations

Box imposes rate limits on the Box API. For more
information about the Box API [rate limits](https://developer.box.com/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/rate-limits), see Rate limits on the Box Developers Guide
website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Box
applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be
delayed.

### Data delay considerations

You may see up to 30-minute delay in an audit event to get delivered to your
destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application
as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this may be
customizable on an account level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Box account

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you need to authorize AppFabric
with Box. To find the information required to authorize
Box with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application

AppFabric integrates with the Box using OAuth. Use the following steps
to create an OAuth application in Box, For more information, see
[Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/client-credentials/client-credentials-setup) on the Box website.

     Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console).
