# Configure 1Password for AppFabric

1Password is a password manager that helps you create, store, and use
strong passwords for all your online accounts. It also protects your data with encryption,
alerts you about breaches, and lets you share passwords.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from 1Password,
normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the
data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for 1Password

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from
1Password.

### Prerequisites

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from 1Password to supported
destinations, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must have an active paid 1Password Business or
Enterprise subscription plan. For more information, see [1Password\
Enterprise](https://1password.com/business-pricing) on the 1Password website.

- You must have an administrator role or team owner in the
1Password account. For more information, see [Groups](https://support.1password.com/groups) in the
1Password support website.

### Rate limit considerations

The 1Password AuditLog Events API limits requests to 600 per minute
and up to 30,000 per hour. Exceeding these limits returns an error. For more
information, see [1Password API Rate limits](https://developer.1password.com/docs/events-api/reference) in the
_1Password Events API reference_.

### Data delay considerations

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your
destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application
as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be
customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

## Connecting AppFabric to your 1Password account

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric
with 1Password. To find the information required to authorize
1Password with AppFabric, use the following steps.
