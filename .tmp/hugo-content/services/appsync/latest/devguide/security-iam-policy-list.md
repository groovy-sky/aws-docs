# AWS managed policies for AWS AppSync

To add permissions to users, groups, and roles, it is easier to use AWS managed
policies than to write policies yourself. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-create-console.md) that provide your team with only the
permissions that they need. To get started quickly, you can use our AWS managed
policies. These policies cover common use cases and are available in your AWS account.
For more information about AWS managed policies, see [AWS managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the _IAM User Guide_.

AWS services maintain and update AWS managed policies. You can't change the
permissions in AWS managed policies. Services occasionally add additional permissions
to an AWS managed policy to support new features. This type of update affects all
identities (users, groups, and roles) where the policy is attached. Services are most
likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new feature is launched or when new
operations become available. Services do not remove permissions from an AWS managed
policy, so policy updates won't break your existing permissions.

Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple
services. For example, the **ReadOnlyAccess** AWS managed
policy provides read-only access to all AWS services and resources. When a service
launches a new feature, AWS adds read-only permissions for new operations and
resources. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see [AWS managed policies for job functions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-job-functions.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.
