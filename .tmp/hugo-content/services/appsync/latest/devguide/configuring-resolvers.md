# Creating basic queries (VTL)

###### Note

We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please consider
using the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](configuring-resolvers-js.md).

GraphQL resolvers connect the fields in a type’s schema to a data source. Resolvers are
the mechanism by which requests are fulfilled. AWS AppSync can automatically create and
connect resolvers from a schema or create a schema and connect resolvers from an existing
table without you needing to write any code.

Resolvers in AWS AppSync use JavaScript to convert a GraphQL expression into a format
the data source can use. Alternatively, mapping templates can be written in [Apache Velocity Template\
Language (VTL)](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/2.0/vtl-reference.html) to convert a GraphQL expression into a format the data source can
use.

This section will show you how to configure resolvers using VTL. An introductory
tutorial-style programming guide for writing resolvers can be found in [Resolver\
mapping template programming guide](resolver-mapping-template-reference-programming-guide.md#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-programming-guide), and helper utilities available to use when
programming can be found in [Resolver mapping\
template context reference](resolver-context-reference.md#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-context-reference). AWS AppSync also has built-in test and debug flows
that you can use when you’re editing or authoring from scratch. For more information, see
[Test and debug resolvers](test-debug-resolvers.md#aws-appsync-test-debug-resolvers).

We recommend following this guide before attempting to to use any of the aforementioned
tutorials.

In this section, we will walk through how to create a resolver, add a resolver for
mutations, and use advanced configurations.

## Create your first resolver

Following the examples from the previous sections, the first step is to create a
resolver for your `Query` type.

Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AppSync console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync).
1. In the **APIs dashboard**,
       choose your GraphQL API.

2. In the **Sidebar**, choose
       **Schema**.
2. On the right-hand side of the page, there's a window called
    **Resolvers**. This box contains a
    list of the types and fields as defined in your **Schema** window on the left-hand side of
    the page. You're able to attach resolvers to fields. For example,
    under the **Query** type, choose
    **Attach** next to the
    `getTodos` field.

3. On the **Create Resolver** page,
    choose the data source you created in the [Attaching a data source](attaching-a-data-source.md) guide. In the **Configure mapping templates** window, you
    can choose both the generic request and response mapping templates
    using the drop-down list to the right or write your own.

###### Note

The pairing of a request mapping template to a response
mapping template is called a unit resolver. Unit resolvers are
typically meant to perform rote operations; we recommend using
them only for singular operations with a small number of data
sources. For more complex operations, we recommend using
pipeline resolvers, which can execute multiple operations with
multiple data sources sequentially.

For more information about the difference between request and
response mapping templates, see [Unit resolvers](resolver-mapping-template-reference-overview.md#unit-resolvers).

For more information about using pipeline resolvers, see [Pipeline\
resolvers](pipeline-resolvers.md#aws-appsync-pipeline-resolvers).

4. For common use cases, the AWS AppSync console has built-in
    templates that you can use for getting items from data sources
    (e.g., all item queries, individual lookups, etc.). For example, on
    the simple version of the schema from [Designing your\
    schema](designing-your-schema.md#aws-appsync-designing-your-schema) where `getTodos` didn’t have
    pagination, the request mapping template for listing items is as
    follows:

```sh

{
       "version" : "2017-02-28",
       "operation" : "Scan"
}
```

5. You always need a response mapping template to accompany the
    request. The console provides a default with the following
    passthrough value for lists:

```sh

$util.toJson($ctx.result.items)
```

In this example, the `context` object (aliased as
    `$ctx`) for lists of items has the form
    `$context.result.items`. If your GraphQL operation
    returns a single item, it would be `$context.result`.
    AWS AppSync provides helper functions for common operations, such
    as the `$util.toJson` function listed previously, to
    format responses properly. For a full list of functions, see [Resolver mapping template utility reference](resolver-util-reference.md#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-util-reference).

6. Choose **Save Resolver**.

API

1. Create a resolver object by calling the [`CreateResolver`](../../../../reference/appsync/latest/apireference/api-createresolver.md) API.

2. You can modify your resolver's fields by calling the [`UpdateResolver`](../../../../reference/appsync/latest/apireference/api-updateresolver.md) API.

CLI

1. Create a resolver by running the [`create-resolver`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/appsync/create-resolver.html) command.

You'll need to type in 6 parameters for this particular
    command:

1. The `api-id` of your API.

2. The `type-name` of the type that you want to
    modify in your schema. In the console example, this was
    `Query`.

3. The `field-name` of the field that you want to
    modify in your type. In the console example, this was
    `getTodos`.

4. The `data-source-name` of the data source you
    created in the [Attaching a data source](attaching-a-data-source.md) guide.

5. The `request-mapping-template`, which is the
    body of the request. In the console example, this
    was:

```

{
       "version" : "2017-02-28",
       "operation" : "Scan"
}
```

6. The `response-mapping-template`, which is the
    body of the response. In the console example, this
    was:

```

$util.toJson($ctx.result.items)
```

An example command may look like this:

```

aws appsync create-resolver --api-id abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz --type-name Query --field-name getTodos --data-source-name TodoTable --request-mapping-template "{ "version" : "2017-02-28", "operation" : "Scan", }" --response-mapping-template ""$"util.toJson("$"ctx.result.items)"
```

An output will be returned in the CLI. Here's an example:

```

{
    "resolver": {
        "kind": "UNIT",
        "dataSourceName": "TodoTable",
        "requestMappingTemplate": "{ version : 2017-02-28, operation : Scan, }",
        "resolverArn": "arn:aws:appsync:us-west-2:107289374856:apis/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/types/Query/resolvers/getTodos",
        "typeName": "Query",
        "fieldName": "getTodos",
        "responseMappingTemplate": "$util.toJson($ctx.result.items)"
    }
}
```

2. To modify a resolver's fields and/or mapping templates, run the
    [`update-resolver`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/appsync/update-resolver.html) command.

With the exception of the `api-id` parameter, the
    parameters used in the `create-resolver` command will be
    overwritten by the new values from the `update-resolver`
    command.

## Adding a resolver for mutations

The next step is to create a resolver for your `Mutation` type.

Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AppSync console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync).
1. In the **APIs dashboard**,
       choose your GraphQL API.

2. In the **Sidebar**, choose
       **Schema**.
2. Under the **Mutation** type, choose
    **Attach** next to the
    `addTodo` field.

3. On the **Create Resolver** page,
    choose the data source you created in the [Attaching a data source](attaching-a-data-source.md) guide.

4. In the **Configure mapping**
**templates** window, you'll need to modify the request
    template because this is a mutation where you’re adding a new item
    to DynamoDB. Use the following request mapping template:

```

{
       "version" : "2017-02-28",
       "operation" : "PutItem",
       "key" : {
           "id" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.id)
       },
       "attributeValues" : $util.dynamodb.toMapValuesJson($ctx.args)
}
```

5. AWS AppSync automatically converts arguments defined in the
    `addTodo` field from your GraphQL schema into DynamoDB
    operations. The previous example stores records in DynamoDB using a key
    of `id`, which is passed through from the mutation
    argument as `$ctx.args.id`. All of the other fields you
    pass through are automatically mapped to DynamoDB attributes with
    `$util.dynamodb.toMapValuesJson($ctx.args)`.

For this resolver, use the following response mapping
    template:

```sh

$util.toJson($ctx.result)
```

AWS AppSync also supports test and debug workflows for editing
    resolvers. You can use a mock `context` object to see the
    transformed value of the template before invoking. Optionally, you
    can view the full request execution to a data source interactively
    when you run a query. For more information, see [Test and debug\
    resolvers](test-debug-resolvers.md#aws-appsync-test-debug-resolvers) and [Monitoring and logging](monitoring.md#aws-appsync-monitoring).

6. Choose **Save Resolver**.

API

You can also do this with APIs by utilizing the commands in the [Create your first resolver](configuring-resolvers.md#create-your-first-resolver) section and the parameter details
from this section.

CLI

You can also do this in the CLI by utilizing the commands in the [Create your first resolver](configuring-resolvers.md#create-your-first-resolver) section and the parameter details
from this section.

At this point, if you’re not using the advanced resolvers you can begin using your
GraphQL API as outlined in [Using your\
API](using-your-api.md#aws-appsync-using-your-api).

## Advanced resolvers

If you are following the Advanced section and you’re building a sample schema in [Designing your schema](designing-your-schema.md#aws-appsync-designing-your-schema) to do a
paginated scan, use the following request template for the `getTodos` field
instead:

```sh

{
    "version" : "2017-02-28",
    "operation" : "Scan",
    "limit": $util.defaultIfNull(${ctx.args.limit}, 20),
    "nextToken": $util.toJson($util.defaultIfNullOrBlank($ctx.args.nextToken, null))
}
```

For this pagination use case, the response mapping is more than just a passthrough
because it must contain both the _cursor_ (so that the client knows
what page to start at next) and the result set. The mapping template is as
follows:

```sh

{
    "todos": $util.toJson($context.result.items),
    "nextToken": $util.toJson($context.result.nextToken)
}
```

The fields in the preceding response mapping template should match the fields defined
in your `TodoConnection` type.

For the case of relations where you have a `Comments` table and you’re
resolving the comments field on the `Todo` type (which returns a type of
`[Comment]`), you can use a mapping template that runs a query against
the second table. To do this, you must have already created a data source for the
`Comments` table as outlined in [Attaching a data\
source](attaching-a-data-source.md#aws-appsync-getting-started-build-a-schema-from-scratch).

###### Note

We’re using a query operation against a second table for illustrative purposes
only. You could use another operation against DynamoDB instead. In addition, you could
pull the data from another data source, such as AWS Lambda or Amazon OpenSearch Service, because the
relation is controlled by your GraphQL schema.

Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AppSync console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync).
1. In the **APIs dashboard**,
       choose your GraphQL API.

2. In the **Sidebar**, choose
       **Schema**.
2. Under the **Todo** type, choose
    **Attach** next to the
    `comments` field.

3. On the **Create Resolver** page,
    choose your **Comments** table data
    source. The default name for the **Comments** table from the quickstart guides is
    `AppSyncCommentTable`, but it may vary depending on
    what name you gave it.

4. Add the following snippet to your request mapping template:

```sh

{
       "version": "2017-02-28",
       "operation": "Query",
       "index": "todoid-index",
       "query": {
           "expression": "todoid = :todoid",
           "expressionValues": {
               ":todoid": {
                   "S": $util.toJson($context.source.id)
               }
           }
       }
}
```

5. The `context.source` references the parent object of
    the current field that’s being resolved. In this example,
    `source.id` refers to the individual
    `Todo` object, which is then used for the query
    expression.

You can use the passthrough response mapping template as
    follows:

```sh

$util.toJson($ctx.result.items)
```

6. Choose **Save Resolver**.

7. Finally, back on the **Schema** page
    in the console, attach a resolver to the `addComment`
    field, and specify the data source for the `Comments`
    table. The request mapping template in this case is a simple
    `PutItem` with the specific `todoid` that
    is commented on as an argument, but you use the
    `$utils.autoId()` utility to create a unique sort key
    for the comment as follows:

```sh

{
       "version": "2017-02-28",
       "operation": "PutItem",
       "key": {
           "todoid": { "S": $util.toJson($context.arguments.todoid) },
           "commentid": { "S": "$util.autoId()" }
       },
       "attributeValues" : $util.dynamodb.toMapValuesJson($ctx.args)
}
```

Use a passthrough response template as follows:

```sh

$util.toJson($ctx.result)
```

API

You can also do this with APIs by utilizing the commands in the [Create your first resolver](configuring-resolvers.md#create-your-first-resolver) section and the parameter details
from this section.

CLI

You can also do this in the CLI by utilizing the commands in the [Create your first resolver](configuring-resolvers.md#create-your-first-resolver) section and the parameter details
from this section.
