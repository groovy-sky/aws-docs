# Scan

The `Scan` request lets you tell the AWS AppSync DynamoDB function to make a
`Scan` request to DynamoDB, and enables you to specify the following:

- A filter to exclude results

- Which index to use

- How many items to return

- Whether to use consistent reads

- Pagination token

- Parallel scans

The `Scan` request object has the following structure:

```TypeScript

type DynamoDBScanRequest = {
  operation: 'Scan';
  index?: string;
  limit?: number;
  consistentRead?: boolean;
  nextToken?: string;
  totalSegments?: number;
  segment?: number;
  filter?: {
    expression: string;
    expressionNames?: { [key: string]: string };
    expressionValues?: { [key: string]: any };
  };
  projection?: {
    expression: string;
    expressionNames?: { [key: string]: string };
  };
};
```

The fields are defined as follows:

## Scan fields

**`operation`**

The DynamoDB operation to perform. To perform the `Scan`
DynamoDB operation, this must be set to `Scan`. This value is
required.

**`filter`**

A filter that can be used to filter the results from DynamoDB before they
are returned. For more information about filters, see [Filters](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md#js-aws-appsync-resolver-reference-dynamodb-filter). This field is optional.

**`index`**

The name of the index to query. The DynamoDB query operation allows you
to scan on Local Secondary Indexes and Global Secondary Indexes in
addition to the primary key index for a hash key. If specified, this
tells DynamoDB to query the specified index. If omitted, the primary key
index is queried.

**`limit`**

The maximum number of items to evaluate at a single time. This field
is optional.

**`consistentRead`**

A Boolean that indicates whether to use consistent reads when querying
DynamoDB. This field is optional, and defaults to `false`.

**`nextToken`**

The pagination token to continue a previous query. This would have
been obtained from a previous query. This field is optional.

**`select`**

By default, the AWS AppSync DynamoDB function only returns whatever attributes
are projected into the index. If more attributes are required, then this
field can be set. This field is optional. The supported values
are:

**`ALL_ATTRIBUTES`**

Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table
or index. If you query a local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches
the entire item from the parent table for each matching item in
the index. If the index is configured to project all item
attributes, all of the data can be obtained from the local
secondary index and no fetching is required.

**`ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES`**

Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes
that have been projected into the index. If the index is
configured to project all attributes, this return value is
equivalent to specifying `ALL_ATTRIBUTES`.

**`SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`**

Returns only the attributes listed in the
`projection`'s `expression`. This
return value is equivalent to specifying the
`projection`'s `expression` without
specifying any value for `Select`.

**`totalSegments`**

The number of segments to partition the table by when performing a
parallel scan. This field is optional, but must be specified if
`segment` is specified.

**`segment`**

The table segment in this operation when performing a parallel scan.
This field is optional, but must be specified if
`totalSegments` is specified.

**`projection`**

A projection that's used to specify the attributes to return from the
DynamoDB operation. For more information about projections, see [Projections](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md#js-aws-appsync-resolver-reference-dynamodb-projections). This field is optional.

The results returned by the DynamoDB scan are automatically converted into GraphQL and JSON
primitive types and is available in the context result
( `context.result`).

For more information about DynamoDB type conversion, see [Type system (response mapping)](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md#js-aws-appsync-resolver-reference-dynamodb-typed-values-responses).

For more information about JavaScript resolvers, see [JavaScript resolvers\
overview](resolver-reference-overview-js.md).

The results have the following structure:

```TypeScript

{
    items = [ ... ],
    nextToken = "a pagination token",
    scannedCount = 10
}
```

The fields are defined as follows:

**`items`**

A list containing the items returned by the DynamoDB scan.

**`nextToken`**

If there might be more results, `nextToken` contains a pagination
token that you can use in another request. AWS AppSync encrypts and obfuscates the
pagination token returned from DynamoDB. This prevents your table data from being
inadvertently leaked to the caller. Also, these pagination tokens can’t be used
across different functions or resolvers.

**`scannedCount`**

The number of items that were retrieved by DynamoDB before a filter expression (if
present) was applied.

## Example 1

The following example is a function request handler for the GraphQL query:
`allPosts`.

In this example, all entries in the table are returned.

```TypeScript

export function request(ctx) {
  return { operation: 'Scan' };
}
```

## Example 2

The following example is a function request handler for the GraphQL query:
`postsMatching(title: String!)`.

In this example, all entries in the table are returned where the title starts with
the `title` argument.

```TypeScript

export function request(ctx) {
  const { title } = ctx.args;
  const filter = { filter: { beginsWith: title } };
  return {
    operation: 'Scan',
    filter: JSON.parse(util.transform.toDynamoDBFilterExpression(filter)),
  };
}
```
