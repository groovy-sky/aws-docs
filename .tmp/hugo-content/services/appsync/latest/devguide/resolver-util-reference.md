# AWS AppSync resolver mapping template utility reference

###### Note

We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please consider
using the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](resolver-reference-js-version.md).

AWS AppSync defines a set of utilities that you can use within a GraphQL resolver to
simplify interactions with data sources. Some of these utilities are for general use with any
data source, such as generating IDs or timestamps. Others are specific to a type of data
source. The following utilities are available:

- [Utility helpers in $util](utility-helpers-in-util.md) \- The $util variable contains general utility
methods to help you work with data. Unless otherwise specified, all utilities use the
UTF-8 character set.

- [AppSync directives](aws-appsync-directives.md) \- AppSync exposes directives to facilitate developer
productivity when writing in VTL.

- [Time helpers in $util.time](time-helpers-in-util-time.md) \- The $util.time variable contains datetime
methods to help generate timestamps, convert between datetime formats, and parse
datetime strings. The syntax for datetime formats is based on [DateTimeFormatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html), which you can reference for further documentation.

- [List helpers in\
$util.list](list-helpers-in-util-list.md) \- $util.list contains methods to help with common List operations
such as removing or retaining items from a list for filtering use cases.

- [Map helpers in $util.map](utility-helpers-in-map.md) \- $util.map contains methods to help with common
Map operations such as removing or retaining items from a Map for filtering use
cases.

- [DynamoDB\
helpers in $util.dynamodb](dynamodb-helpers-in-util-dynamodb.md) \- $util.dynamodb contains helper methods that make
it easier to write and read data to Amazon DynamoDB, such as automatic type mapping and
formatting.

- [Amazon RDS helpers in $util.rds](rds-helpers-in-util-rds.md) \- $util.rds contains helper methods that
format RDS operations by getting rid of extraneous data in result outputs.

- [HTTP helpers in\
$util.http](http-helpers-in-utils-http.md) \- The $util.http utility provides helper methods that you can use
to manage HTTP request parameters and to add response headers.

- [XML helpers in $util.xml](xml-helpers-in-utils-xml.md) \- $util.xml contains helper methods that can make
it easier to translate XML responses to JSON or a Dictionary.

- [Transformation helpers in $util.transform](transformation-helpers-in-utils-transform.md) \- $util.transform contains helper
methods that make it easier to perform complex operations against data sources, such as
DynamoDB filter operations.

- [Math helpers in $util.math](math-helpers-in-util-math.md) \- $util.math contains methods to help with
common Math operations.

- [String helpers in $util.str](str-helpers-in-util-str.md) \- $util.str contains methods to help with common
String operations.

- [Extensions](extensions.md) \- $extensions contains a set of methods to make additional actions within your
