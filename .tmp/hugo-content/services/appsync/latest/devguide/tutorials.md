# VTL resolver tutorials for AWS AppSync

###### Note

We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please consider
using the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](tutorials-js.md).

Data sources and resolvers are used by AWS AppSync to translate GraphQL requests and
fetch information from your AWS resources. AWS AppSync supports automatic provisioning and
connections with certain data source types. AWS AppSync also supports AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB,
relational databases (Amazon Aurora Serverless), Amazon OpenSearch Service, and HTTP endpoints as data sources. You
can use a GraphQL API with your existing AWS resources or build data sources and resolvers
from scratch. The following sections are meant to elucidate some of the more common GraphQL
use cases in the form of tutorials.

AWS AppSync uses _mapping templates_ written in Apache Velocity
Template Language (VTL) for resolvers. For more information about using mapping templates, see
the [Resolver mapping template\
reference](resolver-mapping-template-reference.md#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference). More information about working with VTL is available in the [Resolver\
mapping template programming guide](resolver-mapping-template-reference-programming-guide.md#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-programming-guide).

AWS AppSync supports the automatic provisioning of DynamoDB tables from a GraphQL schema as
described in Provision from schema (optional) and Launch a sample schema. You can also import
from an existing DynamoDB table which will create schema and connect resolvers. This is outlined
in Import from Amazon DynamoDB (optional).
