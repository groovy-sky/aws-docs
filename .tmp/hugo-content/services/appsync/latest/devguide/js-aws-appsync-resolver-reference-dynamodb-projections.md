# Projections

When reading objects in DynamoDB using the `GetItem`, `Scan`,
`Query`, `BatchGetItem`, and `TransactGetItems`
operations, you can optionally specify a projection that identifies the attributes that you
want. The projection property has the following structure, which is similar to filters:

```

type DynamoDBExpression = {
  expression: string;
  expressionNames?: { [key: string]: string}
};
```

The fields are defined as follows:

**`expression`**

The projection expression, which is a string. To retrieve a single attribute,
specify its name. For multiple attributes, the names must be comma-separated
values. For more information on writing projection expressions, see the [DynamoDB projection expressions](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/expressions-projectionexpressions.md) documentation. This field is required.

**`expressionNames`**

The substitutions for expression attribute _name_ placeholders in the form of key-value pairs. The key
corresponds to a name placeholder used in the `expression`. The value
must be a string that corresponds to the attribute name of the item in DynamoDB. This
field is optional and should only be populated with substitutions for expression
attribute name placeholders used in the `expression`. For more
information about `expressionNames`, see the [DynamoDB documentation](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/expressions-expressionattributenames.md).

## Example 1

The following example is a projection section for a JavaScript function in which only
the attributes `author` and `id` are returned from DynamoDB:

```TypeScript

projection : {
    expression : "#author, id",
    expressionNames : {
        "#author" : "author"
    }
}
```

###### Tip

You can access your GraphQL request selection set using [selectionSetList](resolver-context-reference-js.md#aws-appsync-resolver-context-reference-info-js). This field allows you to frame your projection
expression dynamically according to your requirements.

###### Note

While using projection expressions with the `Query` and
`Scan` operations, the value for `select` must be
`SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. For more information, see the [DynamoDB documentation](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-query.md#DDB-Query-request-Select).
