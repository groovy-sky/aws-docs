# Using an AWS AppSync API with the AWS CDK

###### Tip

Before you use the CDK, we recommend reviewing the CDK's [official documentation](../../../cdk/v2/guide/getting-started.md) along
with AWS AppSync's [CDK reference](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-readme.md).

We also recommend ensuring that your [AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md)
and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) installations are working on your system.

In this section, we're going to create a simple CDK application that can add and fetch
items from a DynamoDB table. This is meant to be a quickstart example using some of the code
from the [Designing your schema](designing-your-schema.md),
[Attaching a data source](attaching-a-data-source.md), and [Configuring resolvers\
(JavaScript)](configuring-resolvers-js.md) sections.

## Setting up a CDK project

###### Warning

These steps may not be completely accurate depending on your environment. We're assuming your system
has the necessary utilities installed, a way to interface with AWS services, and proper configurations
in place.

The first step is installing the AWS CDK. In your CLI, you can enter the following command:

```TypeScript

npm install -g aws-cdk
```

Next, you need to create a project directory, then navigate to it. An example set of commands to create
and navigate to a directory is:

```TypeScript

mkdir example-cdk-app
cd example-cdk-app
```

Next, you need to create an app. Our service primarily uses TypeScript. In your project directory, enter
the following command:

```TypeScript

cdk init app --language typescript
```

When you do this, a CDK app along with its initialization files will be installed:

![Terminal output showing Git repository initialization and npm install completion.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-init-app-example.png)

Your project structure may look like this:

![Project directory structure showing folders and files for an example CDK app.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-init-directories.png)

You'll notice we have several important directories:

- `bin`: The initial bin file will create the app. We won't touch this in this
guide.

- `lib`: The lib directory contains your stack files. You can think of stack files as
individual units of execution. Constructs will be inside our stack files. Basically, these are
resources for a service that will be spun up in CloudFormation when the app is deployed. This is where most
of our coding will happen.

- `node_modules`: This directory is created by NPM and contains all package dependencies
you installed using the `npm` command.

Our initial stack file may contain something like this:

```TypeScript

import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
// import * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';

export class ExampleCdkAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // The code that defines your stack goes here

    // example resource
    // const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'ExampleCdkAppQueue', {
    //   visibilityTimeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(300)
    // });
  }
}
```

This is the boilerplate code to create a stack in our app. Most of our code in this example will go inside
the scope of this class.

To verify that your stack file is in the app, in your app's directory, run the following command in the
terminal:

```TypeScript

cdk ls
```

A list of your stacks should appear. If it doesn't, then you may need to run through the steps again or
check the official documentation for help.

If you want to build your code changes before deploying, you can always run the following command in the
terminal:

```TypeScript

npm run build
```

And, to see the changes before deploying:

```TypeScript

cdk diff
```

Before we add our code to the stack file, we're going to perform a bootstrap. Bootstrapping allows us to
provision resources for the CDK before the app deploys. More information about this process can be found
[here](../../../cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.md). To create a
bootstrap, the command is:

```TypeScript

cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION
```

###### Tip

This step requires several IAM permissions in your account. Your bootstrap will be denied if you
don't have them. If this happens, you may have to delete incomplete resources caused by the bootstrap
such as the S3 bucket it generates.

Bootstrap will spin up several resources. The final message will look like this:

![Terminal output showing successful bootstrapping of an AWS environment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-init-bootstrap-final.png)

This is done once per account per Region, so you won't have to do this often. The main resources of the
bootstrap are the CloudFormation stack and the Amazon S3 bucket.

The Amazon S3 bucket is used to store files and IAM roles that grant permissions needed to perform
deployments. The required resources are defined in an CloudFormation stack, called the bootstrap stack, which is
usually named `CDKToolkit`. Like any CloudFormation stack, it appears in the CloudFormation console once it has
been deployed:

![CDKToolkit stack with CREATE_COMPLETE status in CloudFormation console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-init-bootstrap-cfn-console.png)

The same can be said for the bucket:

![S3 bucket details showing name, region, access settings, and creation date.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-init-bootstrap-bucket-console.png)

To import the services we need in our stack file, we can use the following command:

```TypeScript

npm install aws-cdk-lib # V2 command
```

###### Tip

If you're having trouble with V2, you could install the individual libraries using V1 commands:

```TypeScript

npm install @aws-cdk/aws-appsync @aws-cdk/aws-dynamodb
```

We don't recommend this because V1 has been deprecated.

## Implementing a CDK project - Schema

We can now start implementing our code. First, we must create our schema. You can simply create a
`.graphql` file in your app:

```TypeScript

mkdir schema
touch schema.graphql
```

In our example, we included a top-level directory called `schema` containing our
`schema.graphql`:

![File structure showing a schema folder containing schema.graphql file.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-schema-directory.png)

Inside our schema, let's include a simple example:

```SDL

input CreatePostInput {
    title: String
    content: String
}

type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String
    content: String
}

type Mutation {
    createPost(input: CreatePostInput!): Post
}

type Query {
    getPost: [Post]
}
```

Back in our stack file, we need to make sure the following import directives are defined:

```TypeScript

import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as appsync from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-appsync';
import * as dynamodb from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
```

Inside the class, we'll add code to make our GraphQL API and connect it to our `schema.graphql`
file:

```TypeScript

export class ExampleCdkAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // makes a GraphQL API
    const api = new appsync.GraphqlApi(this, 'post-apis', {
      name: 'api-to-process-posts',
      schema: appsync.SchemaFile.fromAsset('schema/schema.graphql'),
    });
  }
}
```

We'll also add some code to print out the GraphQL URL, API key, and Region:

```TypeScript

export class ExampleCdkAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Makes a GraphQL API construct
    const api = new appsync.GraphqlApi(this, 'post-apis', {
      name: 'api-to-process-posts',
      schema: appsync.SchemaFile.fromAsset('schema/schema.graphql'),
    });

    // Prints out URL
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "GraphQLAPIURL", {
      value: api.graphqlUrl
    });

    // Prints out the AppSync GraphQL API key to the terminal
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "GraphQLAPIKey", {
      value: api.apiKey || ''
    });

    // Prints out the stack region to the terminal
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "Stack Region", {
      value: this.region
    });
  }
}
```

At this point, we'll use deploy our app again:

```TypeScript

cdk deploy
```

This is the result:

![Deployment output showing ExampleCdkAppStack details, including GraphQL API URL and stack region.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-schema.png)

It appears our example was successful, but let's check the AWS AppSync console just to confirm:

![GraphQL interface showing successful API request with response data displayed.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-schema-result-1.png)

It appears our API was created. Now, we'll check the schema attached to the API:

![GraphQL schema defining CreatePostInput, Post type, Mutation, and Query operations.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-schema-result-2.png)

This appears to match up with our schema code, so it was successful. Another way to confirm this from a
metadata viewpoint is to look at the CloudFormation stack:

![CloudFormation stack showing ExampleCdkAppStack update complete and CDKToolkit creation complete.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-schema-result-3.png)

When we deploy our CDK app, it goes through CloudFormation to spin up resources like the bootstrap. Each stack
within our app maps 1:1 with an CloudFormation stack. If you go back to the stack code, the stack name was grabbed
from the class name `ExampleCdkAppStack`. You can see the resources it created, which also match
our naming conventions in our GraphQL API construct:

![Expanded view of post-apis resource showing Schema, DefaultApiKey, and CDKMetadata.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-schema-result-4.png)

## Implementing a CDK project - Data source

Next, we need to add our data source. Our example will use a DynamoDB table. Inside the stack class, we'll
add some code to create a new table:

```TypeScript

export class ExampleCdkAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Makes a GraphQL API construct
    const api = new appsync.GraphqlApi(this, 'post-apis', {
      name: 'api-to-process-posts',
      schema: appsync.SchemaFile.fromAsset('schema/schema.graphql'),
    });

    //creates a DDB table
    const add_ddb_table = new dynamodb.Table(this, 'posts-table', {
      partitionKey: {
        name: 'id',
        type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING,
      },
    });

    // Prints out URL
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "GraphQLAPIURL", {
      value: api.graphqlUrl
    });

    // Prints out the AppSync GraphQL API key to the terminal
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "GraphQLAPIKey", {
      value: api.apiKey || ''
    });

    // Prints out the stack region to the terminal
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "Stack Region", {
      value: this.region
    });
  }
}
```

At this point, let's deploy again:

```TypeScript

cdk deploy
```

We should check the DynamoDB console for our new table:

![DynamoDB console showing ExampleCdkAppStack-poststable as Active with Provisioned capacity.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-ddb-result-1.png)

Our stack name is correct, and the table name matches our code. If we check our CloudFormation stack again, we'll
now see the new table:

![Expanded view of a logical ID in CloudFormation showing post-apis, posts-table, and CDKMetadata.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-ddb-result-2.png)

## Implementing a CDK project - Resolver

This example will use two resolvers: one to query the table and one to add to it. Since we're using
pipeline resolvers, we'll need to declare two pipeline resolvers with one function in each. In the query,
we'll add the following code:

```TypeScript

export class ExampleCdkAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Makes a GraphQL API construct
    const api = new appsync.GraphqlApi(this, 'post-apis', {
      name: 'api-to-process-posts',
      schema: appsync.SchemaFile.fromAsset('schema/schema.graphql'),
    });

    //creates a DDB table
    const add_ddb_table = new dynamodb.Table(this, 'posts-table', {
      partitionKey: {
        name: 'id',
        type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING,
      },
    });

    // Creates a function for query
    const add_func = new appsync.AppsyncFunction(this, 'func-get-post', {
      name: 'get_posts_func_1',
      api,
      dataSource: api.addDynamoDbDataSource('table-for-posts', add_ddb_table),
      code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
          export function request(ctx) {
          return { operation: 'Scan' };
          }

          export function response(ctx) {
          return ctx.result.items;
          }
  `),
      runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
    });

    // Creates a function for mutation
    const add_func_2 = new appsync.AppsyncFunction(this, 'func-add-post', {
      name: 'add_posts_func_1',
      api,
      dataSource: api.addDynamoDbDataSource('table-for-posts-2', add_ddb_table),
      code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
          export function request(ctx) {
            return {
            operation: 'PutItem',
            key: util.dynamodb.toMapValues({id: util.autoId()}),
            attributeValues: util.dynamodb.toMapValues(ctx.args.input),
            };
          }

          export function response(ctx) {
            return ctx.result;
          }
      `),
      runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
    });

    // Adds a pipeline resolver with the get function
    new appsync.Resolver(this, 'pipeline-resolver-get-posts', {
      api,
      typeName: 'Query',
      fieldName: 'getPost',
      code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
          export function request(ctx) {
          return {};
          }

          export function response(ctx) {
          return ctx.prev.result;
          }
  `),
      runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
      pipelineConfig: [add_func],
    });

    // Adds a pipeline resolver with the create function
    new appsync.Resolver(this, 'pipeline-resolver-create-posts', {
      api,
      typeName: 'Mutation',
      fieldName: 'createPost',
      code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
          export function request(ctx) {
          return {};
          }

          export function response(ctx) {
          return ctx.prev.result;
          }
  `),
      runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
      pipelineConfig: [add_func_2],
    });

    // Prints out URL
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "GraphQLAPIURL", {
      value: api.graphqlUrl
    });

    // Prints out the AppSync GraphQL API key to the terminal
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "GraphQLAPIKey", {
      value: api.apiKey || ''
    });

    // Prints out the stack region to the terminal
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "Stack Region", {
      value: this.region
    });
  }
}
```

In this snippet, we added a pipeline resolver called `pipeline-resolver-create-posts` with a
function called `func-add-post` attached to it. This is the code that will add `Posts`
to the table. The other pipeline resolver was called `pipeline-resolver-get-posts` with a
function called `func-get-post` that retrieves `Posts` added to the table.

We'll deploy this to add it to the AWS AppSync service:

```TypeScript

cdk deploy
```

Let's check the AWS AppSync console to see if they were attached to our GraphQL API:

![GraphQL API schema showing mutation and query fields with Pipeline resolvers.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-resolver-result-1.png)

It appears to be correct. In the code, both of these resolvers were attached to the GraphQL API we made
(denoted by the `api` props value present in both the resolvers and functions). In the GraphQL
API, the fields we attached our resolvers to were also specified in the props (defined by the
`typename` and `fieldname` props in each resolver).

Let's see if the content of the resolvers is correct starting with the
`pipeline-resolver-get-posts`:

![Code snippet showing request and response functions in a resolver, with an arrow pointing to them.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-resolver-result-2.png)

The before and after handlers match our `code` props value. We can also see that a function
called `add_posts_func_1`, which matches the name of the function we attached in the
resolver.

Let's look at the code content of that function:

![Function code showing request and response methods for a PutItem operation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-resolver-result-3.png)

This matches up with the `code` props of the `add_posts_func_1` function. Our query
was successfully uploaded, so let's check on the query:

![Resolver code with request and response functions, and a get_posts_func_1 function listed below.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-resolver-result-4.png)

These also match the code. If we look at `get_posts_func_1`:

![Code snippet showing two exported functions: request returning 'Scan' operation and response returning items.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-resolver-result-5.png)

Everything appears to be in place. To confirm this from a metadata perspective, we can check our stack in CloudFormation
again:

![List of logical IDs for AWS resources including API, table, functions, and pipelines.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-deploy-resolver-result-6.png)

Now, we need to test this code by performing some requests.

## Implementing a CDK project - Requests

To test our app in the AWS AppSync console, we made one query and one mutation:

![GraphQL code snippet showing a query to get post details and a mutation to create a post.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-request-1.png)

`MyMutation` contains a `createPost` operation with the arguments
`1970-01-01T12:30:00.000Z` and `first post`. It returns the `date` and
`title` that we passed in as well as the automatically generated `id` value.
Running the mutation yields the result:

```TypeScript

{
  "data": {
    "createPost": {
      "date": "1970-01-01T12:30:00.000Z",
      "id": "4dc1c2dd-0aa3-4055-9eca-7c140062ada2",
      "title": "first post"
    }
  }
}
```

If we check the DynamoDB table quickly, we can see our entry in the table when we scan it:

![DynamoDB table entry showing id, date, and title fields for a single item.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cdk-code-request-2.png)

Back in the AWS AppSync console, if we run the query to retrieve this `Post`, we get the following
result:

```TypeScript

{
  "data": {
    "getPost": [
      {
        "id": "9f62c4dd-49d5-48d5-b835-143284c72fe0",
        "date": "1970-01-01T12:30:00.000Z",
        "title": "first post"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
