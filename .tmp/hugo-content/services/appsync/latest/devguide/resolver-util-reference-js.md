# AWS AppSync JavaScript runtime features for resolvers and functions

The `APPSYNC_JS` runtime environment provides functionality similar to [ECMAScript (ES) version 6.0](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0). It
supports a subset of its features and provides some additional methods (utilities) that are
not part of the ES specifications. The following topics list all the supported language
features:

- [Supported runtime features](supported-features.md) \- Learn more about supported core features,
primitive objects, built-in objects and functions, etc.

- [Built-in utilities](built-in-util-js.md) \- The util variable contains general utility methods to
help you work with data. Unless otherwise specified, all utilities use the UTF-8
character set.

- [Built-in modules](built-in-modules-js.md) \- Learn more about how built-in modules can help write
JavaScript resolvers and functions.

- [Runtime\
utilities](runtime-utils-js.md) \- The runtime library provides utilities to control or modify the
runtime properties of your resolvers and functions.

- [Time helpers in\
util.time](time-helpers-in-util-time-js.md) \- The util.time variable contains datetime methods to help
generate timestamps, convert between datetime formats, and parse datetime strings. The
syntax for datetime formats is based on [DateTimeFormatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html), which you can reference for further documentation.

- [DynamoDB\
helpers in util.dynamodb](dynamodb-helpers-in-util-dynamodb-js.md) \- util.dynamodb contains helper methods that make
it easier to write and read data to Amazon DynamoDB, such as automatic type mapping and
formatting.

- [HTTP helpers in\
util.http](http-helpers-in-utils-http-js.md) \- The util.http utility provides helper methods that you can use
to manage HTTP request parameters and to add response headers.

- [Transformation helpers in util.transform](transformation-helpers-in-utils-transform-js.md) \- util.transform contains helper
methods that make it easier to perform complex operations against data sources.

- [String helpers in\
util.str](str-helpers-in-util-str-js.md) \- util.str contains methods to help with common String
operations.

- [Extensions](extensions-js.md) \- extensions contains a set of methods to make additional actions within your
resolvers.

- [XML helpers in\
util.xml](xml-helpers-in-util-xml-js.md) \- util.xml contains methods to help with XML string
conversion.
