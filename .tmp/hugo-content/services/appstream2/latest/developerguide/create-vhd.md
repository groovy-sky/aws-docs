# Create the VHD

A VHD is a single file that when mounted to the operating system is treated like a
hard disk. The VHD can be mounted as a drive letter, to a folder path, or both. When
the VHD is mounted, you can treat it as you would any other hard disk, including
installing your application or copying files to it that your user will need.

To create the app block, you will need to create the VHD, install your
applications to it, then detach it. Once detached you can test your VHD on another
PC, an EC2 instance, or an WorkSpaces Applications image builder to validate the applications
work as expected. Once completed, upload to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account and
create the app block.

###### Note

This page describes using a VHD to deliver your application; however, the
WorkSpaces Applications streaming instance will download any object from Amazon S3. The object you
store in Amazon S3 can also be a zip file, application installer, or the application
executable itself. You can use the setup script to configure it correctly on the
streaming instance before a user launches their application.

The WorkSpaces Applications streaming instance waits up to 120 seconds for the VHD to complete
downloading before the setup script runs. If the VHD does not complete
downloading within this duration, the download stops, and the setup script
will not run.

We recommend a maximum size of 1.5 gigabyte for the VHD. You might be able to
reduce the size of the VHD by compressing. You must use the setup script to
decompress it before mounting it, because the file needs to be fully downloaded
from Amazon S3 before it can be mounted and the application is launched. Larger VHDs
increase the time it takes for the application to launch and the streaming
session to begin.

###### To create a VHD for Microsoft Windows

01. From a Windows PC or Windows Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, open a command
     prompt with administrative privileges.

02. Launch the Microsoft **diskpart** utility by entering the
     following command:

    **diskpart**

03. Create the unformatted and uninitialized VHD file by entering the
     following command, where `<maximum file size>`
     is the size of the VHD file, in MB:

    **create vdisk file=C:\\path\\to\\new\\file.vhdx**
    **maximum= `<maximum file size>`**
    **type=expandable**

04. Select the newly created VHD by entering the following command:

    **select vdisk file=C:\\path\\to\\new\\file.vhdx**

05. Attach the newly created VHD by entering the following command:

    **attach vdisk**

06. Initialize the newly created VHD by entering the following command:

    **convert mbr**

07. Create the primary partition spanning the entire VHD by entering the
     following command:

    **create partition primary**

08. Format the newly created partition by entering the following
     command:

    **format fs=ntfs quick**

09. You can mount your newly created VHD to an unused drive letter, a folder
     path on the root volume, or both.

    To mount a drive letter, enter: **assign**
    **letter= `<unused drive**
    **letter>`**

    To mount a folder, enter: **assign**
    **mount= `C:\path\to\empty\folder\to\mount\`**

    ###### Note

    To mount to a folder path, the folder must already exist and must be
    empty.

10. You can now install your application to the VHD, using either the drive
     letter or the folder mount path chosen in step 9.

After you finish installing your application(s) to the VHD, you need to detach it
before you can safely upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket.

###### To detach a VHD for Microsoft Windows

1. Launch the Microsoft diskpart utility by entering the following
    command:

**diskpart**

2. Select the VHD by entering the following command:

**select vdisk**
**file= `C:\path\to\new\file.vhdx`**

3. Detach the VHD by entering the following command:

**detach vdisk**

4. The VHD has now been detached, and can be tested on another Windows PC,
    Amazon EC2 instance, or an WorkSpaces Applications image builder.

###### To create a VHD for Linux

1. Open a terminal:

- For Amazon Linux 2: Use EC2 instance, WorkSpaces Applications image builder, or WorkSpaces powered by Amazon Linux 2

- For Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS: Use EC2 instance, or WorkSpaces powered by Ubuntu Pro

2. Create the unformatted and uninitialized VHD file:

**dd if=/dev/zero of= `<name of file>`**
**bs= `<size of VHD>`**
**count=1**

3. Add a file system to the created VHD by entering the following
    command:

**sudo mkfs -t ext4 `<name of**
**file>`**

###### Note

You might see a message stating that the file is not a block special
device. You can select to proceed anyway.

4. Create an empty folder to use for the mount point by entering the
    following command:

**sudo mkdir**
**`/path/to/mount/point`**

5. Mount the newly created VHD to a file system path by running the following
    command:

**sudo mount -t auto -o loop `<name of**
**file>` `/path/to/mount/point`**

6. You can now install your application to the VHD using the folder mount
    path chosen in step 4.

###### Note

The default permissions for files and folders created on the VHD can
prevent non-administrator users from launching applications or reading
files. Validate the permissions and change them, if necessary.

After you finish installing your application(s) to the VHD, you need to detach it
before you can safely upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket.

###### To detach a VHD for Linux

1. Open a terminal session, and enter the following command:

**sudo umount**
**`/path/to/mount/point`**

2. The VHD has now been detached, and can be tested on another Amazon Linux 2/Ubuntu Pro 24.04 LTS Amazon EC2 instance, Amazon Linux 2 WorkSpaces Applications image builder, or Amazon Linux 2/Ubuntu WorkSpaces Personal.
