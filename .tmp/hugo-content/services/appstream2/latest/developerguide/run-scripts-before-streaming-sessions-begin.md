# Run Scripts Before Streaming Sessions Begin

You can configure your scripts to run for a maximum of 60 seconds before your
users' applications launch and their streaming sessions begin. Doing so enables you
to customize the WorkSpaces Applications environment before users start streaming their applications.
When the session scripts run, a loading spinner displays for your users. When your
scripts complete successfully or the maximum waiting time elapses, your users'
streaming session will begin. If your scripts don't complete successfully, an error
message displays for your users. However, your users are not prevented from using
their streaming session.

When you specify a file name on a Windows instance, you must use a double
backslash. For example:

C:\\\Scripts\\\Myscript.bat

If you don't use a double backslash, an error displays to notify you that the
.json file is incorrectly formatted.

###### Note

When your scripts complete successfully, they must return a value of 0. If
your scripts return a value other than 0, WorkSpaces Applications displays the error message to
the user.

When you run scripts before streaming sessions begin and the WorkSpaces Applications dynamic
application framework is not enabled, the following process occurs:

1. Your users connect to an WorkSpaces Applications fleet instance that is not domain-joined.
    They connect by using one of the following access methods:

- WorkSpaces Applications user pool

- SAML 2.0

- WorkSpaces Applications API

2. The application catalog displays in the WorkSpaces Applications portal, and your users
    choose an application to launch.

3. One of the following occurs:

- If application settings persistence is enabled for your users, the
application settings Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file that stores your
users' customizations and Windows settings is downloaded and
mounted. Windows user login is required in this case.

For information about application settings persistence, see [Enable Application Settings Persistence for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users](app-settings-persistence.md).

- If application settings persistence is not enabled, the Windows
user is already logged in.

4. Your session scripts start. If persistent storage is enabled for your
    users, storage connector mounting also starts. For information about
    persistent storage, see [Enable and Administer Persistent Storage for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users](persistent-storage.md).

###### Note

The storage connector mount doesn't need to complete for the streaming
session to start. If the session scripts complete before the storage
connector mount completes, the streaming session starts.

For information about monitoring the mount status of storage
connectors, see [Use Storage Connectors with Session Scripts](use-storage-connectors-with-session-scripts.md).

5. Your session scripts complete or time out.

6. The users' streaming session starts.

7. The application that your users chose launches.

For information about the WorkSpaces Applications dynamic application framework, see [Use the WorkSpaces Applications Dynamic Application Framework to Build a Dynamic App Provider](build-dynamic-app-provider.md).

When you run scripts before streaming sessions begin and the WorkSpaces Applications dynamic
application framework is enabled, the following process occurs:

![WorkSpaces Applications workflow from user login to application launch, including SAML authentication and session scripts.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appstream2/latest/developerguide/images/session-scripts-with-DAF-domain-joined2.png)

1. Your users visit the SAML 2.0 application portal for your organization,
    and they choose the WorkSpaces Applications stack.

2. They connect to an WorkSpaces Applications fleet instance that is domain-joined.

3. If application settings persistence is enabled for your users, the
    application settings VHD file that stores your users' customizations and
    Windows settings is downloaded and mounted.

4. Windows user logon occurs.

5. The application catalog displays in the WorkSpaces Applications portal and your users
    choose an application to launch.

6. Your session scripts start. If persistent storage is enabled for your
    users, storage connector mounting also starts.

###### Note

The storage connector mount doesn't need to complete for the streaming
session to start. If the session scripts complete before the storage
connector mount completes, the streaming session starts.

For information about monitoring the mount status of storage
connectors, see [Use Storage Connectors with Session Scripts](use-storage-connectors-with-session-scripts.md).

7. Your session scripts complete or time out.

8. The users' streaming session starts.

9. The application that your users chose launches.
