# WorkSpaces Applications Instance Families

Amazon WorkSpaces Applications users stream applications from stacks that you create. Each stack
is associated with a fleet. When you create a fleet, the instance type that you specify
determines the hardware of the host computers used for your fleet. Each instance type offers
different compute, memory, and GPU capabilities. Instance types are grouped into _instance_
_families_ based on these capabilities. For hardware specifications and pricing information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/pricing).

When you create a fleet or image builder, you must select an image that is compatible with
the instance family on which you intend to run your fleet.

- When launching a new image builder, you are presented with a list of the images in
your image registry. Select the appropriate base image.

- When launching a fleet, ensure that the private image you select was created
from the appropriate base image.

The following table summarizes the available instance families and provides the base image
naming format for each. Select an instance type from an instance family based on the
requirements of the applications that you plan to stream on your fleet, and match the base
image according to the following table.

###### Note

If your use case involves real-time audio-video (AV) or other scenarios that require high frame rates and your display performance isn't as expected, consider scaling up to a larger instance size.

Graphics Pro are no longer available after 10/31/2025 due to End of Life of hardware
supporting Graphics Pro instance types.

Graphics Design instances will no longer be available from AWS after 12/31/2025 due
to End of Life of hardware supporting Graphics Design instance types.

WorkSpaces Applications instances have one 200 GB fixed-size volume, which is used for the C drive. Because WorkSpaces Applications is non-persistent, each instance's
volume is immediately deleted after each user session.
