# Example: WorkSpaces Applications Application Amazon S3 bucket policy cross-service confused deputy prevention

When you store data in an Amazon S3 bucket, the bucket might be exposed to confused deputy
issues. This can leave data such as Elastic fleets, app blocks, setup scripts,
application icons, and session scripts vulnerable to malicious actors.

To prevent confused deputy issues, you can specify the `aws:SourceAccount`
condition or the `aws:SourceArn` condition in the Amazon S3 bucket policy for
`ELASTIC-FLEET-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`.

The resource policies below show how to prevent the confused deputy problem with
either of the following:

- The `aws:SourceAccount` with your AWS account ID

- The global condition context key `aws:SourceArn`

WorkSpaces Applications currently doesn't support confused deputy prevention for application icons. The
service only supports VHD files and setup scripts. If you try to add additional
conditions for application icons, the icons won't be displayed to end users.

In the following example, the bucket policy only allows WorkSpaces Applications Elastic fleet resources
in the owner's account to access `ELASTIC_FLEET_EXAMPLE_BUCKET`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ConfusedDeputyPreventionExamplePolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "appstream.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::ELASTIC-FLEET-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/vhd-folder/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ELASTIC-FLEET-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/scripts/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "your AWS account ID"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowRetrievalPermissionsToS3AppIconsForAppStream",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "appstream.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::ELASTIC-FLEET-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/app-icons/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

You can also use the `aws:SourceArn` condition to limit resource access for
specific resources.

###### Note

If you don’t know the full ARN of a resource, or you want to specify multiple
resources, use the `aws:SourceArn` global context condition key with
wildcards ( **\***) for the unknown portions of the ARN.

            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::ELASTIC-FLEET-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/vhd-folder/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ELASTIC-FLEET-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/scripts/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:appstream:us-east-1:111122223333:app-block/*"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowRetrievalPermissionsToS3AppIconsForAppStream",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "appstream.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::ELASTIC-FLEET-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/app-icons/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

You can use the `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount`
conditions to limit the resource access for specific resources and accounts.

###### Note

If you don’t know the full ARN of a resources, or if you want to specify multiple
resources, use the `aws:SourceArn` global context condition key with
wildcards ( **\***) for the unknown portions of the ARN.
