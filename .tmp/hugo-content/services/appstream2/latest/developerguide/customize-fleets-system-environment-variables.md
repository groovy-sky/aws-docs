# Change System Environment Variables

Follow these steps to change system environment variables across your fleet
instances.

###### To change system environment variables on an image builder

This procedure applies only to system environment variables, not user
environment variables. To change user environment variables that persist across
your fleet instances, perform the steps in the next procedure.

1. Connect to the image builder on which to change system environment
    variables and sign in with an account that has local administrator
    permissions. To do so, do either of the following:

- [Use the\
WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)

- [Create a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-url.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client
connections)

###### Note

If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to
an Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart
card sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications
client for the connection. For information about smart card sign
in, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-usb-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

2. Choose the Windows **Start** button, open the context
    (right-click) menu for **Computer**, and then choose
    **Properties**.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Advanced system**
**settings**.

4. In **System variables**, change the environment variables
    that you want to persist across your fleet instances, and then
    choose **OK**.

5. On the image builder desktop, open Image Assistant.

6. Follow the necessary steps in Image Assistant to finish creating your
    image. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

The changes to the system environment variables persist across your fleet
    instances and are available to streaming sessions launched from those
    instances.

###### Note

Setting AWS CLI credentials as system environment variables might
prevent WorkSpaces Applications from creating the image.
