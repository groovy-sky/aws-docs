# Manage Multi-Session Fleet Instances

When running multi-session fleets on Amazon WorkSpaces Applications, multiple user sessions share a fleet
instance. Unlike single-session fleets — where each instance serves one user and is
automatically recycled after the session is terminated — multi-session instances can
remain active for extended periods as long as users continue to occupy sessions on
them.

This creates an important operational consideration: a multi-session instance cannot be
terminated while active user sessions are running. If an instance is never fully vacated,
it may never be reclaimed or rebooted, which means:

- **Image updates may not propagate** — new image
versions containing patches, software updates, or security fixes will not reach
an instance until all sessions on it have ended and the instance is
recycled.

- **Fleet hygiene is harder to maintain** — without
a mechanism to gracefully cycle instances, administrators must manually restart
fleets or terminate all active sessions to apply updates, which can be disruptive
to end users.

- **Long-running instances may experience performance**
**degradation** — instances that remain active for extended periods
without a restart can accumulate resource contention, memory pressure, and other
system-level issues over time, leading to a degraded experience for end users
sharing that instance.

To address this, WorkSpaces Applications provides a method to manage the lifecycle of individual fleet
instances through a process called draining (also referred to as Drain Mode).

Putting an instance in Drain Mode impacts the capacity of the fleet. The fleet
capacity metrics are available at [Viewing Fleet Usage Using the Console](monitoring-console.md).
