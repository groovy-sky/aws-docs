# Locking the Streaming Session When the User is Idle

WorkSpaces Applications relies on a setting that you configure in the GPMC to lock the streaming
session after your user is idle for specified amount of time. To use the GPMC,
you'll need to do the following first:

- Obtain access to a computer or an EC2 instance that is joined to your
domain.

- Install the GPMC. For more information,
see [Installing or Removing Remote Server Administration Tools for\
Windows 7](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee449483.aspx) in the Microsoft documentation.

- Log in as a domain user with permissions to create GPOs. Link GPOs to the
appropriate OUs.

###### To automatically lock the streaming instance when your user is idle

01. In your directory or on a domain controller, open the command prompt as an
     administrator, type `gpmc.msc`, and then press ENTER.

02. In the left console tree, select the OU where you will create a new GPO or use an existing
     GPO, and then do either of the following:

- Create a new GPO by opening the context (right-click) menu and choosing **Create a GPO in this domain, Link it here**. For **Name**, provide a descriptive name for this
GPO.

- Select an existing GPO.

03. Open the context menu for the GPO, and choose **Edit**.

04. Under **User Configuration**, expand **Policies**,
     **Administrative Templates**, **Control**
    **Panel**, and then choose **Personalization**.

05. Double-click **Enable screen saver**.

06. In the **Enable screen saver** policy setting,
     choose **Enabled**.

07. Choose **Apply**, and then choose **OK**.

09. In the **Force specific screen saver** policy setting,
     choose **Enabled**.

     `scrnsave.scr`. When this setting is enabled, the system displays a black screen saver
     on the user's desktop.

11. Choose **Apply**, and then choose **OK**.

12. Double-click **Password protect the screen saver**.

19. In the console tree, under **User Configuration**, expand **Policies**,
     **Administrative Templates**, **System**, and then choose **Ctrl+Alt+Del Options**.
