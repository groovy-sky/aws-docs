# Qualify USB Devices for Use with Streaming Applications

There are two methods for specifying which USB devices your users can redirect
into their WorkSpaces Applications streaming instances:

###### Note

USB redirection is currently only supported on Windows WorkSpaces Applications streaming
instances. It is not supported on the macOS client.

- You can create the USB device filter strings within the configuration file
saved on an image. This method can only be used with Always-On and On-Demand
fleets.

- You can specify USB device filter strings when you create the fleet,
either with the AWS Management Console or with the
`CreateFleet` API. For detailed information about these
strings, see the section below. This method can only be used with Elastic
fleets.

You can create a file on your WorkSpaces Applications image that specifies which USB devices a user
can make available for their streaming applications. To qualify your users' USB
devices so that the devices can be used with streaming applications, perform these
steps.

###### Note

For security reasons, only qualify USB devices from approved trusted sources.
Qualifying all generic devices or classes of devices might allow unapproved
devices to be used with your streaming applications.

01. If you haven't already done so, install the WorkSpaces Applications client. For
     information, see [Install and Configure the WorkSpaces Applications Client](install-configure-client.md).

02. Connect the USB device that you want to qualify to your computer.

03. Navigate to
     **C:\\Users\\<logged-in-user>\\AppData\\Local\\AppStreamClient**,
     and double-click **dcvusblist.exe**.

04. In the **DCV - USB devices** dialog box, the list of USB
     devices that are connected to your local computer displays. The
     **Filter** column displays the filter string for every
     USB device. Right-click the list entry for a USB device that you want to
     enable, and choose **Copy filter string**.

05. On your desktop, choose the Windows **Start** button, and
     search for Notepad. Double-click **Notepad** to open a new
     file, copy the filter string to the file, and save it. Later, you'll use the
     filter string to qualify the USB device.

06. Launch a new image builder. For more information, see [Launch an Image Builder to Install and Configure Streaming Applications](tutorial-image-builder-create.md).

07. After your image builder is in the **Running** state,
     perform the following steps to create a streaming URL and connect to the
     image builder by using the WorkSpaces Applications client.
    1. With your image builder selected in the list, choose
        **Actions**, **Create streaming**
       **URL**.

    2. In the **Create streaming URL** dialog box,
        choose **Copy link**, and copy and paste the web
        address into a separate file for later use. You'll use this URL to
        reconnect to the image builder in step 12.

    3. Choose **Launch in Client**.

    4. If the **Launch Application** dialog box opens
        and prompts you to choose the application to use when opening the
        link, choose **Amazon AppStream**, **Open**
       **link**. To prevent this dialog box from displaying the
        next time you perform this step to connect to an image builder,
        select the **Remember my choice for amazonappstream**
       **links** check box.

    5. If the WorkSpaces Applications client displays links to the AWS Customer
        Agreement, AWS Service Terms, and the AWS Privacy Notice, and
        third-party notices, review this information, and then choose
        **Finish**.

    6. If the client sign-in page is displayed, the web address field is
        prepopulated with the streaming URL. Choose
        **Connect**.

    7. If prompted, log in to the image builder as Administrator.
08. After you are connected to the image builder, if your USB device requires
     you to install drivers before you use it, download and install the drivers
     on the image builder. For example, if you use the Connexion 3D mouse, you
     must download and install the required Connexion drivers on the image
     builder.

09. On your image builder desktop, choose the Windows
     **Start** button, and search for Notepad. Right-click
     **Notepad**, and choose **Run as**
    **Administrator**.

10. Choose **File**, **Open**, and open the
     following file:
     `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\Photon\DCV\usb_device_allowlist.txt`.
     You can also allow an entire category of devices or all devices from a
     specific manufacturer by using wildcard expressions in the
     `usb_device_allowlist.txt` file.

11. Copy the filter string from your local computer to the image builder. The
     filter string for a specific USB device is a comma-separated string of the
     following fields: **Name**, **Base**
    **Class**, **SubClass**,
     **Protocol**, **ID Vendor**,
     **ID Product**, **Support Autoshare**,
     and **Skip Reset**. For detailed information about these
     strings, see [Working with USB Device Filter Strings](usb-device-filter-strings.md).

12. Disconnect from your image builder, restart it, and reconnect to it by
     using the WorkSpaces Applications client. To do so, open the WorkSpaces Applications client and paste the
     streaming URL that you created in step 7 into the client sign-in web address
     field, and choose **Connect**.

13. On the image builder, test your USB device to confirm that it works as
     expected.

14. Before your users can use the USB device in an WorkSpaces Applications session, they must
     first share the device with their session. For guidance that you can provide
     your users to help them perform this task, see [USB Devices](client-application-windows-how-to-share-usb-devices-user.md).

15. If the USB device works with the image builder as expected, create an
     image. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

16. After you finish creating the image, update your WorkSpaces Applications fleet to use the
     new image.
