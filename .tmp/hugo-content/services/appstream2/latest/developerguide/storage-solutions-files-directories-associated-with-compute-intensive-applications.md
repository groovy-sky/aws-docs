# Files and Directories Associated with Compute-Intensive Applications

During WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, saving large files and directories associated
with compute-intensive applications to persistent storage can take longer than
saving files and directories required for basic productivity applications. For
example, it might take longer for applications to save a large amount of data or
frequently modify the same files than it would to save files created by applications
that perform a single write action. It might also take longer to save many small
files.

If your users save files and directories associated with compute-intensive
applications and WorkSpaces Applications persistent storage options aren't performing as expected, we
recommend that you use a Server Message Block (SMB) solution such as
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server or an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Following are examples of files and
directories associated with compute-intensive applications that are more suitable
for use with these SMB solutions:

- Workspace folders for integrated development environments (IDEs)

- Local database files

- Scratch space folders created by graphics simulation applications
