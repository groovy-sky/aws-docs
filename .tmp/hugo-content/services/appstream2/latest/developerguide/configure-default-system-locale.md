# Specify a Default System Locale

To specify a default system locale for your users’ streaming sessions, perform the
following steps.

01. Connect to the image builder that you want to use and sign in with an account
     that has local administrator permissions. To do so, do either of the
     following:

- [Use the WorkSpaces Applications\
console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)

- [Create a\
streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-url.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client connections)

###### Note

If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to an
Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart card
sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications client
for the connection. For information about smart card sign in, see
[Smart Cards](feature-support-usb-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

02. On the image builder desktop, choose the Windows **Start**
     button, and choose **Control Panel**.

03. Choose **Clock, Language, and Region**, then
     **Region**.

04. In the **Region** dialog box, choose the
     **Formats** tab.

05. Choose **Change system locale**.

06. In the **Region Settings** dialog box, in the
     **Current system locale** list, choose a language and
     region.

    ###### Note

    Currently, WorkSpaces Applications supports only **English (United States)** and **Japanese (Japan)**.

07. Choose **OK** to close the **Region**
    **Settings** dialog box, and choose **OK** again to
     close the **Region** dialog box.

08. When prompted to restart your computer, allow Windows to restart.

09. While Windows restarts, the WorkSpaces Applications login prompt displays. Wait for 10 minutes
     before you log in to the image builder again. Otherwise, you may receive an
     error. After 10 minutes, you can log in as
     **Administrator**.

10. If required, configure additional default regional or language settings.
     Otherwise, on the image builder desktop, open Image Assistant and install and
     configure applications for streaming. After you finish configuring your image
     builder, follow the necessary steps in Image Assistant to finish creating your
     image. For information about how to create an image, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

11. Do one of the following:

- Create a new fleet and choose your new image for the fleet. For more
information, see [Create an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Fleet and Stack](set-up-stacks-fleets.md).

- Update an existing fleet to use the new image.

12. Associate your fleet with the stack that is assigned to the users for whom you
     are configuring the default settings.

    The default system locale setting that you configured is applied to the fleet
     instances and user streaming sessions that are launched from those
     instances.
