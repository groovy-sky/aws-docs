# Create an Environment Variable That is Limited in Scope

Follow these steps to create an environment variable that is limited in scope to
the processes that are spawned off the script. This approach is useful when you need
to use the same environment variable name with different values for different
applications. For example, if you have two different applications that use the
environment variable "LIC\_SERVER", but each application has a different value for
"LIC\_SERVER".

###### To create an environment variable that is limited in scope

01. Connect to the image builder on which to create an environment variable
     that is limited in scope and sign in with an account that has local
     administrator permissions. To do so, do either of the following:

- [Use the\
WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)

- [Create a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-url.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client
connections)

###### Note

If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to
an Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart
card sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications
client for the connection. For information about smart card sign
in, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-usb-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

02. Create a child folder of C:\ drive for the script (for example,
     C:\\Scripts).

03. Open Notepad to create the new script, and enter the following
     lines:

    `set
                                ` `variable` = `value`

    `start " " "C:\path\to\application.exe"`

    Where:

    `variable` is the variable name to be used

    `value` is the value for the given variable
     name

    ###### Note

    If the application path includes spaces, the entire string must be
    encapsulated within quotation marks. For example:

    `start " " "C:\Program
                                    Files\application.exe"`

04. Choose **File**, **Save**. Name the file
     and save it with the .bat extension to C:\\Scripts. For example, name the
     file LaunchApp.bat.

05. If needed, repeat steps 4 and 5 to create a script for each additional
     application that requires its own environment variable and values.

06. On the image builder desktop, start Image Assistant.

07. Choose **Add App**, navigate to C:\\Scripts, and select
     one of the scripts that you created in step 5. Choose
     **Open**.

08. In the **App Launch Settings** dialog box, keep or change
     the settings as needed. When you're done, choose
     **Save**.

09. If you created multiple scripts, repeat steps 8 and 9 for each
     script.

10. Follow the necessary steps in Image Assistant to finish creating your
     image. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

    The environment variable and specific value are now available for
     processes that are run from the script. Other processes cannot access this
     variable and value.
