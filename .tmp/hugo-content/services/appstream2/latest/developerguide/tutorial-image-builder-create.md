# Launch an Image Builder to Install and Configure Streaming Applications

To install and configure applications to stream to your users, you start by launching
an image builder instance as described in the following procedure.

###### Important

After you launch an image builder and it is running, your account may incur nominal
charges. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/pricing).

###### To launch an image builder

01. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home).

02. You can launch the image builder in the following ways:

- If a welcome screen appears displaying two options ( **Try**
**it now** and **Get started**), choose
**Get started**, **Custom set**
**up**.

For information about these two options, see [Amazon WorkSpaces Applications\
FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/faqs).

- If a welcome screen does not appear, choose **Quick**
**links** in the left navigation pane, then **Custom**
**set up**.

- Alternatively, choose **Images** in the left
navigation pane, then the **Image Builder** tab,
**Launch Image Builder**.

03. For **Step 1: Choose Image**, choose a base image. If you are
     launching the image builder for the first time, you can use one of the latest
     base images released by AWS (selected by default). For a list of the latest
     versions of base images released by AWS, see [WorkSpaces Applications Base Image and Managed Image Update Release Notes](base-image-version-history.md). If you have already created images,
     or you want to update applications in an existing image, you can select one of
     your existing images. Be sure to select an image that aligns with the instance
     family that you need. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Instance Families](instance-types.md).

    Choose **Next**.

04. For **Step 2: Configure Image Builder**, configure the image
     builder by doing the following:

- **Name**: Type a unique name identifier for the image builder.

- **Display name (optional)**: Type a name to display for the image builder (maximum of 100 characters).

- **Tags (optional)**: Choose **Add Tag**, and type the key and value
for the tag. To add more tags, repeat this step. For more
information, see [Tagging Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Resources](tagging-basic.md).

- **Instance Type**: Select the instance type for the image builder. Choose a type that
matches the performance requirements of the applications that you
plan to install. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Instance Families](instance-types.md).

- You can use stream.\* instance types for images with `type = "native"`. To use any of the following instance type you must [Import Image](import-image.md) and create an image with `type = "custom"`.

- GeneralPurpose.\*

- MemoryOptimized.\*

- ComputeOptimized.\*

- Accelerated.\*

- Configure **storage** volumes for Image Builder. By default, the storage volume matches image volume size, with a service default of 200 GB included in the hourly instance rate. You can customize your Image Builder storage capacity from 200 GB up to 500 GB based on your requirements.

###### Note

Note: Storage volume size cannot be set below the image volume size. Storage capacity can be increased up to 500 GB, with additional charges applying to any storage beyond the included 200 GB. These charges apply to Image Builders in RUNNING state.

- **Available license included applications**: Select
one or more license included applications that you want to install on
your image.

- Already installed license included applications display a
checked checkbox next to them, and the status says
**Installed**.

- If you want to uninstall an already installed license included
application, uncheck the checkbox next to it.

- After connecting to the Image Builder, you can see apps you
selected installed there.

- **VPC Endpoints (Advanced)**: You can create an [interface VPC\
endpoint](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.md) (interface endpoint), in your virtual private cloud (VPC). To start creating the interface endpoint, select **Create VPC Endpoint**. Selecting this link opens the VPC console. To finish creating the endpoint, follow steps 3 through 6 in _To create an interface endpoint_, in [Tutorial: Creating and Streaming from Interface VPC Endpoints](creating-streaming-from-interface-vpc-endpoints.md).

After you create the interface endpoint, you can use it to keep streaming
traffic within your VPC.

- **WorkSpaces Applications Agent**: This section displays only if you are not using the latest base image from AWS or a custom image that uses the latest version of the agent.

The WorkSpaces Applications agent software runs on your streaming instances,
enabling your users to connect to and stream their applications.
Starting December 7, 2017, your streaming instances can be
automatically updated with the latest WorkSpaces Applications agent software.
This capability helps to ensure that your image builder includes
the latest features, performance improvements, and security
updates that are available from AWS.

You can enable automatic updates of the
WorkSpaces Applications agent by creating a new image from any base image
published by AWS on or after December 7, 2017. If the image that you are launching your image builder from doesn't use the
latest version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent, we recommend that you select
the option to launch your image builder with the latest agent.

- **IAM role (Advanced)**: When you apply an IAM role from your account to an WorkSpaces Applications image builder, you can make AWS API requests from the image builder instance without manually managing AWS credentials. To apply an IAM role to the image builder, do either of the following:

- To use an existing IAM role in your Amazon Web Services account, choose the role that you want to use from the **IAM role** list. The role must must be accessible from the image builder. For more information, see [Configuring an Existing IAM Role to Use With WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Instances](configuring-existing-iam-role-to-use-with-streaming-instances.md).

- To create a new IAM role, choose **Create new IAM role** and follow the steps in [How to Create an IAM Role to Use With WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Instances](how-to-create-iam-role-to-use-with-streaming-instances.md).

05. Choose **Next**.

06. For **Step 3: Configure Network**, do the following:

- To add internet access for the image builder in a VPC with a public
subnet, choose **Default Internet Access**. If you are
providing internet access by using a NAT gateway, leave
**Default Internet Access** unselected. For more
information, see [Internet Access](internet-access.md).

- For **VPC** and **Subnet 1**, choose a VPC and at least one subnet. For increased fault tolerance, we recommend that you choose two subnets in different Availability Zones. For more information, see [Configure a VPC with Private Subnets and a NAT Gateway](managing-network-internet-nat-gateway.md).

If you don't have your own VPC and subnet, you can use the [default VPC](default-vpc-with-public-subnet.md) or create your own. To create your own, choose the **Create a new**
**VPC** and **Create new subnet** links to
create them. Choosing these links opens the Amazon VPC console. After you
create your VPC and subnets, return to the WorkSpaces Applications console and choose the refresh icon to the left of the **Create a new**
**VPC** and **Create new subnet** links to display them in the list. For more information, see [Configure a VPC for WorkSpaces Applications](appstream-vpc.md).

- For **Security group(s)**, choose up to five security groups to associate
with this image builder. If you don't have your own security group and
you don't want to use the default security group, choose the
**Create new security group** link to create one.
After you create your subnets in the Amazon VPC console, return to the WorkSpaces Applications
console and choose the refresh icon to the left of the **Create**
**new security group** link to display them in the list. For
more information, see [Security Groups in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](managing-network-security-groups.md).

07. For **Active Directory Domain (Optional)**, expand this
     section to choose the Active Directory configuration and organizational unit in which to
     place your streaming instance computer objects. Ensure that the selected network
     access settings enable DNS resolvability and communication with your directory.
     For more information, see [Using Active Directory with WorkSpaces Applications](active-directory.md).

08. Choose **Review** and confirm the details for the image
     builder. To change the configuration for any section, choose
     **Edit** and make the needed changes.

09. After you finish
     reviewing the configuration details, choose **Launch**.

    ###### Note

    If an error message notifies you that you don't have sufficient limits (quotas) to create the image builder, submit a limit increase request through the Service Quotas console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas). For more information, see [Requesting a quota increase](../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.md) in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.

10. During the image builder creation process, the status of the image builder displays as **Pending** while WorkSpaces Applications prepares the necessary resources. Click the **Refresh** icon periodically to update the image builder status. After the status changes to **Running**, the image builder is ready to use and you can create a custom image.

**Next Steps**

Next, install and configure your applications for streaming, and then create an image by creating a snapshot of the image builder instance. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).
