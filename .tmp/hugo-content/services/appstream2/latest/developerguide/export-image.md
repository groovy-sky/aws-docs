# Export Image

You can export your images to create EC2 AMIs. Later you can [Import Image](import-image.md) those AMIs back to create WorkSpaces Applications images. This helps you to use your own AMI customization tools for customizing of your images.

###### Note

During export following components will be removed from your images

- WorkSpaces Applications agent

- Microsoft license included applications, which were added using Image Builder

- Only Microsoft Windows Server 2022 and 2025 images can be exported.

## IAM Role Requirements

###### Important

Create an IAM role with the following permissions to use for export import:

```

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCopyImage",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:CopyImage",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowDescribeImages",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeImages",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCreateTags",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:CreateTags",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Add the following trust relationship for this IAM role

```

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "appstream.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
