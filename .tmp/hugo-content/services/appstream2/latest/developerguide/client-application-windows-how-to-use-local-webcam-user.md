# Video and Audio Conferencing

WorkSpaces Applications real-time audio-video (AV) redirects your local webcam video input to
WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions. That way, you can use your local devices for video
and audio conferencing within your WorkSpaces Applications streaming session.

###### To use a local webcam and microphone within an WorkSpaces Applications streaming session

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications client and connect to a streaming session.

2. In the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar in the top left of your session window, do
    either of the following:

- If the video icon has a diagonal line through it (as shown in
the following screenshot), this indicates that the WorkSpaces Applications
real-time AV feature is available for use but no webcams are
attached to your streaming session. Choose the video icon to
attach one or more webcams.

- If the video icon does not have a diagonal line through it (as
shown in the following screenshot), one or more webcams are
already attached to your streaming session. Skip this step and
proceed to the next step.

###### Note

If the video icon doesn't display in the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar, contact
your WorkSpaces Applications administrator. Your administrator might need to perform
additional configuration tasks, as described in [Real-Time Audio-Video](feature-support-real-time-av.md).

3. To display the names of the webcams that are attached to your
    streaming session, choose the downward arrow next to the video icon. If
    you have more than one webcam (for example, if you have a USB webcam
    that is connected to your laptop and a built-in webcam), a check mark
    appears next to the name of the webcam that is selected for use for
    video conferencing within your streaming session.

4. To use the selected webcam for video conferencing within your WorkSpaces Applications
    streaming session, start the video conferencing application that you
    want to use. When the webcam is active (being used for video
    conferencing within your streaming session), the video icon is
    red.

5. To enable the microphone, choose the microphone icon.

###### Note

If you have more than one webcam and want to change the one that you use
for streaming within an WorkSpaces Applications session, you must first detach your webcams
from the session. For more information, see the next procedure.

###### To change the local webcam to use within an WorkSpaces Applications streaming session

1. Within your WorkSpaces Applications streaming session, in the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar in the top
    left of your session window, do either of the following:

- If the video icon does not have a diagonal line through it (as
shown in the following screenshot), this indicates that the
WorkSpaces Applications real-time AV feature is available for use and that
webcams are still attached to your streaming session. Choose the
video icon to detach the webcams.

2. Display the names of your webcams by choosing the downward arrow next
    to the video icon, then select the name of the webcam that you want to

select the check mark next to the name of the webcam you want to
use, the webcam won't change.
