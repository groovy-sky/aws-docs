# Prerequisites for Enabling Application Settings Persistence

To enable application settings persistence, you must first do the
following:

- Check that you have the correct AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for Amazon S3
actions. For more information, see the _IAM Policies and the Amazon_
_S3 Bucket for Home Folders_ section in [Identity and Access Management for Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](controlling-access.md).

- Use an image that was created from a base image published by AWS on or
after December 7, 2017. For a current list of released AWS base images,
see [WorkSpaces Applications Base Image and Managed Image Update Release Notes](base-image-version-history.md).

- Associate the stack on which you plan to enable this feature with a fleet
based on an image that uses a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent released on or
after August 29, 2018. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Agent Release Notes](agent-software-versions.md).

- Enable network connectivity to Amazon S3 from your virtual private cloud (VPC)
by configuring internet access or a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. For more
information, see the _Home Folders and VPC Endpoints_
section in [Networking and Access for Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](managing-network.md).
