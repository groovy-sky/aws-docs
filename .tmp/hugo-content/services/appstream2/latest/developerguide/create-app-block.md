# Create a Custom App Block

You can use the WorkSpaces Applications console to create the app block resource once you have your
VHD and setup script created and uploaded to an S3 bucket in your AWS account. To
learn more about storing the VHD and setup script in an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Store Application Icon, Setup Script, Session Script, and VHD in an S3 Bucket](store-s3-bucket.md).

###### Note

You must have IAM permissions to perform the `S3:GetObject`
action on the VHD and setup script objects in the Amazon S3 bucket to create the app
block resource.

###### To create the app block resource

01. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).

02. From the left-hand navigation menu, choose
     **Applications**, **App block**, and
     **Create app block**.

03. For app block packaging, select **Custom**.

04. For **App block details**, type a unique name identifier
     for the app block. Optionally, you can also specify the following:

- **Display name** – A friendly name for the app
block.

- **Description** – A description for the app
block.

05. For **Virtual hard disk object in S3** under
     **Script settings**, either enter the S3 URI that
     represents the VHD object, or choose **Browse S3** to
     navigate to your S3 buckets and find the VHD object.

06. For **Setup script object in S3** under **Script**
    **settings**, either enter the S3 URI that represents the setup
     script object, or choose **Browse S3** to navigate to your
     S3 buckets and find the setup script object.

07. For **Setup script executable** under **Script**
    **settings**, enter the executable necessary for your setup
     script.

    ###### Note

    If your setup script can execute directly, enter the filename of the
    setup script. If your setup script relies on another executable (for
    example, Microsoft PowerShell) to execute, enter the path to that
    executable.

    Path to Microsoft PowerShell on Microsoft Windows:

    `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`

08. Optionally, for **Setup script executable arguments**
     under **Script settings**, enter in the arguments that need
     to be provided to the setup script executable to execute your setup
     script.

    ###### Note

    If you are using a Microsoft PowerShell script, you must specify the
    "-File" parameter with the name of your setup script as an executable
    argument. Additionally, ensure that the Execution Policy allows your
    script to be run. To learn more, see [about\_Execution\_Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2) and [What is PowerShell?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.2).

09. For **Execution duration in seconds** under
     **Script settings**, enter the timeout duration for
     your setup script.

    ###### Note

    The execution duration in seconds is how long WorkSpaces Applications waits for the
    setup script to run before continuing. If your setup script doesn’t
    complete within this duration, an error is displayed to your user and
    the application will attempt to launch. The setup script is terminated
    after the execution duration has elapsed.

10. (Optional) For **Tags**, create tags for the app block
     resource

11. Review the information that you entered, and choose
     **Create**.

12. If your app block was created successfully, you see a success message at
     the top of the console. If an error occurred, you see a descriptive error
     message and will need to try creating the app block again.
