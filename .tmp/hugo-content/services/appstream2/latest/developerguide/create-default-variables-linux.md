# Creating Default Environment Variables for Your Linux Users

You can create environment variables on a Linux Image Builder instance. Creating
environment variables makes them available on streaming instances created from that
image.

###### Note

On Linux fleet instances, environment variables set using the Image Assistant
(GUI) tool and the default system environment variables are exported through the
/etc/profile.d/appstream\_system\_vars.sh script. To access these environment
variables, you must explicitly source the /etc/profile.d/appstream\_system\_vars.sh
script in your applications.

###### To create environment variables for your users

1. If the folder `/etc/profile` doesn’t exist, run the
    following command to create it:

**\[ImageBuilderAdmin\]$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/profile.d**

2. To create a new shell script file (for example, my-environment.sh) in this
    folder, run the following command:

**\[ImageBuilderAdmin\]$ vim my-environment.sh**

3. On first line of the script file, add the following content:

**#!/bin/sh**

4. For each subsequent line, add an **export** command to set the
    environment variables for your image. The following example adds
    `$HOME/bin` to the `PATH` variable:

**export PATH=”$HOME/bin:$PATH”**

5. Press the **Esc** key to return to command mode in vim, then
    run the following command to save your script and exit vim:

**:x**

6. Run the following command to allow the script to run as a program:

**\[ImageBuilderAdmin\]$ chmod +x my-environment.sh**
