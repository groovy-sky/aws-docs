# Enable and Administer OneDrive for Business for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users

WorkSpaces Applications supports the following persistent storage options for users in your
organization.

- OneDrive for Business

- Google Drive for Google Workspace

- Home folders

You can enable one or more options for your organization. When you enable OneDrive for
Business for an WorkSpaces Applications stack, users of the stack can link their OneDrive for Business
account to WorkSpaces Applications. Then they can sign into their OneDrive for Business account and
access their OneDrive folder during application streaming sessions. Any changes that
they make to files or folders in OneDrive during those sessions are automatically backed
up and synchronized, so that they are available to users outside of their streaming
sessions.

###### Important

You can enable OneDrive for Business for accounts in your OneDrive domains only,
but not for personal accounts. WorkSpaces Applications requires that you configure your Microsoft
Azure Active Directory environment to allow end-user consent to applications. For
more information, see [Configure how end-users consent to applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent) in the Azure Active
Directory [Application management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps) documentation.

The admin consent workflow lets administrators grant access to applications that
require administrator approval. If the admin consent workflow is configured in your
Azure Active Directory environment, follow the step given in [Enable OneDrive for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users](enable-onedrive.md) to specify the domains that require admin consent.

###### Note

You can enable OneDrive for Business for Windows stacks, but not for Linux stacks
or stacks associated with multi-session fleets.
