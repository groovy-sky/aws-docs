# Configuring WorkSpaces Applications to Use Domain Trusts

WorkSpaces Applications supports Active Directory domain environments where network resources such
as file servers, applications, and computer objects reside in one domain, and the
user objects reside in another. The domain service account used for computer object
operations does not need to be in the same domain as the WorkSpaces Applications computer objects.

When creating the directory configuration, specify a service account that has the
appropriate permissions to manage computer objects in the Active Directory domain
where the file servers, applications, computer objects and other network resources
reside.

Your end user Active Directory accounts must have the "Allowed to Authenticate"
permissions for the following:

- WorkSpaces Applications computer objects

- Domain controllers for the domain

For more information, see [Granting Permissions to Create and Manage Active Directory Computer Objects](active-directory-permissions.md).
