# Protecting Data in Transit with FIPS Endpoints

By default, when you communicate with the WorkSpaces Applications service, whether as an administrator using the WorkSpaces Applications console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or an AWS SDK, or as a user streaming from an image builder or a fleet instance, all data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2.

If you require FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through
a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. WorkSpaces Applications offers FIPS endpoints in all United
States AWS Regions where WorkSpaces Applications is available. When you use a FIPS endpoint, all data in
transit is encrypted using cryptographic standards that comply with Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2. For information about FIPS endpoints, including a list
of WorkSpaces Applications endpoints, see [Federal Information Processing\
Standard (FIPS) 140-2](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips).
