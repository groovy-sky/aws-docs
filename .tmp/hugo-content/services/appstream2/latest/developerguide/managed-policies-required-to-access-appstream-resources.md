# AWS Managed Policies Required to Access WorkSpaces Applications Resources

To provide full administrative or read-only access to WorkSpaces Applications, you must attach one of the following AWS managed policies to the IAM users or groups that require those permissions. An _AWS managed policy_ is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. For more information, see [AWS Managed Policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Note

In AWS, IAM roles are used to grant permissions to an AWS service so it
can access AWS resources. The policies that are attached to the role determine
which AWS resources the service can access and what it can do with those
resources. For WorkSpaces Applications, in addition to having the permissions defined in the
**AmazonAppStreamFullAccess** policy, you must also have
the required roles in your AWS account. For more information, see [Roles Required for WorkSpaces Applications, Application Auto Scaling, and AWS Certificate Manager Private CA](roles-required-for-appstream.md).

**AmazonAppStreamFullAccess**

This managed policy provides full administrative access to WorkSpaces Applications
resources. To manage WorkSpaces Applications resources and perform API actions through
the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDK, or AWS
Management Console, you must have the permissions defined in this
policy.

If you sign into the WorkSpaces Applications console as an IAM user, you must attach
this policy to your AWS account. If you sign in through console
federation, you must attach this policy to the IAM role that was used
for federation.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonAppStreamFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonappstreamfullaccess.md).

**AmazonAppStreamReadOnlyAccess**

This identity-based policy grants users read-only permissions to view
and monitor WorkSpaces Applications resources and related service configurations. Users
can access the WorkSpaces Applications console to view streaming applications, fleet
status, usage reports, and associated resources, but cannot make any
changes. The policy also includes necessary read permissions for
supporting services like IAM, Application Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch to enable
comprehensive monitoring and reporting capabilities.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonAppStreamReadOnlyAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonappstreamreadonlyaccess.md).

The WorkSpaces Applications console uses an additional action that provides functionality that is
not available through the AWS CLI or AWS SDK. The
**AmazonAppStreamFullAccess** and
**AmazonAppStreamReadOnlyAccess** policies both provide
permissions for the following action.

ActionDescriptionAccess Level`DescribeImageBuilders`Grants permission to retrieve a list that describes one or more specified
image builders, if the image builder names are provided. Otherwise,
all image builders in the account are described.Read

**AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess**

This managed policy provides full administrative access to AWS
Certificate Manager Private CA resources in your AWS account for
certificate-based authentication.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonappstreampcaaccess.md).

**AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess**

This managed policy is the default policy for the WorkSpaces Applications service role.

This role permissions policy allows WorkSpaces Applications to complete the following
actions:

- When using subnets in your account for your WorkSpaces Applications fleets,
WorkSpaces Applications is able to describe subnets, VPCs, and availability
zones, as well as create and manage the lifecycle of all elastic
network interfaces associated with the fleet instances in those
subnets. This also includes being able to attach Security Groups
and IP addresses from those subnets to those elastic network
interfaces.

- When using features such as UPP and HomeFolders, WorkSpaces Applications is
able to create and manage Amazon S3 buckets, objects and
their lifecyles, policies, and encryption configuration in the
account. These buckets include the following naming
prefixes:

- `"arn:aws:s3:::appstream2-36fb080bb8-",`

- `"arn:aws:s3:::appstream-app-settings-",`

- `"arn:aws:s3:::appstream-logs-"`

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazonappstreamserviceaccess.md).

**ApplicationAutoScalingForAmazonAppStreamAccess**

This managed policy enables application autoscaling for
WorkSpaces Applications.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [ApplicationAutoScalingForAmazonAppStreamAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/applicationautoscalingforamazonappstreamaccess.md).

**AWSApplicationAutoscalingAppStreamFleetPolicy**

This managed policy grants permissions for Application Auto Scaling
to access WorkSpaces Applications and CloudWatch .

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSApplicationAutoscalingAppStreamFleetPolicy](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsapplicationautoscalingappstreamfleetpolicy.md).
