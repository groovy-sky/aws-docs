# Management Network Interface IP Address Range and Ports in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

The management network interface IP address range is 198.19.0.0/16. The following
ports must be open on the management network interface of all streaming
instances:

- Inbound TCP on port 8300. This is used for establishment of the streaming
connection.

- Inbound TCP on ports 8000 and 8443. These are used for management of the
streaming instance by WorkSpaces Applications.

- Inbound UDP on port 8300. This is used for establishment of the streaming
connection over UDP.

- Outbound TCP on port 1688. This is used for Microsoft license included
application activation on fleet streaming instances.

Limit the inbound range on the management network interface to
198.19.0.0/16.

Under normal circumstances, WorkSpaces Applications correctly configures these ports for your
streaming instances. If any security or firewall software is installed on a
streaming instance that blocks any of these ports, the streaming instance may not
function correctly or may be unreachable.

Do not disable IPv6. If you disable IPv6, WorkSpaces Applications will not function correctly. For information about configuring IPv6 for Windows, see [Guidance for configuring IPv6 in Windows for advanced users](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929852/guidance-for-configuring-ipv6-in-windows-for-advanced-users).

###### Note

WorkSpaces Applications relies on the DNS servers within your VPC to return a non-existent domain
(NXDOMAIN) response for local domain names that don’t exist. This enables the
WorkSpaces Applications-managed network interface to communicate with the management servers.

When you create a directory with Simple AD, AWS Directory Service creates two domain controllers that also function as DNS servers on your behalf. Because the domain controllers don't provide the
NXDOMAIN response, they can't be used with WorkSpaces Applications.
