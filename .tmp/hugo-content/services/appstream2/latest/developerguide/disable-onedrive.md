# Disable OneDrive for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users

You can disable OneDrive for a stack without losing user content that is already
stored on OneDrive. Disabling OneDrive for a stack has the following effects:

- Users who are connected to active streaming sessions for the stack receive
an error message. They are informed that they do not have permissions to
access their OneDrive.

- Any new sessions that use the stack with OneDrive disabled do not display
OneDrive.

- Only the specific stack for which OneDrive is disabled is affected.

- Even if OneDrive is disabled for all stacks, WorkSpaces Applications does not delete the
user content stored in their OneDrive.

Follow these steps to disable OneDrive for an existing stack.

###### To disable OneDrive for an existing stack

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Stacks**, and
    select the stack for which to disable OneDrive.

3. Below the stacks list, choose **Storage**, and clear
    **Enable OneDrive for Business** option.

4. In the **Disable OneDrive for Business** dialog box, type
    `CONFIRM` (case-sensitive) to confirm your choice, then
    choose **Disable**.

When users of the stack start their next WorkSpaces Applications streaming session, they
    can no longer access their OneDrive folder from within that session and
    future sessions.
