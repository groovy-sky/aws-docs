# Amazon WorkSpaces Applications User Pools

The WorkSpaces Applications user pool provides a simplified way to manage access to applications for your
users through a persistent portal for each AWS Region. This feature is a built-in
alternative to user management through [Active Directory](active-directory.md) and [SAML 2.0 federation](external-identity-providers.md). Stacks can't be assigned to users in the user pool if the stacks are associated with a fleet that is joined to an Active Directory domain.

The WorkSpaces Applications user pool provides the following key features:

- Users can access application stacks through a persistent URL and login credentials
by using their email address and a password that they choose.

- Users' email addresses are case-sensitive. During login, if they specify an email address that doesn't use the same
capitalization as the email address specified when their user pool account was created, a "user does not exist" error message
displays.

- You can assign multiple stacks to users. Doing so enables WorkSpaces Applications to display multiple
application catalogs to users when they log in.

- When you create new users, a welcome email is automatically sent to them. The
email includes instructions, a login portal link, and a temporary password for
connecting to the login portal.

- After you create users, they are enabled unless you specifically disable
them.

- You can control which users have access to which application stacks, or disable
access completely.
