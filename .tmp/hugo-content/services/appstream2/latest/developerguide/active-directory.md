# Using Active Directory with WorkSpaces Applications

You can join your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Always-On and On-Demand Windows fleets and image builders to
domains in Microsoft Active Directory and use your existing Active Directory domains, either
cloud-based or on-premises, to launch domain-joined streaming instances. You can also use
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, to create an Active Directory
domain and use that to support your WorkSpaces Applications resources. For more information about using AWS
Managed Microsoft AD, see [Microsoft Active Directory](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory-microsoft-ad.md) in the
_AWS Directory Service Administration Guide_.

###### Note

Amazon Linux 2 fleets, image builders, elastic fleets, and app block builders
currently do not support domain join.

By joining WorkSpaces Applications to your Active Directory domain, you can:

- Allow your users and applications to access Active Directory resources such
as printers and file shares from streaming sessions.

- Use Group Policy settings that are available in the Group Policy Management
Console (GPMC) to define the end user experience.

- Stream applications that require users to be authenticated using their Active
Directory login credentials.

- Apply your enterprise compliance and security policies to your WorkSpaces Applications streaming
instances.
