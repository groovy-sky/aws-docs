# Data Protection in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

The AWS [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model)
applies to data protection in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications. As described in this model, AWS is
responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS Cloud. You are
responsible for maintaining control over your content that is hosted on this infrastructure.
This content includes the security configuration and management tasks for the AWS services
that you use. For more information about data privacy, see the [Data Privacy FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq). For information about data protection in Europe, see the [AWS Shared\
Responsibility Model and GDPR](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr) blog post on the _AWS Security_
_Blog_.

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account
credentials and set up individual users with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). That way each user is given only
the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties. We also recommend that you secure your
data in the following ways:

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.

- Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We recommend TLS 1.2.

- Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail.

- Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS
services.

- Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering
and securing personal data that is stored in Amazon S3.

- If you require FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through
a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. For more information about the
available FIPS endpoints, see [Federal\
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips).

We strongly recommend that you never put confidential or sensitive information, such as your
customers' email addresses, into tags or free-form fields such as a **Name** field. This includes when you work with WorkSpaces Applications or other AWS
services using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Any data that you enter into
tags or free-form fields used for names may be used for billing or diagnostic logs. If you
provide a URL to an external server, we strongly recommend that you do not include credentials
information in the URL to validate your request to that server.
