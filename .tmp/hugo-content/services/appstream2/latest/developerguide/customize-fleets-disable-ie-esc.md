# Disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration (ESC) places servers and Internet
Explorer in a configuration that limits exposure to the internet. However, this
configuration can impact the WorkSpaces Applications end user experience. Users who are connected to
WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions may find that websites do not display or perform as
expected when:

- Internet Explorer ESC is enabled on fleet instances from which users'
streaming sessions are launched

- Users run Internet Explorer during their streaming sessions

- Applications use Internet Explorer to load data

###### Note

The following steps apply to Windows fleets only.

###### To disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

01. Connect to the image builder on which to disable Internet Explorer ESC and
     sign in with an account that has local administrator permissions. To do so, do
     either of the following:

- [Use the WorkSpaces Applications\
console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)

- [Create a\
streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-url.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client connections)

###### Note

If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to an
Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart card
sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications client
for the connection. For information about smart card sign in, see
[Smart Cards](feature-support-usb-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

02. On the image builder, disable Internet Explorer ESC by doing the
     following:
    1. Open Server Manager. Choose the Windows **Start**
        button, and then choose **Server Manager**.

    2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Local Server**.

        **Administrators** and **Users**,
        then choose **OK**.

     and then do either of the following:

the **Directory User** tab, and log in with the same
domain account that you used in step 4.
