# Test Dynamic App Providers (Optional)

After you enable your dynamic app provider on an image builder, you can test
the provider to verify that it functions as expected. To do so, perform the
following steps before you finish creating the image.

###### To test dynamic app providers

1. Do one of the following:

- If you are already connected to the image builder on which you
enabled dynamic app providers and you are logged on as **Administrator,** you must switch to an account that
does not have local administrator permissions on the image
builder. To do so, in the upper right corner of the image
builder session toolbar, choose **Admin**
**Commands**, **Switch User**.

- If you are not already connected to the image builder, connect
by either [using the\
WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only) or [creating a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-url.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client
connections).

###### Note

When you are prompted to sign in, choose
**Directory User**, and sign in with a
domain account that does not have local administrator
permissions on the image builder.

2. On the image builder desktop, open Image Assistant, if it is not
    already open.

3. On the **Test Apps** page, if you specified any
    applications in the image that are not from the dynamic app provider,
    they display first in the list. It may take a few moments for
    applications from dynamic app providers to appear in the list.

4. Choose an application from the list and open it to verify that it
    functions as expected.

5. After you finish testing, in the lower right corner of the
    **Test Apps** page, choose **Switch**
**user**.

6. Choose **Administrator**, and log back into the image
    builder.

7. Follow the necessary steps in Image Assistant to finish creating your
    image. For information about how to create an image, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

WorkSpaces Applications automatically optimizes the agents that are specified in the
    **Agents.json** configuration file.
