# Multi-Session Recommendations

When deciding the maximum number of user sessions on an instance in a multi-session
environment, you should consider several factors to ensure optimal performance and
streaming experience. The following are recommendations for you to determine the optimum
number of user sessions on an instance:

- _Evaluate resource requirements_: Understand the resource
requirements of the applications being used within the sessions. Consider
factors such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth. This evaluation
will help determine the amount of resources each user session typically
requires.

- _Consider instance specifications_: Take into account the
specifications of the instance, including the number of CPUs, available memory,
and GPU specifications. Instances with higher specifications can handle a larger
number of user sessions. For more information on different instance types
supported by WorkSpaces Applications and pricing, see [WorkSpaces Applications\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/pricing).

- _Performance testing_: Conduct performance testing on the
applications and workload expected to run within the user sessions. Measure
resource utilization, response times, and overall system performance. Use this
data to assess the impact of concurrent user sessions on performance, and
determine the optimal session-to-instance ratio. You can run these assessments
across different instance types offered by WorkSpaces Applications to find the optimal instance
type or size for your end users. For more information on different instance
types offered by WorkSpaces Applications, see [WorkSpaces Applications Instance Families](instance-types.md).

- _Monitor resource utilization_: Continuously monitor the
resource utilization of the instance during normal usage. Observe CPU, memory,
and disk utilization. Ensure that the resource utilization remains within
acceptable limits to avoid performance degradation. For a multi-session
environment, you can view these metrics on WorkSpaces Applications and the CloudWatch console. For more
information, see [Monitoring Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Resources](monitoring.md).

- _Consider user behavior patterns_: Analyze user behavior
patterns to understand peak usage periods and potential concurrent usage. Some
users might have intermittent or sporadic usage patterns, while others might
have consistent usage throughout the day. Account for these patterns when
determining the maximum number of user sessions to avoid resource contention
during peak periods.

WorkSpaces Applications enables you to configure a maximum of 50 user sessions per instance,
regardless of the instance type or size that you choose. However, this is just
an upper limit, and not a recommended limit. The following is an example table
to help you determine the maximum number of user sessions on an instance in a
multi-session fleet. The recommended maximum number of users listed in the table
is based on general guidelines and assumptions. Testing with the real-life
workload is crucial, since actual performance can vary, depending on the
workload's individual characteristics, the application's resource requirements,
and user behavior.
