# Enable Home Folders for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users

Before enabling home folders, you must do the following:

- Check that you have the correct AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for Amazon S3
actions. For more information, see [Using IAM Policies to Manage Administrator Access to the Amazon S3 Bucket for Home Folders and Application Settings Persistence](s3-iam-policy.md).

- Use an image that was created from an AWS base image released on or
after May 18, 2017. For a current list of released AWS images, see [WorkSpaces Applications Base Image and Managed Image Update Release Notes](base-image-version-history.md).

- Enable network connectivity to Amazon S3 from your virtual private cloud (VPC)
by configuring internet access or a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. For more
information, see [Networking and Access for Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](managing-network.md) and [Using Amazon S3 VPC Endpoints for WorkSpaces Applications Features](managing-network-vpce-iam-policy.md).

You can enable or disable home folders while creating a stack (see [Create a Stack in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-install.md)), or after the stack is created by
using the AWS Management Console for WorkSpaces Applications, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI. For each AWS Region, home
folders are backed up by an Amazon S3 bucket.

The first time you enable home folders for an WorkSpaces Applications stack in an AWS Region, the
service creates an Amazon S3 bucket in your account in that same Region. The same bucket
is used to store the content of home folders for all users and all stacks in that
Region. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Storage](home-folders-s3.md).

###### Note

For guidance that you can provide your users to help them get started with
using home folders during WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, see [Use Home Folders](home-folders-end-user.md).
