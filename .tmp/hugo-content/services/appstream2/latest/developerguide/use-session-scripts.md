# Use Session Scripts to Manage Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Users' Streaming Experience

WorkSpaces Applications provides on-instance session scripts. You can use these scripts to run your own
custom scripts when specific events occur in users' streaming sessions. For example, you
can use custom scripts to prepare your WorkSpaces Applications environment before your users' streaming
sessions begin. You can also use custom scripts to clean up streaming instances after
users complete their streaming sessions.

Session scripts are specified within an WorkSpaces Applications image. These scripts are run within the
user context or the system context. If your session scripts use the standard out to
write information, error, or debugging messaging, these can be optionally saved to an
Amazon S3 bucket within your Amazon Web Services account.
