# WorkSpaces Applications Agent Release Notes

The Amazon WorkSpaces Applications agent software runs on your streaming instances, enabling end users to
connect to and start their streaming applications. Starting December 7, 2017, your streaming
instances can be automatically updated with the latest features, performance improvements,
and security updates that are available from AWS. Before December 7, 2017, agent updates
were included with new base image releases.

To use the latest WorkSpaces Applications agent software, you need to rebuild your images by using new base
images published by AWS on or after December 7, 2017. When you do this, the option to enable
automatic updates of the agent is selected by default in the Image Assistant. We recommend
that you leave this option selected so that any new image builder or fleet instance that is
launched from your image always uses the latest version of the agent. For more information,
see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

The following table describes the latest updates that are available in released versions
of the WorkSpaces Applications agent for Windows instances.
