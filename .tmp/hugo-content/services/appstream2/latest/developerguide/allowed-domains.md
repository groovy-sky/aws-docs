# Allowed Domains

For WorkSpaces Applications users to access streaming instances, you must allow the following
domain on the network from which users initiate access to the streaming
instances.

- Streaming Gateway: \*.amazonappstream.com

###### Note

Instead of using a wildcard to allowlist all streaming gateways, you
can create a VPC endpoint and allowlist only that specific endpoint. For
more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Interface VPC Endpoints](interface-vpc-endpoints.md).

For IPV4 support, you must allow the following domain on the network from which users initiate access to the streaming instances. It is region based and follows the following format: `*.streaming.{region}.appstream2.amazonappstream.com` and `*.dcv-streaming.{region}.appstream2.amazonappstream.com`. If its a FIPS compliant region, it will also need another endpoint with the format `*.streaming.{region}.appstream2-fips.amazonappstream.com` and `*.dcv-streaming.{region}.appstream2-fips.amazonappstream.com`. Check table below.

For IPV6 support, you must allow the following domain on the network from which users initiate access to the streaming instances. It is region based and follows the following format: `*.streaming.appstream2.{region}.on.aws` and `*.dcv-streaming.appstream2.{region}.on.aws`. If its a FIPS compliant region, it will also need another endpoint with the format `*.streaming.appstream2-fips.{region}.on.aws` and `*.dcv-streaming.appstream2-fips.{region}.on.aws`. Check table below.

In order to use IPV6 address your base images must be updated to the images published on September 05, 2025 or later. For more information check [managed image updates](keep-image-updated-managed-image-updates.md).

###### Note

If your users use a network proxy to access streaming instances, disable any
proxy caching for the user auth domains in the table and the session gateway,
\*.amazonappstream.com.

AWS publishes its current IP address ranges, including the ranges that the
Session Gateway and CloudFront domains may resolve to, in JSON format. For
information about how to download the .json file and view the current ranges, see
[AWS IP Address Ranges](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.md) in
the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Or, if you are using AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, you
can access the same information by using the
`Get-AWSPublicIpAddressRange` cmdlet. For more information, see
[Querying the Public IP Address Ranges for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/querying-the-public-ip-address-ranges-for-aws).

For WorkSpaces Applications users that are accessing Elastic fleets, you must allow access to the
domain for the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket that contains the application icon.

###### Note

If your S3 bucket has a “.” character in the name, the domain used is
https://s3.<AWS Region>.amazonaws.com. If your S3 bucket does not have a “.”
character in the name, the domain used is https://< `bucket
                        name` >.s3.< `AWS Region` >.amazonaws.com.
