# VPC Setup Recommendations

When you create a fleet, or launch an image builder or app block builder, you
specify the VPC and one or more subnets to use. You can provide additional access
control to your VPC by specifying security groups.

The following recommendations can help you configure your VPC more
effectively and securely. In addition, they can help you configure an environment
that supports effective fleet scaling. With effective fleet scaling, you can meet current and
anticipated WorkSpaces Applications user demand, while avoiding unecessary resource usage and associated costs.

**Overall VPC Configuration**

- Make sure that your VPC configuration can support your fleet scaling needs.

As you develop your plan for fleet scaling, keep in mind that one user
requires one fleet instance. Therefore, the size of your fleet determines
the number of users who can stream concurrently. For this reason, for each
[instance type](instance-types.md) that you plan to
use, make sure that the number of fleet instances that your VPC can support
is greater than the number of anticipated concurrent users for the same
instance type.

- Make sure that your WorkSpaces Applications account quotas (also referred to as limits) are sufficient to
support your anticipated demand. To request a quota increase, you can use
the Service Quotas console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas). For information about
default WorkSpaces Applications quotas, see [Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Service Quotas](limits.md).

- If you plan to provide your streaming instances (fleet instances, app block builder, or image
builders) with access to the internet, we recommend that you configure a VPC
with two private subnets for your streaming instances and a NAT gateway in a
public subnet.

The NAT gateway lets the streaming instances in your private subnets
connect to the internet or other AWS services. However, it prevents the
internet from initiating a connection with those instances. In addition,
unlike configurations that use the **Default Internet**
**Access** option for enabling internet access, the NAT
configuration supports more than 100 fleet instances. For more information,
see [Configure a VPC with Private Subnets and a NAT Gateway](managing-network-internet-nat-gateway.md).

**Elastic Network Interfaces**

- WorkSpaces Applications creates as many [elastic network\
interfaces](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-elasticnetworkinterfaces.md) (network interfaces) as the maximum desired capacity
of your fleet. By default, the limit for network interfaces per Region is 5000.

When planning capacity for very large deployments, for example, thousands
of streaming instances, consider the number of EC2 instances that are also
used in the same Region.

**Subnets**

- If you are configuring more than one private subnet for your VPC,
configure each in a different Availability Zone. Doing so increases fault
tolerance and can help prevent insufficient capacity errors. If you use two
subnets in the same AZ, you might run out of IP addresses, because WorkSpaces Applications
will not use the second subnet.

- Make sure that the network resources required for your applications are accessible through
both of your private subnets.

- Configure each of your private subnets with a subnet mask that allows for enough client IP
addresses to account for the maximum number of expected
concurrent users. In addition, allow for additional IP addresses
to account for anticipated growth. For more information, see [VPC and Subnet Sizing for IPv4](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-subnets.md#vpc-sizing-ipv4).

- If you are using a VPC with NAT, configure at least one public subnet with a NAT Gateway for internet access, preferably two. Configure the public subnets in the same Availability Zones where your private subnets reside.

To enhance fault tolerance and reduce the chance of insufficient capacity errors for large WorkSpaces Applications fleet deployments, consider extending your VPC configuration into a third Availability Zone. Include a private subnet, public subnet, and NAT gateway in this additional Availability Zone.

- If you enable auto assign IPV6 option for your subnet then Elastic Network Interface for your instances will be auto assigned with a global IPV6 address. For more information, see [modify-subnet](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-subnet-attribute.md).

- Enabling default internet access is only applicable for IPV4 addresses in IPv4 only or dual-stack subnets. To allow internet access for IPV6 addresses add an internet gateway or egress only gateway. For more information, see [egress-only-internet-gateway](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/egress-only-internet-gateway.md).

###### Note

By default IPV6 addresses are globally addressable. If your subnet has an internet gateway and appropriate subnet groups and acl allowing IPV6 traffic rules your streaming instances can be connected to the internet with IPV6 address.

**Security Groups**

- Use security groups to provide additional access control to your VPC.

Security groups that belong to your VPC let you control the
network traffic between WorkSpaces Applications streaming instances and network resources
required by applications. These resources may include other AWS services
such as Amazon RDS or Amazon FSx, license servers, database servers, file servers, and application
servers.

- Make sure that the security groups provide access to the network resources that your applications require.

For more information about configuring security groups for WorkSpaces Applications, see [Security Groups in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](managing-network-security-groups.md). For general information about security groups, see [Security Groups for Your VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-securitygroups.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
