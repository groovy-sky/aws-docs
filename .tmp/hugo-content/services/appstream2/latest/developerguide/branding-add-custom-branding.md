# Adding Your Custom Branding to Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

To customize WorkSpaces Applications with your organizational branding, use the WorkSpaces Applications console to
select the stack to customize, and then add your branding.

If you want to choose your organization logo or favicon from your Amazon S3 buckets, make
sure that your Amazon S3 bucket content is not encrypted using keys that you manage
(Customer Managed Keys). Amazon S3 buckets configured to use server-side encryption with
customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) are not supported for organization logo and
favicon. If you require encryption at rest for your Amazon S3 objects, server-side encryption
with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) is an option for organization logo and
favicon.
