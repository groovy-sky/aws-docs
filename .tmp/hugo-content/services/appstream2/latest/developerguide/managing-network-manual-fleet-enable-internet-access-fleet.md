# Enable Internet Access for Your Fleet in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

You can enable internet access either when you create the fleet or later.

###### To enable internet access at fleet creation

1. Complete the steps in [Create a Fleet in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-create.md) up to
    **Step 4: Configure Network**.

2. Choose a VPC with a NAT gateway.

3. If the subnet fields are empty, select a private subnet for
    **Subnet 1** and, optionally, another private subnet
    for **Subnet 2**. If you don't already have a private subnet in your
    VPC, you may need to create a second private subnet.

4. Continue with the steps in [Create a Fleet in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-create.md).

###### To enable internet access after fleet creation by using a NAT gateway

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Fleets**.

2. Select a fleet and verify that the state is
    **Stopped**.

3. Choose **Fleet Details**, **Edit**, and
    choose a VPC with a NAT gateway.

4. Choose a private subnet for **Subnet 1** and, optionally,
    another private subnet for **Subnet 2**. If you don't already have a private subnet in your
    VPC, you may need to [create a second private subnet](create-configure-new-vpc-with-private-public-subnets-nat.md#vpc-with-private-and-public-subnets-add-private-subnet-nat).

5. Choose **Update**.

You can test your internet connectivity by starting your fleet, and then
connecting to your streaming instance and browsing to the internet.
