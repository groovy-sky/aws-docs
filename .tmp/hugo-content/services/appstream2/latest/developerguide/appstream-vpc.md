# Configure a VPC for WorkSpaces Applications

When you set up WorkSpaces Applications, you must specify the virtual private cloud (VPC) and at least one subnet in which to launch your fleet instances and image builders. A VPC is a virtual network in your own logically isolated area within the
Amazon Web Services Cloud. A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.

When you configure your VPC for WorkSpaces Applications, you can specify either public or
private subnets, or a mix of both types of subnets. A public subnet has direct access to
the internet through an internet gateway. A private subnet, which doesn't have a route
to an internet gateway, requires a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway or NAT
instance to provide access to the internet.
