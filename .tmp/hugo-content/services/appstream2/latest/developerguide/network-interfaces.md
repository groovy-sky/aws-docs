# Network Interfaces in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

Each WorkSpaces Applications streaming instance has the following network interfaces:

- The customer network interface provides connectivity to the resources
within your VPC, as well as the internet, and is used to join the streaming
instance to your directory.

- The management network interface is connected to a secure WorkSpaces Applications
management network. It is used for interactive streaming of the streaming
instance to a user's device, and to allow WorkSpaces Applications to manage the
streaming instance.

WorkSpaces Applications selects the IP address for the management network interface from the following
private IP address range: 198.19.0.0/16. Do not use this range for your VPC CIDR or
peer your VPC with another VPC with this range, as this might create a conflict and
cause streaming instances to be unreachable. Also, do not modify or delete any of
the network interfaces attached to a streaming instance, as this might also cause
the streaming instance to become unreachable.
