# Enable Cross-account PCA Sharing

Private CA (PCA) cross-account sharing offers the ability to grant permissions for
other accounts to use a centralized CA. The CA can generate and issue certificates
by using [AWS Resource Access\
Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/ram) (RAM) to manage the permissions. This removes the need for a
Private CA in every account. Private CA cross-account sharing can be used with
WorkSpaces Applications certificate-based Authentication (CBA) within the same AWS Region.

To use a shared Private CA resource with WorkSpaces Applications CBA, complete the following
steps:

1. Configure the Private CA for CBA in a centralized AWS account. For more
    information, see [Certificate-Based Authentication](certificate-based-authentication.md).

2. Share the Private CA with the resource AWS accounts where WorkSpaces Applications
    resources utilize CBA. To do this, follow the steps in [How to use AWS RAM to share your ACM Private CA cross-account](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-aws-ram-to-share-your-acm-private-ca-cross-account).
    You do not need to complete step 3 to create a certificate. You can either
    share the Private CA with individual AWS accounts, or share through
    AWS Organizations. If you share with individual accounts, you need to accept the
    shared Private CA in your resource account by using the AWS Resource Access Manager console or
    APIs.

When configuring the share, confirm that the AWS Resource Access Manager resource share for
    the Private CA in the resource account is using the
    `AWSRAMBlankEndEntityCertificateAPICSRPassthroughIssuanceCertificateAuthority`
    managed permission template. This template aligns with the PCA template used
    by the WorkSpaces Applications service role when issuing CBA certificates.

3. After the share is successful, view the shared Private CA by using the
    Private CA console in the resource account.

4. Use the API or CLI to associate the Private CA ARN with CBA in your WorkSpaces Applications
    Directory Config. At this time, the WorkSpaces Applications console does not support
    selection of shared Private CA ARNs. The following are example CLI
    commands:

`aws appstream update-directory-config --directory-name <value>
                               --certificate-based-auth-properties
                               Status=<value>,CertificateAuthorityArn=<value>`
