# Create an App Block Builder

You can use app block builder instance to create your application package for WorkSpaces Applications
Elastic fleets.

###### To create an app block builder

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home).

2. Choose **Applications Manager** in the left navigation pane,
    then choose the **App block builders** tab and **Create**
**app block builder**.

3. For **Step 1: Configure app block builder**, configure the
    app block builder by providing the following details:

- **Name**: Type a unique name identifier for the app block builder.

- **Display name (optional)**: Type a name to display for the app block builder
(maximum of 100 characters).

- **Operating system**: Select an operating system for
your application. This must align with the operating system that you are
going to select for you elastic fleet, which your end users will use to
stream the application.

- **IAM role (Optional)**: When you apply an IAM
role from your account to an WorkSpaces Applications app block builder, you can make
AWS API requests from the app block builder instance without manually
managing AWS credentials. To apply an IAM role to the app block
builder, do either of the following:

- To use an existing IAM role in your Amazon Web Services account,
choose the role that you want to use from the **IAM**
**role** list. The role must must be accessible from
the image builder. For more information, see [Configuring an Existing IAM Role to Use With WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Instances](configuring-existing-iam-role-to-use-with-streaming-instances.md).

- To create a new IAM role, choose **Create new IAM**
**role** and follow the steps in [How to Create an IAM Role to Use With WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Instances](how-to-create-iam-role-to-use-with-streaming-instances.md).

- **Instance Type**: Select the instance type for the
app block builder. Choose a type that matches the performance
requirements of the applications that you plan to install.

- **Tags (optional)**: Choose **Add Tag**, and type the key and value
for the tag. To add more tags, repeat this step. For more
information, see [Tagging Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Resources](tagging-basic.md).

4. Choose **Next**.

5. For **Step 2: Configure Network**, do the following:

- To add internet access for the app block builder in a VPC with a public subnet, choose
**Default Internet Access**. If you are providing
internet access by using a NAT gateway, leave **Default Internet**
**Access** unselected. For more information, see [Internet Access](internet-access.md).

- For **VPC** and **Subnet 1**, choose a VPC and at least two
subnets. For increased fault tolerance, we recommend that you choose
three subnets in different Availability Zones. For more information, see
[Configure a VPC with Private Subnets and a NAT Gateway](managing-network-internet-nat-gateway.md).

If you don't have your own VPC and subnet, you can use the [default VPC](default-vpc-with-public-subnet.md) or create your own. To create your own, choose the **Create a new**
**VPC** and **Create new subnet** links to
create them. Choosing these links opens the Amazon VPC console. After you
create your VPC and subnets, return to the WorkSpaces Applications console and choose the refresh icon to the left of the **Create a new**
**VPC** and **Create new subnet** links to display them in the list. For more information, see [Configure a VPC for WorkSpaces Applications](appstream-vpc.md).

- For **Security group(s)**, choose up to five security groups to associate
with this image builder. If you don't have your own security group and
you don't want to use the default security group, choose the
**Create new security group** link to create one.
After you create your subnets in the Amazon VPC console, return to the WorkSpaces Applications
console and choose the refresh icon to the left of the **Create**
**new security group** link to display them in the list. For
more information, see [Security Groups in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](managing-network-security-groups.md).

- For **VPC Endpoints (Optional)**, you can create an
interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) in your virtual private
cloud (VPC). To create the interface endpoint, choose **Create**
**VPC Endpoint**. Selecting this link opens the VPC console.
To finish creating the endpoint, follow steps 3 through 6 in [Tutorial: Creating and Streaming from Interface VPC Endpoints](creating-streaming-from-interface-vpc-endpoints.md). After
you create the interface endpoint, you can use it to keep streaming
traffic within your VPC.

6. Choose **Next**.

7. Choose **Review** and confirm the details for the app block
    builder. To change the configuration for any section, choose
    **Edit** and make the needed changes.

8. After you finish reviewing the configuration details, choose **Create app block**
**builder**.

###### Note

If an error message notifies you that you don't have sufficient limits (quotas) to create the image builder, submit a limit increase request through the Service Quotas console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas). For more information, see [Requesting a quota increase](../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.md) in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.
