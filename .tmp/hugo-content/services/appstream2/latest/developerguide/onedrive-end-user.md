# Use OneDrive for Business

###### Note

OneDrive for Business is currently not supported for Linux-based streaming
instances.

OneDrive for Business is currently not supported for Asia Pacific (Malaysia), Europe (Milan), Europe (Spain), and Israel (Tel Aviv) AWS Regions.

If your WorkSpaces Applications administrator has enabled this file storage option, you can add
your OneDrive account to WorkSpaces Applications. After you add your account and sign in to an WorkSpaces Applications
streaming session, you can do the following in OneDrive:

- Open and edit files and folders that you store in OneDrive. Other users
cannot access your content unless you choose to share it.

- Upload and download files between your local computer and OneDrive. Any
changes that you make to your files and folders in OneDrive during a
streaming session are backed up and synchronized automatically. They are
available to you when you sign in to your OneDrive account and access
OneDrive outside of your streaming session.

- When you are working in an application, you can access your files and
folders that are stored in OneDrive. Choose **File**,
**Open** from the application interface and browse to
the file or folder that you want to open. To save your changes in a file to
OneDrive, choose **File**, **Save** from
the application and browse to the location in OneDrive where you want to
save the file.

- You can also access OneDrive by choosing **My Files**
from the top left of the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar.
