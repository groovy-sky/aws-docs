# Prerequisites

Complete the following steps before you use certificate-based
authentication.

1. Set up a domain-joined fleet and configure SAML 2.0. Ensure that you use
    the `username@domain.com` `userPrincipalName` format for the SAML\_Subject
    `NameID`. For more information, see [Step 5: Create Assertions for the SAML Authentication Response](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md#external-identity-providers-create-assertions).

###### Note

Don't enable **Smart card sign in for Active**
**Directory** in your stack if you want to use
certificate-based authentication. For more information, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-usb-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

2. Use WorkSpaces Applications agent version 10-13-2022 or later with your image. For more
    information, see [Keep Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Image Up-to-Date](keep-image-updated.md).

3. Configure the `ObjectSid` attribute in your SAML assertion. You
    can use this attribute to perform strong mapping with the Active Directory
    user. Certificate-based authentication fails if the `ObjectSid`
    attribute doesn't match the Active Directory security identifier (SID) for
    the user specified in the SAML\_Subject `NameID`. For more
    information, see [Step 5: Create Assertions for the SAML Authentication Response](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md#external-identity-providers-create-assertions). The
    `ObjectSid` is mandatory for certificate-based authentication
    after September 10, 2025. For more information, see [KB5014754: Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain\
    controllers](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16).

4. Add the `sts:TagSession` permission to the IAM role trust
    policy that you use with your SAML 2.0 configuration. For more information,
    see [Passing session\
    tags in AWS STS](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-session-tags.md). This permission is required to use
    certificate-based authentication. For more information, see [Step 2: Create a SAML 2.0 Federation IAM Role](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md#external-identity-providers-grantperms).

5. Create a private certificate authority (CA) using AWS Private CA, if you
    don't have one configured with your Active Directory. AWS Private CA is
    required to use certificate-based authentication. For more information, see
    [Planning your AWS Private CA\
    deployment](../../../privateca/latest/userguide/pcaplanning.md). The following AWS Private CA settings
    are common for many certificate-based authentication use cases:

- CA type options

- Short-lived certificate CA usage
mode – Recommended if the CA only issues
end user certificates for certificate-based
authentication.

- Single level hierarchy with a Root
CA – Choose a subordinate CA to
integrate it with an existing CA hierarchy.

- Key algorithm options – RSA
2048

- Subject distinguished name options
– Use the most appropriate options to identify this CA in
your Active Directory Trusted Root Certification Authorities
store.

- Certificate revocation options
– CRL distribution

###### Note

Certificate-based authentication requires an online CRL
distribution point accessible from both the WorkSpaces Applications fleet
instance and the domain controller. This requires
unauthenticated access to the Amazon S3 bucket configured for AWS
Private CA CRL entries, or a CloudFront distribution with access to
the Amazon S3 bucket if it blocks public access. For more information
about these options, see [Planning a certificate revocation list (CRL)](../../../privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.md).

6. Tag your private CA with a key entitled `euc-private-ca` to
    designate the CA for use with WorkSpaces Applications certificate-based authentication. This
    key doesn't require a value. For more information, see [Managing tags for your private CA](../../../privateca/latest/userguide/pcacatagging.md). For more information about
    the AWS managed policies used with WorkSpaces Applications to grant permissions to
    resources in your AWS account, see [AWS Managed Policies Required to Access WorkSpaces Applications Resources](managed-policies-required-to-access-appstream-resources.md).

7. Certificate-based authentication uses virtual smart cards to log on. For
    more information, see [Guidelines for enabling smart card logon with third-party certification\
    authorities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/enabling-smart-card-logon-third-party-certification-authorities). Follow these steps:

1. Configure domain controllers with a domain controller certificate
    to authenticate smart card users. If you have an Active Directory
    Certificate Services enterprise CA configured in your Active
    Directory, it automatically enrolls domain controllers with
    certificates that enable smart card logon. If you don't have Active
    Directory Certificate Services, see [Requirements for domain controller certificates from a\
    third-party CA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/requirements-domain-controller). AWS recommends Active Directory
    enterprise certificate authorities to automatically manage
    enrollment for domain controller certificates.

###### Note

If you use AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can configure
Certificate Services on an Amazon EC2 instance that satisfies the
requirement for domain controller certificates. See [Deploy Active Directory to a new Amazon Virtual Private\
Cloud](../../../launchwizard/latest/userguide/launch-wizard-ad-deploying-new-vpc.md) for example deployments of AWS Managed
Microsoft AD configured with Active Directory Certificate
Services.

With AWS Managed Microsoft AD and Active Directory
Certificate Services, you must also create outbound rules from
the controller's VPC security group to the Amazon EC2 instance
running Certificate Services. You must provide the security
group access to TCP port 135, and ports 49152 through 65535 to
enable certificate auto-enrollment. The Amazon EC2 instance must also
allow inbound access on these same ports from domain instances,
including domain controllers. For more information on locating
the security group for AWS Managed Microsoft AD, see [Configure your VPC subnets and security\
groups](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms-ad-tutorial-setup-trust-prepare-mad.md#tutorial_setup_trust_open_vpc).

2. On the AWS Private CA console, or with the SDK or CLI, export
    the private CA certificate. For more information, see [Exporting a\
    private certificate](../../../acm/latest/userguide/export-private.md).

3. Publish the private CA to Active Directory. Log on to a domain
    controller or a domain-joined machine. Copy the private CA
    certificate to any
    `<path>\<file>`
    and run the following commands as a domain administrator. You can
    also use Group Policy and the Microsoft PKI Health Tool (PKIView) to
    publish the CA. For more information, see [Configuration instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/enabling-smart-card-logon-third-party-certification-authorities).

```nohighlight

certutil -dspublish -f <path>\<file> RootCA
```

```nohighlight

certutil -dspublish -f <path>\<file> NTAuthCA
```

Make sure that the commands complete successfully, then remove the
    private CA certificate file. Depending on your Active Directory
    replication settings, it can take several minutes for the CA to
    publish to your domain controllers and WorkSpaces Applications fleet
    instances.

###### Note

Active Directory must distribute the CA to the Trusted Root
Certification Authorities and Enterprise NTAuth stores
automatically for WorkSpaces Applications fleet instances when they join the
domain.

For Windows operating systems, the distribution of the CA (Certificate Authority)
happens automatically. However, for Rocky Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you
must download the root CA certificate(s) from the CA used by your WorkSpaces Applications Directory
Config. If your KDC root CA certificate(s) are different, you must also download
those. Before using certificate-based authentication, it's necessary to import these
certificates onto an image or snapshot.

On the image, there should be a file named
/ `etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem`. It should look like the
following:

```

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Base64-encoded certificate chain from ACM Private CA
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Base64-encoded certificate body from ACM private CA
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Base64-encoded root CA KDC certificate chain
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

###### Note

When copying an image across regions or accounts, or re-associating an image with
a new Active Directory, this file will need to be reconfigured with the relevant
certificates on an image builder and snapshotted again before use.

Below are instructions for downloading the root CA certificates:

1. On the image builder, create a file named
    `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem`.

2. Open the [AWS Private CA\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca).

3. Choose the private certificate used with your WorkSpaces Applications Directory
    Config.

4. Choose the **CA certificate** tab.

5. Copy the certificate chain and certificate body to
    `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem` on the image
    builder.

If the root CA certificates used by the KDCs are different from the root CA
certificate used by your WorkSpaces Applications Directory Config, follow these example steps to download
them:

01. Connect to a Windows instance joined to the same domain as your image
     builder.

02. Open `certlm.msc`.

03. In the left pane, choose **Trusted Root Certificate**
    **Authorities**, and then choose
     **Certificates**..

04. For each root CA certificate, open the context (right-click) menu.

05. Choose **All Tasks**, choose **Export**
     to open the Certificate Export Wizard, and then choose
     **Next**.

06. Choose **Base64-encoded X.509 (.CER)**, and choose
     **Next**.

07. Choose **Browse**, enter a file name, and choose
     **Next**.

08. Choose **Finish**.

09. Open the exported certificate in a text editor.

10. Copy the contents of the file to
     `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem` on the image
     builder.
