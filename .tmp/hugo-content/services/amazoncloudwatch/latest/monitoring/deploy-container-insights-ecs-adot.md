# Setting up Container Insights on Amazon ECS using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

Use this section if you want to use AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry to set up CloudWatch
Container Insights on an Amazon ECS cluster. For more information about AWS Distro for Open
Telemetry, see [AWS Distro for\
OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/otel).

These steps assume that you already have a cluster running Amazon ECS. For more information
about using AWS Distro for Open Telemetry with Amazon ECS and setting up an Amazon ECS cluster for
this purpose, see [Setting up AWS\
Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector in Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/setup/ecs).

## Step 1: Create a task role

The first step is creating a task role in the cluster that the AWS OpenTelemetry
Collector will use.

###### To create a task role for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

01. Open the IAM console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies** and then choose
     **Create policy**.

03. Choose the **JSON** tab and copy in the following
     policy:
    JSON

    ```json

                "Action": [
                    "logs:PutLogEvents",
                    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                    "logs:CreateLogStream",
                    "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                    "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                    "ssm:GetParameters"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }

    ```

04. Choose **Review policy**.

05. For name, enter `AWSDistroOpenTelemetryPolicy`, and then
     choose **Create policy**.

06. In the left navigation pane, choose **Roles** and then choose
     **Create role**.

07. In the list of services, choose **Elastic Container**
    **Service**.

08. Lower on the page, choose **Elastic Container Service Task**

5. Configure your containers, and then choose **Next**.

6. Under **Metrics and logging**, select **Use metric**
**collection**.

7. Choose **Next**.

8. Choose **Create**.

## Step 4: Run the task

The final step is running the task that you've created.

###### To run the task for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

1. Open the console at
