# Install the CloudWatch agent using AWS Systems Manager

Using AWS Systems Manager makes it easier to install the CloudWatch agent on a fleet of Amazon EC2
instances. You can download the agent into one server and create your CloudWatch agent
configuration file for all servers in the fleet. Then you can use Systems Manager to install the agent
on the other servers, using the configuration file that you created. Use the following
topics to install and run the CloudWatch agent using AWS Systems Manager.

## Install or update the SSM Agent

On an Amazon EC2 instance, the CloudWatch agent requires that the instance is running version
2.2.93.0 or later of the SSM Agent. Before you install the CloudWatch agent, update or install
SSM Agent on the instance if you haven't already done so.

For information about installing or updating SSM Agent on an instance running Linux,
see [Installing and\
Configuring SSM Agent on Linux Instances](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/manually-install-ssm-agent-linux.md) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

For information about installing or updating the SSM Agent, see [Working with SSM Agent](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.md) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

## Verify Systems Manager prerequisites

Before you use Systems Manager Run Command to install and configure the CloudWatch agent, verify that
your instances meet the minimum Systems Manager requirements. For more information, see [Systems Manager\
Prerequisites](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.md#systems-manager-prereqs) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

## Verify internet access

Your Amazon EC2 instances must be able to connect to CloudWatch endpoints. This can be by
Internet Gateway, NAT gateway, or CloudWatch Interface VPC endpoints. For more information about
how to configure internet access, see [Internet Gateways](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-internet-gateway.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

The endpoints and ports to configure on your proxy are as follows:

- If you're using the agent to collect metrics, you must allow list the CloudWatch
endpoints for the appropriate Regions. These endpoints are listed in [Amazon CloudWatch](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#cw_region) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

- If you're using the agent to collect logs, you must allow list the CloudWatch Logs endpoints
for the appropriate Regions. These endpoints are listed in [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#cwl_region) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

- If you're using Systems Manager to install the agent or Parameter Store to store your configuration
file, you must allow list the Systems Manager endpoints for the appropriate Regions. These
endpoints are listed in [AWS\
Systems Manager](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#ssm_region) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

## Download the CloudWatch agent package to your first instance

Use the following steps to download the CloudWatch agent package using Systems Manager.

     **AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage**.

05. In the **Targets** area, choose the instance to install the CloudWatch
     agent on. If you don't see a specific instance, it might not be configured as a
     managed instance for use with Systems Manager. For more information, see [Setting Up AWS Systems Manager for\
     Hybrid Environments](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.md) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

06. In the **Action** list, choose
     **Install**.

07. In the **Name** field, enter
     `AmazonCloudWatchAgent`.

08. Keep **Version** set to **latest** to install
     the latest version of the agent.

09. Choose **Run**.

10. Optionally, in the **Targets and outputs** areas, select the
     button next to an instance name and choose **View output**. Systems Manager
     should show that the agent was successfully installed.

## Create and modify the agent configuration file

After you have downloaded the CloudWatch agent, you must create the configuration file
before you start the agent on any servers.

If you're going to save your agent configuration file in the
Systems Manager Parameter Store, you must use an EC2 instance to save to the Parameter Store. Additionally, you
must first attach to that instance the `CloudWatchAgentAdminRole` IAM role.
For more information about attaching roles, see [Attaching an IAM\
Role to an Instance](../../../ec2/latest/windowsguide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md#attach-iam-role) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

For more information about creating the CloudWatch agent configuration file, see [Create the CloudWatch agent configuration file](create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file.md).

## Install and start the CloudWatch agent on additional EC2 instances using your agent configuration

After you have a CloudWatch agent configuration saved in Parameter Store, you can use it when you
install the agent on other servers.

For each of these servers, follow the steps listed previously in this section to
verify the Systems Manager prerequisites, the version of the SSM Agent, and internet access. Then use
the following instructions to install the CloudWatch agent on the additional instances, using
the CloudWatch agent configuration file that you have created.

**Step 1: Download and install the CloudWatch agent**

To be able to send the CloudWatch data to a different Region, make sure that the IAM role
that you attached to this instance has permissions to write the CloudWatch data in that
Region.

Following is an example of using the `aws configure` command to create a
named profile for the CloudWatch agent. This example assumes that you are using the default
profile name of `AmazonCloudWatchAgent`.

###### To create the AmazonCloudWatchAgent profile for the CloudWatch agent

- On Linux servers, type the following command and follow the prompts:

```

sudo aws configure --profile AmazonCloudWatchAgent
```

On Windows Server, open PowerShell as an administrator, type the following command
and follow the prompts.

```

aws configure --profile AmazonCloudWatchAgent
```

## Install the CloudWatch agent on additional EC2 instances using your agent configuration

After you have a CloudWatch agent configuration saved in Parameter Store, you can use it when you
install the agent on other servers.

For each of these servers, follow the steps listed previously in this section to
verify the Systems Manager prerequisites, the version of the SSM Agent, and internet access. Then use
the following instructions to install the CloudWatch agent on the additional instances, using
the CloudWatch agent configuration file that you have created.

**Step 1: Download and install the CloudWatch agent**

You need to install the agent on each server where you will run the
agent. The CloudWatch agent is available as a package in Amazon Linux 2023 and Amazon Linux 2. If you are
using this operating system, you can use Systems Manager to install the package by using the
following steps.

###### Note

You must also make sure that the IAM role attached to the instance has the
**CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy** attached. For more information, see
[Prerequisites](prerequisites.md) ﻿.

## (Optional) Modify the common configuration and named profile for CloudWatch agent

The CloudWatch agent includes a configuration file called
`common-config.toml`. You can use this file to optionally specify
proxy and Region information.

On a server running Linux, this file is in the
`/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc` directory. On a server running Windows
Server, this file is in the `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent`
directory.

The default `common-config.toml` is as follows:

```

# This common-config is used to configure items used for both ssm and cloudwatch access

## Configuration for shared credential.
## Default credential strategy will be used if it is absent here:
##            Instance role is used for EC2 case by default.
##            AmazonCloudWatchAgent profile is used for onPremise case by default.
# [credentials]
#    shared_credential_profile = "{profile_name}"
#    shared_credential_file= "{file_name}"

## Configuration for proxy.
## System-wide environment-variable will be read if it is absent here.
## i.e. HTTP_PROXY/http_proxy; HTTPS_PROXY/https_proxy; NO_PROXY/no_proxy
## Note: system-wide environment-variable is not accessible when using ssm run-command.
## Absent in both here and environment-variable means no proxy will be used.
# [proxy]
#    http_proxy = "{http_url}"
#    https_proxy = "{https_url}"
#    no_proxy = "{domain}"
```

All lines are commented out initially. To set the credential profile or proxy
settings, remove the `#` from that line and specify a value. You can edit this
file manually, or by using the `RunShellScript` Run Command in Systems Manager:

- `shared_credential_profile` – For on-premises servers, this line
specifies the IAM user credential profile to use to send data to CloudWatch. If you keep
this line commented out, `AmazonCloudWatchAgent` is used.

On an EC2 instance, you can use this line to have the CloudWatch agent send data from
this instance to CloudWatch in a different AWS Region. To do so, specify a named profile
that includes a `region` field specifying the name of the Region to send
to.

If you specify a `shared_credential_profile`, you must also remove the
`#` from the beginning of the `[credentials]` line.

- `shared_credential_file` – To have the agent look for
credentials in a file located in a path other than the default path, specify that
complete path and file name here. The default path is `/root/.aws` on Linux
and is `C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.aws` on Windows Server.

The first example below shows the syntax of a valid
`shared_credential_file` line for Linux servers, and the second example
is valid for Windows Server. On Windows Server, you must escape the \
characters.

```nohighlight

shared_credential_file= "/usr/username/credentials"
```

```nohighlight

shared_credential_file= "C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\.aws\\credentials"
```

If you specify a `shared_credential_file`, you must also remove the
`#` from the beginning of the `[credentials]` line.

- Proxy settings – If your servers use HTTP or HTTPS proxies to contact AWS
services, specify those proxies in the `http_proxy` and
`https_proxy` fields. If there are URLs that should be excluded from
proxying, specify them in the `no_proxy` field, separated by commas.
