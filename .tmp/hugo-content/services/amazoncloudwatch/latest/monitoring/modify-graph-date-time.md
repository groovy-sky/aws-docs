# Modify the time range or time zone format for a graph

This section describes how you can modify the date, time, and time zone format on a
CloudWatch metrics graph. It also describes how you can zoom in on a graph to apply a specific
time range. For information about creating a graph, see [Graph a metric](graph-a-metric.md).

###### Note

If the time range of a dashboard is shorter than the period used for a graph on the
dashboard, the following happens:

- The graph is modified to display the amount of data corresponding one complete
period for that widget, even though this is longer than the dashboard time range. This
ensures that there is at least one data point on the graph.

- The start time of the period for this data point is adjusted backwards to ensure
that at least one data point can be displayed.

###### To specify a relative time range for a graph

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**, and then
    choose **All metrics**. In the upper right corner of the
    screen, you can select one of the predefined time ranges, which span from 1 hour
    to 1 week ( **1h**, **3h**,
    **12h**, **1d**, **3d**, or
    **1w**). Alternatively, you can choose
    **Custom** to set your own time range.

3. Choose **Custom**, and then select the
    **Relative** tab in the upper left corner of the box. You can
    specify a time range in **Minutes**,
