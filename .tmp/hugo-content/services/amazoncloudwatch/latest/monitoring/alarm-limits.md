# Limits

## General CloudWatch quotas

For information about general CloudWatch service quotas that apply to alarms, see [CloudWatch service quotas](cloudwatch-limits.md).

## Limits that apply to alarms based on Metrics Insights queries

When working with CloudWatch Metrics Insights alarms, be aware of these functional
limits:

- A default of 200 alarms using the Metrics Insights query per account per Region

- Only the latest 3 hours of data can be used for evaluating the alarm's conditions.
However, you can visualize up to two weeks of data on the alarm's detail page
graph

- Alarms evaluating multiple time series will limit the number of contributors in ALARM to 100

- Assuming the query retrieves 150 time series:

- If there are fewer than 100 contributors in ALARM (for example 95), the `StateReason`
will be "95 out of 150 time series evaluated to ALARM"

- If there are more than 100 contributors in ALARM (for example 105), the `StateReason`
will be "100+ time series evaluated to ALARM"

- Furthermore, if the volume of attributes is too large, the number of contributors in ALARM can be limited to less than 100.

- Metrics Insights limits on the maximum number of time series analyzed or returned
apply

- During alarm evaluation, the `EvaluationState` will be set to
`PARTIAL_DATA` for the following limits:

- If the Metrics Insights query returns more than 500 time series.

- If the Metrics Insights query matches more than 10,000 metrics.

quotas](cloudwatch-metrics-insights-limits.md).

## Limits that apply to alarms based on PromQL queries

When working with CloudWatch PromQL alarms, be aware of these functional
limits:

- Alarms evaluating multiple time series will limit the number of contributors in ALARM to 100

- If there are fewer than 100 contributors in ALARM (for example 95), the `StateReason`
will be "95 time series evaluated to ALARM"

- If there are more than 100 contributors in ALARM (for example 105), the `StateReason`
will be "100+ time series evaluated to ALARM"

- Furthermore, if the volume of attributes is too large, the number of contributors in ALARM can be limited to less than 100.

- PromQL query limits on the maximum number of time series analyzed or returned
apply

- During alarm evaluation, the `EvaluationState` will be set to
`PARTIAL_DATA` if the PromQL query returns more than 500 time series.

## Limits that apply to alarms based on connected data sources

- When CloudWatch evaluates an alarm, it does so every minute, even if the period for the
alarm is longer than one minute. For the alarm to work, the Lambda function must be
able to return a list of timestamps starting on any minute, not only on multiples of
the period length. These timestamps must be spaced one period length apart.

Therefore, if the data source queried by the Lambda can only return timestamps that
are multiples of the period length, the function should "re-sample" the fetched data
to match the timestamps expected by the `GetMetricData` request.

For example, an alarm with a five-minute period is evaluated every minute using
five-minute windows that shift by one minute each time. In this case:

- For the alarm evaluation at 12:15:00, CloudWatch expects data points with timestamps
of `12:00:00`, `12:05:00`, and `12:10:00`.

- Then for the alarm evaluation at 12:16:00, CloudWatch expects data points with
timestamps of `12:01:00`, `12:06:00`, and
`12:11:00`.

- When CloudWatch evaluates an alarm, any data points returned by the Lambda function that
don't align with the expected timestamps are dropped, and the alarm is evaluated using
the remaining expected data points. For example, when the alarm is evaluated at
`12:15:00` it expects data with timestamps of `12:00:00`,
`12:05:00`, and `12:10:00`. If it receives data with
timestamps of `12:00:00`, `12:05:00`, `12:06:00`, and
`12:10:00`, the data from `12:06:00` is dropped and CloudWatch
evaluates the alarm using the other timestamps.

Then for the next evaluation at `12:16:00`, it expects data with
timestamps of `12:01:00`, `12:06:00`, and `12:11:00`.
If it only has the data with timestamps of `12:00:00`,
`12:05:00`, and `12:10:00`, all of these data points are
ignored at 12:16:00 and the alarm transitions into the state according to how you
specified the alarm to treat missing data. For more information, see [Alarm evaluation](alarm-evaluation.md).

- We recommend that you create these alarms to take actions when they transition to
the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state, because several Lambda function failure use
cases will transition the alarm to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` regardless of the
way that you set the alarm to treat missing data.

- If the Lambda function returns an error:

- If there is a permission problem with calling the Lambda function, the alarm
begins having missing data transitions according to how you specified the alarm to
treat missing data when you created it.

- Any other error coming from the Lambda function causes the alarm to transition
to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`.

- If the metric requested by the Lambda function has some delay so that the last data
point is always missing, you should use a workaround. You can create an M out of N
alarm or increase the evaluation period of the alarm. For more information about M out
of N alarms, see [Alarm evaluation](alarm-evaluation.md).
