# Creating multi checks blueprint canary

Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics multi checks blueprint helps you create a Synthetics canary by
providing a simple JSON configuration. You can save costs by bundling up to 10 different
types of HTTP/DNS/SSL/TCP checks in a step-based sequential manner. Each check includes
assertions that provide basic verification against a check result.

Multi checks canaries are designed for simple use cases that require only basic checks
without a headless browser. For more complex use cases, review the other canary types that
Amazon CloudWatch
Synthetics provides.

## Prerequisites

- Must be using syn-nodejs-3.0+ in order to create a multi check canary

- When using Authentication and Secrets Manager configuration, you must ensure the
canary [ExecutionRoleArn](../../../../reference/amazonsynthetics/latest/apireference/api-createcanary.md) allows for the permissions to access these secrets

- When using Authentication for Sigv4, you must ensure the canary [ExecutionRoleArn](../../../../reference/amazonsynthetics/latest/apireference/api-createcanary.md) allows for the permissions to access the related role

## Limitations

- HTTP Response sizes cannot be greater than 1 MB

- Maximum of 10 defined variables.

- When using the JSON RFC, the Checks JSON may have duplicate fields provided
however only the last sequential field will be used

- In the AWS Management Console, a multi check canary will default to showing multi check step
metrics to readily identify the availability of each check. When checks are removed,
this
graph may still show the checks in the availability graph until the metric stops
being active for at least 3 hours

## Packaging structure, JSON schema, and configuration settings

The JSON Checks configuration that will be used for the canary must be named `
            blueprint-config.json`. The configuration must follow the [schema](https://github.com/aws-samples/synthetics-canary-local-debugging-sample/tree/main) and follow the instructions under [Writing a JSON configuration for Node.js multi Checks blueprint](cloudwatch-synthetics-writingcanary-multichecks.md).

Compress the `blueprint-config.json` into a ZIP file and provide it in
one of the following creation workflows. When there is a `synthetics.json`
configuration, then it is also compressed in the same ZIP file. The following is a zip
file example called `multi-checks.zip`.

```

multi-checks.zip
├── blueprint-config.json
└── synthetics.json

```

## Creating a multi check canary in AWS Management Console

1. Open the Amazon CloudWatch synthetics console.

2. Choose **Create Canary**.

3. Under **Use a blueprint**, choose **multi checks**
    .

Under **Configure Checks**, you will see two tabs, **Checks** and **Canary configuration**.

4. Select the runtime version **syn-nodejs-3.0** or later.

5. Follow the procedure under [Writing a JSON configuration for Node.js multi Checks blueprint](cloudwatch-synthetics-writingcanary-multichecks.md) to describe the
    check you want to perform. Alternatively, the console provides you a default JSON
    configuration that you can build on.

6. Choose **Create Canary**.

## Creating a multi check canary using AWS Synthetics APIs

Use the `CreateCanary` API and within the `Code` parameter,
provide the field/value `BlueprintTypes="multi-checks"` instead of `
            Handler`. When both `BlueprintTypes` and `Handler` are
specified, a `ValidationException` is displayed. The runtime version provided
must be `syn-nodejs-3.0` or later.

```

aws synthetics create-canary \
    --name my-multi-check-canary \
    --code ZipFile="ZIP_BLOB",BlueprintTypes="multi-checks" \
    --runtime-version syn-nodejs-3.0 \
    ...

// Or if you wanted to use S3 to provide your code.

aws synthetics create-canary \
    --name my-multi-check-canary \
    --code S3Bucket="my-code-bucket",S3Key="my-zip-code-key",BlueprintTypes="multi-checks" \
    ...

```

## Creating a multi check canary in CloudFormation

In your CloudFormation template for a multi check canary, within the `Code`
parameter, provide the field/value `BlueprintTypes="multi-checks"` instead of `
            Handler`. When both `BlueprintTypes` and `Handler` are
specified, a `ValidationException` is displayed. The runtime version provided
must be `syn-nodejs-3.0 or later`.

An example template:

```

SyntheticsCanary:
    Type: 'AWS::Synthetics::Canary'
    Properties:
      Name: MyCanary
      RuntimeVersion: syn-nodejs-3.0
      Schedule: {Expression: 'rate(5 minutes)', DurationInSeconds: 3600}
      ...
      Code:
        S3Bucket: "my-code-bucket"
        S3Key: "my-zip-code-key"
        BlueprintTypes: ["multi-checks"]
      ...

```

## Authentication configuration

When your canary makes HTTP requests to an authenticated endpoint, you can configure
the steps of your blueprint canary to use one of four
authentication types: Basic, API Key, OAuth Client Credentials, and SigV4. Rather than
setting up request headers yourself, you can specify an authentication type in
your blueprint definition, and Synthetics follows the specified authentication type to
populate the components of your HTTP request with the authentication information
provided.

You specify an authentication type in your blueprint step with the Authentication
section. You specify the authentication scheme you want to use, the properties required
for
your chosen authentication scheme, and Synthetics uses the information provided to
construct an authentication header for your HTTP request.

Since storing secrets (such as passwords or API keys) in plain text is a security
concern, Synthetics supports integration with AWS Secrets Manager. When you want to authenticate
an HTTP request
in a Synthetics blueprint canary, you can refer to the secret storing your
authentication information and Synthetics handles retrieving the secret and caching it
in your canary.
This approach provides secrets to Synthetics while keeping your secrets securely stored,
without specifying them in plain text in your blueprint configuration.

For more information about AWS Secrets Manager, see [What is AWS Secrets Manager?](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.md)

### Basic authentication

Synthetics implements the Basic HTTP authentication scheme defined in RFC 7617.
The process works as follows:

- A username and password pair is provided from the blueprint configuration.

- The user-pass is created by concatenating the username, a single colon (":")
character, and the password.

- The user-pass is UTF-8 encoded, then converted into a base64-encoded string.

- This base64-encoded user-pass is provided in the "Authorization" header with
the following format: Authorization: Basic {base64-encoded-user-pass}

For example, if the user agent wants to send the user-id "Aladdin" and password
"open sesame", it uses the following header field: Authorization: Basic
QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==

Example configuration:

```

"Authentication": {
    "type": "BASIC",
    "username": MY_USERNAME, // Required
    "password": MY_PASSWORD // Required
}

```

### API key authentication

You can provide an API key for authenticating your HTTP requests. When you use API
key authentication, your provided API key is put into the "X-API-Key" HTTP header.
If you have a custom resource that looks for API key headers in a header besides this
one, you can optionally specify a different header name to have Synthetics put the API
key into.

Example configuration:

```

"Authentication": {
    "type": "API_KEY",
    "apiKey": S0A1M2P3L4E5, // Required
    "header": X-Specific-Header // Optional, defaults to "X-API-Key"
}

```

### SigV4 authentication

AWS SigV4 (Signature Version 4) is the AWS signing protocol for adding
authentication information to AWS API requests. To make a
SigV4-authenticated request, you need to specify the region and service you are making
requests to, as well as an ARN (AWS Resource Name) identifying an IAM
role you want the canary to assume when making this SigV4 request. Synthetics assumes
the IAM role provided in the roleArn, and uses it to authenticate your AWS API
request.

Example configuration:

```

"Authentication": {
    "type": "SIGV4",
    "region": us-west-2, // Required
    "service": s3, // Required
    "roleArn": arn:AWS:iam:12345678912:role/SampleRole // Required
}

```

#### SigV4 considerations

For Synthetics to assume the role that you provided in the SigV4 authentication
section, the trust policy attached to that role must be configured to allow the
canary to assume the provided roleArn. The AWS principal you need to trust is the
role that your canary assumed through AWS STS. It takes the format `
                aws:sts::{account_running_the_canary}:assumed-role/<canary_name>/<assumed_role_name>`
arn:.

For example, if you have a canary running in account 0123456789012, named
test-canary, and the role it assumed was named canary-assume-role, then the trust
policy needs to include this statement for the canary to assume the roleArn for
SigV4 authentication correctly:

```

{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:AWS:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/test-canary/"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}

```

### OAuth client credentials

Synthetics implements the OAuth Client Credentials grant type as defined in RFC
6479 Section 4.4. If you want to make an HTTP request to an endpoint
authenticated with a Bearer Token issued by an OAuth token endpoint, Synthetics can
request and manage a bearer token on your behalf. When you use the OAuth scheme,
Synthetics performs the following steps:

- Uses the Basic authentication scheme with the clientId and clientSecret to
authenticate a request to the tokenUrl, the endpoint that issues bearer tokens

- If you provide the optional scope, audience, and resource parameters, they are
included in the token request

- Uses the access token returned by the tokenUrl to authenticate your HTTP
request

- Securely stores the refresh token returned from the tokenUrl for future token
requests

Example configuration:

```

"Authentication": {
    "type": "OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS",
    "tokenUrl": ..., // Required
    "clientId": ..., // Required
    "clientSecret": ..., // Required
    "scope": ..., // Optional
    "audience": ..., // Optional
    "resource": ..., // Optional
}

```

#### OAuth considerations

Synthetics refreshes OAuth tokens when a 401 or 407 response is returned.

### AWS Secrets Manager integration

To avoid storing secret values (such as passwords or API keys) in plain text,
Synthetics provides an integration with AWS Secrets Manager. You can reference an entire secret
value in your blueprint configuration with the format `
              ${aws_SECRET:<secret_name>}`, or to reference a particular key `
              ${aws_SECRET:<secret_name>:<secret_key>}`.

For example, if you have a secret named login/basic-auth-credentials, storing a
username and password with the following JSON structure:

```

{
    "username": "Aladdin",
    "password": "open sesame"
}

```

You can reference the username and password in your blueprint configuration as
follows, and Synthetics handles retrieving the secret value and using its keys to
authenticate your request:

```

"Authentication": {
    "type": "BASIC",
    "username": ${AWS_SECRET:login/basic-auth-credentials:username},
    "password": ${AWS_SECRET:login/basic-auth-credentials:password}
}

```

To allow Synthetics to retrieve the specified secret, the role ARN assumed by the
canary needs to have secretsManager:GetSecretValue permissions. If the secret is
encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the AWS managed key
AWS/secretsmanager, then you also need kms:Decrypt permissions for that key.

Example permissions:

```

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
            "Resource": "arn:AWS:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:secretName-AbCdEf"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
            "Resource": "arn:AWS:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/key-id"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common troubleshooting failures

The underlying code for multi check blueprint is written in Typescript. See the
canary troubleshooting page for common failures: [Troubleshooting\
a failed canary](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-troubleshoot.md).

### JSON check configuration syntax errors

When there are any syntactic errors related to the canary's JSON check
configuration, the AWS Management Console will provide you a failure reason when you attempt to
create the canary. If you are creating a canary using an API or CloudFormation, you will see
the failure when the canary is executed for the first time. It is recommended to use
the safe canary updates workflow for multi check canary. For more information, see [Performing\
safe canary updates](performing-safe-canary-upgrades.md).

### Networking or timeout failures

For any intermittent or consistent failures related to timeouts, network
connection failures (for example, ENOTFOUND, ECONNRESET) consider turning on `
              DEBUG` logs such that the following run will provide more additional details on
why the Checks are failing. To do so, provide the Environment Variable
CW\_SYNTHETICS\_LOG\_LEVEL: "DEBUG".

If there are still failures that you are unable to debug, consider reaching out to
AWS Support or checking if any of the other provided Canary types from CloudWatch
Synthetics more closely matches your use-case.
