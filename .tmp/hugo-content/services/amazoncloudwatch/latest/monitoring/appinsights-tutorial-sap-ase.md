## Prerequisites

You must perform the following prerequisites to configure an SAP ASE database
with CloudWatch Application Insights:

- **SAP ASE configuration parameters** – The following configuration parameters must be enabled on your ASE DB: `"enable monitoring"`,
`"sql text pipe max messages"`, `"sql text pipe active"`. This allows CloudWatch Application Insights to provide full monitoring capabilities for your DB. If these settings aren't enabled on your ASE database, Application Insights
will automatically enable them to collect the necessary metrics to allow monitoring.

- **SAP ASE database user** – The
database user provided during Application Insights onboarding must have permission to
access the following:

- System tables in the master database and user (tenant) databases

- Monitoring tables

- **SAPHostCtrl** – Install and set up SAPHostCtrl on your Amazon EC2 instance.

- **Amazon CloudWatch agent** – Make sure that you are not running a preexisting CloudWatch agent on your Amazon EC2 instance.
If you have CloudWatch agent installed, make sure to remove the configuration of the resources you are using in CloudWatch Application Insights from the existing CloudWatch agent configuration file to avoid a merge conflict. For more information, see
[Manually create or edit the CloudWatch agent configuration file](cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-details.md).

- **AWS Systems Manager enablement** – Install SSM
Agent on your instances, and enable the instances enabled for SSM. For
information about how to install the SSM agent, see [Working with SSM Agent](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.md) in the _AWS Systems Manager User_
_Guide_.

- **Amazon EC2 instance roles** – You must
attach the following Amazon EC2 instance roles to configure your database.

- You must attach the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` role
to enable Systems Manager. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager identity-based policy examples](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.md).

- You must attach the `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` to
enable instance metrics and logs to be emitted through CloudWatch. For
more information, see [Create IAM roles and users for use with Amazon CloudWatch agent](create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.md).

- You must attach the following IAM inline policy to the Amazon EC2
instance role to read the password stored in AWS Secrets Manager. For more
information about inline policies, see [Inline policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User_
_Guide_.

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:ApplicationInsights-*"
          }
      ]
}

```

- **AWS Resource Groups** – You must
create a resource group that includes all of the associated AWS resources
used by your application stack to onboard your applications to CloudWatch Application Insights. This
includes Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS volumes running your SAP ASE database.
If there are multiple databases per account, we recommend that you create
one resource group that includes the AWS resources for each SAP ASE
database system.

- **IAM permissions** – For non-admin
users:

- You must create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that allows
Application Insights to create a service-linked role, and attach it to your
user identity. For steps to attach the policy, see [IAM policy for CloudWatch Application Insights](appinsights-iam.md).

- The user must have permission to create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager to
store the database user credentials. For more information, see
[Example: Permission to create secrets](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-examples.md#auth-and-access_examples_create).
JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "secretsmanager:CreateSecret"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:ApplicationInsights-*"
      }
    ]
}

```

- **Service-linked role** – Application Insights
uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is
created for you when you create your first Application Insights application in the
Application Insights console. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for CloudWatch Application Insights](chap-using-service-linked-roles-appinsights.md).

## Set up monitoring on your SAP ASE database

Use the following steps to set up monitoring for your SAP ASE database

01. Open the [CloudWatch\
     console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. From the left navigation pane, under **Insights**, choose
     **Application Insights**.

03. The **Application Insights** page displays the list of
     applications that are monitored with Application Insights, and the monitoring status
     for each application. In the upper right-hand corner, choose **Add**
    **an application**.

04. On the **Specify application details** page, from the
     dropdown list under **Resource group**, select the AWS
     resource group that contains your SAP ASE database resources. If you
     haven't created a resource group for your application, you can create one by
     choosing **Create new resource group** under the
     **Resource group** dropdown. For more information about
     creating resource groups, see the [_AWS Resource Groups_\
    _User Guide._](../../../arg/latest/userguide/resource-groups.md)

05. Under **Monitor CloudWatch Events**, select the check box to
     integrate Application Insights monitoring with CloudWatch Events to get insights from Amazon EBS,
     Amazon EC2, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon ECS, AWS Health APIs and notifications, Amazon RDS, Amazon S3,
     and AWS Step Functions.

06. Under **Integrate with AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter**, select the
     check box next to **Generate AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter OpsItems for**
    **remedial actions** to view and get notifications when problems
     are detected for the selected applications. To track the operations that are
     performed to resolve operational work items, called OpsItems, that are
     related to your AWS resources, provide an SNS topic ARN.

07. You can optionally enter tags to help you identify and organize your
     resources. CloudWatch Application Insights supports both tag-based and CloudFormation stack-based resource groups,
     with the exception of Application Auto Scaling groups. For more
     information, see [Tag Editor](../../../arg/latest/userguide/tag-editor.md) in the
     _AWS Resource Groups and Tags User Guide_.

08. Choose **Next** to continue to set up monitoring.

09. On the **Review detected components** page, the monitored
     components and their workloads automatically detected by CloudWatch Application Insights are
     listed.

    ###### Note

    Components that contain a detected SAP ASE High Availability workload support only one workload on a component. Components that contain a
    detected SAP ASE single node workload support multiple workloads, but you can't add or remove workloads. All automatically detected workloads will be monitored.

10. Choose **Next**.

11. On the **Specify component details** page, enter the
     username and password of your SAP ASE databases.

12. Review your application monitoring configuration, and choose
     **Submit**.

13. The application details page opens, where you can view the
     **Application summary**, the list of
     **Monitored components and workloads**, and **Unmonitored**
    **components and workloads**. If you select the radio button next to a
     component or workload, you can also view the **Configuration history**,
     **Log patterns**, and any **Tags**
     that you have created. When you submit your configuration, your account
     deploys all of the metrics and alarms for your SAP ASE system, which can
     take up to 2 hours.

## Manage monitoring of your SAP ASE database

You can manage user credentials, metrics, and log paths for your SAP ASE database
by performing the following steps:

1. Open the [CloudWatch\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. From the left navigation pane, under **Insights**, choose
    **Application Insights**.

3. The **Application Insights** page displays the list of
    applications that are monitored with Application Insights, and the monitoring status
    for each application.

4. Under **Monitored components**, select the radio button
    next to the component name. Then, choose **Manage**
**monitoring**.

5. Under **EC2 instance group logs**, you can update the
    existing log path, log pattern set, and log group name. In addition, you can
    add up to three additional **Application logs**.

6. Under **Metrics**, you can choose the SAP ASE metrics
    according to your requirements. SAP ASE metric names are prefixed with
    `asedb`. You can add up to 60 metrics per component.

7. Under **ASE configuration**, enter the username and password
    for the SAP ASE database. This is the username and password that
    Amazon CloudWatch agent uses to connect to the SAP ASE database.

8. Under **Custom alarms**, you can add additional alarms to
    be monitored by CloudWatch Application Insights.

9. Review your application monitoring configuration and choose
    **Submit**. When you submit your configuration, your
    account updates all of the metrics and alarms for your SAP HANA system,
    which can take up to 2 hours.

## Configure the alarm threshold

CloudWatch Application Insights automatically creates a Amazon CloudWatch metric for the alarm to watch, along with
the threshold for that metric. The alarm changes to the `ALARM ` state
when the metric surpasses the threshold for a specified number of evaluation
periods. Note that these settings are not retained by Application Insights.

To edit an alarm for a single metric, perform the following steps:

1. Open the [CloudWatch\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Alarms** > **All alarms**.

3. Select the radio button next to the alarm that was automatically created
    by CloudWatch Application Insights. Then choose **Actions**, and select
    **Edit** from the dropdown menu.

4. Edit the following parameters under **Metric**.
1. Under **Statistic**, choose one of the statistics
       or predefined percentiles, or specify a custom percentile. For
       example, `p95.45`.

2. Under **Period**, choose the evaluations period
       for the alarm. When you evaluate the alarm, each period is
       aggregated into one data point.
5. Edit the following parameters under
    **Conditions**.
1. Choose whether the metric must be greater than, less than, or
       equal to the threshold.

2. Specify the threshold value.
6. Under **Additional configuration** edit the following
    parameters.
1. Under **Datapoints to alarm**, specify the number
       of data points, or evaluation periods, that must be in the
       `ALARM` state to initiate the alarm. When the two
       values match, an alarm is created that enters `ALARM`
       state if the designated number of consecutive periods are exceeded.
       To create an `m` out of `n` alarm, specify a
       lower value for the first data point than for the second. For more
       information about evaluating alarms, see [Evaluating an alarm](cloudwatch-alarms.md#alarm-evaluation).

2. Under **Missing data treatment**, choose the
       behavior of the alarm when some data points are missing. For more
       information about missing data treatment, see [Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing\
       data](cloudwatch-alarms.md#alarms-and-missing-data).

3. If the alarm uses a percentile as the monitored statistic, a
       **Percentiles with low samples** box appears.
       Choose whether to evaluate or ignore cases with low sample rates. If
       you choose **ignore (maintain alarm state)**, the
       current alarm state is always maintained when the sample size is too
       low. For more information about percentiles with low samples, see
       [Percentile-based alarms and low data samples](percentiles-with-low-samples.md).
7. Choose **Next**.

8. Under **Notification**, select an SNS topic to notify
    when the alarm is in `ALARM` state, `OK` state, or
    `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.

9. Choose **Update alarm**.

## View and troubleshoot SAP ASE problems detected by Application Insights

This section helps you resolve common troubleshooting problems that occur when you configure monitoring for SAP ASE on Application Insights.

###### SAP ASE Backup Server errors

You can identify the error message by checking the dynamically created dashboard. The dashboard shows the error message reported in the
SAP ASE Backup Server. For more details about SAP ASE Backup Server logs, see [SAP Documentation \
Backup Server Error Logging](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ASE/aa939a27edb34f019f71cc47b9c0fd9a/a7aeb8b1bc2b10149ccf99b95687a64c.html).

###### SAP ASE long running transactions

Identify the long running transaction and confirm whether it can be stopped or if the running time is intentional. For more details, see [2180410 — \
How to display transaction log records for long running transactions? — SAP ASE](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2180410).

###### SAP ASE User connections

Review whether your SAP ASE database is sized accordingly for the workload you intend to run on the database. For more details, see [Configuring \
User Connections](https://help.sap.com/docs/help/061ec8a5739842df9e505d8944fae8e2/9ea258fceaaa496eb80e17d3d5694ff6.html) in the SAP documentation.

###### SAP ASE disk space

You can identify the database layer that is causing the problem by checking the
dynamically created dashboard. The dashboard shows the related metrics and log file
snippets. It is important to understand the cause of the disk growth and when
applicable, increase the physical disk size, the allocated disk space, or both. For
more details, see [SAP Documentation disk resize](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ASE/e0d4539d39c34f52ae9ef822c2060077/ab22db00bc2b1014ad3ce047bbf117d7.html) in the SAP documentation.
