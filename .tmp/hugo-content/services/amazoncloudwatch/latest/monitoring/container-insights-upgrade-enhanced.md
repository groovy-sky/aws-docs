# Upgrading to Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS in CloudWatch

###### Important

If you are upgrading or installing Container Insights on an Amazon EKS cluster, we
recommend that you use the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on for the installation,
instead of using the instructions in this section. Additionally, to retrieve
accelerated computing metrics, you must use the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS
add-on. For more information and instructions, see [Quick start with the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on](container-insights-setup-eks-addon.md).

Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS is the newest version of
Container Insights. It collects detailed metrics from clusters running Amazon EKS and offers
curated, immediately usable dashboards to drill down into application and infrastructure
telemetry. For more information about this version of Container Insights, see [Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS](container-insights-detailed-metrics.md).

If you have installed the original version of Container Insights in an Amazon EKS cluster
and you want to upgrade it to the newer version with enhanced observability, follow the
instructions in this section.

###### Important

Before completing the steps in this section, you must have verified the
prerequisites including cert-manager. For more information, see [Quick Start with the CloudWatch agent operator and Fluent Bit](container-insights-setup-eks-quickstart.md#Container-Insights-setup-EKS-quickstart-FluentBit).

###### To upgrade an Amazon EKS cluster to Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS

1. Install the CloudWatch agent operator by entering the following command. Replace
    `my-cluster-name` with the name of your Amazon EKS or
    Kubernetes cluster, and replace `my-cluster-region` with
    the name of the Region where the logs are published. We recommend that you use the
    same Region where your cluster is deployed to reduce the AWS outbound data
    transfer costs.

```nohighlight

ClusterName=my-cluster-name
RegionName=my-cluster-region
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/main/k8s-quickstart/cwagent-operator-rendered.yaml | sed 's/{{cluster_name}}/'${ClusterName}'/g;s/{{region_name}}/'${RegionName}'/g' | kubectl apply -f -
```

If you notice a failure caused by conflicting resources, it is likely because
    you already have the CloudWatch agent and Fluent Bit with its associated components such
    as the ServiceAccount, the ClusterRole and the ClusterRoleBinding installed on the
    cluster. When the CloudWatch agent operator tries to install the CloudWatch agent and its
    associated components, if it detects any change in the contents, it by default fails
    the installation or update to avoid overwriting the state of the resources on the
    cluster. We recommend that you delete any existing CloudWatch agent with Container
    Insights setup that you had previously installed on the cluster, and then install
    the CloudWatch agent operator.

2. (Optional) To apply an existing custom Fluent Bit configuration, you must update
    the configmap associated with the Fluent Bit daemonset. The CloudWatch agent operator
    provides a default configuration for Fluent Bit, and you can override or modify the
    default configuration as needed. To apply a custom configuration, follow these
    steps.
1. Open the existing configuration by entering the following command.

      ```nohighlight

      kubectl edit cm fluent-bit-config -n amazon-cloudwatch
      ```

2. Make your changes in the file, then enter `:wq` to save the file
       and exit edit mode.

3. Restart Fluent Bit by entering the following command.

      ```nohighlight

      kubectl rollout restart ds fluent-bit -n amazon-cloudwatch
      ```
