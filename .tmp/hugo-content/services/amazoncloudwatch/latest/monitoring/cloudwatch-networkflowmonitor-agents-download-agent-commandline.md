# Download prebuilt packages of the Network Flow Monitor agent by using the command line

You can use the command line to install the Network Flow Monitor agent as a package in Amazon Linux 2023,
or download and install prebuilt packages of the Network Flow Monitor agent.

Before or after you download a prebuilt package, you can optionally verify the package signature.
For more information, see [Verify the signature of the Network Flow Monitor agent package](#CloudWatch-NetworkFlowMonitor-agents-download-agent-commandline-verify-sig).

Choose from the following instructions, depending on the Linux operating system that you're using
and the type of installation that you want.

**Amazon Linux AMIs**

The Network Flow Monitor agent is available as a package in Amazon Linux 2023. If you're using
this operating system, you can install the package by entering the following command:

`sudo yum install network-flow-monitor-agent`

You must also make sure that the IAM role attached to the instance has the
[CloudWatchNetworkFlowMonitorAgentPublishPolicy](security-iam-awsmanpol-network-flow-monitor.md#security-iam-awsmanpol-CloudWatchNetworkFlowMonitorAgentPublishPolicy) policy
attached. For more information, see [Configure permissions for agents](cloudwatch-networkflowmonitor-agents-ec2-permissions.md).

**Amazon Linux 2023**

Install the package for your architecture by using one of the following commands:

- **x86\_64**: `sudo yum install
  									https://networkflowmonitoragent.awsstatic.com/latest/x86_64/network-flow-monitor-agent.rpm`

- **ARM64 (Graviton)**: `sudo yum install
  									https://networkflowmonitoragent.awsstatic.com/latest/arm64/network-flow-monitor-agent.rpm`

Verify that Network Flow Monitor agent is successfully installed by running the following command and
verifying that the response shows that the agent is enabled and active:

```

service network-flow-monitor status
network-flow-monitor.service - Network Flow Monitor Agent
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/network-flow-monitor.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2025-04-23 19:17:16 UTC; 1min 9s ago
```

**DEB-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu)**

Install the package for your architecture by using one of the following commands:

- **x86\_64**:
`wget https://networkflowmonitoragent.awsstatic.com/latest/x86_64/network-flow-monitor-agent.deb`

- **ARM64 (Graviton)**:
`wget https://networkflowmonitoragent.awsstatic.com/latest/arm64/network-flow-monitor-agent.deb`

Install the package by using the following command: `$ sudo apt-get install ./network-flow-monitor-agent.deb`

Verify that Network Flow Monitor agent is successfully installed by running the following command and
verifying that the response shows that the agent is enabled and active:

```

service network-flow-monitor status
network-flow-monitor.service - Network Flow Monitor Agent
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/network-flow-monitor.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2025-04-23 19:17:16 UTC; 1min 9s ago
```

## Verify the signature of the Network Flow Monitor agent package

The Network Flow Monitor agent rpm and deb installer packages for Linux instances are cryptographically signed.
You can use a public key to verify that the agent package is original and unmodified. If the files
are damaged or have been altered, the verification fails. You can verify the signature of the
installer package using either RPM or GPG. The following information is for Network Flow Monitor agent versions 0.1.3 or later.

To find the correct signature file for each architecture and operating system, use the following table.

Follow the steps here to verify the signature of the Network Flow Monitor agent.

###### To verify the signature of the Network Flow Monitor agent for Amazon S3 package

1. Install GnuPG so that you can run the gpg command. GnuPG is required to verify the authenticity
    and integrity of a downloaded Network Flow Monitor agent for an Amazon S3 package. GnuPG is installed by default on
    Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

2. Copy the following public key and save it to a file named `nfm-agent.gpg`.

3. Import the public key into your keyring and note the returned value.

```nohighlight

PS>  rpm --import nfm-agent.gpg
gpg: key 3B789C72: public key "Network Flow Monitor Agent" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)
```

Make a note of the key value because you need it in the next step. In this
    example, the key value is `3B789C72`.

4. Verify the fingerprint by running the following command. Be sure to replace
    `key-value` with the value from the preceding step. We
    recommend that you use GPG to verify the fingerprint even if you use RPM to verify
    the installer package.

```nohighlight

PS>  gpg --fingerprint key-value
pub   rsa4096 2025-04-08 [SC] [expires: 2028-04-07]
         7673 6CA9 97AD D3E9 D277  26A8 EFBD A4CC BC95 FAD1
uid   Network Flow Monitor Agent <network-flow-monitor-agent@amazon.com>
```

The fingerprint string should be equal to the following:

`7673 6CA9 97AD D3E9 D277  26A8 EFBD A4CC BC95 FAD1`

If the fingerprint string doesn't match, don't install the agent. Contact
    Amazon Web Services.

After you have verified the fingerprint, you can use it to verify the signature of
    the Network Flow Monitor agent package.

5. Download the package signature file, if you haven't already done so, based on your instance's architecture
    and operating system.

6. Verify the installer package signature. Be sure to replace the `signature-filename`
    and `agent-download-filename` with the values that you specified when you
    downloaded the signature file and agent, as shown in the table earlier in this topic.

```nohighlight

PS> gpg --verify sig-filename agent-download-filename
gpg: Signature made Tue Apr  8 00:40:02 2025 UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 77777777EXAMPLEKEY
gpg:                issuer "network-flow-monitor-agent@amazon.com"
gpg: Good signature from "Network Flow Monitor Agent <network-flow-monitor-agent@amazon.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: Using untrusted key!
```

If the output includes the phrase `BAD signature`, check to make sure that you
    performed the procedure correctly. If you continue to get this response, contact
    [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport)
    and avoid using the downloaded file.

Note the warning about trust. A key is trusted only if you or someone who you trust
    has signed it. This doesn't mean that the signature is invalid, only that you have not
    verified the public key.

Next, follow the steps here to verify the RPM package.

###### To verify the signature of the RPM package

1. Copy the following public key and save it to a file named `nfm-agent.gpg`.

2. Import the public key into your keyring.

```nohighlight

3. Verify the installer package signature. Be sure to replace the `agent-download-filename`
    with the value that you specified when you downloaded the agent, as shown in the table earlier in this topic.

```nohighlight

```

For example, for the x86\_64 architecture on Amazon Linux 2023, use the following command:

```nohighlight

PS>  rpm --checksig network-flow-monitor-agent.rpm
```

This command returns output similar to the following.

```

network-flow-monitor-agent.rpm: digests signatures OK
```

If the output contains the phrase `NOT OK (MISSING KEYS: (MD5) key-id)`, check to make
    sure that you performed the procedure correctly. If you continue to get this response, contact
    [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport) and don't install the agent.
