# Using Internet Monitor

Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet issues impact the performance and availability
between your applications hosted on AWS and your end users. It can reduce the time it takes for you to diagnose
internet issues from days to minutes. Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that AWS captures from its global
networking footprint to calculate a baseline of performance and availability for internet-facing traffic. This
is the same data that AWS uses to monitor internet uptime and availability. With those measurements
as a baseline, Internet Monitor raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your
end users (clients) in the different geographic locations where your application runs.

In the Amazon CloudWatch console, you can see a global view of traffic patterns and health events, and easily
drill down into information about events, at different geographic granularities (locations). You can clearly
visualize impact, and pinpoint the client locations and networks (ASNs, typically internet service providers or ISPs)
that are affected. If Internet Monitor determines that an internet availability or performance issue is caused by a specific
ASN or by the AWS network, it provides that information.

To get started, create a monitor that includes one or more resources, so Internet Monitor can create a traffic profile
for your AWS application. Then, view information in the Internet Monitor dashboard to visualize data and get insights and suggestions
about your application's internet traffic.
