# Install the CloudWatch agent with the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart

You can use either the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Amazon CloudWatch Observability
Helm chart to install the CloudWatch Agent and the Fluent-bit agent on an Amazon EKS cluster. You can
also use the Helm chart to install the CloudWatch Agent and the Fluent-bit agent on a Kubernetes
cluster that is not hosted on Amazon EKS.

Using either method on an Amazon EKS cluster enables both [Container Insights](containerinsights.md) with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS and [CloudWatch Application Signals](cloudwatch-application-monitoring-sections.md) by
default. Both features help you to collect infrastructure metrics, application performance
telemetry, and container logs from the cluster.

With version `v6.0.1-eksbuild.1` or later of the add-on, Container Insights
with OpenTelemetry metrics is enabled, which collects metrics using the OpenTelemetry
Protocol (OTLP) and supports PromQL queries. For more information, see [Container Insights with OpenTelemetry metrics for Amazon EKS](container-insights-otel-metrics.md).

With Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS, Container Insights
metrics are charged per observation instead of being charged per metric stored or log
ingested. For Application Signals, billing is based on inbound requests to your
applications, outbound requests from your applications, and each configured service level
objective (SLO). Each inbound request received generates one application signal, and each
outbound request made generates one application signal. Every SLO creates two application
signals per measurement period. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

Both methods enable Container Insights on both Linux and Windows worker nodes in the
Amazon EKS cluster. To enable Container Insights on Windows, you must use version 1.5.0 or later
of the Amazon EKS add-on or the Helm chart. Application Signals is not supported on
Windows in Amazon EKS clusters.

The Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on is supported on Amazon EKS clusters running with
Kubernetes version 1.23 or later.

When you install the add-on or the Helm chart, you must also grant IAM permissions to
enable the CloudWatch agent to send metrics, logs, and traces to CloudWatch. There are two ways to do
this:

- Attach a policy to the IAM role of your worker nodes. This option grants
permissions to worker nodes to send telemetry to CloudWatch.

- Use an IAM role for service accounts for the agent pods, and attach the policy to
this role. This works only for Amazon EKS clusters. This option gives CloudWatch access only to the
appropriate agent pods.

## Option 1: Install using EKS Pod Identity

If you use version 3.1.0 or later of the add-on, you can use EKS Pod Identity to grant
the required permissions to the add-on. EKS Pod Identity is the recommended option and
provides benefits such as least privilege, credential rotation, and auditability.
Additionally, using EKS Pod Identity allows you to install the EKS add-on as part of the
cluster creation itself.

To use this method, first follow the [EKS Pod\
Identity association](../../../eks/latest/userguide/pod-id-association.md#pod-id-association-create/) steps to create the IAM role and set up the EKS Pod
Identity agent.

Then install the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on. To install the add-on, you can use
the AWS CLI, the Amazon EKS console, CloudFormation, or Terraform.

AWS CLI

###### To use the AWS CLI to install the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on

Enter the following commands. Replace
`my-cluster-name` with the name of your
cluster and replace `111122223333` with your account ID.
Replace `my-role` with the IAM role that you created in
the EKS Pod Identity association step.

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy \
--role-name my-role \
--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy

aws eks create-addon \
--addon-name amazon-cloudwatch-observability \
--cluster-name my-cluster-name \

3. If you don't have an IAM role configured, choose **Create**
      **recommended role**, then choose **Next** until
       you are at **Step 3 Name, review, and create**. You can
       change your role name if desired, otherwise, choose **Create**
      **Role**, and then return to the Add-on page and select the IAM
       role that you just created.

4. (Optional) You can expand the **Optional configuration**
      **settings**. If you select **Override** for the
       **Conflict resolution method**, one or more of the
       settings for the existing add-on can be overwritten with the Amazon EKS add-on
       settings. If you don't enable this option and there's a conflict with your
       existing settings, the operation fails. You can use the resulting error
       message to troubleshoot the conflict. Before selecting this option, make
       sure that the Amazon EKS add-on doesn't manage settings that you need to
       self-manage.

## Option 3: Install using IAM service account role (applies only to using the add-on)

This method is valid only if you are using the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on.
Before using this method, verify the following prerequisites:

- You have a functional Amazon EKS cluster with nodes attached in one of the
AWS Regions that supports Container Insights. For the list of supported Regions, see
[Container Insights](containerinsights.md).

- You have `kubectl` installed and configured for the cluster. For more
information, see [Installing\
`kubectl`](../../../eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.md) in the _Amazon EKS User Guide_.

- You have `eksctl` installed. For more information, see [Installing or updating\
`eksctl`](../../../eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.md) in the _Amazon EKS User Guide_.

AWS CLI

###### To use the AWS CLI to install the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on using the IAM service account role

1. Enter the following command to create an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, if
    the cluster doesn't have one already. For more information, see [Configuring a\
    Kubernetes service account to assume an IAM role](../../../eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.md) in the
    _Amazon EKS User Guide_.

```nohighlight

eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster my-cluster-name --approve
```

2. Enter the following command to create the IAM role with the
    **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy** policy attached, and
    configure the agent service account to assume that role using OIDC. Replace
    `my-cluster-name` with the name of your cluster, and
    replace `my-service-account-role` with the name of the
    role that you want to associate the service account with. If the role doesn't
    already exist, `eksctl` creates it for you.

```nohighlight

eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
     --name cloudwatch-agent \
     --namespace amazon-cloudwatch --cluster my-cluster-name \
     --role-name my-service-account-role \
     --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy \
     --role-only \
     --approve
```

3. Install the add-on by entering the following command. Replace
    `my-cluster-name` with the name of your cluster,
    replace `111122223333` with your account ID, and
    replace `my-service-account-role` with the IAM role
    created in the previous step.

```nohighlight

aws eks create-addon --addon-name amazon-cloudwatch-observability --cluster-name my-cluster-name --service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-service-account-role

- [Manage admission webhook TLS certificates](#CloudWatch-Observability-EKS-addon-Webhook)

- [Collect Amazon EBS volume IDs](#CloudWatch-Observability-EKS-addon-VolumeIDs)

### Opt out of collecting container logs

By default, the add-on uses Fluent Bit to collect container logs from all pods and
then sends the logs to CloudWatch Logs. For information about which logs are collected, see [Setting up Fluent Bit](container-insights-setup-logs-fluentbit.md#Container-Insights-FluentBit-setup).

###### Note

Neither the add-on or the Helm chart manage existing Fluentd or Fluent Bit
resources in a cluster. You can delete the existing Fluentd or Fluent Bit resources
before installing the add-on or Helm chart. Alternatively, to keep your existing setup
and avoid having the add-on or the Helm chart from also installing Fluent Bit, you can
disable it by following the instructions in this section.

To opt out of the collection of container logs if you are using the Amazon CloudWatch
Observability EKS add-on, pass the following option when you create or update the
add-on:

```nohighlight

--configuration-values '{ "containerLogs": { "enabled": false } }'
```

To opt out of the collection of container logs if you are using the Helm chart, pass
the following option when you create or update the add-on:

```nohighlight

--set containerLogs.enabled=false
```

### Use a custom Fluent Bit configuration

Starting with version 1.7.0 of the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on, you can modify
the Fluent Bit configuration when you create or update the add-on or Helm chart. You
supply the custom Fluent Bit configuration in the `containerLogs` root level
section of the advanced configuration of the add-on or the value overrides in the Helm
chart. Within this section, you supply the custom Fluent Bit configuration in the
`config` section (for Linux) or `configWindows` section (for
Windows). The `config` is further broken down into the following
sub-sections:

- `service`– This section represents the `SERVICE`
config to define the global behavior of the Fluent Bit engine.

- `customParsers`– This section represents any global
`PARSER` s that you want to include that are capable of taking
unstructured log entries and giving them a structure to make it easier for
processing and further filtering.

- `extraFiles`– This section can be used to provide additional
Fluent Bit `conf` files to be included. By default, the following 3
`conf` files are included:.

- `application-log.conf`– A `conf` file for
sending application logs from your cluster to the log group
`/aws/containerinsights/my-cluster-name/application`
in CloudWatch Logs.

- `dataplane-log.conf`– A `conf` file for sending
logs corresponding to your cluster’s data plane components including the CRI
logs, kubelet logs, kube-proxy logs and Amazon VPC CNI logs to the log group
`/aws/containerinsights/my-cluster-name/dataplane`
in CloudWatch Logs.

- `host-log.conf`– A `conf` for sending logs from
`/var/log/dmesg`, `/var/log/messages`, and
`/var/log/secure` on Linux, and System `winlogs` on
Windows, to the log group
`/aws/containerinsights/my-cluster-name/host`
in CloudWatch.

###### Note

Provide the full configuration for each of these individual sections even if you
are modifying only one field within a sub-section. We recommend that you use the
default configuration provided below as a baseline and then modify it accordingly so
that you don't disable functionality that is enabled by default. You can use the
following YAML configuration when modifying the advanced config for the Amazon EKS add-on
or when you supply value overrides for the Helm chart.

To find the `config` section for your cluster, see [aws-observability /\
helm-charts](https://github.com/aws-observability/helm-charts/releases) on GitHub and find the release corresponding to the version of the
add-on or Helm chart that you are installing. Then navigate to
`/charts/amazon-cloudwatch-observability/values.yaml` to find the
`config` section (for Linux) and `configWindows` section (for
Windows) within the `fluentBit` section under
`containerLogs`.

As an example, the default Fluent Bit configuration for version 1.7.0 can be found
[here](https://github.com/aws-observability/helm-charts/blob/v1.7.0/charts/amazon-cloudwatch-observability/values.yaml).

We recommend that you provide the `config` as YAML when you supply it
using the Amazon EKS add-on’s advanced config or when you supply it as value overrides for
your Helm installation. Be sure that the YAML conforms to the following
structure.

```yaml

containerLogs:
fluentBit:
    config:
      service: |
        ...
      customParsers: |
        ...
      extraFiles:
        application-log.conf: |
          ...
        dataplane-log.conf: |
          ...
        host-log.conf: |
          ...
```

The following example `config` changes the global setting for the flush
interval to be 45 seconds. Even though the only modification is to the
`Flush` field, you must still provide the full `SERVICE`
definition for the service sub-section. Because this example didn't specify overrides
for the other sub-sections, the defaults are used for them.

```yaml

containerLogs:
fluentBit:
    config:
      service: |
        [SERVICE]
          Flush                     45
          Grace                     30
          Log_Level                 error
          Daemon                    off
          Parsers_File              parsers.conf
          storage.path              /var/fluent-bit/state/flb-storage/
          storage.sync              normal
          storage.checksum          off
          storage.backlog.mem_limit 5M
```

The following example configuration includes an extra Fluent bit `conf`
file. In this example, we are adding a custom `my-service.conf` under
`extraFiles` and it will be included in addition to the three default
`extraFiles`.

```yaml

containerLogs:
fluentBit:
    config:
      extraFiles:
        my-service.conf: |
          [INPUT]
            Name              tail

            auto_create_group   true
```

The next example removes an existing `conf` file entirely from
`extraFiles`. This excludes the `application-log.conf` entirely
by overriding it with an empty string. Simply omitting `application-log.conf`
from `extraFiles` would instead imply to use the default, which is not what
we are trying to achieve in this example. The same applies to removing any custom
`conf` file that you might have previously added to
`extraFiles`.

```yaml

containerLogs:
fluentBit:
    config:
      extraFiles:
        application-log.conf: ""
```

### Manage Kubernetes tolerations for the installed pod workloads

Starting with version 1.7.0 of the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on, the add-on and
the Helm chart by default set Kubernetes _tolerations_ to tolerate
all taints on the pod workloads that are installed by the add-on or the Helm chart. This
ensures that daemonsets such as the CloudWatch agent and Fluent Bit can schedule pods on all
nodes in your cluster by default. For more information about tolerations and taints, see
[Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration) in the Kubernetes documentation.

The default tolerations set by the add-on or the Helm chart are as follows:

```yaml

tolerations:
- operator: Exists
```

You can override the default tolerations by setting the `tolerations`
field at the root level when using the add-on advanced config or when you install or
upgrade the Helm chart with value overrides. An example would look like the
following:

```yaml

tolerations:
- key: "key1"
operator: "Exists"
effect: "NoSchedule"
```

To omit tolerations completely, you can use a config that looks like the
following:

```yaml

tolerations: []
```

Any changes to tolerations apply to all pod workloads that are installed by the
add-on or the Helm chart.

### Opt out of accelerated compute metrics collection

By default, Container Insights with enhanced observability collects metrics for
Accelerated Compute monitoring, including NVIDIA GPU metrics, AWS Neuron metrics for
AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia, and AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
metrics.

NVIDIA GPU metrics from Amazon EKS workloads are collected by default beginning with
version `v1.3.0-eksbuild.1` of the EKS add-on or the Helm chart and version
`1.300034.0` of the CloudWatch agent. For a list of metrics collected and
prerequisites, see [NVIDIA GPU metrics](container-insights-metrics-enhanced-eks.md#Container-Insights-metrics-EKS-GPU).

AWS Neuron metrics for AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia accelerators are
collected by default beginning with version `v1.5.0-eksbuild.1` of the EKS
add-on or the Helm chart, and version `1.300036.0` of the CloudWatch agent. For a
list of metrics collected and prerequisites, see [AWS Neuron metrics for AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia](container-insights-metrics-enhanced-eks.md#Container-Insights-metrics-EKS-Neuron).

AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) metrics from Linux nodes on Amazon EKS clusters are
collected by default beginning with version `v1.5.2-eksbuild.1` of the EKS
add-on or the Helm chart and version `1.300037.0` of the CloudWatch agent. For a
list of metrics collected and prerequisites, see [AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) metrics](container-insights-metrics-enhanced-eks.md#Container-Insights-metrics-EFA).

You can opt out of collecting these metrics by setting the
`accelerated_compute_metrics` field in the CloudWatch agent configuration file to
`false`. This field is in the `kubernetes` section of the
`metrics_collected` section in the CloudWatch configuration file. The following
is an example of an opt-out configuration. For more information about how to use custom
CloudWatch agent configurations, see the following section, [Use a custom CloudWatch agent configuration](#CloudWatch-Observability-EKS-addon-CustomAgentConfig).

```json

{
"logs": {
    "metrics_collected": {
      "kubernetes": {
        "enhanced_container_insights": true,
        "accelerated_compute_metrics": false
      }
    }
}
}
```

### Use a custom CloudWatch agent configuration

To collect other metrics, logs or traces using the CloudWatch agent, you can specify a
custom configuration while also keeping Container Insights and CloudWatch Application Signals
enabled. To do so, embed the CloudWatch agent configuration file within the config key under
the agent key of the advanced configuration that you can use when creating or updating
the EKS add-on or the Helm chart. The following represents the default agent
configuration when you do not provide any additional configuration.

###### Important

Any custom configuration that you provide using additional configuration settings
overrides the default configuration used by the agent. Be cautious not to
unintentionally disable functionality that is enabled by default, such as Container
Insights with enhanced observability and CloudWatch Application Signals. In the scenario
that you are required to provide a custom agent configuration, we recommend using the
following default configuration as a baseline and then modifying it
accordingly.

- For using the Amazon CloudWatch observability EKS add-on

```json

  --configuration-values '{
    "agent": {
      "config": {
        "logs": {
          "metrics_collected": {
            "application_signals": {},
            "kubernetes": {
              "enhanced_container_insights": true
            }
          }
        },
        "traces": {
          "traces_collected": {
            "application_signals": {}
          }
        }
      }
    }
}'
```

- For using the Helm chart

```json

  --set agent.config='{
    "logs": {
      "metrics_collected": {
        "application_signals": {},
        "kubernetes": {
          "enhanced_container_insights": true
        }
      }
    },
    "traces": {
      "traces_collected": {
        "application_signals": {}
      }
    }
}'
```

The following example shows the default agent configuration for the CloudWatch agent on
Windows. The CloudWatch agent on Windows does not support custom configuration.

```json

{
"logs": {
    "metrics_collected": {
      "kubernetes": {
        "enhanced_container_insights": true
      },
    }
}
}
```

### Manage admission webhook TLS certificates

The Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on and the Helm chart leverage Kubernetes [admission webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers) to validate and mutate `AmazonCloudWatchAgent`
and `Instrumentation` custom resource (CR) requests, and optionally
Kubernetes pod requests on the cluster if CloudWatch Application Signals is enabled. In
Kubernetes, webhooks require a TLS certificate that the API server is configured to
trust in order to ensure secure communication.

By default, the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on and the Helm chart auto-generate a
self-signed CA and a TLS certificate signed by this CA for securing the communication
between the API server and the webhook server. This auto-generated certificate has a
default expiry of 10 years and is not auto-renewed upon expiry. In addition, the CA
bundle and the certificate are re-generated every time the add-on or Helm chart is
upgraded or re-installed, thus resetting the expiry. If you want to change the default
expiry of the auto-generated certificate, you can use the following additional
configurations when creating or updating the add-on. Replace
`expiry-in-days` with your desired expiry duration in days.

- Use this for the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on

```nohighlight

  --configuration-values '{ "admissionWebhooks": { "autoGenerateCert": { "expiryDays": expiry-in-days } } }'
```

- Use this for the Helm chart

```nohighlight

  --set admissionWebhooks.autoGenerateCert.expiryDays=expiry-in-days
```

For a more secure and feature-rich certificate authority solution, the add-on has
opt-in support for [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs), a
widely-adopted solution for TLS certificate management in Kubernetes that simplifies the
process of obtaining, renewing, managing and using those certificates. It ensures that
certificates are valid and up to date, and attempts to renew certificates at a
configured time before expiry. cert-manager also facilitates issuing certificates from a
variety of supported sources, including [AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority](https://aws.amazon.com/private-ca).

We recommend that you review best practices for management of TLS certificates on
your clusters and advise you to opt in to cert-manager for production environments. Note
that if you opt-in to enabling cert-manager for managing the admission webhook TLS
certificates, you are required to pre-install cert-manager on your Amazon EKS cluster before
you install the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart. For more
information about available installation options, see [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation).
After you install it, you can opt in to using cert-manager for managing the admission
webhook TLS certificates using the following additional configuration.

- If you are using the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on

```nohighlight

  --configuration-values '{ "admissionWebhooks": { "certManager": { "enabled": true } } }'
```

- If you are using the Helm chart

```nohighlight

  --set admissionWebhooks.certManager.enabled=true
```

```nohighlight

--configuration-values '{ "admissionWebhooks": { "certManager": { "enabled": true } } }'
```

The advanced configuration discussed in this section will by default use a [SelfSigned](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned)
issuer.

### Collect Amazon EBS volume IDs

If you want to collect Amazon EBS volume IDs in the performance logs, you must add
another policy to the IAM role that is attached to the worker nodes or to the service
account. Add the following as an inline policy. For more information, see [Adding and\
Removing IAM Identity Permissions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-attach-detach.md).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Collect Java Management Extensions (JMX) metrics

The CloudWatch agent supports Java Management Extensions (JMX) metrics collection on Amazon EKS.
This allows you to collect additional metrics from Java applications running on Amazon EKS
clusters enabling insight into performance, memory usage, traffic, and other critical
metrics. For more information, see [Collect Java Management Extensions (JMX) metrics](cloudwatch-agent-jmx-metrics.md).

## Enable Kueue metrics

Beginning with version `v2.4.0-eksbuild.1` of the the CloudWatch Observability
EKS add-on, Container Insights for Amazon EKS supports collecting Kueue metrics from Amazon EKS
clusters. For more information about these metrics, see [Kueue metrics](container-insights-metrics-eks.md#Container-Insights-metrics-Kueue).

If you are using the Amazon SageMaker AI Hyperpod Task Governance EKS add-on, you
can skip the steps in the **Prerequisites** section and just follow the
steps in [Enable the configuration flag](#enable-Kueue-metrics-flag).

### Prerequisites

Before you install Kueue in your Amazon EKS cluster, make the following updates in the
manifest file:

1. Enable the optional cluster queue resource metrics for Kueue. To do this, modify
    the in-line `controller_manager_config.yaml` in the
    `kueue-system` ConfigMap. In the `metrics` section, add or
    uncomment the line `enableClusterQueueResources: true`.

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
     controller_manager_config.yaml: |
       apiVersion: config.kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
       kind: Configuration
       health:
         healthProbeBindAddress: :8081
       metrics:
         bindAddress: :8080
         enableClusterQueueResources: true  <-- ADD/UNCOMMENT THIS LINE
```

2. By default, all `k8s` services are available cluster-wide. Kueue
    creates a service `kueue-controller-manager-metrics-service` for exposing
    metrics. To prevent duplicate observations for metrics, modify this service to allow
    access only to the metrics service from the same node. To do this, add the line
    `internalTrafficPolicy: Local` to the
    `kueue-controller-manager-metrics-service` definition.

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
     labels:
       ...
     name: kueue-controller-manager-metrics-service
     namespace: kueue-system
spec:
     ports:
  - name: https
    port: 8443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: https
internalTrafficPolicy: Local   <-- ADD THIS LINE
selector:
    control-plane: controller-manager
```

3. Lastly, the `kueue-controller-manager` pod creates a
    `kube-rbac-proxy` container. This container currently has a high level
    of logging verbosity, which causes the cluster's bearer token to be logged by that
    container when the metrics scraper accesses the
    `kueue-controller-manager-metrics-service`. We recommend that you
    decrease this logging verbosity. The default value in the manifest distributed by
    Kueue is 10, we recommend to change it to 0.

   ```yaml

   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     labels:
       ...
     name: kueue-controller-manager
     namespace: kueue-system
   spec:
     ...
     template:
       ...
       spec:
         containers:
         ...
      - args:
        - --secure-listen-address=0.0.0.0:8443
        - --upstream=http://127.0.0.1:8080/
        - --logtostderr=true
        - --v=0  <-- CHANGE v=10 TO v=0
        image: gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy:v0.8.0
        name: kube-rbac-proxy
        ...
```

### Enable the configuration flag

To enable the Kueue metrics, you must enable `kueue_container_insights`
in the add-on additional configuration. You can do this either by using the AWS CLI to set
up the EKS Observability add-on, or by using the Amazon EKS console.

After you have successfully installed the EKS Observability add-on with one of the
following methods, you can view your Amazon EKS cluster metrics under the HyperPod console
**Dashboard** tab.

AWS CLI

###### To enable Kueue metrics using the AWS CLI

- Enter the following AWS CLI command to install the add-on.

```nohighlight

aws eks create-addon --cluster-name cluster-name --addon-name amazon-cloudwatch-observability --configuration-values "configuration_json_file"
```

The following is an example of the JSON file with the configuration
values.

```json

{
      "agent": {
          "config": {
              "logs": {
                  "metrics_collected": {
                      "kubernetes": {
                          "kueue_container_insights": true,
                          "enhanced_container_insights": true
                      },
                      "application_signals": { }
                  }
              },
              "traces": {
                  "traces_collected": {
                      "application_signals": { }
                  }
              }
          },
      },
}
```

Amazon EKS console

###### To enable Kueue metrics using the Amazon EKS console

1. Open the Amazon EKS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home).

2. Choose the name of your cluster.

3. Choose **Add-ons**.

4. Find the **Amazon CloudWatch Observability** add-on in
    the list, and install it. When you do so, choose **Optional**
**configuration** and include the following JSON configuration
    values.

```json

{
       "agent": {
           "config": {
               "logs": {
                   "metrics_collected": {
                       "kubernetes": {
                           "kueue_container_insights": true,
                           "enhanced_container_insights": true
                       },
                       "application_signals": { }
                   }
               },
               "traces": {
                   "traces_collected": {
                       "application_signals": { }
                   }
               }
           },
       },
}
```

## Appending OpenTelemetry collector configuration files

The CloudWatch agent supports supplemental OpenTelemetry collector configuration files
alongside its own configuration files. This feature allows you to use CloudWatch agent features
such as CloudWatch Application Signals or Container Insights through the CloudWatch agent configuration and
bring in your existing OpenTelemetry collector configuration with a single agent.

To prevent merge conflicts with pipelines automatically created by CloudWatch agent, we
recommend that you add a custom suffix to each of the components and pipelines in your
OpenTelemetry collector configuration. This will prevent clashing and merge
conflicts.

- If you are using the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on

```yaml

  --configuration-values file://values.yaml
```

or

```nohighlight

  --configuration-values '
    agent:
      otelConfig:
        receivers:
          otlp/custom-suffix:
            protocols:
              http: {}
        exporters:
          awscloudwatchlogs/custom-suffix:
            log_group_name: "test-group"
            log_stream_name: "test-stream"
        service:
          pipelines:
            logs/custom-suffix:
              receivers: [otlp/custom-suffix]
              exporters: [awscloudwatchlogs/custom-suffix]
'
```

- If you are using the Helm chart

```nohighlight

  --set agent.otelConfig='
    receivers:
      otlp/custom-suffix:
        protocols:
          http: {}
    exporters:
      awscloudwatchlogs/custom-suffix:
        log_group_name: "test-group"
        log_stream_name: "test-stream"
    service:
      pipelines:
        logs/custom-suffix:
          receivers: [otlp/custom-suffix]
          exporters: [awscloudwatchlogs/custom-suffix]
'
```

## Enabling APM through Application Signals for your Amazon EKS cluster

By default, OpenTelemetry (OTEL) based Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is enabled through Application Signals when installing either the
CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on (V5.0.0 or greater) or the Helm chart. You can further customize specific settings using the advanced configuration for the Amazon EKS add-on or by overriding values with the Helm chart.

###### Note

If you use any OpenTelemetry (OTEL) based APM solution, enabling Application Signals affects your existing observability setup. Review your current implementation before proceeding.
To maintain your existing APM setup after upgrading to V5.0.0 or later, see [Opt out of Application Signals](#Opting-out-App-Signals).

**Application Signals Auto monitor**

Version 5.0.0 of the CloudWatch Observability Amazon EKS add-on and Helm chart introduces new
functionality. You can now automatically enable Application Signals for all or specific
service workloads in your EKS cluster through the Auto monitor configuration. The
following `autoMonitor` settings can be specified within the
`applicationSignals` section under the `manager` section of the
advanced configuration.

- _monitorAllServices_ – A boolean flag to enable (true)
or disable (false) monitoring of all service workloads by Auto monitor. Defaults to
true. Enabling this flag will ensure that all Kubernetes workloads (Deployments,
DaemonSets, and StatefulSets) in the cluster that are mapped to a Kubernetes Service
will be in scope for automatic enablement of Application Signals when they are brought
up for the first time (or when restarted for existing workloads). The system excludes
workloads in the `kube-system` and `amazon-cloudwatch`
namespaces by default.

- _languages_ – A list of strings specifying the set of
languages that Application Signals will try to automatically instrument your services
with, when `monitorAllServices` is enabled. Defaults to all the [supported languages](cloudwatch-application-monitoring-sections.md).

- _restartPods_ – A boolean flag controls whether
workloads restart after configuration changes. Defaults to false. Enabling this flag
to `true` controls whether Kubernetes workloads within Auto monitor scope
restart automatically when saving configuration changes. Any settings on your
Kubernetes workloads that influence the restart of the pods such as
`updateStrategy` will be considered. Consider that restarting may cause
service downtime.

- _customSelector_ – Settings to select specific
Kubernetes namespaces or workloads for Auto monitor.

- _java_ – Specify workloads to automatically
instrument with Java

- _python_ – Specify workloads to automatically
instrument with Python

- _nodejs_ – Specify workloads to automatically
instrument with Node.js

- _dotnet_ – Specify workloads to automatically
instrument with .NET

For each of the languages above, the following fields can be configured.

- _namespaces_ – A list of strings specifying the
namespaces to be selected. Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

- _deployments_ – A list of strings specifying the
deployments to be selected. Specify in `namespace/deployment` format.
Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

- _daemonsets_ – A list of strings specifying the
daemonsets to be selected. Specify in `namespace/daemonset` format.
Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

- _statefulsets_ – A list of strings specifying the
statefulsets to be selected. Specify in `namespace/statefulset` format.
Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

- _exclude_ – Settings to exclude specific Kubernetes
namespaces or workloads from Auto monitor. Excluding a workload takes precedence when
the same workload is also within scope of `monitorAllServices` or
`customSelector`.

- _java_ – Specify workloads to exclude from being
automatically instrumented with Java

- _python_ – Specify workloads to exclude from being
automatically instrumented with Python

- _nodejs_ – Specify workloads to exclude from being
automatically instrumented with Node.js

- _dotnet_ – Specify workloads to exclude from being
automatically instrumented with .NET

For each of the languages above, the following fields can be configured.

- _namespaces_ – A list of strings specifying the
namespaces to be excluded. Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

- _deployments_ – A list of strings specifying the
deployments to be excluded. Specify in `namespace/deployment` format.
Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

- _daemonsets_ – A list of strings specifying the
daemonsets to be excluded. Specify in `namespace/daemonset` format.
Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

- _statefulsets_ – A list of strings specifying the
statefulsets to be excluded. Specify in `namespace/statefulset` format.
Defaults to an empty list, that is \[\]

The following is an example configuration that automatically enables Application
Signals for all existing and new service workloads on the cluster.

```

manager:
  applicationSignals:
    autoMonitor:
      monitorAllServices: true
      restartPods: true
```

The following is an example configuration that automatically enables Application
Signals for any new service workload that is brought up and for any existing service
workload that is explicitly restarted on the cluster.

```

manager:
  applicationSignals:
    autoMonitor:
      monitorAllServices: true
```

The following is an example configuration that automatically enables Application
Signals with Java for all existing and new pods corresponding to a workload in the
`pet-warehouse` namespace.

```

manager:
  applicationSignals:
    autoMonitor:
      restartPods: true
      customSelector:
        java:
          namespaces: ["pet-warehouse"]
```

The following is an example configuration that automatically enables Application
Signals with Python for all existing and new service workloads in the cluster excluding
the `pet-clinic` deployment.

```

manager:
  applicationSignals:
    autoMonitor:
      monitorAllServices: true
      languages: ["python"]
      restartPods: true
      exclude:
        python:
          deployments: ["pet-warehouse/pet-clinic"]
```

The following is an example configuration that automatically enables Application
Signals with Java for all service workloads in the cluster except for the ones in the
`python-apps` namespace and further enables Application Signals with Python
specifically for the `sample-python-app` deployment in the
`python-apps` namespace.

```

manager:
  applicationSignals:
    autoMonitor:
      monitorAllServices: true
      languages: ["java"]
      restartPods: true
      customSelector:
        python:
          deployments: ["python-apps/sample-python-app"]
      exclude:
        java:
          namespaces: ["python-apps"]
```

## Considerations for large Kubernetes clusters

If you run large Kubernetes clusters, you might need additional configuration
to ensure the CloudWatch agent runs reliably. The following sections describe common issues
and recommended configurations for large clusters.

**Separate agent installations for cluster-level and node-level metrics**

###### Note

This section applies only if you have [Container Insights with enhanced\
observability](container-insights-detailed-metrics.md) enabled. If you use [Container Insights with OpenTelemetry metrics](container-insights-otel-metrics.md)
exclusively, the default installation already deploys separate agent
installations.

By default, the CloudWatch agent runs as a daemonset on each node in your cluster.
One agent Pod is elected as a leader to collect cluster-level metrics. These metrics include
control plane metrics and workload status metrics. On large clusters, this
leader Pod may be terminated with an out-of-memory (OOM) error because it performs additional work while sharing
the same resource limits as all other agent Pods.

To determine if you are experiencing this issue, check for agent Pods
in a failed state with exit code `137` and reason `OOMKilled`. A common symptom
is that one agent Pod (the leader) crashes, a new leader is elected, and that
Pod also crashes, creating a recurring cycle. To confirm this behavior,
inspect the leader election ConfigMap by running the following command.

```nohighlight

kubectl describe configmap cwagent-clusterleader -n amazon-cloudwatch
```

If the ConfigMap shows frequent changes to the leader entry, this indicates
that a new leader is being elected repeatedly, which confirms the issue.

To avoid this issue, you can separate the agent into two installations:

- A daemonset for node-level metrics and Application Signals

- A deployment for cluster-level metrics

This separation lets you manage and scale each installation independently.

To enable this configuration, use the advanced configuration to define two entries
in the `agents` section:

1. Set the `CWAGENT_ROLE` environment
    variable to `NODE` on the daemonset agent.

2. Set the `CWAGENT_ROLE` environment
    variable to `LEADER` on the deployment agent.

###### Important

The deployment agent configuration must enable only Container Insights.
Don't enable Application Signals on the deployment agent. Both installations run with
`hostNetwork` by default, and enabling Application Signals on both
causes port binding conflicts.

The following example shows an advanced configuration that separates the agent
into two installations.

```yaml

agents:
  - name: cloudwatch-agent
    env:
      - name: CWAGENT_ROLE
        value: NODE
  - name: cloudwatch-agent-ci-leader
    mode: deployment
    config:
      {
        "logs": {
          "metrics_collected": {
            "kubernetes": {
              "enhanced_container_insights": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    env:
      - name: CWAGENT_ROLE
        value: LEADER
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 10Gi
        cpu: 2000m
```

In this example, besides setting the `CWAGENT_ROLE` environment variable
on each agent installation, it overrides the default mode, configuration, and resource
limits for the deployment agent only. The base `cloudwatch-agent` installation
uses the defaults.

You can further customize each agent installation by adding
`nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, or `nodeAffinity`
fields to schedule the leader Pod on a specific node. The resource limits
shown in the preceding example are illustrative. Adjust these values based on your
cluster size and the number of metrics that the leader Pod collects.

## Considerations for Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes

Node-level metrics aren't available for hybrid nodes because [Container Insights](containerinsights.md) depends on the
availability of the [EC2 Instance Metadata Service](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.md) (IMDS) for node-level
metrics. Cluster, workload, Pod, and container-level metrics are available
for hybrid nodes.

After you install the add-on, patch the `amazoncloudwatchagents` resource
to add the `RUN_WITH_IRSA` environment variable so the agent runs successfully
on hybrid nodes:

```nohighlight

kubectl patch amazoncloudwatchagents cloudwatch-agent -n amazon-cloudwatch --type=json -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/env/-","value":{"name":"RUN_WITH_IRSA","value":"True"}}]'
```

## Troubleshooting the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart

Use the following information to help troubleshoot problems with the Amazon CloudWatch
Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart

###### Topics

- [Updating and deleting the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart](#EKS-addon-troubleshoot-update)

- [Verify the version of the CloudWatch agent used by the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart](#EKS-addon-troubleshoot-version)

- [Handling a ConfigurationConflict when managing the add-on or the Helm chart](#EKS-addon-troubleshoot-conflict)

### Updating and deleting the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart

For instructions about updating or deleting the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on,
see [Managing Amazon EKS add-ons](../../../eks/latest/userguide/managing-add-ons.md). Use `amazon-cloudwatch-observability` as
the name of the add-on.

To delete the Helm chart in a cluster, enter the following command.

```nohighlight

helm delete amazon-cloudwatch-observability -n amazon-cloudwatch --wait
```

### Verify the version of the CloudWatch agent used by the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart

The Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on and the Helm chart installs a custom resource
of kind `AmazonCloudWatchAgent` that controls the behavior of the CloudWatch agent
daemonset on the cluster, including the version of the CloudWatch agent being used. You can
get a list of all the `AmazonCloudWatchAgent` custom resources installed on
your cluster u by entering the following command:

```nohighlight

kubectl get amazoncloudwatchagent -A
```

In the output of this command, you should be able to check the version of the CloudWatch
agent. Alternatively, you can also describe the `amazoncloudwatchagent`
resource or one of the `cloudwatch-agent-*` pods running on your cluster to
inspect the image being used.

### Handling a ConfigurationConflict when managing the add-on or the Helm chart

When you install or update the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart,
if you notice a failure caused by existing resources, it is likely because you already
have the CloudWatch agent and its associated components such as the ServiceAccount, the
ClusterRole and the ClusterRoleBinding installed on the cluster.

The error displayed by the add-on will include `Conflicts found when
              trying to apply. Will not continue due to resolve conflicts mode`,

The error displayed by the Helm chart will be similar to `Error:
              INSTALLATION FAILED: Unable to continue with install and invalid ownership
              metadata.`.

When the add-on or the Helm chart tries to install the CloudWatch agent and its associated
components, if it detects any change in the contents, it by default fails the
installation or update to avoid overwriting the state of the resources on the
cluster.

If you are trying to onboard to the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on and you see
this failure, we recommend deleting an existing CloudWatch agent setup that you had previously
installed on the cluster and then installing the EKS add-on or Helm chart. Be sure to
back up any customizations you might have made to the original CloudWatch agent setup such as
a custom agent configuration, and provide these to the add-on or Helm chart when you
next install or update it. If you had previously installed the CloudWatch agent for onboarding
to Container Insights, see [Deleting the CloudWatch agent and Fluent Bit for Container Insights](containerinsights-delete-agent.md) for more information.

Alternatively, the add-on supports a conflict resolution configuration option that
has the capability to specify `OVERWRITE`. You can use this option to proceed
with installing or updating the add-on by overwriting the conflicts on the cluster. If
you are using the Amazon EKS console, you'll find the **Conflict resolution**
**method** when you choose the **Optional configuration**
**settings** when you create or update the add-on. If you are using the AWS CLI,
you can supply the `--resolve-conflicts OVERWRITE` to your command to create
or update the add-on.

## Opt out of Application Signals

Fine-tune your service monitoring preferences in the CloudWatch console or with the SDK.

For versions before 5.0.0, to disable Application Signals auto-monitoring, follow the procedure below:

**Using CLI or SDK**

The following configuration can be applied either as an advanced configuration to the EKS add-on or as a values override when using the helm chart.

```

{
  "manager": {
    "applicationSignals": {
      "autoMonitor": {
        "monitorAllServices": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your services for the changes to take effect.

**Using the console**

Open the CloudWatch console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

1. In the navigation pane, under **Application Signals (APM)**, choose **Services**.

2. Choose **Enable Application Signals** to view the enablement page.

3. Clear the **Auto-Monitor** checkbox for each service you don't want to monitor.

4. Restart your services for the changes to take effect.
