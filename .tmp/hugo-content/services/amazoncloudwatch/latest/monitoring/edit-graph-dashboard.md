# Editing a graph on a CloudWatch dashboard

You can edit the graphs that you add to your CloudWatch dashboard. You can change a
graph's title, statistic, or period. You can add, update, and remove metrics
from your graphs. If your graph contains more than one metric, you can
reduce
clutter by
hiding
metrics that you aren't
using.
The procedures in this section describe how
to
edit a graph on your dashboard. For information about creating a graph, see [Add or remove a graph from a CloudWatch\
dashboard](add-remove-graph-dashboard.md).

###### To edit a graph on a dashboard

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Dashboards**,
     and then
     choose
     a dashboard.

03. In the upper-right corner
     of the graph
     that you want to edit,
     choose **Widget actions**,
     and then choose **Edit**.

04. To change the graph's title,
     choose the pen and paper icon
     that's next
     to the current title.
     Enter the new title,
     and then choose **Apply**.

05. (Optional) To change your graph's time range, select one of the predefined
     time ranges in the upper are of the graph. The time ranges span
     from 1 hour to 1 week ( **_1h_**,
     **_3h_**,
     **_12h_**,
     **_1d_**,
     **_3d_**, or
     **_1w_**).

     To set your own time range,
     choose **Custom**.

    1. (Optional) To have this widget keep using this time range that you select, even
        if the time range for the rest of the dashboard is later changed, choose **Persist time range**.
06. To change your graph's widget type, use
     dropdown
     that's next to the predefined time ranges.

07. In **Graphed metrics**, you can add a
     dynamic label to your metric and change your metric's label,
     label color, statistic, and period. You also can determine
     the position of labels on the
     Y-axis
     from left to right.
    1. To add a dynamic label
        for a metric,
        choose **Dynamic labels**.
        Dynamic labels display a statistic
        about the metric
        in the graph legend.
        Dynamic labels update automatically
        when your dashboard or graph refreshes.
        By default,
        the dynamic values
        that you add
        to labels
        appear
        at the beginning
        of the labels.
        For more information,
        see [Use dynamic labels](graph-dynamic-labels.md).

    2. To change the color
        of a metric,
        choose the color square
        that's next
        to the metric.

    3. To change the statistic,
        choose the statistic value
        under the **_Statistic_** column,
        and then choose a new value.
        For more information,
        see [Statistics](cloudwatch-concepts.md#Statistic).

    4. To change the period,
        choose the period value
        under the **_Period_** column,
        and then choose a new value.
08. To add or edit horizontal annotations,
     choose **Options**:

    1. To add a horizontal annotation,
        choose **Add horizontal annotation**.

    2. For **Label**,
        choose the pen and paper icon
        next
        to the current annotation.
        Then enter your new annotation.
        After you enter your annotation,
        choose the check mark icon.

    3. For **Value**,
        choose the pen and paper icon
        next
        to the current metric value.
        Then enter your new metric value.
        After you enter your value,
        select the check mark icon.

    4. For **Fill**,
        choose the dropdown
        under the column,
        and then specify
        how your annotation will use shading.
        You can choose **None**, **Above**, **Between**, or **Below**.
        If you choose **Between**,
        another new label and value field appears.

       ###### Tip

       You can change the fill color
       by choosing the colored square
       next
       to the annotation.

    5. For **Axis**,
        specify whether your annotation
        appears on the left or right side
        of the Y-axis.

    6. To hide an annotation,
        deselect the check box
        next to the annotation
        that you want
        to hide
        on the graph.

    7. To delete an annotation,
        choose **X**
        under the **Actions** column.

       ###### Note

       You can repeat these steps
       to add multiple horizontal annotations
       to the same graph.
09. To add or edit vertical annotations,
     choose **Options**:

    1. To add a vertical annotation,
        choose **Add vertical annotation**.

    2. For **Label**,
        choose the pen and paper icon
        next
        to the current annotation.
        Then enter your new annotation.
        After you enter your annotation,
        choose the check mark icon.

       ###### Tip

       To show only the date and time,
       leave the label field blank.

    3. For **Date**,
        choose the current date and time.
        Then enter the new date and time.

    4. For **Fill**,
        choose the dropdown
        under the column,
        and then specify
        how your annotation will use shading.
        You can choose **None**, **Above**, **Between**, or **Below**.
        If you choose **Between**,
        a new label and value field appears.

       ###### Tip

       You can change the fill color
       by choosing the color square
       next
       to the annotation.

       ###### Note

       You can repeat these steps
       to add multiple vertical annotations
       to the same graph.

    5. To hide an annotation,
        deselect the check box
        next to the annotation
        that you want
        to hide
        on the graph.

    6. To delete an annotation,
        choose **X**
        under the **Actions** column.
10. To customize the Y-axis, choose **Options**.
     Under **_Left Y-axis_**,
     you can enter a custom label for **Label**.
     If the graph displays values on the right Y-axis, you can
     customize that label, too. You also can set minimums and
     maximums on the Y-axis values, so
     that
     the graph displays only the value range
     that you specify.

11. When you finish making changes,
     choose **Update widget**.

###### To hide or change the position of a graph legend

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

    choose **Widget actions**. Choose
    **Legend**
    and select **Hidden**,
    **Bottom**, or

###### To temporarily hide metrics for a graph on a dashboard

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Dashboards**, and
    then
    choose

3. Select the color square for the metric that you want to hide
    in the graph's footer. An
    **_X_** appears in
    the color square when you hover over it, and the square
    turns
    gray
    when you choose it.

4. To restore the hidden metric, clear the
    **X** in the
    gray
    square.
