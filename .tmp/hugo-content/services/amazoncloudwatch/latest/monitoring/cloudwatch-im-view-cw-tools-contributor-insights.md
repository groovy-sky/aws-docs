# Use Contributor Insights to identify top locations and ISPs

CloudWatch Contributor Insights can help you identify top client locations and ASNs (typically, internet service providers or ISPs)
for your AWS application. Use the following sample Contributor Insights rules to get started with rules that are useful with Internet Monitor.
For more information, see [Create a Contributor Insights rule in CloudWatch](contributorinsights-createrule.md).

To learn more about client location accuracy in Internet Monitor, see [Geolocation information and accuracy in Internet Monitor](cloudwatch-im-inside-internet-monitor.md#IMGeolocationSourceAccuracy).

###### Note

Internet Monitor stores internet measurements data every five minutes, so after you set up a Contributor Insights rule,
you must adjust the period to five minutes to see a graph.

**View top locations and ASNs**
**impacted by an availability impact**

To view top client locations and ASNs impacted by a drop in availability, you can use the following Contributor Insights rule
in the Syntax editor. Replace `monitor-name` with your own monitor name.

```nohighlight

{
    "Schema": {
        "Name": "CloudWatchLogRule",
        "Version": 1
    },
    "AggregateOn": "Sum",
    "Contribution": {
        "Filters": [
            {
                "Match": "$.clientLocation.city",
                "IsPresent": true
            }
        ],
        "Keys": [
            "$.clientLocation.city",
            "$.clientLocation.networkName"
        ],
        "ValueOf": "$.awsInternetHealth.availability.percentageOfTotalTrafficImpacted"
    },
    "LogFormat": "JSON",
    "LogGroupNames": [
        "/aws/internet-monitor/monitor-name/byCity"
    ]
}
```

**View top client locations and ASNs impacted by a latency impact**

To view top client locations and ASNs impacted by an increase in round-trip time (latency), you can use the following Contributor Insights rule in the
Syntax editor. Replace `monitor-name` with your own monitor name.

```nohighlight

{
    "Schema": {
        "Name": "CloudWatchLogRule",
        "Version": 1
    },
    "AggregateOn": "Sum",
    "Contribution": {
        "Filters": [            {
                "Match": "$.clientLocation.city",
                "IsPresent": true
            }
        ],
        "Keys": [
            "$.clientLocation.city",
            "$.clientLocation.networkName"
        ],
        "ValueOf": "$.awsInternetHealth.performance.percentageOfTotalTrafficImpacted"
    },
    "LogFormat": "JSON",
    "LogGroupNames": [
        "/aws/internet-monitor/monitor-name/byCity"
    ]
}
```

**View top client locations and ASNs impacted by**
**total percentage of traffic**

To view top client locations and ASNs impacted by total percentage of traffic, you can use the following Contributor Insights rule in the
Syntax editor. Replace `monitor-name` with your own monitor name.

```nohighlight

{
    "Schema": {
        "Name": "CloudWatchLogRule",
        "Version": 1
    },
    "AggregateOn": "Sum",
    "Contribution": {
        "Filters": [
            {
                "Match": "$.clientLocation.city",
                "IsPresent": true
            }
        ],
        "Keys": [
            "$.clientLocation.city",
            "$.clientLocation.networkName"
        ],
        "ValueOf": "$.percentageOfTotalTraffic"
    },
    "LogFormat": "JSON",
    "LogGroupNames": [
        "/aws/internet-monitor/monitor-name/byCity"
    ]
}
```
