# Viewing Container Insights metrics

After you have Container Insights set up and it is collecting metrics, you can view those
metrics in the CloudWatch console.

For Container Insights metrics to appear on your dashboard, you must complete the
Container Insights setup. For more information, see [Setting up Container Insights](deploy-container-insights.md).

This procedure explains how to view the metrics that Container Insights automatically
generates from the collected log data. The rest of this section explains how to further dive
into your data and use CloudWatch Logs Insights to see more metrics at more levels of
granularity.

###### To view Container Insights metrics

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Insights**, **Container**
**Insights**.

3. Use the drop-down boxes near the top to select the type of resource to view, as well
    as the specific resource.

You can set a CloudWatch alarm on any metric that Container Insights collects. For more
information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](cloudwatch-alarms.md)

###### Note

If you have already set up CloudWatch Application Insights to monitor your containerized
applications, the Application Insights dashboard appears below the Container Insights
dashboard. If you have not already enabled Application Insights, you can do so by choosing
**Auto-configure Application Insights** below the performance view in the
Container Insights dashboard.

For more information about Application Insights and containerized applications, see
[Enable Application Insights for Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS resource monitoring](appinsights-setting-up-console.md#appinsights-container-insights).

## Viewing the top contributors

For some of the views in Container Insights performance monitoring, you can also see the
top contributors by memory or CPU, or the most recently active resources. This is available
when you select any of the following dashboards in the drop-down box near the top of the
page:

- ECS Services

- ECS Tasks

- EKS Namespaces

- EKS Services

- EKS Pods

When you are viewing one of these types of resources, the bottom of the page displays a
table sorted initially by CPU usage. You can change it to sort by memory usage or recent
activity. To see more about one of the rows in the table, you can select the checkbox next
to that row and then choose **Actions** and choose one of the options in
the **Actions** menu.

## Using CloudWatch Logs Insights to view Container Insights data

Container Insights collects metrics by using performance log events with using [embedded metric format](cloudwatch-embedded-metric-format.md). The logs are
stored in CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch generates several metrics automatically from the logs which you
can view in the CloudWatch console. You can also do a deeper analysis of the performance data that
is collected by using CloudWatch Logs Insights queries.

For more information about CloudWatch Logs Insights, see [Analyze Log Data with CloudWatch Logs Insights](../logs/analyzinglogdata.md). For more information about the log fields you can
use in queries, see [Container Insights performance log events for Amazon EKS and Kubernetes](container-insights-reference-performance-logs-eks.md).

###### To use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query your container metric data

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, **Logs**
**Insights**.

Near the top of the screen is the query editor. When you first open CloudWatch Logs Insights, this
    box contains a default query that returns the 20 most recent log events.

3. In the box above the query editor, select one of the Container Insights log groups
    to query. For the following example queries to work, the log group name must end with
    **performance**.

When you select a log group, CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically detects fields in the data in the
    log group and displays them in **Discovered fields** in the right pane.
    It also displays a bar graph of log events in this log group over time. This bar graph
    shows the distribution of events in the log group that matches your query and time
    range, not only the events displayed in the table.

4. In the query editor, replace the default query with the following query and choose
    **Run query**.

```

STATS avg(node_cpu_utilization) as avg_node_cpu_utilization by NodeName
| SORT avg_node_cpu_utilization DESC

```

This query shows a list of nodes, sorted by average node CPU utilization.

5. To try another example, replace that query with another query and choose
    **Run query**. More sample queries are listed later on this
    page.

```

STATS avg(number_of_container_restarts) as avg_number_of_container_restarts by PodName
| SORT avg_number_of_container_restarts DESC

```

This query displays a list of your pods, sorted by average number of container
    restarts.

6. If you want to try another query, you can use include fields in the list at the
    right of the screen. For more information about query syntax, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Syntax](../logs/cwl-querysyntax.md).

###### To see lists of your resources

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Resources**.

3. The default view is a list of your resources being monitored by Container Insights,
    and alarms that you have set on these resources. To see a visual map of the resources,
    choose **Map view**.

4. From the map view, you can pause your pointer over any resource in the map to see
    basic metrics about that resource. You can choose any resource to see more detailed
    graphs about the resource.

## Use case: Seeing task-level metrics in Amazon ECS containers

The following example illustrates how to use CloudWatch Logs Insights to dive deeper into your
Container Insights logs. For more examples, see the blog [Introducing Amazon CloudWatch\
Container Insights for Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/introducing-container-insights-for-amazon-ecs).

Container Insights does not automatically generate metrics at the Task level of
granularity. The following query displays task-level metrics for CPU and memory
usage.

```

stats avg(CpuUtilized) as CPU, avg(MemoryUtilized) as Mem by TaskId, ContainerName
| sort Mem, CPU desc

```

## Other sample queries for Container Insights

**List of your pods, sorted by average number of container**
**restarts**

```

STATS avg(number_of_container_restarts) as avg_number_of_container_restarts by PodName
| SORT avg_number_of_container_restarts DESC

```

**Pods requested vs. pods running**

```

fields @timestamp, @message
| sort @timestamp desc
| filter Type="Pod"
| stats min(pod_number_of_containers) as requested, min(pod_number_of_running_containers) as running, ceil(avg(pod_number_of_containers-pod_number_of_running_containers)) as pods_missing by kubernetes.pod_name
| sort pods_missing desc
```

**Count of cluster node failures**

```

stats avg(cluster_failed_node_count) as CountOfNodeFailures
| filter Type="Cluster"
| sort @timestamp desc
```

**Application log errors by container name**

```

stats count() as countoferrors by kubernetes.container_name
| filter stream="stderr"
| sort countoferrors desc

```
