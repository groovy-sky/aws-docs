# Retrieve custom metrics with StatsD

You can retrieve additional custom metrics from your applications or services using
the CloudWatch agent with the `StatsD` protocol. StatsD is a popular open-source
solution that can gather metrics from a wide variety of applications. StatsD is especially
useful for instrumenting your own metrics. For an example of using the CloudWatch agent and
StatsD together, see [How to better monitor your custom application metrics using Amazon CloudWatch\
Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/new-how-to-better-monitor-your-custom-application-metrics-using-amazon-cloudwatch-agent).

`StatsD` is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows
Server. CloudWatch supports the following `StatsD` format:

```nohighlight

MetricName:value|type|@sample_rate|#tag1:
  value,tag1...
```

- `MetricName` – A string with no colons, bars, # characters, or @
characters.

- `value` – This can be either integer or float.

- `type` – Specify `c` for counter, `g` for
gauge, `ms` for timer, `h` for histogram, or `s` for
set.

- `sample_rate` – (Optional) A float between 0 and 1, inclusive.
Use only for counter, histogram, and timer metrics. The default value is 1 (sampling
100% of the time).

- `tags` – (Optional) A comma-separated list of tags.
`StatsD` tags are similar to dimensions in CloudWatch. Use colons for key/value
tags, such as `env:prod`.

You can use any `StatsD` client that follows this format to send the
metrics to the CloudWatch agent. For more information about some of the available
`StatsD` clients, see the [StatsD client page on\
GitHub](https://github.com/etsy/statsd/wiki).

To collect these custom metrics, add a `"statsd": {}` line to the
`metrics_collected` section of the agent configuration file. You can add this
line manually. If you use the wizard to create the configuration file, it's done for you.
For more information, see [Create the CloudWatch agent configuration file](create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file.md).

The `StatsD` default configuration works for most users. There are optional
fields that you can add to the **statsd** section of the agent
configuration file as needed:

- `service_address` – The service address to which the CloudWatch agent
should listen. The format is
`ip:port`. If you
omit the IP address, the agent listens on all available interfaces. Only the UDP
format is supported, so you don't need to specify a UDP prefix.

The default value is `:8125`.

- `metrics_collection_interval` – How often in seconds that the
`StatsD` plugin runs and collects metrics. The default value is 10
seconds. The range is 1–172,000.

- `metrics_aggregation_interval` – How often in seconds CloudWatch
aggregates metrics into single data points. The default value is 60 seconds.

For example, if `metrics_collection_interval` is 10 and
`metrics_aggregation_interval` is 60, CloudWatch collects data every 10
seconds. After each minute, the six data readings from that minute are aggregated into
a single data point, which is sent to CloudWatch.

The range is 0–172,000. Setting `metrics_aggregation_interval`
to 0 disables the aggregation of `StatsD` metrics.

- `allowed_pending_messages` – The number of UDP messages that are
allowed to queue up. When the queue is full, the StatsD server starts dropping
packets. The default value is 10000.

- `drop_original_metrics` – Optional. If you are using the
`aggregation_dimensions` field in the `metrics` section to
roll up metrics into aggregated results, then by default the agent sends both the
aggregated metrics and the original metrics that are separated for each value of the
dimension. If you don't want the original metrics to be sent to CloudWatch, you can specify
this parameter with a list of metrics. The metrics specified along with this parameter
don't have their metrics by dimension reported to CloudWatch. Instead, only the aggregated
metrics are reported. This reduces the number of metrics that the agent collects,
reducing your costs.

The following is an example of the **statsd** section of the agent
configuration file, using the default port and custom collection and aggregation
intervals.

```json

{
   "metrics":{
      "metrics_collected":{
         "statsd":{
            "service_address":":8125",
            "metrics_collection_interval":60,
            "metrics_aggregation_interval":300
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## Viewing StatsD metrics imported by the CloudWatch agent

After importing StatsD metrics into CloudWatch, you can view these metrics as time series
graphs, and create alarms that can watch these metrics and notify you if they breach a
threshold that you specify. The following procedure shows how to view StatsD metrics as
a time series graph. For more information about setting alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](cloudwatch-alarms.md).

###### To view StatsD metrics in the CloudWatch console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**.

3. Choose the namespace for the metrics collected by the agent. By default, this is
    **CWAgent**, but you may have specified a different namespace in
    the CloudWatch agent configuration file.

4. Choose a metric dimension (for example, **Per-Instance**
**Metrics**).

5. The **All metrics** tab displays all metrics for that dimension
    in the namespace. You can do the following:
1. To graph a metric, select the check box next to the metric. To select all
       metrics, select the check box in the heading row of the table.

2. To sort the table, use the column heading.

3. To filter by resource, choose the resource ID and then choose **Add**
      **to search**.

4. To filter by metric, choose the metric name and then choose **Add to**
      **search**.
6. (Optional) To add this graph to a CloudWatch dashboard, choose
    **Actions**, **Add to dashboard**.
