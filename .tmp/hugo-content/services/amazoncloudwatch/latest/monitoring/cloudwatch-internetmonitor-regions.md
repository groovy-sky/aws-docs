# Supported AWS Regions for Internet Monitor

The AWS Regions and AWS Local Zones where Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor is supported are listed in this section. For more information about Regions that
Internet Monitor is supported in, including opt-in Regions, see [Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor \
endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/cwim-region.md) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

Note that Internet Monitor stores data for a monitor in only the AWS Region in which you create the monitor, although a monitor
can include resources in multiple Regions.
