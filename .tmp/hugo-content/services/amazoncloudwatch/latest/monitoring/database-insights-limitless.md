# Monitoring Aurora Limitless databases with Database Insights

Database Insights supports monitoring [Aurora PostgreSQL\
Limitless Databases](../../../amazonrds/latest/aurorauserguide/user-databaseinsights-engines.md) at both the fleet and instance levels. Your Aurora PostgreSQL
Limitless Databases are discoverable in both the Database Instance Dashboard and the Fleet
Health Dashboard.

Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Databases use _shard groups_. Each shard group
consists of multiple database instances that work together to process distributed workloads.
Database Insights helps you understand the load distribution among the instances within a shard
group.

In the Fleet Health Dashboard, Database Insights provides monitoring of your Limitless shard groups
together with the rest of databases that make up your database fleets. You can get an
opinionated view of health and DBLoad utlilization for your Limitless shard groups in the
same way you do for other databases in the fleet. In the Instance Dashboard, Database Insights
provides monitoring at both the shard group level and for individual instances within the
group. Database Insights provides a new view per shard group where you can see database load
distributed across the instances in the shard group. From there, you can navigate to the
specific instance dashboard within a shard group.

###### Note

Enhanced Monitoring is automatically enabled for Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless
Databases. Enhanced Monitoring incurs additional charges. For more information, see
[Cost of Enhanced Monitoring](../../../amazonrds/latest/aurorauserguide/user-monitoring-os.md#USER_Monitoring.OS.cost).

For Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Databases, logs are automatically published to CloudWatch Logs
and are discoverable in the Database Insights console. This incurs additional charges,
following standard CloudWatch Logs pricing. For details about how CloudWatch Logs and Database Insights are priced
and pricing examples, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls).

## Monitoring Aurora Limitless shard groups in the Fleet Health Dashboard

Database Insights supports monitoring Aurora Limitless shard groups in the Fleet Health
Dashboard.

In this view, you can see your Limitless shard groups alongside other databases that
make up your database fleets. The Fleet Health Dashboard provides an opinionated view of
health and DBLoad utilization for your Limitless shard groups, similar to how it
presents information for other databases in the fleet.

![Database Insights Fleet Health Dashboard. The main panel shows a hexagonal grid representing database instances, with one highlighted for 'shardgroup2'. It displays DB Load Utilization for Routers and Shards. The top right shows a graph of 'Top 10 instances per DB Load Utilization' over time. Below are details for 'db-microsoftsqlserver-enterprise-1-dbi-advanced' including top queries and wait events. The bottom sections show no critical events and no calling services. The left sidebar indicates 44 total instances with 2 in alarm state, and an average DB Load Utilization of 25.1%.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_fhd.png)

When viewing Aurora Limitless databases in the Fleet Health Dashboard:

- Only shard groups are visible, not individual instances

- Shard groups appear in the following widgets:

- The honeycomb chart

- The top 10 by DBLoad

- Events

- Calling Services

- The table list

- DBLoad utilization is provided for both routers and shards

This fleet-level view allows you to monitor and compare the performance of your Aurora
Limitless shard groups with other databases in your fleet, providing a comprehensive
overview of your entire database fleet.

![Database Insights dashboard showing a list of database instances. The table displays 7 instances with their DB Identifier, Alarm state, Engine type, DB Load Utilization, Last state update, and Database version. Engines include PostgreSQL, SQL Server Enterprise, Oracle Standard, Aurora MySQL, and Aurora PostgreSQL. The SQL Server instance has the highest load at 25.21%. Two Aurora PostgreSQL instances are labeled as 'Limitless' and show separate utilization for Shards and Routers. The interface includes options for filtering, sorting, and viewing additional details.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_fhd-limitless-list-view.png)

## Monitoring Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Databases in the Instance Dashboard

Database Insights works similarly for Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database as it does for standard
Aurora DB clusters. However, you track metrics at the shard group level for
Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database. The two main metrics to track are the
following:

- **Database load** – Measures the level of
activity in your database. The key metric is `DBLoad`, which is
collected every second. The unit for the `DBLoad` metric is average
active sessions (AAS). To get the average active sessions, Database Insights samples the
number of sessions concurrently running a query. The AAS is the total number of
sessions divided by the total number of samples for a specific time
period.

- **Maximum CPU** – The maximum
computational power available to your database. To see whether active sessions
are exceeding the maximum CPU, look at their relationship to the `Max
                          vCPU` line. The `Max vCPU` value is determined by the
number of vCPU (virtual CPU) cores for your DB instance.

You can also "slice" the `DBLoad` metric into dimensions, which are
subcategories of the metric. The most useful dimensions are the following:

- **Top instances** – Shows the relative DB
load for your instances (shards and routers) in descending order.

- **Wait events** – Cause SQL statements to
wait for specific events to happen before they can continue running. Wait events
indicate where work is impeded.

- **Top SQL** – Shows which queries
contribute the most to DB load.

![Database Insights dashboard showing database performance metrics. The top section displays a line graph tracking database activity from 12:00 to 14:45 on July 14. Below, the DB Load Analysis tab shows a "Top instances" view listing 4 database instances (DTR-3-757, DTR-2-903, DAS-4-112, and DAS-5-992) with their load utilization metrics, all showing values less than 0.01 AAS (Average Active Sessions). The interface includes options for alarm states, filters, and various analysis views.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_limitless-top-instances.png)

## Analyze DB load for Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Databases with Database Insights

With Database Insights, you can track metrics at the shard group level and at the instance level
for an Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database. When analyzing DB load for an Aurora
PostgreSQL Limitless Database, you might want to compare the DB load for each shard and
router to the maximum vCPU.

The Absolute view shows the number of Average active sessions (AAS) and the estimated
vCPU. The Relative view shows the ratio of AAS to the estimated vCPU.

The interface displays a time series graph of average active sessions (AAS) and a pie chart showing load distribution across 5 database instances. The pie chart indicates a total of 261 AAS with percentages split between instances DTR-2-103, DTR-3-650, DAS-4-659, DAS-5-784, and DAS-6-336. The dashboard includes filters, alarm states, and database telemetry options."](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_limitless-doughnut.png)
