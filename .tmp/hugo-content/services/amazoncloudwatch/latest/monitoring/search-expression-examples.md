# CloudWatch search expression examples

The following examples illustrate more search expression uses and syntax. Let's start
with a search for `CPUUtilization` across all instances in the Region and then
look at variations.

This example displays one line for each instance in the Region, showing the
`CPUUtilization` metric from the `AWS/EC2` namespace.

```sql

SEARCH(' {AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName="CPUUtilization" ', 'Average')
```

Changing `InstanceId` to `InstanceType` changes the graph to show
one line for each instance type used in the Region. Data from all instances of each type is
aggregated into one line for that instance type.

```sql

SEARCH(' {AWS/EC2,InstanceType} MetricName="CPUUtilization" ', 'Average')
```

The following example aggregates the `CPUUtilization` by instance type and
displays one line for each instance type that includes the string `micro`.

```sql

SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceType} InstanceType=micro MetricName="CPUUtilization" ', 'Average')
```

This example narrows the previous example, changing the `InstanceType` to an
exact search for t2.micro instances.

```sql

SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceType} InstanceType="t2.micro" MetricName="CPUUtilization" ', 'Average')
```

The following search removes the `{metric schema}` part of the query, so the
`CPUUtilization` metric from all namespaces appears in the graph. This can
return quite a few results because the graph includes multiple lines for the
`CPUUtilization` metric from each AWS service, aggregated along different
dimensions.

```sql

SEARCH('MetricName="CPUUtilization" ', 'Average')
```

To narrow these results a bit, you can specify two specific metric namespaces.

```sql

SEARCH('MetricName="CPUUtilization" AND ("AWS/ECS" OR "AWS/ES") ', 'Average')
```

The preceding example is the only way to do a search of specific multiple namespaces
with one search query, as you can specify only one metric schema in each query. However, to
add more structure, you could use two queries in the graph, as in the following example.
This example also adds more structure by specifying a dimension to use to aggregate the data
for Amazon ECS.

```sql

SEARCH('{AWS/ECS ClusterName}, MetricName="CPUUtilization" ', 'Average')
SEARCH(' {AWS/EBS} MetricName="CPUUtilization" ', 'Average')
```

The following example returns the Elastic Load Balancing metric named `ConsumedLCUs` as well
as all Elastic Load Balancing metrics or dimensions that contain the token `flow`.

```sql

SEARCH('{AWS/NetworkELB, LoadBalancer} "ConsumedLCUs" OR flow ', 'Maximum')
```

The following example uses nested grouping. It returns Lambda metrics for
`Errors` from all functions and `Invocations` of functions with
names that include the strings `ProjectA` or `ProjectB`.

```sql

SEARCH('{AWS/Lambda,FunctionName} MetricName="Errors" OR (MetricName="Invocations" AND (ProjectA OR ProjectB)) ', 'Average')
```

The following example displays all of your custom metrics, excluding metrics generated
by AWS services.

```sql

SEARCH('NOT Namespace=AWS ', 'Average')
```

The following example displays metrics with metric names, namespaces, dimension names,
and dimension values that contain the string `Errors` as part of their
name.

```sql

SEARCH('Errors', 'Average')
```

The following example narrows that search to exact matches. For example, this search
finds the metric name `Errors` but not metrics named
`ConnectionErrors` or `errors`.

```sql

SEARCH(' "Errors" ', 'Average')
```

The following example shows how to specify names that contain spaces or special
characters in the metric schema part of the search term.

```sql

SEARCH('{"Custom-Namespace", "Dimension Name With Spaces"}, ErrorCount ', 'Maximum')
```

## CloudWatch cross-account observability search expression examples

**CloudWatch cross-account observability examples**

If you are signed in to an account that is set up as a monitoring account in CloudWatch
cross-account observability, you can use the **SEARCH** function to
return metrics from specified source accounts. For more information, see [CloudWatch cross-account observability](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md).

The following example retrieves all Lambda metrics from the account with the account ID
111122223333.

```sql

SEARCH(' AWS/Lambda :aws.AccountId = 111122223333 ', 'Average')
```

The following example retrieves all `AWS/EC2` metrics from two accounts:
111122223333 and 777788889999.

```sql

SEARCH(' AWS/EC2 :aws.AccountId = (111122223333 OR 777788889999) ', 'Average')
```

The following example retrieves all `AWS/EC2` metrics from the source
account 111122223333 and from the monitoring account itself.

```sql

SEARCH(' AWS/EC2 :aws.AccountId = (111122223333 OR 'LOCAL') ', 'Average')
```

The following example retrieves the `SUM` of the `MetaDataToken`
metric from the account `444455556666` with the
`InstanceId` dimension.

```sql

SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} :aws.AccountId=444455556666 MetricName=\"MetadataNoToken\"','Sum')
```
