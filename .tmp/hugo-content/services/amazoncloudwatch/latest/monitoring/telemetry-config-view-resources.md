# Viewing AWS resource telemetry in CloudWatch

The Telemetry configuration and auditing experience displays AWS resources in two places:
As an overview, on the **Telemetry config** page and in detail, on the
**Discovered data sources** page.

- **Ingestion - Data source Tab** – This page shows the AWS resources that you can
send to CloudWatch. For specific resource types percentage of resources with telemetry that are configured and the
total number of resources detected. You can filter the display of resources in the
**Data source** tab by account ID or by the tags applied to your resources.

- **Discovered Resources** – This page shows details about each
AWS resource that has been discovered by telemetry configuration and auditing experience,
including the resource ID, the type of telemetry each resource is providing, and the time when information
about the resource was last refreshed by telemetry configuration. You can filter the display of resource on the
**view data sources** page by any of the information provided about the
resource.

For each AWS resource tracked by CloudWatch, the **Discovered data**
**sources** page shows the status of its telemetry by providing the following
information:

- For telemetry types that CloudWatch detects that the resource is sending to CloudWatch, the
**Discovered data sources** page shows **On**.

- For telemetry types that CloudWatch detects the resource is not providing, the
**Discovered data sources** page shows **Off**.

- For telemetry types that are not supported for a resource, the **Discovered**
**resources** page shows **NS**, that is, not supported.

###### To view resources on the **Ingestion** page

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Ingestion**.

3. The **Ingestion** page shows the total number of each resource that was
    discovered by CloudWatch, the number of resources providing telemetry, and the percentage of
    discovered resources that are providing telemetry.

4. To see recent changes to resources, choose **Refresh**.

###### To view resources on the **Discovered resources** page

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Ingestion**.

3. Do one of the following to view all resource types discovered by telemetry configuration
    or to view one resource type:
1. To view all resources that have been discovered by CloudWatch, click **View data**
      **sources**. The **Discovered data sources** page appears and shows
       all resources discovered.

2. To view one resource type,click the name of the AWS resource type in the
       **Ingestion > Data Source Tab**. The **Discovered data**
      **source** page appears. The **Discovered data sources** page shows
       that a filter has been applied for that data source and now displays all discovered resources
       for that resource type.
4. On the **Discovered data sources** page, to view information about the
    resource or to change its telemetry settings, click the resource ID. The console page for the
    AWS resource will open, navigate to the configuration setting and turn on or off the
    configuration.

- ###### Note

You can only view a resource on its console page if the resource belongs to your
account. To determine if the resource belongs to your account, check the
**AWS account** column. If the **AWS account** column
does not appear, change your the **Discovered data sources** page
preferences. For more information, see [Changing preferences for the Discovered data sources page](#telemetry-config-resource-view-prefs).

## Filtering discovered resources

You can use one or more filters on the **Ingestion > Data Sources** page
for the **Discovered data sources** page to change your view of the resources.
Your filter settings persist across both pages.

###### To filter resources on the **Data Sources** page

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Ingestion**, and then choose
    **Data Sources Tab**.

3. You can filter the discovered resources that are displayed on the page by specifying an
    account ID or tag value.
1. Choose **Find resource**.

2. Choose **Account ID** or **Tag value**, and then
       choose additional options for the filter. Statistics about telemetry coverage for each
       resource change based on your filter options.
4. To remove a filter, in the filter text box, choose **X**.

###### To filter resources on the **Discovered Data sources** page

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Ingestion**.

3. To view all resource types discovered by telemetry configuration or to view one resource
    type, do one of the following:
1. To view all resources discovered by CloudWatch, choose **View data**
      **sources**. The **Discovered data sources** page appears and shows
       all resources discovered.

2. To view one resource type, at the bottom of the page, choose a type of AWS resource.
       The **Discovered data sources** page appears. The **Discovered**
      **resources** page filters all discovered resources for that resource type.
4. You can filter the resources displayed in the page based on any of the columns in the
    page. You can change the columns in the page by changing your preferences for the
    **Discovered data sources** page. For more information, see [Changing preferences for the Discovered data sources page](#telemetry-config-resource-view-prefs).
1. Choose **Find resource**. Filters for each column in the page appear.
       Choose one, then choose additional options to define the filter. Resources appear in the
       page that match the filter settings.

2. To further filter the resources displayed in the page, choose **Find**
      **resources** again, choose another filter, and choose additional options. Resources
       appear in the page that match all of the filter settings.
5. To remove one of the filters, in the filter text box, choose
    **X**.

6. To remove all of the filters and see all resource types discovered, choose
    **Clear filters**.

## Changing preferences for the Discovered data sources page

You can change your preferences for the **Discovered data sources** page
to control how many resources appear per page and which detailed metrics appear in the page.
Only detailed metrics in view can be used to filter the resources displayed in the discovered
resources page. For more information, see [Filtering discovered resources](#telemetry-config-filter-resource-view).
