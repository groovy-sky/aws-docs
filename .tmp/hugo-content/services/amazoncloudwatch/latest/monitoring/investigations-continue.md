# View and continue an open investigation

Use the steps in this section to view and continue and existing investigation

###### To view and continue an investigation

1. If you aren't already on the page for the investigation, do the
    following:
1. Open the CloudWatch console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **AI**
      **Operations**, **Investigations**.

3. Choose the name of the investigation.
2. The **Feed** section displays the items that have been added
    to the investigation findings, including the metric or alarm that was originally
    selected to start the investigation with.

The pane on the right includes tabs. Choose the
    **Suggestions** tab.

3. The **Suggestions** tab displays
    _observations_ of other telemetry that CloudWatch investigations has found
    that might be related to the investigation. It might also include
    _hypotheses_, which are possible reasons or root causes
    that CloudWatch investigations has found for the situation.

Both observations and hypotheses are written in natural language by
    CloudWatch investigations.

You have several options:
   - For each suggestion, you can choose **Accept** or
      **Discard**.

     When you choose **Accept**, the suggestion is added
      to the **Feed** section, and CloudWatch investigations uses this information
      to direct further scanning and suggestions.

     If you choose **Discard**, the suggestion is moved to
      the **Discarded** tab.

   - For each observation-type suggestion, you can choose to expand the
      graph in the **Suggestions** tab, or open it in the
      CloudWatch console to see more details about it.

   - Some of the observations might be results of CloudWatch Logs Insights queries
      that CloudWatch investigations ran as part of the investigation. When an observation is a
      CloudWatch Logs Insights query result, the query itself is displayed as part of
      the observation. You can edit the query and re-run it. To do so, choose
      the vertical ellipsis menu icon ![An example of a CloudWatch overview home page, showing alarms and their current state, and examples of other metrics graph widgets that might appear on the overview home page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/vmore.png) by the results, and then choose **Open in**
     **Logs Insights**. For more information, see [Analyzing\
      log data with CloudWatch Logs Insights](../logs/analyzinglogdata.md).

   - If you know of telemetry in an AWS service that might apply to this
      investigation, you can go to that service's console and add the
      telemetry to the investigation. For example, to add a Lambda metric to
      the investigation, you can do the following:

1. Open the Lambda console.

2. In the **Monitor** section, find the
    metric.

3. Open the vertical ellipsis context menu ![An example of a CloudWatch overview home page, showing alarms and their current state, and examples of other metrics graph widgets that might appear on the overview home page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/vmore.png) for the metric, choose
    **Investigate**, **Add to**
**investigation** Then, in the
    **Investigate** pane, select the name of
    the investigation.

   - When you view a hypothesis in the **Suggestions**
      tab, you can choose **Show reasoning** to display the
      data that CloudWatch investigations used to generate the hypothesis. For hypotheses involving
      multiple resources, you may also see a visual representation showing the
      causal relationships between the resources as connected nodes.

   - You can choose the **Discarded** tab and view the
      suggestions that have been previously discarded. To add one of them to
      the findings, choose **Restore to findings**.

   - To add notes to the findings, choose **New note** in
      the **Feed** pane. Then enter your notes and choose
      **Add**.
4. When you add a hypothesis to the **Feed** area, it might
    display **Show suggested actions**. If so, choosing this
    displays possible actions that you can take, assuming that hypothesis is correct
    about the issue. Possible actions include the following:

- **Documentation suggestions** are links to AWS
documentation that can help you understand the issue that you are
working on, and how to solve it. To view suggested documentation, choose
its **Review** link

- **Runbook suggestions** are suggestions that leverage
the pre-defined _runbooks_ in Systems Manager
Automation. Each runbook defines a number of steps for performing a task
on an AWS resource. For information about continuing with a runbook
action, see [Reviewing and executing suggested runbook remediations for CloudWatch investigations](suggested-investigation-actions.md).

###### Important

There is a charge for executing an Automation runbook. However,
CloudWatch investigations provides you with a preview of actions that a suggested runbook
takes, giving you an opportunity to better evaluate whether to
execute the runbook. For information about Automation pricing, see
[AWS Systems Manager pricing for\
Automation](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing).

5. (Optional) Choose **Incident report** to create a
    comprehensive incident analysis document. For
    more information, see [Generate incident reports](investigations-incident-reports.md).

6. When you are ready to end an investigation, choose **End**
**investigation** and then optionally add final notes. The
    investigation status changes to **Archived**. You can restart
    archived investigations by opening the investigation page and choosing
    **Restart investigation**.

###### Note

At some point, you might see **Completed the analysis. Finished with the**
**investigation.** displayed above the **Feed** area. If
you then add more telemetry to the findings, this message changes and CloudWatch investigations begins
scanning your telemetry again, based on the new data that you added to the
findings.
