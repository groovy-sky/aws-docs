# IAM policies to use CloudWatch RUM

To be able to fully manage CloudWatch RUM, you must be signed in as an IAM user or role
that has the **AmazonCloudWatchRUMFullAccess** IAM policy.
Additionally, you may need other policies or permissions:

- To create an app monitor that creates a new Amazon Cognito identity pool for
authorization, you need to have the **Admin** IAM role or the
**AdministratorAccess** IAM policy.

- To create an app monitor that sends data to CloudWatch Logs, you must be logged on to an
IAM role or policy that has the following permission:

```json

{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "logs:PutResourcePolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "*"
      ]
}
```

- To enable JavaScript source maps in an app monitor, you will need to upload
your source map files to a Amazon S3 bucket. Your IAM role or policy needs specific
Amazon S3 permissions that allow creating Amazon S3 buckets, setting bucket policies, and
managing files in the bucket. For security, scope these permissions to specific
resources. The example policy below restricts access to buckets containing
`rum` in their names and uses the
`aws:ResourceAccount` condition key to limit permissions to the
principal account only.

```

{
      "Sid": "AllowS3BucketCreationAndListing",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:CreateBucket",
          "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*",
      "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
              "aws:ResourceAccount": "${aws:PrincipalAccount}"
          }
      }
},
{
      "Sid": "AllowS3BucketActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:GetBucketLocation",
          "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*rum*",
      "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
              "aws:ResourceAccount": "${aws:PrincipalAccount}"
          }
      }
},
{
      "Sid": "AllowS3BucketPolicyActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:PutBucketPolicy",
          "s3:GetBucketPolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*rum*",
      "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
              "aws:ResourceAccount": "${aws:PrincipalAccount}"
          }
      }
},
{
      "Sid": "AllowS3ObjectActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject",
          "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*rum*",
      "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
              "aws:ResourceAccount": "${aws:PrincipalAccount}"
          }
      }
}
```

- To use your own AWS KMS keys for server-side encryption on your source map
bucket, your IAM role or policy will need specific AWS KMS permissions that
allows creating a key, updating the key policy, using the AWS KMS key with Amazon S3
and setting the encryption configuration of your Amazon S3 bucket. For security,
scope these permissions to specific purposes. The example below restricts access
to keys for a specific region and accountId and has similar S3 restrictions as
the above example.

```nohighlight

{
      "Sid": "AllowKMSKeyCreation",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "kms:CreateKey",
          "kms:CreateAlias"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
},
{
      "Sid": "KMSReadPermissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "kms:ListAliases"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
},
{
      "Sid": "AllowUpdatingKeyPolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "kms:PutKeyPolicy",
          "kms:GetKeyPolicy",
          "kms:ListKeyPolicies"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:key/*"
},
{
      "Sid": "AllowUseOfKMSKeyForS3",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "kms:DescribeKey",
          "kms:Encrypt",
          "kms:Decrypt",
          "kms:GenerateDataKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:key/*"
},
{
      "Sid": "AllowS3EncryptionConfiguration",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration",
          "s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*rum*",
      "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
              "aws:ResourceAccount": "${aws:PrincipalAccount}"
          }
      }
}
```

Other users who need to view CloudWatch RUM data but don't need to create CloudWatch RUM
resources, can be granted the **AmazonCloudWatchRUMReadOnlyAccess**
policy.
