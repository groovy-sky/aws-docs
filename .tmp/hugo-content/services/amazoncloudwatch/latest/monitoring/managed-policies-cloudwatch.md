# AWS managed (predefined) policies for CloudWatch

AWS addresses many common use cases by providing standalone IAM policies
that are created and administered by AWS. These AWS managed policies grant necessary
permissions for common use cases so that you can avoid having to investigate what
permissions are needed. For more information, see [AWS managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the _IAM User Guide_.

The following AWS managed policies, which you can attach to users in your account,
are specific to CloudWatch.

## CloudWatchNetworkFlowMonitorTopologyServiceRolePolicy

You can't attach ` CloudWatchNetworkFlowMonitorTopologyServiceRolePolicy` to your IAM entities. This policy is attached
to a service-linked role named **AWSServiceRoleForNetworkFlowMonitor\_Topology**. Using these permissions, as
well as internal meta data information gathering (for performance efficiencies), this service-linked role gathers meta data about resource
network configurations, such as describing route tables and gateways, for resources that this service monitors network traffic for. This meta data
enables Network Flow Monitor to generate topology snapshots of the resources. When there is network degradation, Network Flow Monitor uses the topologies to
provide insights into the location of issues in the network and to help determine attribution for issues.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [CloudWatchNetworkFlowMonitorTopologyServiceRolePolicy](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/cloudwatchnetworkflowmonitortopologyservicerolepolicy.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

For more information, see [Service-linked roles for Network Flow Monitor](using-service-linked-roles-network-flow-monitor.md).

###### Note

You can review these permissions policies by signing in to the IAM console
and searching for specific policies there.

You can also create your own custom IAM policies to allow permissions for
CloudWatch actions and resources. You can attach these custom policies to
the IAM users or groups that require those permissions.

## AWS managed (predefined) policies for CloudWatch cross-account observability

information, see [CloudWatch investigations](investigations.md).

### AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy

The **AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy** policy grants
full access to all CloudWatch investigations actions and their required permissions via the AWS
console. This policy also grants limited access to other service's APIs required
for CloudWatch investigations functionality.

- The `aiops` permissions grant access to all CloudWatch investigations
actions.

- The `organizations`, `sso`,
`identitystore`, and `sts` permissions allow
actions needed for IAM Identity Center management which facilitate identity-aware
sessions.

- The `ssm` permissions are required for SSM Ops Item
integration with third-party issue management.

- The `iam` permissions are needed so that administrators can
pass IAM roles to the `aiops` and
`ssm.integrations` services, and the role is later used
by the assistant to analyze AWS resources

###### Important

These permissions allow users with this policy to pass any IAM
role to the `aiops` and `ssm.integrations`
services.

- It allows APIs from services outside CloudWatch investigations, which are required for
investigation feature functionality. These include actions to configure
Amazon Q Developer in chat applications, AWS KMS, CloudTrail trails, and SSM third-party issue
management.

- The `q` permissions enable integration with Amazon Q, allowing
users to interact with and update CloudWatch investigations reports through Amazon Q's conversational interface.

To see the full contents of the policy, see [AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/aiopsconsoleadminpolicy.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy_
_Reference Guide_.

### AIOpsOperatorAccess

The **AIOpsOperatorAccess** policy grants access
to a limited set of CloudWatch investigations APIs which include creating, updating, and deleting
investigations, investigation events, and investigation resources.

This policy only provides access to investigations. You should be sure that
IAM principals with this policy also have permissions to read CloudWatch
observability data such as metrics, SLOs, and CloudWatch Logs query results.

- The `aiops` permissions allow access to CloudWatch investigations APIs to
create, update, and delete investigations.

- The `sso-directory`, `sso`,
`identitystore`, and `sts` permissions allow
actions needed for IAM Identity Center management which facilitate
identity-aware sessions.

- The `ssm` permissions are required for SSM Ops Item
integration with third-party issue management.

- The `q` permissions enable integration with Amazon Q, allowing
users to interact with and update CloudWatch investigations reports through Amazon Q's conversational interface.

To see the full contents of the policy, see [AIOpsOperatorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/aiopsoperatoraccess.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_
_Guide_.

### AIOpsReadOnlyAccess

The **AIOpsReadOnlyAccess** policy grants
read-only permissions for CloudWatch investigations and other related services.

- The `aiops` permissions allow access to CloudWatch investigations APIs to get,
list, and validate investigation groups.

Identity Center management which facilitate identity-aware sessions.

- The `ssm` permissions are required for SSM Ops Item
integration with third-party issue management.

To see the full contents of the policy, see [AIOpsReadOnlyAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/aiopsreadonlyaccess.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_
_Guide_.

### AIOpsAssistantPolicy

The **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** policy is the default policy
recommended by AWS to assign to the Amazon AI Operations (AIOps) role used by your
investigation group to enable it to analyze your AWS resources during
investigations of operational events. This policy is not intended for use by
human users.

You can choose to have the policy assigned automatically when you create an
investigation, or you can assign the policy manually to the role being used by
the investigation. This policy is scoped based on the resources that CloudWatch investigations
analyzes when performing investigations, and will be updated as more resources
are supported. For a complete list of services that work with CloudWatch investigations see, [AWS services where investigations are supported](investigations-services.md).

You can also choose to assign the general AWS [**ReadOnlyAccess**](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/readonlyaccess.md) to the assistant in
addition to assigning it **AIOpsAssistantPolicy**.
The reason to do this is that **ReadOnlyAccess**
will be updated more frequently by AWS with permissions for new AWS services
and actions that are released. The **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** will also be updated for new actions, but
not as frequently.

To see the full contents of the policy, see [AIOpsAssistantPolicy](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/aiopsassistantpolicy.md) in the _AWS Managed Policy_
_Reference Guide_.

### AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy

The **AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy** policy
grants permissions required by CloudWatch investigations to generate incident reports from
investigation data.

This policy is intended for use by CloudWatch investigations to enable automated incident report
generation from investigation findings.

- The `aiops` permissions allow access to CloudWatch investigations APIs to read
investigation data and events, create and update incident reports, and
manage AI-derived facts that form the foundation of report
generation.

To see the full contents of the policy, see [AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/aiopsassistantincidentreportpolicy.md) in the _AWS Managed_
_Policy Reference Guide_.

## AWS managed (predefined) policies for CloudWatch Synthetics

The **CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess** and
**CloudWatchSyntheticsReadOnlyAccess** AWS managed policies
are available for you to assign to users who will manage or use CloudWatch Synthetics. The
following additional policies are also relevant:

- **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** and
**CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess** – These are
necessary to read all Synthetics data in the CloudWatch console.

- **AWSLambdaReadOnlyAccess** – Required to view the
source code used by canaries.

- **CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess** – Allows you to
create canaries. Additionally, to create and delete canaries that have a new
IAM role created for them, you need specific inline policy
permissions.

###### Important

Granting a user the `iam:CreateRole`,
`iam:DeleteRole`, `iam:CreatePolicy`,
`iam:DeletePolicy`, `iam:AttachRolePolicy`,
and `iam:DetachRolePolicy` permissions gives that user full
administrative access to create, attach, and delete roles and policies
that have ARNs that match
`arn:aws:iam::*:role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole*`
and
`arn:aws:iam::*:policy/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsPolicy*`.
For example, a user with these permissions can create a policy that has
full permissions for all resources, and attach that policy to any role
that matches that ARN pattern. Be careful to whom you grant these
permissions.

For information about attaching policies and granting permissions to
users, see [Changing Permissions for an IAM User](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-users-change-permissions.md#users_change_permissions-add-console) and [To embed an inline policy for a user or role](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-attach-detach.md#embed-inline-policy-console).
