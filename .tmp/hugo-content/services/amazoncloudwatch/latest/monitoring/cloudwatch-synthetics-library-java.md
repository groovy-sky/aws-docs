# Runtime versions using Java

The following section contains information about the CloudWatch Synthetics runtime versions
for Java. This runtime does not have any browser or framework included.

The naming convention for these runtime versions is `syn-language
          -majorversion.minorversion`.

## syn-java-1.0

**Major dependencies**:

- AWS Lambda runtime Java 21

**Features**

- _CloudWatch Logs integration_ – You can query and filter for logs
through the CloudWatch Synthetics console. Each log message contains unique `
                  canaryRunId`, making it easy to search for logs for a particular canary run.

- _Metrics_ – You can monitor canary run success percentage and
duration through CloudWatch metrics. You can also configure alarms to alert you when
canaries detect issues.

- _Canary artifacts_ \- Each canary run uploads a detailed
report corresponding to the run and the steps in the run which can be accessed
through Amazon S3.

- _Support for traces_ \- You can emit traces for all the
requests made by the canary through X-Ray. Each canary run is associated with one
trace Id.
