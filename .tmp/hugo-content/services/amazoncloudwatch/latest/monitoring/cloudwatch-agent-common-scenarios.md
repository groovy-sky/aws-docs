## Running the CloudWatch agent as a different user

On Linux servers, the CloudWatch runs as the root user by default. To have the agent run as a
different user, use the `run_as_user` parameter in the `agent` section
in the CloudWatch agent configuration file. This option is available only on Linux servers.

If you're already running the agent with the root user and want to change to using a
different user, use one of the following procedures.

###### To run the CloudWatch agent as a different user on an EC2 instance running Linux

1. Download and install a new CloudWatch agent package.

2. Create a new Linux user or use the default user named `cwagent` that the
    RPM or DEB file created.

3. Provide credentials for this user in one of these ways:
   - If the file `.aws/credentials` exists in the home directory
      of the root user, you must create a credentials file for the user you are going to
      use to run the CloudWatch agent. This credentials file will be
      `/home/username/.aws/credentials`.
      Then set the value of the `shared_credential_file` parameter in
      `common-config.toml` to the pathname of the credential file.
      For more information, see [Install the CloudWatch agent using AWS Systems Manager](installing-cloudwatch-agent-ssm.md).

   - If the file `.aws/credentials` does not exist in the home
      directory of the root user, you can do one of the following:
     - Create a credentials file for the user you are going to use to run the CloudWatch
        agent. This credentials file will be
        `/home/username/.aws/credentials`.
        Then set the value of the `shared_credential_file` parameter in
        `common-config.toml` to the pathname of the credential
        file. For more information, see [Install the CloudWatch agent using AWS Systems Manager](installing-cloudwatch-agent-ssm.md).

     - Instead of creating a credentials file, attach an IAM role to the
        instance. The agent uses this role as the credential provider.
4. In the CloudWatch agent configuration file, add the following line in the
    `agent` section:

```nohighlight

"run_as_user": "username"
```

Make other modifications to the configuration file as needed. For more information,
    see [Create the CloudWatch agent configuration file](create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file.md)

5. Give the user the required permissions. The user must have Read (r) permissions for
    the log files to be collected, and must have Execute (x) permission on every directory
    in the log files' path.

6. Start the agent with the configuration file that you just modified.

```nohighlight

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:configuration-file-path
```

###### To run the CloudWatch agent as a different user on an on-premises server running Linux

1. Download and install a new CloudWatch agent package.

2. Create a new Linux user or use the default user named `cwagent` that the
    RPM or DEB file created.

3. Store the credentials of this user to a path that the user can access, such as
    `/home/username/.aws/credentials`.

4. Set the value of the `shared_credential_file` parameter in
    `common-config.toml` to the pathname of the credential file. For
    more information, see [Install the CloudWatch agent using AWS Systems Manager](installing-cloudwatch-agent-ssm.md).

5. In the CloudWatch agent configuration file, add the following line in the
    `agent` section:

```nohighlight

"run_as_user": "username"
```

Make other modifications to the configuration file as needed. For more information,
    see [Create the CloudWatch agent configuration file](create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file.md)

6. Give the user required permissions. The user must have Read (r) permissions for the
    log files to be collected, and must have Execute (x) permission on every directory in
    the log files' path.

7. Start the agent with the configuration file that you just modified.

```nohighlight

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:configuration-file-path
```

## How the CloudWatch agent handles sparse log files

Sparse files are files with both empty blocks and real contents. A sparse file uses disk
space more efficiently by writing brief information representing the empty blocks to disk
instead of the actual null bytes which makes up the block. This makes the actual size of a
sparse file usually much smaller than its apparent size.

However, the CloudWatch agent doesn’t treat sparse files differently than it treats normal
files. When the agent reads a sparse file, the empty blocks are treated as "real" blocks
filled with null bytes. Because of this, the CloudWatch agent publishes as many bytes as the
apparent size of a sparse file to CloudWatch.

Configuring the CloudWatch agent to publish a sparse file can cause higher than expected CloudWatch
costs, so we recommend not to do so. For example, `/var/logs/lastlog` in
Linux is usually a very sparse file, and we recommend that you don't publish it to CloudWatch.

## Adding custom dimensions to metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent

To add custom dimensions such as tags to metrics collected by the agent, add the
`append_dimensions` field to the section of the agent configuration file that
lists those metrics.

For example, the following example section of the configuration file adds a custom
dimension named `stackName` with a value of `Prod` to the
`cpu` and `disk` metrics collected by the agent.

```json

"cpu":{
  "resources":[
    "*"
  ],
  "measurement":[
    "cpu_usage_guest",
    "cpu_usage_nice",
    "cpu_usage_idle"
  ],
  "totalcpu":false,
  "append_dimensions":{
    "stackName":"Prod"
  }
},
"disk":{
  "resources":[
    "/",
    "/tmp"
  ],
  "measurement":[
    "total",
    "used"
  ],
  "append_dimensions":{
    "stackName":"Prod"
  }
}
```

Remember that any time you change the agent configuration file, you must restart the
agent to have the changes take effect.

## Aggregating or rolling up metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent

To aggregate or roll up metrics collected by the agent, add an
`aggregation_dimensions` field to the section for that metric in the agent
configuration file.

For example, the following configuration file snippet rolls up metrics on the
`AutoScalingGroupName` dimension. The metrics from all instances in each Auto Scaling
group are aggregated and can be viewed as a whole.

```json

"metrics": {
  "cpu":{...}
  "disk":{...}
  "aggregation_dimensions" : [["AutoScalingGroupName"]]
}
```

To roll up along the combination of each `InstanceId` and
`InstanceType` dimensions in addition to rolling up on the Auto Scaling group name, add
the following.

```json

"metrics": {
  "cpu":{...}
  "disk":{...}
  "aggregation_dimensions" : [["AutoScalingGroupName"], ["InstanceId", "InstanceType"]]
}
```

To roll up metrics into one collection instead, use `[]`.

```json

"metrics": {
  "cpu":{...}
  "disk":{...}
  "aggregation_dimensions" : [[]]
}
```

Remember that any time you change the agent configuration file, you must restart the
agent to have the changes take effect.

## Collecting high-resolution metrics with the CloudWatch agent

The `metrics_collection_interval` field specifies the time interval for the
metrics collected, in seconds. By specifying a value of less than 60 for this field, the
metrics are collected as high-resolution metrics.

For example, if your metrics should all be high-resolution and collected every 10
seconds, specify 10 as the value for `metrics_collection_interval` under the
`agent` section as a global metrics collection interval.

```json

"agent": {
  "metrics_collection_interval": 10
}
```

Alternatively, the following example sets the `cpu` metrics to be collected
every second, and all other metrics are collected every minute.

```json

"agent":{
  "metrics_collection_interval": 60
},
"metrics":{
  "metrics_collected":{
    "cpu":{
      "resources":[
        "*"
      ],
      "measurement":[
        "cpu_usage_guest"
      ],
      "totalcpu":false,
      "metrics_collection_interval": 1
    },
    "disk":{
      "resources":[
        "/",
        "/tmp"
      ],
      "measurement":[
        "total",
        "used"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Remember that any time you change the agent configuration file, you must restart the
agent to have the changes take effect.

## Sending metrics, logs, and traces to a different account

To have the CloudWatch agent send the metrics, logs, or traces to a different account, specify
a `role_arn` parameter in the agent configuration file on the sending server. The
`role_arn` value specifies an IAM role in the target account that the agent
uses when sending data to the target account. This role enables the sending account to
assume a corresponding role in the target account when delivering the metrics or logs to the
target account.

You can also specify separate `role_arn` strings in the agent configuration
file: one to use when sending metrics, another for sending logs, and another for sending
traces.

The following example of part of the `agent` section of the configuration
file sets the agent to use `CrossAccountAgentRole` when sending data to a
different account.

```json

{
  "agent": {
    "credentials": {
      "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CrossAccountAgentRole"
    }
  },
  .....
}
```

Alternatively, the following example sets different roles for the sending account to use
for sending metrics, logs, and traces:

```json

"metrics": {
    "credentials": {
     "role_arn": "RoleToSendMetrics"
    },
    "metrics_collected": {....
```

```json

"logs": {
    "credentials": {
    "role_arn": "RoleToSendLogs"
    },
    ....
```

**Policies needed**

When you specify a `role_arn` in the agent configuration
file, you must also make sure the IAM roles of the sending and target accounts have
certain policies. The roles in both the sending and target accounts should have
`CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`. For more information about assigning this policy
to a role, see [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

The role in the sending account also must include the following policy. You add this
policy on the **Permissions** tab in the IAM console when you edit the
role.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/agent-role-in-target-account"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

The role in the target account must include the following policy so that it recognizes
the IAM role used by the sending account. You add this policy on the **Trust**
**relationships** tab in the IAM console when you edit the role.
This role
is the role specified in
`agent-role-in-target-account` in the policy used by
the sending account.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/role-in-sender-account"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Timestamp differences between the CloudWatch agent and the earlier CloudWatch Logs agent

The CloudWatch agent supports a different set of symbols for timestamp formats, compared to
the earlier CloudWatch Logs agent. These differences are shown in the following table.

Symbols supported by both agentsSymbols supported only by CloudWatch agentSymbols supported only by earlier CloudWatch Logs agent

%A, %a, %b, %B, %d, %f, %H, %l, %m, %M, %p, %S, %y, %Y, %Z, %z

%-d, %-l, %-m, %-M, %-S

%c,%j, %U, %W, %w

For more information about the meanings of the symbols supported by the new CloudWatch agent,
see [CloudWatch Agent Configuration File: Logs Section](cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-details.md#CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Logssection) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_. For information about symbols supported by the CloudWatch Logs
agent, see [Agent\
Configuration File](../logs/agentreference.md#agent-configuration-file) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

## Appending OpenTelemetry collector configuration files

The CloudWatch agent supports supplemental OpenTelemetry collector configuration files
alongside its own configuration files. This feature allows you to use CloudWatch agent features
such as CloudWatch Application Signals or Container Insights through the CloudWatch agent configuration and bring
in your existing OpenTelemetry collector configuration with a single agent.

To prevent merge conflicts with pipelines automatically created by CloudWatch agent, we
recommend that you add a custom suffix to each of the components and pipelines in your
OpenTelemetry collector configuration.

```JSON

receivers:
  otlp/custom-suffix:
    protocols:
      http:

exporters:
  awscloudwatchlogs/custom-suffix:
    log_group_name: "test-group"
    log_stream_name: "test-stream"

service:
  pipelines:
    logs/custom-suffix:
      receivers: [otlp/custom-suffix]
      exporters: [awscloudwatchlogs/custom-suffix]

```

To configure the CloudWatch agent, start the CloudWatch agent using the `fetch-config`
option and specify the CloudWatch agent’s configuration file. CloudWatch agent requires at least one
CloudWatch agent configuration file.

```

/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -c file:/tmp/agent.json -s
```

Next, use the `append-config` option while specifying the OpenTelemetry
collector configuration file.

```

/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a append-config -c file:/tmp/otel.yaml -s
```

The agent merges the two configuration files on start up and logs the resolved
configuration.
