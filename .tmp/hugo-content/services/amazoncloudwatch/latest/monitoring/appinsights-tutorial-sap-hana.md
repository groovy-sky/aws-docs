## Prerequisites

You must perform the following prerequisites to configure an SAP HANA database
with CloudWatch Application Insights:

- **SAP HANA** – Install a running and
reachable SAP HANA database 2.0 SPS05 on an Amazon EC2 instance.

- **SAP HANA database user** – A
database user with monitoring roles must be created in the SYSTEM database
and all tenants.

###### Example

The following SQL commands create a user with monitoring roles.

```sql

su - <sid>adm
hdbsql -u SYSTEM -p <SYSTEMDB password> -d SYSTEMDB
CREATE USER CW_HANADB_EXPORTER_USER PASSWORD <Monitoring user password> NO FORCE_FIRST_PASSWORD_CHANGE;
CREATE ROLE CW_HANADB_EXPORTER_ROLE;
GRANT MONITORING TO CW_HANADB_EXPORTER_ROLE;
GRANT CW_HANADB_EXPORTER_ROLE TO CW_HANADB_EXPORTER_USER;
```

- **Python 3.8** – Install Python 3.8 or
later versions on your operating system. Use the latest release of Python. If
Python3 is not detected on your operating system, Python 3.6 will be installed.

For more information, see the [installation example](#install).

###### Note

Manual installation of Python 3.8 or higher is required for SuSE Linux 15 SP4, RedHat Linux 8.6, and later operating systems.

- **Pip3** – Install the installer
program, pip3, on your operating system. If pip3 is not detected on your
operating system, it will be installed.

- **hdbclient** – CloudWatch Application Insights uses the python driver to connect to the SAP HANA database. If the client is not installed under python3, ensure that you have hdbclient tar file version `2.10 or later` under
`/hana/shared/SID/hdbclient/`.

- **Amazon CloudWatch agent** – Make sure that you are not running a preexisting CloudWatch agent on your Amazon EC2 instance.
If you have CloudWatch agent installed, make sure to remove the configuration of the resources you are using in CloudWatch Application Insights from the existing CloudWatch agent configuration file to avoid a merge conflict. For more information, see
[Manually create or edit the CloudWatch agent configuration file](cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-details.md).

- **AWS Systems Manager enablement** – Install
SSM Agent on your instances, and the instances must be enabled for SSM.
For information about how to install the SSM Agent, see [Working with SSM\
Agent](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.md) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

- **Amazon EC2 instance roles** – You must
attach the following Amazon EC2 instance roles to configure your database.

- You must attach the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` role
to enable Systems Manager. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager identity-based policy examples](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-iam-identity-based-access-control.md).

- You must attach the `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy` to
enable instance metrics and logs to be emitted through CloudWatch. For
more information, see [Create IAM roles and users for use with CloudWatch\
agent](create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.md).

- You must attach the following IAM inline policy to the Amazon EC2
instance role to read the password stored in AWS Secrets Manager. For more
information about inline policies, see [Inline policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User_
_Guide_.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:ApplicationInsights-*"
          }
      ]
}

```

- **AWS resource groups** – You must
create a resource group that includes all of the associated AWS resources
used by your application stack to onboard your applications to CloudWatch Application Insights. This
includes Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS volumes running your SAP HANA database.
If there are multiple databases per account, we recommend that you create
one resource group that includes the AWS resources for each SAP HANA
database system.

- **IAM permissions** – For non-admin
users:

- You must create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that allows
Application Insights to create a service-linked role, and attach it to your
user identity. For steps to attach the policy, see [IAM policy for CloudWatch Application Insights](appinsights-iam.md).

- The user must have permission to create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager to
store the database user credentials. For more information, see
[Example: Permission to create secrets](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-examples.md#auth-and-access_examples_create).
JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "secretsmanager:CreateSecret"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:ApplicationInsights-*"
      }
    ]
}

```

- **Service-linked role** – Application Insights
uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is
created for you when you create your first Application Insights application in the
Application Insights console. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for CloudWatch Application Insights](chap-using-service-linked-roles-appinsights.md).

## View and troubleshoot SAP HANA problems detected by CloudWatch Application Insights

The following sections provide steps to help you resolve common troubleshooting
scenarios that occur when you configure monitoring for SAP HANA on
Application Insights.

###### Troubleshooting topics

- [SAP HANA database reaches memory allocation limit](#appinsights-tutorial-sap-hana-troubleshooting-memory)

- [Disk full event](#appinsights-tutorial-sap-hana-troubleshooting-disk-full)

- [SAP HANA backup stopped running](#appinsights-tutorial-sap-hana-troubleshooting-backup-stopped)

### SAP HANA database reaches memory allocation limit

###### Description

Your SAP application that is backed by an SAP HANA database malfunctions
because of high memory pressure, leading to application performance
degradation.

###### Resolution

You can identify the application layer that is causing the problem by
checking the dynamically created dashboard, which shows the related metrics
and log file snippets. In the following example, the problem may be because
of a large data load in the SAP HANA system.

![Memory allocation exceeded.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/appinsights-memory-allocation-1.png)

The used memory allocation exceeds the threshold of 80 percent of the total
memory allocation limit.

![Log group showing out of memory.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/appinsights-memory-allocation-2.png)

The log group shows the scheme `BNR-DATA` and table
`IMDBMASTER_30003` ran out of memory. In addition, the log group
shows the exact time of the issue, current global location limit, shared memory,
code size, and OOM reservation allocation size.

![Log group text.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/appinsights-memory-allocation-3.png)

### Disk full event

###### Description

Your SAP application that is backed by an SAP HANA database stops
responding, which leads to an inability to access the database.

###### Resolution

You can identify the database layer that is causing the problem by
checking the dynamically created dashboard, which shows the related metrics
and log file snippets. In the following example, the problem may be that the
administrator failed to enable automatic log backup, which caused the
sap/hana/log directory to fill up.

![Log group showing out of memory.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/appinsights-disk-full-1.png)

The log group widget in the problem dashboard shows the `DISKFULL`
event.

![Log group showing out of memory.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/appinsights-disk-full-2.png)

### SAP HANA backup stopped running

###### Description

Your SAP application that is backed by an SAP HANA database has stopped
working.

###### Resolution

You can identify the database layer that is causing the problem by
checking the dynamically created dashboard, which shows the related metrics
and log file snippets.

The log group widget in the problem dashboard shows the `ACCESS
                        DENIED` event. This includes additional information, such as the S3
bucket, the S3 bucket folder, and the S3 bucket Region.

![Log group showing out of memory.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/appinsights-backup-stopped-2.png)

## Anomaly detection for SAP HANA

For specific SAP HANA metrics, such as the number of thread count, CloudWatch applies
statistical and machine learning algorithms to define the threshold. These
algorithms continuously analyze the metrics of the SAP HANA database, determine
normal baselines, and surface anomalies with minimal user intervention. The
algorithms generate an anomaly detection model, which generates a range of expected
values that represent normal metric behavior.

Anomaly detection algorithms account for the seasonality and trend changes of
metrics. The seasonality changes can be hourly, daily, or weekly, as shown in the
following examples of the SAP HANA CPU usage.

![Log group showing out of memory.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/appinsights-anomaly-detection.png)

After you create a model, CloudWatch anomaly detection continuously evaluates the model
and makes adjustments to it to ensure that is it as accurate as possible. This
includes retraining the model to adjust if the metric values evolve over time or
experience sudden changes. It also includes predictors to improve the models for
metrics that are seasonal, spiky, or sparse.

## Troubleshooting Application Insights for SAP HANA

This section provides steps to help you resolve common errors returned by the
Application Insights dashboard.

### Unable to add more than 60 monitored metrics

The output shows the following error.

```
Component cannot have more than 60 monitored metrics
```

**Root cause** – The current metric limit is 60 monitored metrics per component.

**Resolution** – To stay under the limit, remove metrics that are not necessary.

### No SAP metrics appear after the onboarding process

Use the following information to find out why SAP metrics don't appear on the dashboard after the onboarding process. The first step is to troubleshoot why the SAP metrics don't appear using the AWS Management Console or Exporter logs from an Amazon EC2 instance. Next, review the error output to find a resolution.

#### Troubleshoot why SAP metrics don't appear after onboarding

You can use the AWS Management Console or exporter logs from an Amazon EC2 instance for troubleshooting.

AWS Management Console

###### Troubleshoot no SAP metrics appear after onboarding using the console

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **State Manager**.

3. Under **Associations**, check the
    status of the document
    `AWSEC2-ApplicationInsightsCloudwatchAgentInstallAndConfigure`.
    If the status is `Failed`, under **Execution id**, select the failed id and view the output.

4. Under **Associations**, check the status of the document `AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage`. If the status is `Failed`, under **Execution id**, select the failed id and view the output.

Exporter logs from Amazon EC2 instance

###### Troubleshoot no SAP metrics appear after onboarding using exporter logs

1. Connect to the Amazon EC2 instance where your SAP HANA database is running.

2. Find the correct naming convention for
    `WORKLOAD_SHORT_NAME` using the following
    command. You will use this short name in the following two
    steps.

```

sudo systemctl | grep exporter
```

###### Note

Application Insights adds a suffix, `WORKLOAD_SHORT_NAME` to the service name depending on the workload that is running. The short names for SAP HANA single node, multiple nodes, and high availability deployments are
`HANA_SN`, `HANA_MN`, and `HANA_HA`.

3. To check for errors in the exporter manager service logs, run the following command replacing `WORKLOAD_SHORT_NAME` with the short name you found in [Step 2](#step-find-short-name).

```nohighlight

sudo journalctl -e --unit=prometheus-hanadb_exporter_manager_WORKLOAD_SHORT_NAME.service
```

4. If the exporter manager service logs do not show an error, check for errors in the exporter service logs by running the following command.

```nohighlight

sudo journalctl -e --unit=prometheus-hanadb_exporter_WORKLOAD_SHORT_NAME.service
```

#### Resolving the common root causes for SAP metrics not appearing after onboarding

The following examples describe how to resolve the common root causes of
SAP metrics not appearing after onboarding.
