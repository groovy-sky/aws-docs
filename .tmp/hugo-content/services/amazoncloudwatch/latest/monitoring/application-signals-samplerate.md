# Trace sampling rate

By default, when you enable Application Signals X-Ray centralized sampling is enabled
using the default sampling rate settings of `reservoir=1/s` and `fixed_rate=5%`.
The environment variables for the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) SDK agent as set as follows.

For information about changing the sampling configuration, see the following:

- To change X-Ray sampling, see [Configure sampling rules](../../../xray/latest/devguide/aws-xray-interface-console.md#xray-console)

- To change ADOT sampling, see [Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector for X-Ray remote sampling](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/remote-sampling)

If you want to disable X-Ray centralized sampling and use local sampling instead, set the following values
for the ADOT SDK Java agent as below. The following example sets the sampling rate at 5%.
