# IAM policy for CloudWatch Application Insights

To use CloudWatch Application Insights, you must create an [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies.md) and attach it to your user, group, or
role. For more information about users, groups, and roles, see [IAM Identities (users, user groups, and roles)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id.md). The IAM policy
defines the user permissions.
