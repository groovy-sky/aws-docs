# Modify destination membership at runtime

You might encounter situations where you have to add or remove membership
of some users from a destination that you own. You can use the
`put-destination-policy` command on your destination with a
new access policy. In the following example, a previously added account
**111111111111** is stopped from sending any more log
data, and account **222222222222** is enabled.

1. Fetch the policy that is currently associated with the destination
    **testDestination** and make a note of the
    **AccessPolicy**:

```nohighlight

aws logs describe-destinations \
       --destination-name-prefix "testDestination"

{
    "Destinations": [
      {
        "DestinationName": "testDestination",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/CWLtoKinesisRole",
        "DestinationArn": "arn:aws:logs:region:999999999999:destination:testDestination",
        "TargetArn": "arn:aws:kinesis:region:999999999999:stream/RecipientStream",
        "AccessPolicy": "{\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [{\"Sid\": \"\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": {\"AWS\": \"111111111111\"}, \"Action\": \"logs:PutSubscriptionFilter\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:logs:region:999999999999:destination:testDestination\"}] }"
      }
    ]
}
```

2. Update the policy to reflect that account
    **111111111111** is stopped, and that account
    **222222222222** is enabled. Put this policy in
    the **~/NewAccessPolicy.json** file:
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "222222222222"
               },
               "Action": "logs:PutSubscriptionFilter",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:999999999999:destination:testDestination"
           }
       ]
}

```

3. Call **PutDestinationPolicy** to associate the
    policy defined in the **NewAccessPolicy.json** file
    with the destination:

```nohighlight

aws logs put-destination-policy \
   --destination-name "testDestination" \
   --access-policy file://~/NewAccessPolicy.json
```

This will eventually disable the log events from account ID
    **111111111111**. Log events from account ID
    **222222222222** start flowing to the
    destination as soon as the owner of account
    **222222222222** creates a subscription
    filter.
