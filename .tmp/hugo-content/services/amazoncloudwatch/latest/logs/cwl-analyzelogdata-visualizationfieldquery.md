# Tutorial: Run a query that produces a visualization grouped by log fields

When you run a query that uses the `stats` function to group
the returned results by the values of one or more fields in the log entries,
you can view the results as a bar chart, pie chart, line graph or stacked
area graph. This helps you more efficiently visualize trends in your
logs.

###### To run a query for visualization

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, and then
    choose **Logs Insights**.

3. In the **Select log group(s)** drop down, choose
    one or more log groups to query.

    If this is a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account
    observability, you can select log groups in the source accounts as
    well as the monitoring account. A single query can query logs from
    different accounts at once.

You can filter the log groups by log group name, account ID, or
    account label.

4. In the query editor, delete the current contents, enter the
    following `stats` function, and then choose **Run**
**query**.

```nohighlight

stats count(*) by @logStream
       | limit 100
```

The results show the number of log events in the log group for
    each log stream. The results are limited to only 100 rows.

5. Choose the **Visualization** tab.

6. Select the arrow next to **Line**, and then
    choose **Bar**.

The bar chart appears, showing a bar for each log stream in the
    log group.
