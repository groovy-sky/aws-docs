# Troubleshoot with CloudWatch Logs Live Tail

CloudWatch Logs Live Tail helps you quickly troubleshoot incidents by viewing a streaming
list of new log events as they are ingested. You can view, filter, and highlight ingested logs in near real time, helping you
to detect and resolve issues quickly. You can filter the logs based on terms you specify, and also highlight
logs that contain specified terms to help you quickly find what you are looking for.

Live Tail sessions incur costs by session usage time, per minute.
For more information about
pricing, see the **Logs**
tab at [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

Live Tail is supported only for log groups in the Standard log class. For more information
about log classes, see [Log classes](cloudwatch-logs-log-classes.md).

The following sections explain how to use Live Tail in the console and in the AWS CLI. You can also start a Live Tail session
programatically. For more information, see
[StartLiveTail](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatchlogs/latest/apireference/api-startlivetail.md).
For SDK examples, see
[Start a Live Tail session using an AWS SDK](example-cloudwatch-logs-startlivetail-section.md).

You can also use Live Tail in the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. To start a Live Tail session from the VS Code Command Palette, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Logs \
Live Tail section](../../../toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-livetail.md) of the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide.

The Live Tail feature is available in all commercial AWS [Regions](../../../glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap-icmpid-docs-homepage-addtlrcs.md#region).
It is not available in the China Regions or the
AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

###### Note

The `StartLiveTail` API routes requests using SDK host prefix injection. SDK versions released before April 1, 2026 route to
`streaming-logs.Region.amazonaws.com`, which does not support VPC endpoints. SDK versions released on or after April 1, 2026 route to
`stream-logs.Region.amazonaws.com`, which supports VPC endpoints. To set up a VPC endpoint for this API, see [Creating a VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Logs](cloudwatch-logs-and-interface-vpc.md#create-VPC-endpoint-for-CloudWatchLogs).

## Start a Live Tail session using the AWS CLI

The `start-live-tail` AWS CLI command starts a Live Tail streaming session for one or more log groups in a terminal.
A Live Tail session can last for up to three hours. If more than 500 log events per second match the filter, the log events that are displayed
are a sample of the total log events, to provide a real-time tailing experience. For more information about the `start-live-tail` command,
see [start-live-tail](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/logs/start-live-tail.html)

You can use the `start-live-tail` in two modes:

- **print-only**– this is the default mode

- **interactive**

### print-only

In `print-only` mode, log events are streamed on the terminal. New events are added at the bottom every second,
creating a near real-time tailing experience similar to `tail -f` on Linux.

To start a Live Tail session in print-only mode, enter the following command.

```nohighlight

aws logs start-live-tail --log-group-identifiers arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111111222222:log-group:my-logs
```

When you use print-only mode, you can also pipe it with other Linux commands to increase its analytical capabilities. The following example
filters log events with the `error` keyword and prints the second and fourth column of these events to help you extract particular information.

```nohighlight

aws logs start-live-tail --log-group-identifiers arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111111222222:log-group:my-logs --mode print-only | grep "error" | awk '{print $2, $4}'
```

### interactive

In `interactive` mode, you can highlight terms and toggle the format of the output log events between JSON and plain text.
Interactive mode also displays information about the Live Tail session such as session duration, whether the session is being sampled,
and the current highlighted terms and the count of the times they have been encountered.

To start a Live Tail session in interactive mode, enter the following command.

```nohighlight

aws logs start-live-tail --log-group-identifiers arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111111222222:log-group:my-logs --mode interactive
```

The Live Tail session begins. The following video shows part of an example session.

![A short video that shows log events appearing on the screen during a Live Tail session.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/images/LiveTailCLIStartVideo.gif)

To highlight a term in the streaming logs, press **h** and then enter the term. The following shows the screen after the term `latency`
has been highlighted.

To clear a highlighted term, press **c** and then type the number that represents the term that
you want to stop highlighting.

You can press **t** to toggle the display format of incoming events between JSON and plain text. This toggle functionality is best-effort and happens only if the log event format
is compatible.

You can use the up arrow and down arrow keys to scroll, and use `CTRL+u` and `CTRL+d` to scroll faster.

The following image displays the highlighting of the `latency` term during a Live Tail session.

## Start a Live Tail session in the console

You use the CloudWatch console to start a Live Tail session. The following procedure explains how to start a
Live Tail session by using the **Live tail** option in the left navigation pane. You can also
start Live Tail sessions from the Log Groups page or the CloudWatch Logs Insights page.

If you are using data protection policies to mask sensitive data in a log group that you are
viewing with Live Tail, the sensitive data always appears masked in the Live Tail session. For more
information about masking sensitive data in log groups, see
[Help protect sensitive log data with masking](mask-sensitive-log-data.md).

###### Important

If your network security team doesn't allow the use of web sockets, you can't
currently access the
Live Tail portion of the CloudWatch console. You can use Live Tail with the AWS CLI or APIs. For more information, see [Start a Live Tail session using the AWS CLI](#CloudWatchLogs_LiveTail_session_CLI)
and [StartLiveTail](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatchlogs/latest/apireference/api-startlivetail.md).

###### To start a Live Tail session

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, **Live tail**.

03. For **Select log groups**, select the log groups that you want
     to view events from, in the Live Tail session. You can select as many as 10 log groups.

04. (Optional) If you selected only one log group, you can filter your Live Tail session further by
     selecting one or more log streams to view log events from. To do so, under
     **Select log streams**, select the names of the log streams from the drop down list.
     Alternatively, you can use the second box under **Select log streams**
     to enter a log stream name prefix, and then all log streams
     with names that match the prefix will be selected.

05. (Optional) To display only log events that contain certain words or other strings, enter the word
     or string in `Add filter patterns`.

    For example, to display only log events that include
     the word `Warning`, enter `Warning`. The filters field is case-sensitive. You can include multiple terms and pattern operators in this field:

- `error 404` displays only log events that include both
`error` and `404`

- `?Error ?error` displays log events that include either
`Error` or `error`

- `-INFO` displays all log events that don't include
`INFO`

- `{ $.eventType = "UpdateTrail" }` displays all JSON log events where
the value of the event type field is `UpdateTrail`

You can also use regular expression (regex) to filter:

- `%ERROR%` uses regex to display all log events consisting of the **ERROR** keyword

- `{ $.names = %Steve% }` uses regex to display JSON log events where **Steve** is in the property `"name"`

- `[ w1 = %abc%, w2 ]` uses regex to display space-delimited log events where the first word is **abc**

For more information about pattern syntax, see [Filter pattern syntax](filterandpatternsyntax.md).

06. (0ptional) To highlight some of the displayed log events, enter a term to search for and highlight
     under **Live Tail**. Enter highlight terms one at a time. If you add multiple terms
     to highlight, a different color is assigned to represent each term. A highlight indicator
     is displayed to the left of any log
     event that contains the specified term, and also appears under the term itself when you expand the
     log event in the main window to view the full log event.

    You can use filtering along with highlighting to quickly troubleshoot issues. For example, you might
     filter the events to display only the events that contain `Error`, and then also highlight
     the events that contain `404`.

07. To start the session, choose **Apply filters**

    Matching log events begin appearing in the window. The following information is also displayed:

- The timer displays
how long the Live Tail session has been active.

- **events/sec** displays how many ingested log
events per second match the filters that you have set.

- To keep the session from scrolling too fast because many events
match the filters, CloudWatch Logs might display only some matching events. If this happens,
the percentage of matching events that are displayed on screen is shown
in **% displayed**.

08. To pause the flow of events to investigate what is currently displayed, click anywhere
     in the events window.

09. During the session, you can use the following to see more details about each log event.

- To display the entire text for a log event in the main window,
choose the arrow next to that log event.

- To display the entire text for a log event in a side window,
choose the **+** magnifying glass next to that log event. The event flow pauses
and the side window appears.

Displaying a log event text in the side window can be useful to compare its text
to other events in the main window.

10. To stop the Live Tail session, choose **Stop**.

11. To restart the session, optionally use the **Filter** panel
     to modify the filtering criteria, and choose **Apply filters**.
     Then choose **Start**.
