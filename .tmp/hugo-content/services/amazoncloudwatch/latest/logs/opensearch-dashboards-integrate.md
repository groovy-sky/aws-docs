# Step 1: Create the integration with OpenSearch Service

The first step is creating the integration with OpenSearch Service, which you need to do only once.
Creating the integration will create the following resources in your account.

- **[An OpenSearch Service time series collection](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-collections.md)** without
high availability.

A collection is a set of OpenSearch Service _indexes_ that work together
to support a workload.

- **Two security policies** for the collection. One defines the
encryption type, which is either with a customer managed AWS KMS key or a service
owned key. The other policy defines network access, allowing the OpenSearch Service
application to access the collection. For more information, see [Encryption of data at rest for Amazon OpenSearch Service](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.md).

- **[An OpenSearch Service data access policy](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-data-access.md)** that defines who can
access data in the collection.

- **[An\**
**OpenSearch Service direct query data source](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/direct-query-s3.md)** with CloudWatch Logs defined as
the source.

- **[An OpenSearch Service\**
**application](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/application.md)** with the name `aws-analytics`.
The application will be configured to allow the creation of a workspace. If an
application named `aws-analytics` already exists, it will be updated
to add this collection as a data source.

- **[A OpenSearch Service\**
**workspace](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/application.md)** that will host the dashboards and allows
everyone who has been granted access to read from the workspace.

## Required permissions

To create the integration, you must be signed on to an account that has the
**CloudWatchOpenSearchDashboardsFullAccess** managed IAM
policy or equivalent permissions, shown here. You must also have these permissions
to delete the integration, create, edit, and delete dashboards, and to refresh the
dashboard manually.

## Create the integration

Use these steps to create the integration.

###### To integrate CloudWatch Logs with Amazon OpenSearch Service

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Logs Insights** and
    then choose the **Analyze with OpenSearch** tab.

3. Choose **Create integration**.

4. For **Integration name**, enter a name for the
    integration.

5. (Optional) To encrypt the data written to OpenSearch Service Serverless, enter the ARN
    of the AWS KMS key that you want to use in **KMS key ARN**.
    For more information, see [Encryption at rest](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-encryption.md) in the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide.

6. For **Data retention**, enter the amount of time that you
    want the OpenSearch Service data indexes to be retained. This also defines the maximum
    time period for which you can view data in the dashboards. Choosing a longer
    data retention period will incur additional searching and indexing costs.
    For more information, see [OpenSearch Service Serverless\
    Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/pricing).

The maximum retention period is 30 days.

The data retention length will also be used to create the OpenSearch Service collection
    lifecycle policy.

7. For **IAM role for writing to OpenSearch collection**,
    create a new IAM role or select an existing IAM role to be used to write
    to the OpenSearch Service collection.

Creating a new role is the simplest method, and the role will be created
    with the necessary permissions.

###### Note

If you create a role, it will have permissions to read from all log
groups in the account.

If you want to select an existing role, it should have the permissions
    listed in [Permissions that the integration needs](opensearch-dashboards-createrole.md). Alternatively, you
    can choose **Use an existing role** and then in the
    **Verify access permissions of the selected role**
    section you can choose **Create role**. This way you can
    use the permissions listed in [Permissions that the integration needs](opensearch-dashboards-createrole.md) as a template and
    modify it. For example, if you want to specify a finer-grain control of log
    groups.

8. For **IAM roles and users who can view dashboards**, you
    select how you want to grant access to IAM roles and IAM users for
    vended logs dashboard access:
   - To limit the dashboard access to just some users, choose
      **Select IAM roles and users who can view**
     **dashboards** and then in the text box search for and
      select the IAM roles and IAM users that you want to grant access
      to.

   - To grant dashboard access to all users, choose **Allow all**
     **roles and users in this account to view**
     **dashboards**.

     ###### Important

     Selecting roles or users, or choosing all users, only adds
     them to the [data access policy](../../../opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-data-access.md) needed for accessing OpenSearch Service
     collection that stores the dashboard data. **For them to**
     **be able to view the vended logs dashboards, you must also**
     **grant those roles and users the [CloudWatchOpenSearchDashboardAccess](iam-identity-based-access-control-cwl.md#managed-policies-cwl-CloudWatchOpenSearchDashboardAccess) managed IAM policy.**
9. Choose **Create integration**

Creating the integration will take a few minutes.
