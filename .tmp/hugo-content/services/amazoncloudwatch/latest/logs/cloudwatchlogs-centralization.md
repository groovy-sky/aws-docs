# Cross-account cross-Region log centralization

Amazon CloudWatch Logs data centralization works with AWS Organizations to collect log data from multiple member
accounts into one data repository using cross-account and cross-region centralization rules.
You define the rules that automatically replicate log data from multiple accounts and
AWS Regions into a centralized account within your organization. This capability
streamlines log consolidation for improved centralized monitoring, analysis, and compliance
across your entire AWS infrastructure.

CloudWatch Logs data centralization offers configuration flexibility to meet operational and
security requirements, such as the ability to configure a backup region during rule setup
within the destination account to ensure increased resiliency. Additionally, you have full
control over encryption behavior for log groups copied from source accounts to handle data
originally encrypted with customer managed KMS keys.

###### Note

The CloudWatch Logs centralization feature only processes new log data that arrives in source accounts
after you create the centralization rule. Historical log data (logs that existed before
rule creation) is not centralized.

## Data centralization concepts

Before you begin using CloudWatch Logs data centralization, familiarize yourself with the
following concepts:

**Centralization rule**

A configuration that defines how log data from source accounts and regions
is replicated to a destination account and region. Rules specify source
criteria and destination settings.

**Source account**

The AWS account where log data originates. Log events from source
accounts are replicated to the destination account based on the
centralization rules you define.

**Destination account**

The destination AWS account where replicated log data is stored. This
account serves as the centralized location for log analysis and
monitoring.

**Backup region**

An optional secondary region within the destination account where log data
can be replicated for increased resiliency and disaster recovery
purposes.

**Encryption in CloudWatch Logs**

Log group data is always encrypted in CloudWatch Logs. By default,
CloudWatch Logs uses server-side encryption with 256-bit Advanced Encryption
Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) to encrypt log data at rest. As an alternative,
you can use AWS Key Management Service for this encryption. For more information,
see [CloudWatch Logs Encryption documentation](encrypt-log-data-kms.md).

- **How encryption works during centralization**: CloudWatch Logs centralization actively
copies log data at ingestion time from source accounts to destination accounts. During this
process, your data remains encrypted in transit using an AWS owned service key. Data at rest in both
source and destination log groups is encrypted using your chosen encryption method
(customer managed or AWS owned KMS keys). If you are using customer managed KMS key in your destination log groups,
add the tag `LogsManaged = true` to the kms key for Centralization service to access it.

- **When KMS permissions are required**:

- If you are using customer managed KMS keys in your source accounts, CloudWatch Logs
requires [KMS permissions](encrypt-log-data-kms.md#cmk-permissions-lg)
in the following example scenarios:

- **Throughput Management**: When centralization throughput limits are reached, log data is
temporarily stored encrypted with your customer managed KMS key until bandwidth becomes available.

- **Data Protection and Redaction**: When source log groups have data protection policies enabled,
CloudWatch Logs requires decrypt permissions to access raw log data to centralize it.

###### Important

Centralization rules are managed by the AWS Organizations management account or delegated administrator.
To exclude customer managed KMS-encrypted log groups from centralization, configure the rule settings
to "Do not centralize log groups encrypted with AWS KMS key."

## Setting up log centralization

To set up CloudWatch Logs Centralization, you need to configure centralization rules that define
how log data flows from log groups in source accounts to log groups in your destination
account.

Once the centralization rule is enabled and log events are being replicated to the
destination account, you can create metric, subscription, and account filters on centralized log
groups with enhanced filtering capabilities. These filters can target log events from
specific source accounts and regions, and can emit source account and region information
as metric dimensions. For more information, see [Creating metrics from log events using filters](monitoringlogdata.md).

### Prerequisites

- AWS Organizations must be set up and the source and destination accounts must both
belong to the organization.

- Trusted access must be enabled for CloudWatch, the management account and the
destination account so provide access to the log data.

###### Note

It is recommended to enable trusted access through the console, which
automatically creates the required service-linked role (SLR). If trusted
access is enabled through other methods, the service-linked role will
need to be created separately.

### Customizing destination log group names

When you create a centralization rule, you can customize how destination log group
names are structured using attributes. These attributes are automatically replaced
with actual values when log groups are created, allowing you to organize logs
hierarchically in your destination account. By default, only the
`${source.logGroup}` attribute is used, which merges all log groups with
the same name in the destination account. If a variable cannot be resolved,
it inherits the value from its parent variable in the hierarchy.

#### Available attributes

You can use the following attributes in your destination log group name
pattern:

Destination log group name attributesAttributeDescription`${source.accountId}`The AWS account ID where the log originated.`${source.region}`The AWS Region where the log originated.`${source.logGroup}`The original log group name from the source account.`${source.org.id}`Your AWS Organizations ID of the source account.`${source.org.ouId}`The organizational unit ID of the source account`${source.org.rootId}`The organization root ID`${source.org.path}`The full organizational path from account to root

#### Examples

Preserve original log group structure

Pattern: `/centralized/${source.accountId}${source.logGroup}`

Result: `/centralized/123456789012/aws/lambda/my-function`

Organize by account and region

Pattern: `/centralized/${source.accountId}/${source.region}`

Result: `/centralized/123456789012/us-east-1`

Organize by organization structure

Pattern: `/logs/${source.org.id}/${source.org.ouId}/${source.accountId}`

Result: `/logs/o-abc123/ou-xyz-12345678/123456789012`

Simple flat structure

Pattern: `/centralized-logs`

Result: `/centralized-logs`

#### Best practices

- Include the source account ID to easily identify which account logs
came from.

- Include the source region if you are centralizing from multiple
regions.

- Structure destination log group names to be under 512 characters.
CloudWatch Logs enforces a maximum log group name length of 512
characters.

### Creating a centralization rule

Use the following procedure to create a centralization rule that replicates log
data from source accounts to your destination account.

###### To create a centralization rule

1. Navigate to the CloudWatch console in the Management or Delegated Administrator
    account of the organization.

2. Choose **Settings**.

3. Navigate to the **Organization** tab.

4. Choose **Configure rule**.

5. Specify source details by setting the following fields, then choose
    **Next**:
1. **Centralization rule name**: Enter a unique name
       for the centralization rule.

2. **Source accounts**: Define source selection
       criteria to pick accounts from which telemetry data will be
       centralized. The selection criteria can include:

- A list of member accounts in the organization

- A list of organization units in the organization

- The entire organization

You can provide the selection criteria in two modes:

- **Builder**: A click-based experience to
generate the source selection criteria

- **Editor**: A free-form text box to
provide the source selection criteria

Supported syntax for source selection criteria:

- _Supported Keys:_ OrganizationId \|
OrganizationUnitId \| AccountId \| \*

- _Supported Operators:_ = \| IN \|
OR

3. **Source Regions**: Select a list of regions to
       look for the telemetry data to centralize.
6. Specify destination details by setting the following fields, then choose
    **Next**:
1. **Destination account**: Select an account in the
       organization that acts as a central destination for telemetry
       data.

2. **Destination Region**: Select a primary region
       that stores a copy of the centralized telemetry data.

3. **Backup Region**: Optionally select a region
       that stores a second copy of the centralized telemetry data.
7. Specify telemetry data by setting the following fields, then choose
    **Next**:
1. **Log groups**: Choose one of the following
       options:

- **All log groups**: Centralize logs from
all log groups in the source accounts.

- **Filter log group**: Centralize logs
from a subset of log groups in the source accounts, matching
selection criteria. You can provide the
selection criteria in two modes:

- **Builder**: A click-based
experience to generate the selection
criteria

- **Editor**: A free-form text box
to provide the selection criteria

There are two selection criteria that you can use to filter
logs:

- **Log group selection criteria**:
The selection criteria that specifies which
source log groups to centralize.

- _Supported Keys:_ LogGroupName
\| \*

- _Supported Operators:_ = \| != \|
IN \| NOT IN \| AND \| OR \| LIKE \| NOT LIKE

- **Data source selection criteria**:
The selection criteria that specifies which
data sources to centralize.

- _Supported Keys:_ DataSourceName
\| DataSourceType

- _Supported Operators:_ = \| != \|
IN \| NOT IN \| AND \| OR \| LIKE \| NOT LIKE

When both log group selection criteria and data source
selection criteria are specified, a log event must match
both criteria to be centralized.

2. **KMS Encrypted Log Group**

      ###### Important

      CloudWatch centralization rules will fail to deliver logs from the
      source account to the destination log groups if the KMS Key
      provided in the Centralization rule doesn't permit CloudWatch Logs to use
      it. If you are using customer managed KMS key in your destination log groups,
      add the tag LogsManaged = true to the kms key. For more information, see [Step 2: Set permissions on the KMS key](cloudwatchlogs-insights-query-encrypt.md#cmk-permissions).

      Choose one of the following options:

- **Centralize source log groups encrypted with customer managed KMS keys**
**using a destination specific customer managed KMS key**: Centralize log events from source log groups encrypted with
customer managed KMS keys into destination log groups encrypted with a
customer managed KMS key in the destination account.

When this setting is selected, you must also set the
following:

- **Destination encryption key**
**ARN**: ARN of the customer managed KMS key in the destination account
and primary destination region, to be associated with newly created destination log groups.

- **Backup destination encryption key**
**ARN** (if backup region is selected): ARN of the customer managed KMS key in the
destination account and backup destination region, to be associated with newly created destination log groups.

- **Skip centralizing to unencrypted destination log**
**groups** (optional): If a log group already exists without a customer managed KMS key,
CloudWatch cannot update its encryption. Choose this option to skip centralization of log events
from source log groups encrypted with customer managed KMS keys into destination log groups that
are not associated with a customer managed KMS key.

- **Centralize log groups encrypted with customer managed KMS keys in destination account**
**with AWS owned KMS key**: Centralize log events from source log groups encrypted with customer managed
KMS keys into newly created destination log groups encrypted using an AWS owned KMS key.

- **Do not centralize log groups encrypted with**
**customer managed KMS keys**: Skip centralization of log events from source log groups
encrypted with customer managed KMS keys.
8. Review the centralization rule, optionally make any last-minute edits, and
    choose **Create Centralization policy**.

### Modifying a centralization rule

Use the following procedure to modify an existing centralization rule.

###### To modify a centralization rule

6. Confirm deletion and choose **Delete**.

## Monitoring and troubleshooting centralization rules

You can monitor the status and performance of your centralization rules using CloudWatch
metrics, the CloudWatch Logs console, and AWS CloudTrail logs. This helps you ensure that log data is
being replicated successfully and identify any issues with your centralization configuration.

CloudWatch Logs provides:

1. _Rule health per Centralization rule_

1. Choose **Settings**.

2. Navigate to the **Organization** tab.

3. Choose **Manage rules**.

2. _Logs API calls with AWS CloudTrail_

3. CloudWatch also publishes metrics for centralization, including log events replicated,
    errors, and throttling. For more information about these metrics and their dimensions,
    see [Centralization metrics and dimensions](cloudwatch-logs-monitoring-cloudwatch-metrics.md#CloudWatchLogs-Centralization-Metrics).

### Centralization rule health status

Each centralization rule has a health status that indicates whether it's operating
correctly. You can check rule health through the console or programmatically using
the API.

Rule health statuses include:

- `HEALTHY`: The rule is operating normally and replicating log
data as configured

- `UNHEALTHY`: The rule has encountered issues and may not be
replicating data correctly

- `PROVISIONING`: Centralization for the organization is in the
process of being set up.

When a rule is marked as UNHEALTHY, the `FailureReason` field provides
details about the specific issue that needs to be addressed.

### Monitoring centralization API calls with AWS CloudTrail

AWS CloudTrail logs API calls made to the centralization service, allowing you to track
configuration changes and troubleshoot issues for accounts that are members of your
AWS Organizations.

Key CloudTrail events for centralization include:

- `CreateCentralizationRuleForOrganization`: When a new
centralization rule is created

- `UpdateCentralizationRuleForOrganization`: When an existing
rule is modified

- `DeleteCentralizationRuleForOrganization`: When a rule is
deleted

- `GetCentralizationRuleForOrganization`: When rule details are
retrieved

- `ListCentralizationRulesForOrganization`: When rules are
listed

You can use CloudTrail logs to audit centralization configuration changes and correlate
them with performance issues or replication failures.

### Monitoring recommendations

To ensure centralization is working correctly, we recommend setting up CloudWatch alarms
on key centralization metrics that we vend to CloudWatch Metrics. This proactive monitoring helps you detect issues early
and maintain reliable log centralization across your organization.

Key metrics to monitor include:

- `IncomingCopiedBytes`: Monitor the volume of log data being
successfully replicated to your destination account. A sudden drop or absence
of this metric may indicate centralization issues.

- `CentralizationError`: Set up alarms for any errors in the centralization
process to quickly identify and resolve issues.

- `CentralizationThrottled`: Monitor for throttling events that could
impact log replication performance.

For a complete list of available centralization metrics and their dimensions,
see [Centralization metrics and dimensions](cloudwatch-logs-monitoring-cloudwatch-metrics.md#CloudWatchLogs-Centralization-Metrics).

If logs are not being centralized as expected, review the following common scenarios
that can prevent log centralization.

**Historical log data**

The CloudWatch Logs centralization feature only processes new log data that arrives
in source accounts after you create the centralization rule. Historical log
data (logs that existed before rule creation) is not centralized.

**KMS key permissions**

Centralization rules will fail to deliver logs from the source account to
the destination log groups if the KMS key provided in the centralization
rule doesn't permit CloudWatch Logs to use it. Ensure that the KMS key policy grants
the necessary permissions to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see [Step 2: Set permissions on the KMS key](cloudwatchlogs-insights-query-encrypt.md#cmk-permissions).

**Customer Managed KMS key configuration**

If you selected **Do not centralize log groups encrypted with**
**Customer Managed KMS key** during rule creation, log events
from source log groups encrypted with Customer Managed KMS key will be
skipped and not centralized.

**Destination encryption mismatch**

If the destination log group already exists with a different KMS encryption
configuration than what the centralization rule specifies, and the conflict
resolution is set to SKIP, records will be dropped and a
`DestinationEncryptionMismatch` error will be emitted. For
example, this occurs when the destination has default encryption but the rule
specifies a customer managed KMS key.

**Trusted access not enabled**

Trusted access must be enabled for CloudWatch in AWS Organizations for the management
account and the destination account to provide access to the log data.

**Source selection criteria**

Verify that your centralization rule's source selection criteria is
configured correctly:

- _Accounts and regions_: Ensure that the source
accounts and regions where logs originate are included in the rule.
Log groups from accounts or regions not specified in the rule will
not be centralized.

- _Log group filters_: If you configured log group
filters, only log groups matching the specified criteria will be
centralized. Verify that your log group selection criteria includes
the log groups you expect to centralize.

- _Organization membership_: Both source and
destination accounts must belong to the same AWS Organizations organization.
Accounts outside the organization cannot participate in
centralization.

**Log group quota limit reached**

If the destination account has reached its log group quota limit, new log
groups cannot be created for centralization. Verify that the destination
account has sufficient quota to accommodate centralized log groups from all
source accounts. You can request a quota increase if needed.

**Log stream name length limit exceeded**

Log stream names have maximum length restrictions. When centralization
replicates log streams to the destination account, a suffix is added to the
log stream name. If the resulting log stream name exceeds the maximum allowed
length, records will be dropped and an `InvalidLogStream`
error will be emitted to the customer account.

**Rule health status**

Check the centralization rule health status in the console or using the
`GetCentralizationRuleForOrganization` API. If the rule is
marked as UNHEALTHY, review the `FailureReason` field for
specific details about the issue.

To diagnose centralization issues, review the centralization rule health status in the
console, check CloudWatch metrics for errors and throttling, and examine AWS CloudTrail logs for API
call failures. For more information about centralization metrics, see [Centralization metrics and dimensions](cloudwatch-logs-monitoring-cloudwatch-metrics.md#CloudWatchLogs-Centralization-Metrics).
