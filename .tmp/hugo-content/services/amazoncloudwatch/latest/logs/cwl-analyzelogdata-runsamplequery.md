# Tutorial: Run and modify a sample query

The following tutorial helps you get started with CloudWatch Logs Insights. You run a
sample query in Logs Insights QL, and then see how to modify and rerun
it.

To run a query, you must already have logs stored in CloudWatch Logs. If you are
already using CloudWatch Logs and have log groups and log streams set up, you are
ready to start. You may also already have logs if you use services such as
AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Route 53, or Amazon VPC and you have set up logs from those services
to go to CloudWatch Logs. For more information about sending logs to CloudWatch Logs, see [Getting started with CloudWatch Logs](cwl-gettingstarted.md).

Queries in CloudWatch Logs Insights return either a set of fields from log events or the
result of a mathematical aggregation or other operation performed on log
events. This tutorial demonstrates a query that returns a list of log
events.

## Run a sample query

###### To run a CloudWatch Logs Insights sample query

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, and
    then choose **Logs Insights**.

On the **Logs Insights** page, the query
    editor contains a default query in Logs Insights QL that returns
    the 20 most recent log events.

3. In the **Select log group(s)** drop down,
    choose one or more log groups to query.

    If this is a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account
    observability, you can select log groups in the source accounts
    as well as the monitoring account. A single query can query logs
    from different accounts at once.

You can filter the log groups by log group name, account ID,
    or account label.

When you select a log group in the Standard log class, CloudWatch Logs Insights
    automatically detects data fields in the group. To see
    discovered fields, select the **Fields** menu
    near the top right of the page.

###### Note

Discovered fields is supported only for log groups in the
Standard log class. For more information about log classes,
see [Log classes](cloudwatch-logs-log-classes.md).

4. (Optional) Use the time interval selector to select a time
    period that you want to query.

You can choose between 5 and 30-minute intervals; 1, 3, and
    12-hour intervals; or a custom time frame.

5. Choose **Run** to view the results.

For this tutorial, the results include the 20 most recently
    added log events.

CloudWatch Logs displays a bar graph of log events in the log group over
    time. The bar graph shows not only the events in the table, but
    also the distribution of events in the log group that match the
    query and timeframe.

6. To see all fields for a returned log event, choose the
    triangular dropdown icon left of the numbered event.

## Modify the sample query

In this tutorial, you modify the sample query to show the 50 most
recent log events.

If you haven't already run the previous tutorial, do that now. This
tutorial starts where that previous tutorial ends.

###### Note

Some sample queries provided with CloudWatch Logs Insights use `head` or
`tail` commands instead of `limit`. These
commands are being deprecated and have been replaced with
`limit`. Use `limit` instead of
`head` or `tail` in all queries that you
write.

###### To modify the CloudWatch Logs Insights sample query

1. In the query editor, change **20** to
    **50**, and then choose
    **Run**.

The results of the new query appear. Assuming there is enough
    data in the log group in the default time range, there are now
    50 log events listed.

2. (Optional) You can save queries that you have created. To save
    this query, choose **Save**. For more
    information, see [Save and re-run CloudWatch Logs Insights queries](cwl-insights-saving-queries.md).

## Add a filter command to the sample query

This tutorial shows how to make a more powerful change to the query in
the query editor. In this tutorial, you filter the results of the
previous query based on a field in the retrieved log events.

If you haven't already run the previous tutorials, do that now. This
tutorial starts where that previous tutorial ends.

###### To add a filter command to the previous query

1. Decide on a field to filter. To see the most common fields
    that CloudWatch Logs has detected in the log events contained in the
    selected log groups in the past 15 minutes, and the percentage
    of those log events in which each field appears, select
    **Fields** on the right side of the
    page.

To see the fields contained in a particular log event, choose
    the icon to the left of that row.

The **awsRegion** field might appear in your
    log event, depending on which events are in your logs. For the
    rest of this tutorial, we use **awsRegion** as
    the filter field, but you can use a different field if that
    field isn't available.

2. In the query editor box, place your cursor after
    **50** and press Enter.

3. On the new line, first enter \| (the pipe character) and a
    space. Commands in a CloudWatch Logs Insights query must be separated by the pipe
    character.

4. Enter `filter
                                       awsRegion="us-east-1"`.

5. Choose **Run**.

The query runs again, and now displays the 50 most recent
    results that match the new filter.

If you filtered on a different field and got an error result,
    you might need to escape the field name. If the field name
    includes non-alphanumeric characters, you must put backtick
    characters (\`) before and after the field name (for example,
    `` `error-code`="102"``).

You must use the backtick characters for field names that
    contain non-alphanumeric characters, but not for values. Values
    are always contained in quotation marks (").

Logs Insights QL includes powerful query abilities, including several
commands and support for regular expressions, mathematical, and
statistical operations. For more information, see [CloudWatch Logs Insights language query syntax](cwl-querysyntax.md).
