# Example: Count occurrences of a term

Log events frequently include important messages that you want to count, maybe
about the success or failure of operations. For example, an error may occur and be
recorded to a log file if a given operation fails. You may want to monitor these
entries to understand the trend of your errors.

In the example below, a metric filter is created to monitor for the term Error.
The policy has been created and added to the log group
**MyApp/message.log**. CloudWatch Logs publishes a data point to the CloudWatch
custom metric ErrorCount in the **MyApp/message.log** namespace
with a value of "1" for every event containing Error. If no event contains the word
Error, then a value of 0 is published. When graphing this data in the CloudWatch console,
be sure to use the sum statistic.

After you create a metric filter, you can view the metric in the CloudWatch console.
When you are selecting the metric to view, select the metric namespace that matches
the log group name. For more information, see [Viewing Available\
Metrics](../monitoring/viewing-metrics-with-cloudwatch.md).

###### To create a metric filter using the CloudWatch console

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Log groups**.

03. Choose the name of the log group.

04. Choose **Actions**, **Create metric**
    **filter**.

05. For **Filter Pattern**, enter
     `Error`.

    ###### Note

    All entries in **Filter Pattern** are
    case-sensitive.

06. (Optional) To test your filter pattern, under **Test**
    **Pattern**, enter one or more log events to use to test the
     pattern. Each log event must be within one line, because line breaks are
     used to separate log events in the **Log event messages**
     box.

07. Choose **Next**, and then on the **Assign**
    **metric** page, for **Filter Name**, type
     `MyAppErrorCount`.

08. Under **Metric Details**, for **Metric**
    **Namespace**, type **MyNameSpace**.

09. For **Metric Name**, type
     **ErrorCount**.

10. Confirm that **Metric Value** is 1. This specifies that
     the count is incremented by 1 for every log event containing "Error".

11. For **Default Value** type 0, and then choose
     **Next**.

12. Choose **Create metric filter**.

###### To create a metric filter using the AWS CLI

At a command prompt, run the following command:

```nohighlight

aws logs put-metric-filter \
  --log-group-name MyApp/message.log \
  --filter-name MyAppErrorCount \
  --filter-pattern 'Error' \
  --metric-transformations \
      metricName=ErrorCount,metricNamespace=MyNamespace,metricValue=1,defaultValue=0
```

You can test this new policy by posting events containing the word "Error" in the
message.

###### To post events using the AWS CLI

At a command prompt, run the following command. Note that patterns are
case-sensitive.

```nohighlight

aws logs put-log-events \
  --log-group-name MyApp/access.log --log-stream-name TestStream1 \
  --log-events \
    timestamp=1394793518000,message="This message contains an Error" \
    timestamp=1394793528000,message="This message also contains an Error"
```
