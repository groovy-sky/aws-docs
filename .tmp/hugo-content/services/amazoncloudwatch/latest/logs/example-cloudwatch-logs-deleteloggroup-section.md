        public static async Task Main()
        {
            var client = new AmazonCloudWatchLogsClient();
            string logGroupName = "cloudwatchlogs-example-loggroup";

            var request = new DeleteLogGroupRequest
            {
                LogGroupName = logGroupName,
            };

            var response = await client.DeleteLogGroupAsync(request);

            if (response.HttpStatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
