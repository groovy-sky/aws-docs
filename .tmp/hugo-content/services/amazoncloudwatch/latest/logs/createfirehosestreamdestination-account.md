# Step 2: Create a destination

###### Important

All steps in this procedure are to be done in the log data recipient
account.

When the destination is created, CloudWatch Logs sends a test message to the destination
on the recipient account’s behalf. When the subscription filter is active later,
CloudWatch Logs sends log events to the destination on the source account’s behalf.

###### To create a destination

1. Wait until the Firehose stream that you created in [Step 1: Create a Firehose delivery stream](createfirehosestream-account.md) becomes active. You
    can use the following command to check the
    **StreamDescription.StreamStatus** property.

```

aws firehose describe-delivery-stream --delivery-stream-name "my-delivery-stream"
```

In addition, take note of the
    **DeliveryStreamDescription.DeliveryStreamARN**
    value, because you will need to use it in a later step. Sample output of
    this command:

```

{
       "DeliveryStreamDescription": {
           "DeliveryStreamName": "my-delivery-stream",
           "DeliveryStreamARN": "arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:222222222222:deliverystream/my-delivery-stream",

                       "CloudWatchLoggingOptions": {
                           "Enabled": false
                       }
                   },
                   "ExtendedS3DestinationDescription": {
                       "RoleARN": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/FirehosetoS3Role",
                       "BucketARN": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
                       "BufferingHints": {

                           "IntervalInSeconds": 300
                       },
                       "CompressionFormat": "UNCOMPRESSED",
                       "EncryptionConfiguration": {
                           "NoEncryptionConfig": "NoEncryption"
                       },
                       "CloudWatchLoggingOptions": {
                           "Enabled": false
                       },
                       "S3BackupMode": "Disabled"
                   }
               }
           ],
           "HasMoreDestinations": false
       }
}
```

It might take a minute or two for your delivery stream to show up in
    the active state.

2. When the delivery stream is active, create the IAM role that will
    grant CloudWatch Logs the permission to put data into your Firehose stream. First,
    you'll need to create a trust policy in a file
    **~/TrustPolicyForCWL.json**. Use a text editor to
    create this policy. For more information about CloudWatch Logs endpoints, see
    [Amazon CloudWatch Logs endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/cwl-region.md).

This policy includes a `aws:SourceArn` global condition
    context key that specifies the `sourceAccountId` to help
    prevent the confused deputy security problem. If you don't yet know the
    source account ID in the first call, we recommend that you put the
    destination ARN in the source ARN field. In the subsequent calls, you
    should set the source ARN to be the actual source ARN that you gathered
    from the first call. For more information, see [Confused deputy prevention](subscriptions-confused-deputy.md).

```nohighlight

{
       "Statement": {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": {
               "Service": "logs.amazonaws.com"
           },
           "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
           "Condition": {
               "StringLike": {
                   "aws:SourceArn": [
                       "arn:aws:logs:region:sourceAccountId:*",
                       "arn:aws:logs:region:recipientAccountId:*"
                   ]
               }
           }
        }
}
```

3. Use the **aws iam create-role** command to create the
    IAM role, specifying the trust policy file that you just created.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role \
         --role-name CWLtoKinesisFirehoseRole \
         --assume-role-policy-document file://~/TrustPolicyForCWL.json
```

The following is a sample output. Take note of the returned
    `Role.Arn` value, because you will
    need to use it in a later step.

```nohighlight

{
       "Role": {
           "Path": "/",
           "RoleName": "CWLtoKinesisFirehoseRole",
           "RoleId": "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED",
           "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/CWLtoKinesisFirehoseRole",
           "CreateDate": "2023-02-02T08:10:43+00:00",
           "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
               "Statement": {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": {
                       "Service": "logs.amazonaws.com"
                   },
                   "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                   "Condition": {
                       "StringLike": {
                           "aws:SourceArn": [
                               "arn:aws:logs:region:sourceAccountId:*",
                               "arn:aws:logs:region:recipientAccountId:*"
                           ]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
}
```

4. Create a permissions policy to define which actions CloudWatch Logs can perform
    on your account. First, use a text editor to create a permissions policy
    in a file **~/PermissionsForCWL.json**:

```

{
       "Statement":[
         {
           "Effect":"Allow",
           "Action":["firehose:*"],
           "Resource":["arn:aws:firehose:region:222222222222:*"]
         }
       ]
}
```

5. Associate the permissions policy with the role by entering the
    following command:

```

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name CWLtoKinesisFirehoseRole --policy-name Permissions-Policy-For-CWL --policy-document file://~/PermissionsForCWL.json
```

6. After the Firehose delivery stream is in the active state and you have
    created the IAM role, you can create the CloudWatch Logs destination.
1. This step will not associate an access policy with your
       destination and is only the first step out of two that completes
       a destination creation. Make a note of the ARN of the new
       destination that is returned in the payload, because you will
       use this as the `destination.arn` in a later
       step.

      ```nohighlight

      aws logs put-destination \
          --destination-name "testFirehoseDestination" \
          --target-arn "arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:222222222222:deliverystream/my-delivery-stream" \
          --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/CWLtoKinesisFirehoseRole"

      {
          "destination": {
              "destinationName": "testFirehoseDestination",
              "targetArn": "arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:222222222222:deliverystream/my-delivery-stream",
              "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/CWLtoKinesisFirehoseRole",
              "arn": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:222222222222:destination:testFirehoseDestination"}
      }
      ```

2. After the previous step is complete, in the log data recipient
       account (222222222222), associate an access policy with the
       destination. This policy enables the log data sender account
       (111111111111) to access the destination in just the log data
       recipient account (222222222222). You can use a text editor to
       put this policy in the `~/AccessPolicy.json`
       file:
      JSON

      ```json

      {
        "Version":"2012-10-17",
        "Statement" : [
          {
            "Sid" : "",
            "Effect" : "Allow",
            "Principal" : {
              "AWS" : "111111111111"
            },
            "Action" : ["logs:PutSubscriptionFilter","logs:PutAccountPolicy"],
            "Resource" : "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:222222222222:destination:testFirehoseDestination"
          }
        ]
      }

      ```

3. This creates a policy that defines who has write access to the
       destination. This policy must specify the
       `logs:PutSubscriptionFilter` and
       `logs:PutAccountPolicy` actions to access the
       destination. Cross-account users will use the
       `PutSubscriptionFilter` and
       `PutAccountPolicy` actions to send log events to
       the destination.

      ```nohighlight

      aws logs put-destination-policy \
          --destination-name "testFirehoseDestination" \
          --access-policy file://~/AccessPolicy.json
      ```
