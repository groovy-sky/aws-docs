# Permissions requests in AWS IQ

In AWS IQ, an expert might request a permissions policy to access your AWS account and
complete the necessary work. The level of access required depends on the scope of the project.
AWS IQ simplifies the process of granting access to experts, which allows experts to implement
projects in your account.

AWS IQ creates an IAM role for the expert to use for the duration of the proposal. You
can view AWS CloudTrail logs of the expert's activity in your account and can revoke access at any time.
Access is automatically revoked at the completion of the proposal, when the final payment is
made.

An expert might also include details about why they're requesting a level of permissions. You
can review the information in the permission request. To get started, choose the permission
request in the AWS IQ console and then choose **Accept** or
**Decline**.

###### Tip

It is an AWS security best practice to grant the least amount of privileges necessary to
perform a task. If you think the expert is requesting an inappropriate level of access, you
should decline the request. Learn more about [Granting least privilege](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md#grant-least-privilege) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.
