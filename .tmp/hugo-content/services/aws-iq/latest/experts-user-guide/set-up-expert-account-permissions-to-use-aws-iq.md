End of support notice: On May 28, 2026, AWS
will end support for AWS IQ. After May 28, 2026, you will

# Setting up permissions to use AWS IQ

To access AWS IQ, you must have the necessary permissions. Navigate to the AWS Management Console to
view or set up permissions. To leverage all resources on AWS IQ, add the [`AWSIQFullAccess` managed policy](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsiqfullaccess.md). For more granular controls, add specific
permissions to your IAM identity.

###### Note

As a security best practice, we recommend periodically changing your user access keys. For
more information, see [Managing access keys in IAM](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-credentials-access-keys.md#Using_RotateAccessKey).

This topic describes how to create an
IAM user,
attach policies to an existing user, and set up granular permissions in the AWS Management Console.

## Creating a user with `AWSIQFullAccess` permissions

You, or your AWS account administrator, can create a new user with the
`AWSIQFullAccess` managed policy on your AWS account. You can also attach this
managed policy to an existing
user.
For more information, see [`AWSIQFullAccess`](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsiqfullaccess.md) in the AWS _Managed Policy Reference_
_Guide_.

###### To create an IAM user with managed policies

1. Sign in to the
    **AWS Management Console**.

2. Choose **Users** and then choose **Add users**.

3. Enter a **User name**, and then choose **AWS Management Console**
**access**. Accept the default information or change to custom values.

4. Choose **Next: Permissions** and then choose **Attach existing**
**policies directly**.

5. Choose **`AWSIQFullAccess`** from the list of policy names,
    and then choose **Next: Tags**.
1. _(Optional)_ Add tags and then choose **Next:**
      **Review**.
6. Choose **Create user**.

7. Choose **Show** to display the password, and then copy
    your
    password to a secure location. You can also choose **Send email** to send the
    login instructions within an email message.

## Attaching managed policies to an existing user

If you already have an
IAM user,
you can attach the `AWSIQFullAccess` managed policy using the following
procedure.

###### To attach managed policies to an existing IAM user

1. Sign in to the [IAM\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Choose **Users**.

3. Choose the user name to see the summary page for the user.

4. Choose **Add permissions**.

5. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**.

6. Choose `AWSIQFullAccess` from the list of policy
    names.

If you don't see the policy names on the first page, filter the policies or search for the
    names using the console.

7. Choose **Next: Review**.

8. Choose **Add permissions**.

For more information, see [Adding\
and removing identity permissions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-attach-detach.md).

## Granular IAM permissions

As a user with
administrative access, you can create one or more users in your AWS account.
To configure your users with chosen levels of access on AWS IQ, you can deny specific
permissions. First, add the `AWSIQFullAccess` managed policy. Then, you can add inline
policies to deny specific permissions. For more information, see [Actions, resource, and condition keys for AWS IQ](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-awsiq.md).

The following are examples of how to use granular permissions in AWS IQ.

###### To use granular permissions in AWS IQ

1. Sign in to the [IAM\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. To restrict a user from requesting access to a customer’s AWS account, create a deny
    policy on the **CreatePermissionRequest**, which is used to grant
    permission for creating permission requests.
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Action": [
                   "iq-permission:CreatePermissionRequest"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
}

```

3. To restrict a user from requesting payments and proposals, create a deny policy for the
    following permissions:

- `CreatePaymentRequest` – grants permission to create a payment
request.

- `CreateMilestoneProposal` – grants permission to create a milestone
proposal.

- `CreateUpfrontProposal` – grants permission to create an upfront
proposal.

- `CreateScheduledProposal` – grants permission to create a scheduled billing
proposal.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Action": [
                  "iq:CreatePaymentRequest",
                  "iq:CreateMilestoneProposal",
                  "iq:CreateUpfrontProposal",
                  "iq:CreateScheduledProposal"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
}

```

4. To restrict a user from sending chat messages, create a deny policy on all resources for
    the following permissions:

- `SendIndividualChatMessage` – grants permission to chat messages as an
individual.

- `SendCompanyChatMessage` – grants permission to send chat messages as
a company.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "iq:SendIndividualChatMessage",
                "iq:SendCompanyChatMessage"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### To attach inline policies to an existing IAM identity

1. Sign in to the [IAM\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Choose **Users**.

3. Choose the username to see the summary page for the user.

4. Choose **Add permissions**.

5. Choose **Create inline policy**.

6. Select **Switch to deny permissions** to deny access.

7. Under **Service**, search for **IQ** or **IQ**
**Permissions**.

###### Note

If you’re searching for permission requests and access grants, use **IQ**
**Permissions**. For all other permissions, use **IQ**.

8. Under **Access level**, select the permissions to deny.

9. Choose **Review policy**, provide the name for your policy, and then
    choose **Create policy**.
