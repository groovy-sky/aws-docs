# Mapping fine-grained IAM actions reference

###### Note

The following AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions have reached the end of standard support on July 2023:

- `aws-portal` namespace

- `purchase-orders:ViewPurchaseOrders`

- `purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders`

If you're using AWS Organizations, you can use the [bulk policy migrator scripts](migrate-iam-permissions.md) or bulk policy migrator to update
polices from your payer account. You can also use the old to granular action
mapping reference to verify the IAM actions that need to be added.

If you have an AWS account, or are a part of an AWS Organizations created on or after
March 6, 2023, 11:00 AM (PDT), the fine-grained actions are already in effect in your
organization.

You will need to migrate the following IAM actions in your permission policies or service
control policies (SCP):

- `aws-portal:ViewAccount`

- `aws-portal:ViewBilling`

- `aws-portal:ViewPaymentMethods`

- `aws-portal:ViewUsage`

- `aws-portal:ModifyAccount`

- `aws-portal:ModifyBilling`

- `aws-portal:ModifyPaymentMethods`

- `purchase-orders:ViewPurchaseOrders`

- `purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders`

You can use this topic to view the mapping of the old to new fine-grained actions for each
IAM action that we're retiring.

###### Overview

1. Review your affected IAM policies in your AWS account. To do so, follow the steps in
    the **Affected policies** tool to identify your affected IAM policies.
    See [How to use the affected policies tool](migrate-security-iam-tool.md).

2. Use the IAM console to add the new granular permissions to your policy. For example,
    if your policy allows the `purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders` permission, you
    will need to add each action in the [Mapping for purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders](#mapping-for-purchase-ordersmodifypurchaseorders) table.

**Old policy**

The following policy allows a user to add, delete, or modify any purchase order in the
    account.
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:purchase-orders::123456789012:purchase-order/*"
           }
       ]
}

```

**New policy**

The following policy also allows a user to add, delete, or modify any purchase order in
    the account. Note that each granular permission appears after the old
    `purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders` permission. These permissions give you
    more control over what actions you want to allow or deny.

###### Tip

We recommend that you keep the old permissions to ensure that you don't lose
permissions until this migration is complete.

JSON

```json

{
   	"Version":"2012-10-17",
   	"Statement": [
   		{
   			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
   			"Effect": "Allow",
   			"Action": [
   				"purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders",
   				"purchase-orders:AddPurchaseOrder",
   				"purchase-orders:DeletePurchaseOrder",
   				"purchase-orders:UpdatePurchaseOrder",
   				"purchase-orders:UpdatePurchaseOrderStatus"
   			],
   			"Resource": "arn:aws:purchase-orders::123456789012:purchase-order/*"
   		}
   	]
}

```

3. Save your changes.
