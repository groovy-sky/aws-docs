## CSV file

The first five rows of the CSV file are the metadata for the price list file. The sixth
row has the column names for the products and their attributes, such as
`SKU`, `RateCode`, and more.

The number of columns varies depends on the Savings Plan. The first few
columns contain the pricing details, while other columns contain the product
details for a Savings Plan.

## JSON file

The product details and pricing details are in separate sections. A JSON
service price list file looks like the following example.

```json

   "version" : "The version of the price list file",
   "publicationDate" : "The publication date of the price list file",
   "regionCode" : "Region for which price list file is valid for",
