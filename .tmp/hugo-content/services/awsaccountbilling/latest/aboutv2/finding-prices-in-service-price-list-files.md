The AWS Price List Bulk API provides prices for all AWS products for informational
purposes, including On-Demand and Reserved Instances pricing.

To find the prices and terms for a specific product, you can use the offer files. For
example, you can find a list of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance prices.

###### Note

The AWS Price List Bulk API is not a comprehensive source for limited period offers,
such as AWS Free Tier pricing. For information about Free Tier prices, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

2. Open the JSON file with your preferred application.

3. Under **terms** and **On-Demand**, find the
    SKU that you want.

If you don't know the SKU, search under **products** for the
    **usage type** and **operation**.

4. See the **pricePerUnit** to find the corresponding On-Demand
    price for the SKU.

## Finding tiered prices for services

The following procedure shows how to find tiered prices for services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service
(Amazon S3).

###### To find tiered prices for services by using the CSV file

## Finding tiered prices for services with Free Tier

The following procedure shows how to find AWS services that publish Free Tier
prices in the AWS Price List Bulk API, such as AWS Lambda.

All Free Tier prices are subject to the terms documented in [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

**Any** doesn't represent all AWS Regions in this scenario.
    It's a subset of Regions defined by other line items in the CSV file, with a
    **RelatedTo** column matching the SKU for the location
    **Any** entry.

5. To find a list of all eligible locations and products for a specific
    Free Tier SKU, find the Free Tier SKU under the
    **RelatedTo** column.

6. To find the covered usage by Free Tier across all eligible locations,
    see the **StartingRange** and **EndingRange**
    for the location **Any**.

### Example

This example assumes there are no more entries in the price file where
**RelatedTo** equals to the SKU `ABCD`.

As shown in the following table, the Free Tier offer with SKU
`ABCD` is valid in the `Asia Pacific (Singapore)` and
`US East (Ohio)` Regions, but not in `AWS GovCloud (US)`.
The covered usage by Free Tier is 400,000 seconds total, used across both
eligible Regions.
