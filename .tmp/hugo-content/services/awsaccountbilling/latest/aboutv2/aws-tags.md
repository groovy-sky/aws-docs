# Using AWS-generated tags

The AWS-generated tag `createdBy` is a tag that AWS defines and applies to
supported AWS resources for cost allocation purposes. To use the AWS-generated tag, a management account owner must activate it in the Billing and Cost Management console. When a management account owner
activates the tag, the tag is also activated for all member accounts. After the tag is
activated, AWS starts applying the tag to resources that are created after the
AWS-generated tag is activated.

The AWS-generated tag is available only in the Billing and Cost Management console and reports, and doesn't appear
anywhere else in the AWS console, including the AWS Tag Editor. The
`createdBy` tag does not count towards your tags per resource
quota.

The `aws:createdBy` tags are populated only in the following AWS Regions:

- `ap-northeast-1`

- `ap-northeast-2`

- `ap-south-1`

- `ap-southeast-1`

- `ap-southeast-2`

- `cn-north-1`

- `eu-central-1`

- `eu-west-1`

- `sa-east-1`

- `us-east-1`

- `us-east-2`

- `us-gov-west-1`

- `us-west-1`

- `us-west-2`

Resources created outside of these AWS Regions will not have this tag auto-populated.

The
`createdBy` tag uses the following key-value definition:

```

key = aws:createdBy
```

```

value = account-type:account-ID or access-key:user-name or role session name
```

Not all values include all of the value parameters. For example, the value for a
AWS-generated tag for a root account doesn't always have a user name.

Valid values for the `account-type` are `Root`,
`IAMUser`, `AssumedRole`, and
`FederatedUser`.

If the tag has an account ID, the `account-id` tracks the
account number of the root account or federated user who created the resource. If the
tag has an access key, then the `access-key` tracks the IAM
access key used and, if applicable, the session role name.

The `user-name` is the user name, if one is available.

Here are some examples of tag values:

```nohighlight

Root:1234567890
Root: 111122223333 :exampleUser
IAMUser: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED :exampleUser
AssumedRole: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED :exampleRole
FederatedUser:1234567890:exampleUser
```

For more information about IAM users, roles, and federation, see the [IAM User Guide](../../../iam/latest/userguide.md).

AWS generated cost allocation tags are applied on a best-effort basis. Issues with
services that AWS-generated tag depends on, such as CloudTrail, can cause a gap in
tagging.

## AWS Marketplace vendor-provided tags

Certain AWS Marketplace vendors can create tags and associate them with your software usage. These tags will have the prefix `aws:marketplace:isv:`. To use the tags, a management account owner must activate the tag in the Billing and Cost Management console. When a management account owner activates the tag, the tag is also activated for all member accounts. Similar to `aws:createdBy` tags, these tags appear only in the Billing and Cost Management console and they don't count towards your tags per resource quota. You can find the tag keys that apply to the product on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) product pages.

## Restrictions on AWS-generated tags cost allocation tags

The following restrictions apply to the AWS-generated tags:

- Only a management account can activate AWS-generated tags.

- You can't update, edit, or delete AWS-generated tags.

- The maximum active tag keys for Billing and Cost Management reports is 500.

- AWS-generated tags are created using CloudTrail logs. CloudTrail logs over a certain
size cause AWS-generated tag creation to
fail.

- The reserved prefix is `aws:`.

AWS-generated tag names and values are automatically assigned the `aws:` prefix, which you can't assign. AWS-generated tag names don't count towards the user-defined resource tag quota of 50. User-defined tag names have the prefix `user:` in the cost allocation report.

- Null tag values will not appear in Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets. If there is only one tag value that is also null, the tag key will also not appear in Cost Explorer or AWS Budgets.
