# Joining custom metadata with S3 metadata tables

You can analyze data across your AWS managed metadata tables and customer (self-managed) metadata
tables. By using a standard SQL `JOIN` operator, you can query data from these multiple
sources.

The following example SQL query finds matching records between an AWS managed journal table
( `"journal"`) and a self-managed metadata table
( `my_self_managed_metadata_table`). The query also filters
information based on `CREATE` events, which indicate that a new object (or a new version of the
object) was written to the bucket. (For more information, see the [S3 Metadata journal tables schema](metadata-tables-schema.md).)

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "s3tablescatalog/aws-s3"."b_general-purpose-bucket-name"."journal" a
JOIN "my_namespace"."my_self_managed_metadata_table" b
ON a.bucket = b.bucket AND a.key = b.key AND a.version_id = b.version_id
WHERE a.record_type = 'CREATE';
```

The following example SQL query finds matching records between an AWS managed inventory table
( `"inventory"`) and a self-managed metadata table
( `my_self_managed_metadata_table`):

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "s3tablescatalog/aws-s3"."b_general-purpose-bucket-name"."inventory" a
JOIN "my_namespace"."my_self_managed_metadata_table" b
ON a.bucket = b.bucket AND a.key = b.key AND a.version_id = b.version_id;
```
