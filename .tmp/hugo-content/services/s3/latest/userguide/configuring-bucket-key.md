# Configuring your bucket to use an S3 Bucket Key with SSE-KMS for new objects

When you configure server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), you can
configure your bucket to use an S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS on new objects. S3 Bucket Keys decrease the
request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS KMS and reduce the cost of SSE-KMS. For more information, see
[Reducing the cost of SSE-KMS with Amazon S3 Bucket Keys](bucket-key.md).

You can configure your bucket to use an S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS on new objects by using
the Amazon S3 console, REST API, AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or CloudFormation. If you want to enable or
disable an S3 Bucket Key for existing objects, you can use a `CopyObject` operation. For
more information, see [Configuring an S3 Bucket Key at the object level](configuring-bucket-key-object.md) and [Using Batch Operations to enable S3 Bucket Keys for SSE-KMS](batch-ops-copy-example-bucket-key.md).

When an S3 Bucket Key is enabled for the source or destination bucket, the encryption
context will be the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and not the object ARN, for example,
`arn:aws:s3:::bucket_ARN`. You need to update your
IAM policies to use the bucket ARN for the encryption context. For more information, see
[S3 Bucket Keys and replication](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md#bk-replication).

The following examples illustrate how an S3 Bucket Key works with replication. For more
information, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md).

###### Prerequisites

Before you configure your bucket to use an S3 Bucket Key, review [Changes to note before enabling an S3 Bucket Key](bucket-key.md#bucket-key-changes).

###### Topics

In the S3 console, you can enable or disable an S3 Bucket Key for a new or existing
bucket. Objects in the S3 console inherit their S3 Bucket Key setting from the bucket
configuration. When you enable an S3 Bucket Key for your bucket, new objects that you
upload to the bucket use an S3 Bucket Key for SSE-KMS.

###### Uploading, copying, or modifying objects in buckets that have an S3 Bucket Key enabled

If you upload, modify, or copy an object in a bucket that has an S3 Bucket Key
enabled, the S3 Bucket Key settings for that object might be updated to align with the
bucket configuration.

If an object already has an S3 Bucket Key enabled, the S3 Bucket Key settings for that
object don't change when you copy or modify the object. However, if you modify or copy an
object that doesn’t have an S3 Bucket Key enabled, and the destination bucket has an
S3 Bucket Key configuration, the object inherits the destination bucket's S3 Bucket Key
settings. For example, if your source object doesn't have an S3 Bucket Key enabled but the
destination bucket has S3 Bucket Key enabled, an S3 Bucket Key is enabled for the
object.

###### To enable an S3 Bucket Key when you create a new bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

3. Choose **Create bucket**.

4. Enter your bucket name, and choose your AWS Region.

5. Under **Default encryption**, for **Encryption key**
**type**, choose **AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)**.

6. Under **AWS KMS key**, do one of the following to choose your
    KMS key:

- To choose from a list of available KMS keys, choose **Choose from**
**your AWS KMS keys**, and then choose your
**KMS key** from the list of available keys.

Both the AWS managed key ( `aws/s3`) and your customer managed keys appear
in this list. For more information about customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and AWS keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#key-mgmt) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- To enter the KMS key ARN, choose **Enter AWS KMS key**
**ARN**, and enter your KMS key ARN in the field that appears.

- To create a new customer managed key in the AWS KMS console, choose **Create a**
**KMS key**.

For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see [Creating\
Keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

7. Under **Bucket Key**, choose **Enable**.

8. Choose **Create bucket**.

Amazon S3 creates your bucket with an S3 Bucket Key enabled. New objects that you upload
    to the bucket will use an S3 Bucket Key.

To disable an S3 Bucket Key, follow the previous steps, and choose
    **Disable**.

###### To enable an S3 Bucket Key for an existing bucket

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

3. In the **Buckets** list, choose the bucket that you want to
    enable an S3 Bucket Key for.

4. Choose the **Properties** tab.

5. Under **Default encryption**, choose
    **Edit**.

6. Under **Default encryption**, for **Encryption key**
**type**, choose **AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)**.

7. Under **AWS KMS key**, do one of the following to choose your
    KMS key:

- To choose from a list of available KMS keys, choose **Choose from**
**your AWS KMS keys**, and then choose your
**KMS key** from the list of available keys.

Both the AWS managed key ( `aws/s3`) and your customer managed keys appear
in this list. For more information about customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and AWS keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#key-mgmt) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- To enter the KMS key ARN, choose **Enter AWS KMS key**
**ARN**, and enter your KMS key ARN in the field that appears.

- To create a new customer managed key in the AWS KMS console, choose **Create a**
**KMS key**.

For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see [Creating\
Keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

8. Under **Bucket Key**, choose **Enable**.

9. Choose **Save changes**.

Amazon S3 enables an S3 Bucket Key for new objects added to your bucket. Existing
    objects don't use the S3 Bucket Key. To configure an S3 Bucket Key for existing objects,
    you can use a `CopyObject` operation. For more information, see [Configuring an S3 Bucket Key at the object level](configuring-bucket-key-object.md).

To disable an S3 Bucket Key, follow the previous steps, and choose
    **Disable**.

You can use [PutBucketEncryption](../api/api-putbucketencryption.md) to
enable or disable an S3 Bucket Key for your bucket. To configure an S3 Bucket Key with
`PutBucketEncryption`, use the [ServerSideEncryptionRule](../api/api-serversideencryptionrule.md) data type, which includes default encryption with
SSE-KMS. You can also optionally use a customer managed key by specifying the KMS key ID for the
customer managed key.

For more information and example syntax, see [PutBucketEncryption](../api/api-putbucketencryption.md).

The following example enables default bucket encryption with SSE-KMS and an
S3 Bucket Key by using the AWS SDK for Java.

Java

```Java

AmazonS3 s3client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard()
    .withRegion(Regions.DEFAULT_REGION)
    .build();

ServerSideEncryptionByDefault serverSideEncryptionByDefault = new ServerSideEncryptionByDefault()
    .withSSEAlgorithm(SSEAlgorithm.KMS);
ServerSideEncryptionRule rule = new ServerSideEncryptionRule()
    .withApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault(serverSideEncryptionByDefault)
    .withBucketKeyEnabled(true);
ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration serverSideEncryptionConfiguration =
    new ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration().withRules(Collections.singleton(rule));

SetBucketEncryptionRequest setBucketEncryptionRequest = new SetBucketEncryptionRequest()
    .withServerSideEncryptionConfiguration(serverSideEncryptionConfiguration)
    .withBucketName(bucketName);

s3client.setBucketEncryption(setBucketEncryptionRequest);
```

The following example enables default bucket encryption with SSE-KMS and an
S3 Bucket Key by using the AWS CLI. Replace the `user input
              placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
        "Rules": [
            {
                "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                    "SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms",
                    "KMSMasterKeyID": "KMS-Key-ARN"
                },
                "BucketKeyEnabled": true
            }
        ]
    }'
```

_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.
