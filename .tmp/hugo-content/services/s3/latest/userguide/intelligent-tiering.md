# Managing storage costs with Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically
moving data to the most cost-effective access tier when access patterns change, without operational
overhead or impact on performance. For a small monthly object monitoring and automation charge,
S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and automatically moves objects that have not been
accessed to lower-cost access tiers.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic storage cost savings in three low latency and high
throughput access tiers. For data that can be accessed asynchronously, you can choose
to activate automatic archiving capabilities within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. If an object in the Infrequent Access tier
or Archive Instant Access tier is accessed later, it is automatically moved back to the Frequent Access tier.
No additional tiering charges apply when objects are moved between access tiers within the
S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the recommended storage class for data with unknown, changing, or
unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period, such as data
lakes, data analytics, and new applications.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class supports all Amazon S3 features,
including the following:

- S3 Inventory, for verifying the access tier of objects

- S3 Replication, for replicating data to any AWS Region

- S3 Storage Lens, for viewing storage usage and activity metrics

- Server-side encryption, for protecting object data

- S3 Object Lock, for preventing accidental deletion of data

- AWS PrivateLink, for accessing Amazon S3 through a private endpoint in a virtual private
cloud (VPC)
