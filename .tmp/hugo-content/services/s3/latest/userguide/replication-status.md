# Getting replication status information

Replication status can help you determine the current state of an object being replicated.
The replication status of a source object will return either `PENDING`,
`COMPLETED`, or `FAILED`. The replication status of a replica will
return `REPLICA`.

You can also use replication status values when you're creating S3 Batch Replication
jobs. For example, you can use these status values to replicate objects that have either
never been replicated or that have failed replication. For more information about using
these values with Batch Replication, see [Using replication status information with Batch Replication jobs](#replication-status-batch-replication).

## Replication status overview

In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and one or
more destination buckets where Amazon S3 replicates objects. When you request an object (by
using `GetObject`) or object metadata (by using `HeadObject`) from
these buckets, Amazon S3 returns the `x-amz-replication-status` header in the
response:

- When you request an object from the source bucket, Amazon S3 returns the
`x-amz-replication-status` header if the object in your request
is eligible for replication.

For example, suppose that you specify the object prefix `TaxDocs`
in your replication configuration to tell Amazon S3 to replicate only objects with
the key name prefix `TaxDocs`. Any objects that you upload that have
this key name prefix—for example,
`TaxDocs/document1.pdf`—will be replicated. For object requests
with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 returns the
`x-amz-replication-status` header with one of the following
values for the object's replication status: `PENDING`,
`COMPLETED`, or `FAILED`.

###### Note

If object replication fails after you upload an object, you can't retry
replication. You must upload the object again, or you must use
S3 Batch Replication to replicate any failed objects. S3 Lifecycle blocks
expiration and transition actions on objects with `PENDING` or
`FAILED` replication status. For more information
about using Batch Replication, see [Replicating existing objects with Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-batch.md).

Objects transition to a `FAILED` state for issues such as
missing replication role permissions, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) permissions, or
bucket permissions. For temporary failures, such as if a bucket or Region is
unavailable, replication status doesn't transition to `FAILED`,
but remains `PENDING`. After the resource is back online, Amazon S3
resumes replicating those objects.

- When you request an object from a destination bucket, if the object in your
request is a replica that Amazon S3 created, Amazon S3 returns the
`x-amz-replication-status` header with the value
`REPLICA`.

###### Note

Before deleting an object from a source bucket that has replication enabled, check
the object's replication status to make sure that the object has been replicated.

If an S3 Lifecycle configuration is enabled on the source bucket, Amazon S3 suspends
lifecycle actions until it marks the object's replication status as
`COMPLETED`. If replication status is `FAILED`,
S3 Lifecycle continues to block expiration and transition actions on the object
until you resolve the underlying replication issue. For more information, see
[S3 Lifecycle and](lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config.md#lifecycle-and-replication).

## Replication status if replicating to multiple destination buckets

When you replicate objects to multiple destination buckets, the
`x-amz-replication-status` header acts differently. The header of the
source object returns a value of `COMPLETED` only when replication is
successful to all destinations. The header remains at the `PENDING` value
until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fail
replication, the header returns `FAILED`.

## Replication status if Amazon S3 replica modification sync is enabled

When your replication rules enable Amazon S3 replica modification sync, replicas can report
statuses other than `REPLICA`. If metadata changes are in the process of
replicating, the `x-amz-replication-status` header returns
`PENDING`. If replica modification sync fails to replicate metadata, the header
returns `FAILED`. If metadata is replicated correctly, the replicas return
the header `REPLICA`.

## Using replication status information with Batch Replication jobs

When creating a Batch Replication job, you can optionally specify additional filters,
such as the object creation date and replication status, to reduce the scope of the
job.

You can filter objects to replicate based on the
`ObjectReplicationStatuses` value, by providing one or more of the
following values:

- `"NONE"` – Indicates that Amazon S3 has never attempted to
replicate the object before.

- `"FAILED"` – Indicates that Amazon S3 has attempted, but failed,
to replicate the object before.

- `"COMPLETED"` – Indicates that Amazon S3 has successfully
replicated the object before.

- `"REPLICA"` – Indicates that this is a replica object that
Amazon S3 has replicated from another source.

For more information about using these replication status values with
Batch Replication, see [Filters for a Batch Replication job](s3-batch-replication-batch.md#batch-replication-filters).

## Finding replication status

To get the replication status of the objects in a bucket, you can use the Amazon S3
Inventory tool. Amazon S3 sends a CSV file to the destination bucket that you specify in the
inventory configuration. You can also use Amazon Athena to query the replication status in
the inventory report. For more information about Amazon S3 Inventory, see [Cataloging and analyzing your data with S3 Inventory](storage-inventory.md).

You can also find the object replication status by using the Amazon S3 console, the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS SDK.

In the Amazon S3 console, you can view the replication status for an object on the
object's details page.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Buckets**.

3. In the **General purpose buckets** list, choose the
    name of the replication source bucket.

4. In the **Objects** list, choose the object name. The
    object's details page appears.

5. On the **Properties** tab, scroll down to the
    **Object management overview** section. Under
    **Management configurations**, see the value under
    **Replication status**.

Use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) `head-object` command to retrieve object
metadata, as shown in the following example. Replace the
`amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket1` with the name of your replication
source bucket, and replace the other `user input
                            placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api head-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket1 --key object-key --version-id object-version-id
```

The command returns object metadata, including the
`ReplicationStatus` as shown in the following example
response.

```json

{
   "AcceptRanges":"bytes",
   "ContentType":"image/jpeg",
   "LastModified":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 21:02:29 GMT",
   "ContentLength":3191,
   "ReplicationStatus":"COMPLETED",
   "VersionId":"jfnW.HIMOfYiD_9rGbSkmroXsFj3fqZ.",
   "ETag":"\"6805f2cfc46c0f04559748bb039d69ae\"",
   "Metadata":{

   }
}
```

The following code fragments get your replication status by using the
AWS SDK for Java and AWS SDK for .NET, respectively.

Java

```java

GetObjectMetadataRequest metadataRequest = new GetObjectMetadataRequest(bucketName, key);
ObjectMetadata metadata = s3Client.getObjectMetadata(metadataRequest);

System.out.println("Replication Status : " + metadata.getRawMetadataValue(Headers.OBJECT_REPLICATION_STATUS));
```

.NET

```csharp

GetObjectMetadataRequest getmetadataRequest = new GetObjectMetadataRequest
    {
         BucketName = sourceBucket,
         Key        = objectKey
    };

GetObjectMetadataResponse getmetadataResponse = client.GetObjectMetadata(getmetadataRequest);
Console.WriteLine("Object replication status: {0}", getmetadataResponse.ReplicationStatus);
```
