# Using S3 Replication metrics

S3 Replication metrics provide detailed metrics for the replication rules in your replication
configuration. With replication metrics, you can monitor minute-by-minute progress by tracking
bytes pending, operations pending, operations that failed replication, and replication
latency.

###### Note

- S3 Replication metrics are billed at the same rate as Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. For more
information, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

- If you're using S3 Replication Time Control, Amazon CloudWatch begins reporting replication metrics 15
minutes after you enable S3 RTC on the respective replication rule.

S3 Replication metrics are turned on automatically when you enable S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC). You can also
enable S3 Replication metrics independently of S3 RTC while [creating or editing a rule](replication-walkthrough1.md). S3 RTC includes
other features, such as a service level agreement (SLA) and notifications for missed
thresholds. For more information, see [Meeting compliance requirements with S3 Replication Time Control](replication-time-control.md).

When S3 Replication metrics are enabled, Amazon S3 publishes the following metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch
metrics are delivered on a best-effort basis.

Metric nameMetric descriptionWhich objects does this metric apply to?Which Region is this metric published in?Is this metric still published if the destination bucket is deleted?Is this metric still published if replication doesn't occur?

**Bytes Pending Replication**

The total number of bytes of objects that are pending replication for a given
replication rule.

This metric applies only to new objects that are replicated with S3 Cross-Region
Replication (S3 CRR) or S3 Same-Region Replication (S3 SRR).This metric is published in the Region of the destination bucket.NoYes

**Replication Latency**

The maximum number of seconds by which the replication destination bucket is
behind the source bucket for a given replication rule.

This metric applies only to new objects that are replicated with S3 CRR or S3
SRR.This metric is published in the Region of the destination bucket.NoYes

**Operations Pending Replication**

The number of operations that are pending replication for a given replication
rule. This metric tracks operations related to objects, delete markers, tags, access
control lists (ACLs), and S3 Object Lock.

This metric applies only to new objects that are replicated with S3 CRR or S3
SRR.This metric is published in the Region of the destination bucket.NoYes

**Operations Failed Replication**

The number of operations that failed replication for a given replication rule.
This metric tracks operations related to objects, delete markers, tags, access
control lists (ACLs), and Object Lock.

**Operations Failed Replication** tracks
S3 Replication failures aggregated at a per-minute interval. To identify the
specific objects that have failed replication and their failure reasons, subscribe
to the `OperationFailedReplication` event in Amazon S3 Event Notifications.
For more information, see [Receiving replication failure events with Amazon S3 Event Notifications](replication-metrics-events.md).

This metric applies both to new objects that are replicated with S3 CRR or S3
SRR and also to existing objects that are replicated with
S3 Batch Replication.

###### Note

If an S3 Batch Replication job fails to run at all, metrics aren't sent to
Amazon CloudWatch. For example, your job won't run if you don't have the necessary
permissions to run an S3 Batch Replication job, or if the tags or prefix in your
replication configuration don't match.

This metric is published in the Region of the source bucket.YesNo

For information about working with these metrics in CloudWatch, see [S3 Replication metrics in CloudWatch](metrics-dimensions.md#s3-cloudwatch-replication-metrics).

## Enabling S3 Replication metrics

You can start using S3 Replication metrics with a new or existing replication rule. For full
instructions on creating replication rules, see [Configuring replication for buckets in the same account](replication-walkthrough1.md). You can choose to apply your replication rule
to an entire S3 bucket, or to Amazon S3 objects with a specific prefix or tag.

This topic provides instructions for enabling S3 Replication metrics in your replication
configuration when the source and destination buckets are owned by the same or different
AWS accounts.

To enable replication metrics by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you must add a replication
configuration to the source bucket with `Metrics` enabled. In this example
configuration, objects under the prefix `Tax` are
replicated to the destination bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`, and metrics are
generated for those objects.

```json

{
    "Rules": [
        {
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Filter": {
                "Prefix": "Tax"
            },
            "Destination": {
                "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
                "Metrics": {
                    "Status": "Enabled"
                }
            },
            "Priority": 1
        }
    ],
    "Role": "IAM-Role-ARN"
}
```

## Viewing replication metrics

You can view S3 Replication metrics in the source general purpose bucket's **Metrics** tab in
the Amazon S3 console. These Amazon CloudWatch metrics are also available in the Amazon CloudWatch console. When
you enable S3 Replication metrics, Amazon CloudWatch emits metrics that you can use to track bytes pending,
operations pending, and replication latency at the replication rule level.

S3 Replication metrics are turned on automatically when you enable replication with
S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) by using the Amazon S3 console or the Amazon S3 REST API. You can also enable
S3 Replication metrics independently of S3 RTC while [creating or editing a rule](replication-walkthrough1.md).

If you're using S3 Replication Time Control, Amazon CloudWatch begins reporting replication metrics 15 minutes
after you enable S3 RTC on the respective replication rule. For more information, see
[Using S3 Replication metrics](repl-metrics.md).

Replication metrics track the rule IDs of the replication configuration. A replication
rule ID can be specific to a prefix, a tag, or a combination of both.

For more information about CloudWatch metrics for Amazon S3, see [Monitoring metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](cloudwatch-monitoring.md).

###### Prerequisites

Create a replication rule that has S3 Replication metrics enabled. For more information, see
[Enabling S3 Replication metrics](#enabling-replication-metrics).

###### To view S3 Replication metrics through the source bucket's **Metrics** tab

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

3. In the buckets list, choose the name of the
    source bucket that contains the objects that you want replication metrics for.

4. Choose the **Metrics** tab.

5. Under **Replication metrics**, choose the replication rules that
    you want to see metrics for.

6. Choose **Display charts**.

Amazon S3 displays **Replication latency**, **Bytes pending**
**replication**, **Operations pending replication**, and
    **Operations failed replication** charts for the rules that you
    selected.
