# Access control list (ACL) overview

Amazon S3 access control lists (ACLs) enable you to manage access to buckets and objects. Each
bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a subresource. It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. When a request is received
against a resource, Amazon S3 checks the corresponding ACL to verify that the requester has
the necessary access permissions.

S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to both control ownership of the objects that are
uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs. By default, Object Ownership is set to the Bucket owner enforced setting,
and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to them
exclusively by using access-management policies.

A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs. We recommend that you keep ACLs disabled, except
in circumstances where you need to control access for each object individually. With ACLs disabled, you can use policies
to control access to all objects in your bucket, regardless of who uploaded the objects to your bucket.
For more information, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](about-object-ownership.md).

###### Important

If your general purpose bucket uses the Bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, you must use policies to
grant access to your general purpose bucket and the objects in it. With the Bucket owner enforced setting enabled, requests to set
access control lists (ACLs) or update ACLs fail and return the `AccessControlListNotSupported` error code.
Requests to read ACLs are still supported.

When you create a bucket or an object, Amazon S3 creates a default ACL that grants the resource
owner full control over the resource. This is shown in the following sample bucket ACL
(the default object ACL has the same structure):

###### Example

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<AccessControlPolicy xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Owner>
    <ID>*** Owner-Canonical-User-ID ***</ID>
  </Owner>
  <AccessControlList>
    <Grant>
      <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
               xsi:type="Canonical User">
        <ID>*** Owner-Canonical-User-ID ***</ID>
      </Grantee>
      <Permission>FULL_CONTROL</Permission>
    </Grant>
  </AccessControlList>
</AccessControlPolicy>
```

The sample ACL includes an `Owner` element that identifies the owner by the
AWS account's canonical user ID. For instructions on finding your canonical user ID,
see [Finding an AWS account canonical user ID](#finding-canonical-id). The
`Grant` element identifies the grantee (either an AWS account or a
predefined group) and the permission granted. This default ACL has one
`Grant` element for the owner. You grant permissions by adding
`Grant` elements, with each grant identifying the grantee and the
permission.

###### Note

An ACL can have up to 100 grants.

- [What permissions can I grant?](#permissions)

- [aclRequired values for common Amazon S3 requests](#aclrequired-s3)

- [Sample ACL](#sample-acl)

- [Canned ACL](#canned-acl)

## Who is a grantee?

When you grant access rights, you specify each grantee as a
`type="value"`
pair, where `type` is one of the
following:

- `id` – If the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account

- `uri` – If you are granting permissions to a predefined group

###### Warning

When you grant other AWS accounts access to your resources, be aware that the AWS accounts can delegate their permissions to users under their
accounts. This is known as _cross-account_
_access_. For information about using cross-account access,
see [Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Finding an AWS account canonical user ID

The canonical user ID is associated with your AWS account. This ID is a long
string of characters, such as:

`79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be`

For information about how to find the canonical user ID for your account, see
[Find the canonical user ID for your AWS account](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.md#FindCanonicalId) in the _AWS Account Management Reference Guide_.

You can also look up the canonical user ID of an AWS account by reading the
ACL of a bucket or an object to which the AWS account has access permissions.
When an individual AWS account is granted permissions by a grant request, a
grant entry is added to the ACL with the account's canonical user ID.

###### Note

If you make your bucket public (not recommended), any unauthenticated user
can upload objects to the bucket. These anonymous users don't have an
AWS account. When an anonymous user uploads an object to your bucket, Amazon S3
adds a special canonical user ID
( `65a011a29cdf8ec533ec3d1ccaae921c`) as the object owner in
the ACL. For more information, see [Amazon S3 bucket and object ownership](access-policy-language-overview.md#about-resource-owner).

### Amazon S3 predefined groups

Amazon S3 has a set of predefined groups. When granting account access to a group, you specify
one of the Amazon S3 URIs instead of a canonical user ID. Amazon S3 provides the following
predefined groups:

- **Authenticated Users**
**group** – Represented by
`http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers`.

This group represents all AWS accounts. **Access permission to this**
**group allows any AWS account to access the resource.** However, all
requests must be signed (authenticated).

###### Warning

When you grant access to the **Authenticated Users**
**group**, any AWS authenticated user in the world can
access your resource.

- **All Users group** –
Represented by
`http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers`.

**Access permission to this group allows anyone in the world access**
**to the resource.** The requests can be signed
(authenticated) or unsigned (anonymous). Unsigned requests omit the
Authentication header in the request.

###### Warning

We highly recommend that you never grant the **All Users**
**group** `WRITE`, `WRITE_ACP`, or
`FULL_CONTROL` permissions. For example, although
`WRITE` permissions deny non-owners the ability to
overwrite or delete existing objects, `WRITE` permissions
still allow anyone to store objects in your bucket, for which you
are billed. For more details about these permissions, see the
following section [What permissions can I grant?](#permissions).

- **Log Delivery group**
– Represented by
`http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery`.

`WRITE` permission on a bucket enables this group to write server access logs
(see [Logging requests with server access logging](serverlogs.md)) to the
bucket.

###### Note

When using ACLs, a grantee can be an AWS account or one of the predefined Amazon S3 groups.
However, the grantee cannot be an IAM user. For more information about AWS
users and permissions within IAM, see [Using\
AWS Identity and Access Management](../../../iam/latest/userguide.md).

## What permissions can I grant?

The following table lists the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. The set of
ACL permissions is the same for an object ACL and a bucket ACL. However, depending
on the context (bucket ACL or object ACL), these ACL permissions grant permissions
for specific buckets or object operations. The table lists the permissions and
describes what they mean in the context of objects and buckets.

For more information about ACL permissions in the Amazon S3 console, see [Configuring ACLs](managing-acls.md).

PermissionWhen granted on a bucketWhen granted on an object`READ`Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucketAllows grantee to read the object data and its metadata`WRITE`Allows grantee to create new objects in the bucket. For the bucket and object owners
of existing objects, also allows deletions and overwrites of those
objectsNot applicable`READ_ACP`Allows grantee to read the bucket ACLAllows grantee to read the object ACL`WRITE_ACP`Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucketAllows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object`FULL_CONTROL`Allows grantee the `READ`, `WRITE`, `READ_ACP`, and
`WRITE_ACP` permissions on the bucketAllows grantee the `READ`, `READ_ACP`, and
`WRITE_ACP` permissions on the object

###### Warning

Use caution when granting access permissions to your S3 buckets and objects. For example,
granting `WRITE` access to a bucket allows the grantee to create
objects in the bucket. We highly recommend that you read through the entire
[Access control list (ACL) overview](acl-overview.md) section before
granting permissions.

### Mapping of ACL permissions and access policy permissions

As shown in the preceding table, an ACL allows only a finite set of permissions, compared
to the number of permissions that you can set in an access policy (see [Policy actions for Amazon S3](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions)).
Each of these permissions allows one or more Amazon S3 operations.

The following table shows how each ACL permission maps to the corresponding access policy
permissions. As you can see, access policy allows more permissions than an ACL
does. You use ACLs primarily to grant basic read/write permissions, similar to
file system permissions. For more information about when to use an ACL, see
[Identity and Access Management for Amazon S3](security-iam.md).

For more information about ACL permissions in the Amazon S3 console, see [Configuring ACLs](managing-acls.md).

Bucket owner can create, overwrite, and delete any object in the bucket, and object
owner has `FULL_CONTROL` over their object.

In addition, when the grantee is the bucket owner, granting `WRITE` permission
in a bucket ACL allows the `s3:DeleteObjectVersion` action to
be performed on any version in that bucket.

policy permissions.Equivalent to granting `READ`, `READ_ACP`, and
`WRITE_ACP` ACL permissions. Accordingly, this
ACL permission maps to a combination of corresponding access

### Condition keys

When you grant access policy permissions, you can use condition keys to constrain the
value for the ACL on an object using a bucket policy. The following context keys
correspond to ACLs. You can use these context keys to mandate the use of a
specific ACL in a request:

- `s3:x-amz-grant-read` ‐ Require read access.

- `s3:x-amz-grant-write` ‐ Require write access.

- `s3:x-amz-grant-read-acp` ‐ Require read access to the bucket ACL.

- `s3:x-amz-grant-write-acp` ‐ Require write access to the bucket ACL.

- `s3:x-amz-grant-full-control` ‐ Require full control.

- `s3:x-amz-acl` ‐ Require a [Canned ACL](#canned-acl).

For example policies that involve ACL-specific headers, see [Granting s3:PutObject permission with a condition requiring the bucket owner to get full control](example-bucket-policies-condition-keys.md#grant-putobject-conditionally-1). For a complete list of
Amazon S3 specific condition keys, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-amazons3.md) in the _Service Authorization_
_Reference_.

For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](using-with-s3-policy-actions.md).

## `aclRequired` values for common Amazon S3 requests

To identify Amazon S3 requests that required ACLs for authorization, you can use the
`aclRequired` value in Amazon S3 server access logs or AWS CloudTrail. The
`aclRequired` value that appears in CloudTrail or Amazon S3 server access logs
depends on which operations were called and certain information about the requester,
object owner, and bucket owner. If no ACLs were required, or if you are setting the
`bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL, or if the requests are
allowed by your bucket policy, the `aclRequired` value string is
" `-`" in Amazon S3 server access logs and is absent in CloudTrail.

The following tables list the expected `aclRequired` values in CloudTrail or
Amazon S3 server access logs for the various Amazon S3 API operations. You can use this
information to understand which Amazon S3 operations depend on ACLs for authorization. In
the following tables, A, B, and C represent the different accounts associated with
the requester, object owner, and bucket owner. Entries with an asterisk (\*) indicate
any of accounts A, B, or C.

###### Note

`PutObject` operations in the following table, unless specified
otherwise, indicate requests that do not set an ACL, unless the ACL is a
`bucket-owner-full-control` ACL. A null value for
`aclRequired` indicates that `aclRequired` is absent
in AWS CloudTrail logs.

The following table shows the `aclRequired` values for CloudTrail.

string of " `-`" indicates a null value in Amazon S3 server access
logs.

## Sample ACL

The following sample ACL on a bucket identifies the resource owner and a set of
grants. The format is the XML representation of an ACL in the Amazon S3 REST API. The
bucket owner has `FULL_CONTROL` of the resource. In addition, the ACL
shows how permissions are granted on a resource to two AWS accounts, identified by
canonical user ID, and two of the predefined Amazon S3 groups discussed in the preceding
section.

## Canned ACL

Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined grants, known as _canned ACLs_. Each
canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. The following table
lists the set of canned ACLs and the associated predefined grants.

Canned ACLApplies toPermissions added to ACL`private`Bucket and objectOwner gets `FULL_CONTROL`. No one else has access
rights (default).`public-read`Bucket and objectOwner gets `FULL_CONTROL`. The `AllUsers` group (see [Who is a grantee?](#specifying-grantee)) gets `READ` access. `public-read-write`Bucket and objectOwner gets `FULL_CONTROL`. The
`AllUsers` group gets `READ` and
`WRITE` access. Granting this on a bucket is
generally not recommended.`aws-exec-read`Bucket and objectOwner gets `FULL_CONTROL`. Amazon EC2 gets `READ`
access to `GET` an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) bundle from Amazon S3.`authenticated-read`Bucket and objectOwner gets `FULL_CONTROL`. The
`AuthenticatedUsers` group gets `READ`
access.`bucket-owner-read`ObjectObject owner gets `FULL_CONTROL`. Bucket owner
gets `READ` access. If you specify this canned ACL
when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.`bucket-owner-full-control`Object Both the object owner and the bucket owner get
`FULL_CONTROL` over the object. If you specify
this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.`log-delivery-write`Bucket The `LogDelivery` group gets `WRITE` and `READ_ACP`
permissions on the bucket. For more information about logs, see
( [Logging requests with server access logging](serverlogs.md)).

###### Note

You can specify only one of these canned ACLs in your request.

You specify a canned ACL in your request by using the `x-amz-acl` request
header. When Amazon S3 receives a request with a canned ACL in the request, it adds the
predefined grants to the ACL of the resource.
