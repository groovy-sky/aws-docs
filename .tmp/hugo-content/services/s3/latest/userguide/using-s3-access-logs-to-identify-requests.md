# Using Amazon S3 server access logs to identify requests

You can identify Amazon S3 requests by using Amazon S3 server access logs.

###### Note

- To identify Amazon S3 requests, we recommend that you use AWS CloudTrail data events instead of
Amazon S3 server access logs. CloudTrail data events are easier to set up and contain more
information. For more information, see [Identifying Amazon S3 requests using CloudTrail](cloudtrail-request-identification.md).

- Depending on how many access requests you get, analyzing your logs might require
more resources or time than using CloudTrail data events.

## Querying access logs for requests by using Amazon Athena

You can identify Amazon S3 requests with Amazon S3 access logs by using Amazon Athena.

Amazon S3 stores server access logs as objects in an S3 bucket.
It
is often easier to use a tool that can analyze the logs in Amazon S3. Athena
supports analysis of S3 objects and can be used to query Amazon S3 access logs.

###### Example

The following example shows how you can query Amazon S3 server access logs in Amazon Athena.
Replace the `user input placeholders` used in the
following examples with your own information.

###### Note

To specify an Amazon S3 location in an Athena query, you must provide an S3 URI for the
bucket where your logs are delivered to. This URI must include the bucket name and
prefix in the following format:
`s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket1-logs/prefix/`

1. Open the Athena console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).

2. In the Query Editor, run a command similar to the following. Replace
    `s3_access_logs_db` with the name that you
    want to give to your database.

```sql

CREATE DATABASE s3_access_logs_db
```

###### Note

It's a best practice to create the database in the same AWS Region as your S3
bucket.

3. In the Query Editor, run a command similar to the following to create a table
    schema in the database that you created in step 2. Replace
    `s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs` with the
    name that you want to give to your table. The `STRING` and
    `BIGINT` data type values are the access log properties. You can query
    these properties in Athena. For `LOCATION`, enter the S3 bucket and prefix
    path as noted earlier.

4. In the navigation pane, under **Database**, choose your
    database.

5. Under **Tables**, choose **Preview table** next
    to your table name.

In the **Results** pane, you should see data from the server
    access logs, such as `bucketowner`, `bucket`,
    `requestdatetime`, and so on. This means that you successfully created
    the Athena table. You can now query the Amazon S3 server access logs.

###### Example— Show who deleted an object and when (timestamp, IP address, and IAM user)

```sql

SELECT requestdatetime, remoteip, requester, key
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE key = 'images/picture.jpg' AND operation like '%DELETE%';
```

###### Example— Show all operations that were performed by an IAM user

```sql

SELECT *
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE requester='arn:aws:iam::123456789123:user/user_name';
```

###### Example— Show all operations that were performed on an object in a specific time period

```sql

SELECT *
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE Key='prefix/images/picture.jpg'
AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2017-02-18:07:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND parse_datetime('2017-02-18:08:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss');
```

###### Example— Show how much data was transferred to a specific IP address in a specific time period

```sql

SELECT coalesce(SUM(bytessent), 0) AS bytessenttotal
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE remoteip='192.0.2.1'
AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2022-06-01','yyyy-MM-dd')
AND parse_datetime('2022-07-01','yyyy-MM-dd');
```

###### Example— Find request IDs for HTTP 5xx errors in a specific time period

```sql

SELECT requestdatetime, key, httpstatus, errorcode, requestid, hostid
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE httpstatus like '5%' AND timestamp
BETWEEN '2024/01/29'
AND '2024/01/30'
```

###### Note

To reduce the time that you retain your logs, you can create an S3 Lifecycle
configuration for your server access logs bucket. Create lifecycle configuration rules to
remove log files periodically. Doing so reduces the amount of data that Athena analyzes for
each query. For more information, see [Setting an S3 Lifecycle configuration on a bucket](how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.md).

## Identifying Signature Version 2 requests by using Amazon S3 access logs

Amazon S3 support for Signature Version 2 will be turned off
(deprecated). After that, Amazon S3 will no longer accept
requests that use Signature Version 2, and all requests must use Signature Version 4
signing. You can identify Signature Version 2 access requests by using Amazon S3 access logs.

###### Note

To identify Signature Version 2 requests, we recommend that you use AWS CloudTrail data
events instead of Amazon S3 server access logs. CloudTrail data events are easier to set up and
contain more information than server access logs. For more information, see [Identifying Amazon S3 Signature Version 2 requests by using CloudTrail](cloudtrail-request-identification.md#cloudtrail-identification-sigv2-requests).

###### Example— Show all requesters that are sending Signature Version 2 traffic

```sql

SELECT requester, sigv, Count(sigv) as sigcount
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
GROUP BY requester, sigv;
```

## Identifying object access requests by using Amazon S3 access logs

You can use queries on Amazon S3 server access logs to identify Amazon S3 object access requests,
for operations such as `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, and
discover further information about those requests.

The following Amazon Athena query example shows how to get all `PUT` object
requests for Amazon S3 from a server access log.

###### Example— Show all requesters that are sending `PUT` object requests in a certain period

```sql

SELECT bucket_name, requester, remoteip, key, httpstatus, errorcode, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE operation='REST.PUT.OBJECT'
AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2019-07-01:00:42:42',yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND parse_datetime('2019-07-02:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

The following Amazon Athena query example shows how to get all `GET` object
requests for Amazon S3 from the server access log.

###### Example— Show all requesters that are sending `GET` object requests in a certain period

```sql

SELECT bucket_name, requester, remoteip, key, httpstatus, errorcode, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE operation='REST.GET.OBJECT'
AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2019-07-01:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND parse_datetime('2019-07-02:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

The following Amazon Athena query example shows how to get all anonymous requests to your S3
buckets from the server access log.

###### Example— Show all anonymous requesters that are making requests to a bucket during a certain period

```sql

SELECT bucket_name, requester, remoteip, key, httpstatus, errorcode, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE requester IS NULL
AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2019-07-01:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND parse_datetime('2019-07-02:00:42:42','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

The following Amazon Athena query shows how to identify all requests to your S3 buckets that
required an access control list (ACL) for authorization. You can use this information to
migrate those ACL permissions to the appropriate bucket policies and disable ACLs. After
you've created these bucket policies, you can disable ACLs for these buckets. For more
information about disabling ACLs, see [Prerequisites for disabling ACLs](object-ownership-migrating-acls-prerequisites.md).

###### Example— Identify all requests that required an ACL for authorization

```sql

SELECT bucket_name, requester, key, operation, aclrequired, requestdatetime
FROM s3_access_logs_db.mybucket_logs
WHERE aclrequired = 'Yes'
AND parse_datetime(requestdatetime,'dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z')
BETWEEN parse_datetime('2022-05-10:00:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
AND parse_datetime('2022-08-10:00:00:00','yyyy-MM-dd:HH:mm:ss')
```

###### Note

- You can modify the date range as needed to suit your needs.

- These query examples might also be useful for security monitoring. You can review
the results for `PutObject` or `GetObject` calls from unexpected
or unauthorized IP addresses or requesters and for identifying any anonymous requests
to your buckets.

- This query only retrieves information from the time at which logging was enabled.

- If you are using AWS CloudTrail logs, see [Identifying access to S3 objects by using CloudTrail](cloudtrail-request-identification.md#cloudtrail-identification-object-access).
