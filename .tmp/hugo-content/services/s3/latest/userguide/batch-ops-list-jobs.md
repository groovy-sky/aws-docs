# Listing jobs

You can retrieve a list of your S3 Batch Operations jobs. The list provides information
about jobs that haven't yet finished, and jobs that finished within the last 90 days.
For each job, the list includes details such as job ID, description, priority, current
status, and the number of tasks that have succeeded and failed.

You can filter your job list by status. If you retrieve the list by using the console,
you can also search your jobs by description or ID and filter them by
AWS Region.

## Get a list of `Active` and `Complete` jobs

The following AWS CLI example gets a list of `Active` and
`Complete` jobs. To use this example, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your
own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3control list-jobs \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --account-id account-id \
    --job-statuses '["Active","Complete"]' \
    --max-results 20
```

For more information and examples, see [list-jobs](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3control/list-jobs.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.
