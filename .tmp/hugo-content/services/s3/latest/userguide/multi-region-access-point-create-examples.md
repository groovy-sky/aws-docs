# Create an Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Point

The following example demonstrates how to create a Multi-Region Access Point by using the Amazon S3
console.

###### To create a Multi-Region Access Point

###### Note

Multi-Region Access Point opt-in Regions aren't currently supported in the Amazon S3 console.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Multi-Region Access Points**.

3. Choose **Create Multi-Region Access Points** to begin creating your
    Multi-Region Access Point.

4. On the **Multi-Region Access Point** page, supply a name for the Multi-Region Access Point
    in the **Multi-Region Access Point name** field.

5. Select the buckets that will be associated with this Multi-Region Access Point. You can
    choose buckets that are in your account, or you can choose buckets from
    other accounts.

###### Note

You must add at least one bucket from either your account or other
accounts. Also, be aware that Multi-Region Access Points support only one bucket per
AWS Region. Therefore, you can’t add two buckets from the same
Region. [AWS Regions that are\
disabled by default](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande-manage.md) are not supported.

- To add a bucket that is in your account, choose **Add**
**buckets**. A list of all the buckets in your
account displays. You can search for your bucket by name, or
sort the bucket names in alphabetical order.

- To add a bucket from another account, choose **Add**
**bucket from other accounts**. Make sure that you
know the exact bucket name and AWS account ID because you
can't search or browse for buckets in other accounts.

###### Note

You must enter a valid AWS account ID and bucket name.
The bucket must also be in a supported Region, or you will
encounter an error when you try to create your Multi-Region Access Point. For
the list of Regions that support Multi-Region Access Points, see [Multi-Region Access Points restrictions and limitations](multiregionaccesspointrestrictions.md).

6. (Optional) If you need to remove a bucket that you added, choose
    **Remove**.

###### Note

You can’t add or remove buckets to this Multi-Region Access Point after you’ve
finished creating it.

7. Under **Block Public Access settings for this**
**Multi-Region Access Point**, select the Block Public Access settings that you
    want to apply to the Multi-Region Access Point. By default, all Block Public Access
    settings are enabled for new Multi-Region Access Points. We recommend that you leave all
    settings enabled unless you know that you have a specific need to
    disable any of them.

###### Note

You can't change the Block Public Access settings for a Multi-Region Access Point
after the Multi-Region Access Point has been created. Therefore, if you're going to
block public access, make sure that your applications work correctly
without public access before you create a Multi-Region Access Point.

8. Choose **Create Multi-Region Access Point**.

###### Important

When you add a bucket that's owned by another account to your Multi-Region Access Point, the
bucket owner must also update their bucket policy to grant access
permissions to the Multi-Region Access Point. Otherwise, the Multi-Region Access Point won't be able to retrieve
data from that bucket. For example policies that show how to grant such
access, see [Multi-Region Access Point policy examples](multiregionaccesspointpermissions.md#MultiRegionAccessPointPolicyExamples).

You can use the AWS CLI to create a Multi-Region Access Point. When you create the Multi-Region Access Point, you must
provide all the buckets that it will support. You can't add buckets to the
Multi-Region Access Point after it has been created.

The following example creates a Multi-Region Access Point with two buckets by using the AWS CLI.
To use this example command, replace the `user input
                            placeholders` with your own information.

###### Note

To create a Multi-Region Access Point using buckets in an opt-in
Region, make sure to [enable all opt-in Regions](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.md) first. Otherwise, you’ll get a `403 InvalidRegion` error when you try
to create a Multi-Region Access Point using buckets for an opt-in Region
that you haven’t actually opted in to.
