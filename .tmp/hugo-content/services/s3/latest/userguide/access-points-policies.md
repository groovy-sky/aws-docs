# Configuring IAM policies for using access points

Amazon S3 access points support AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resource policies that allow you to control the use
of the access point by resource, user, or other conditions. For an application or user to be able to
access objects through an access point, both the access point and the underlying bucket or Amazon FSx file system must permit the
request.

###### Important

Restrictions that you include in an access point policy apply only to requests made through
that access point. Attaching an access point to a bucket does not change
underlying resource's behavior. All existing operations against the bucket not
made through your access point will continue to work as before.

When you're using IAM resource policies, make sure to resolve security warnings, errors,
general warnings, and suggestions from AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer before you save your policy.
IAM Access Analyzer runs policy checks to validate your policy against IAM [policy grammar](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-grammar.md) and [best practices](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md). These checks generate
findings and provide recommendations to help you author policies that are functional and
conform to security best practices.

To learn more about validating policies by using IAM Access Analyzer, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy\
validation](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-policy-validation.md) in the _IAM User Guide_. To view a
list of the warnings, errors, and suggestions that are returned by IAM Access Analyzer, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy\
check reference](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks.md).

## Policy examples for access points

The following examples demonstrate how to create IAM policies to control requests
made through an access point.

###### Note

Permissions granted in an access point policy are effective only if the underlying bucket
also allows the same access. You can accomplish this in two ways:

1. **(Recommended)** Delegate access control
    from the bucket to the access point, as described in [Delegating access control to access points](#access-points-delegating-control).

2. Add the same permissions contained in the access point policy to the underlying
    bucket's policy. The Example 1 access point policy example demonstrates how to
    modify the underlying bucket policy to allow the necessary access.

###### Example 1 – Access point policy grant

The following access point policy grants IAM user
`Jane` in account
`123456789012` permissions to
`GET` and `PUT` objects with the prefix
`Jane/` through the access point
`my-access-point` in account
`123456789012`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Jane"
        },
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/Jane/*"
    }]
}

```

###### Note

For the access point policy to effectively grant access to
`Jane`, the underlying bucket must also
allow the same access to `Jane`. You can
delegate access control from the bucket to the access point as described in [Delegating access control to access points](#access-points-delegating-control). Or, you can add the
following policy to the underlying bucket to grant the necessary permissions to
Jane. Note that the `Resource` entry differs between the access point and bucket
policies.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Jane"
        },
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/Jane/*"
    }]
}

```

###### Example 2 – Access point policy with tag condition

The following access point policy grants IAM user
`Mateo` in account
`123456789012` permissions to
`GET` objects through the access point
`my-access-point` in the account
`123456789012` that have the tag key
`data` set with a value of
`finance`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Mateo"
        },
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
                "s3:ExistingObjectTag/data": "finance"
            }
        }
    }]
}

```

###### Example 3 – Access point policy that allows bucket listing

The following access point policy allows IAM user `Arnav` in the account
`123456789012` permission to view the
objects contained in the bucket underlying the access point
`my-access-point` in the account
`123456789012`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Arnav"
        },
        "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point"
    }]
}

```

###### Example 4 – Service control policy

The following service control policy requires all new access points to be created with a
virtual private cloud (VPC) network origin. With this policy in place, users in your
organization can't create new access points that are accessible from the internet.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": "s3:CreateAccessPoint",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringNotEquals": {
                "s3:AccessPointNetworkOrigin": "VPC"
            }
        }
    }]
}

```

###### Example 5 – Bucket policy to limit S3 operations to VPC network origins

The following bucket policy limits access to all S3 object operations for the
bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` to access points with a VPC network origin.

###### Important

Before using a statement like the one shown in this example, make sure that
you don't need to use features that aren't supported by access points, such as
Cross-Region Replication.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:BypassGovernanceRetention",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:DeleteObjectTagging",
                "s3:DeleteObjectVersion",
                "s3:DeleteObjectVersionTagging",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:GetObjectLegalHold",
                "s3:GetObjectRetention",
                "s3:GetObjectTagging",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
                "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObjectLegalHold",
                "s3:PutObjectRetention",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging",
                "s3:PutObjectVersionAcl",
                "s3:PutObjectVersionTagging",
                "s3:RestoreObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "s3:AccessPointNetworkOrigin": "VPC"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Condition keys

S3 access points have condition keys that you can use in IAM policies to control access to
your resources. The following condition keys represent only part of an IAM policy. For
full policy examples, see [Policy examples for access points](#access-points-policy-examples), [Delegating access control to access points](#access-points-delegating-control), and [Granting permissions for cross-account access points](#access-points-cross-account).

**`s3:DataAccessPointArn`**

This example shows a string that you can use to match on an access point ARN. The
following example matches all access points for AWS account
`123456789012` in Region
`us-west-2`:

```nohighlight

"Condition" : {
    "StringLike": {
        "s3:DataAccessPointArn": "arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/*"
    }
}
```

**`s3:DataAccessPointAccount`**

This example shows a string operator that you can use to match on the
account ID of the owner of an access point. The following example matches all access points
that are owned by the AWS account
`123456789012`.

```nohighlight

"Condition" : {
    "StringEquals": {
        "s3:DataAccessPointAccount": "123456789012"
    }
}
```

**`s3:AccessPointNetworkOrigin`**

This example shows a string operator that you can use to match on the
network origin, either `Internet` or `VPC`. The
following example matches only access points with a VPC origin.

```nohighlight

"Condition" : {
    "StringEquals": {
        "s3:AccessPointNetworkOrigin": "VPC"
    }
}
```

For more information about using condition keys with Amazon S3, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-amazons3.md) in the _Service Authorization_
_Reference_.

For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](using-with-s3-policy-actions.md).

## Delegating access control to access points

You can delegate access control for a bucket to the bucket's access points. The following
example bucket policy allows full access to all access points that are owned by the bucket
owner's account. Thus, all access to this bucket is controlled by the policies attached
to its access points. We recommend configuring your buckets this way for all use cases that
don't require direct access to the bucket.

###### Example 6 – Bucket policy that delegates access control to access points

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement" : [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal" : { "AWS": "*" },
        "Action" : "*",
        "Resource" : [ "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"],
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals" : { "s3:DataAccessPointAccount" : "111122223333" }
        }
    }]
}

```

## Granting permissions for cross-account access points

To create an access point to a bucket that's owned by another account, you must first create
the access point by specifying the bucket name and account owner ID. Then, the bucket owner must
update the bucket policy to authorize requests from the access point. Creating an access point is
similar to creating a DNS CNAME in that the access point doesn't provide access to the bucket
contents. All bucket access is controlled by the bucket policy. The following example
bucket policy allows `GET` and `LIST` requests on the bucket from
an access point that's owned by a trusted AWS account.

Replace `Bucket ARN` with the ARN of the bucket.

###### Example 7 – Bucket policy delegating permissions to another AWS account

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement" : [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal" : { "AWS": "*" },
        "Action" : ["s3:GetObject","s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource" : ["arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"],
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals" : { "s3:DataAccessPointAccount" : "Access point owner's account ID" }
        }
    }]
}

```

###### Note

Cross-account access points are only available for access points attached to S3 buckets.
You cannot attach an access point to a volume on an Amazon FSx file system owned by another AWS account.
