# Using tags with S3 table buckets

An AWS tag is a key-value pair that holds metadata about resources, in this case Amazon S3 table buckets. You can tag S3 table buckets when you create them or manage tags on existing table buckets. For general information about tags, see [Tagging for cost allocation or attribute-based access control (ABAC)](tagging.md).

###### Note

There is no additional charge for using tags on table buckets beyond the standard S3 API request rates. For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

## Common ways to use tags with table buckets

Use tags on your S3 table buckets for:

**Attribute-based access control (ABAC)** – Scale access permissions and grant access to S3 table buckets based on their tags. For more information, see [Using tags for ABAC](tagging.md#using-tags-for-abac).

### ABAC for S3 table buckets

Amazon S3 table buckets support attribute-based access control (ABAC) using tags. Use tag-based condition keys in your AWS organizations, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and S3 table bucket policies. ABAC in Amazon S3 supports authorization across multiple AWS accounts.

In your IAM policies, you can control access to S3 table buckets based on the table bucket's tags by using the `s3tables:TableBucketTag/tag-key` condition key or the [AWS global condition keys](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-tagkeys): `aws:ResourceTag/key-name`, `aws:RequestTag/key-name`, or `aws:TagKeys`.

#### aws:ResourceTag/key-name

Use this condition key to compare the tag key-value pair that you specify in the policy with the key-value pair attached to the resource. For example, you could require that access to a table bucket is allowed only if the table bucket has the tag key `Department` with the value `Marketing`.

This condition key applies to all table bucket actions that are performed using the Amazon S3 Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), S3
APIs, or the AWS SDKs, except for the `CreateBucket` API request.

For an example policy, see [1.1 - table bucket policy to restrict operations on the tables inside of the table bucket using tags](#example-policy-table-bucket-resource-tag).

For additional example policies and more information, see [Controlling access to AWS resources](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-tags.md#access_tags_control-resources) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

###### Note

For actions performed on tables, this condition key acts on the tags applied to the table and not on the tags applied to the table bucket containing the table. Use the `s3tables:TableBucketTag/tag-key` instead if you would like your ABAC policies to act on the tags of the table bucket when performaing table actions.

#### aws:RequestTag/key-name

Use this condition key to compare the tag key-value pair that was passed in the request with the tag pair that you specify in the policy. For example, you could check whether the request to tag a table bucket includes the tag key `Department` and that it has the value `Accounting`.

This condition key applies when tag keys are passed in a `TagResource` or `CreateTableBucket` API operation request, or when tagging or creating a table bucket with tags using the Amazon S3 Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDKs.

For an example policy, see [1.2 - IAM policy to create or modify table buckets with specific tags](#example-policy-table-bucket-request-tag).

For additional example policies and more information, see [Controlling access during AWS requests](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-tags.md#access_tags_control-requests) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

#### aws:TagKeys

Use this condition key to compare the tag keys in a request with the keys that you specify in the policy to define what tag keys are allowed for access. For example, to allow tagging during the `CreateTableBucket` action, you must create a policy that allows both the `s3tables:TagResource` and `s3tables:CreateTableBucket` actions. You can then use the `aws:TagKeys` condition key to enforce that only specific tags are used in the `CreateTableBucket` request.

This condition key applies when tag keys are passed in a `TagResource`, `UntagResource`, or `CreateTableBucket` API operations or when tagging, untagging, or creating a table bucket with tags using the Amazon S3 Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDKs.

For an example policy, see [1.3 - IAM policy to control the modification of tags on existing resources maintaining tagging governance](#example-policy-table-bucket-tag-keys).

For additional example policies and more information, see [Controlling access based on tag keys](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-tags.md#access_tags_control-tag-keys) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

#### s3tables:TableBucketTag/tag-key

Use this condition key to grant permissions to specific data in table buckets using tags. This condition key acts, on the most part, on the tags assigned to the table bucket for all S3 tables actions. Even when you create a table with tags, this condition key acts on the tags applied to the table bucket that contains that table. The exceptions are:

- When you create a table bucket with tags, this condition key acts on the tags in the request.

For an example policy, see [1.4 - Using the s3tables:TableBucketTag condition key](#example-policy-table-bucket-tag).

#### Example ABAC policies for table buckets

See the following example ABAC policies for Amazon S3 table buckets.

###### Note

If you are using Lake Formation to manage access to your Amazon S3 Tables and you have an IAM or S3 Tables resource-based policy that restricts IAM users and
IAM roles based on principal tags, you must attach the same principal tags to the IAM role
that Lake Formation uses to access your Amazon S3 data (for example, LakeFormationDataAccessRole) and
grant this role the necessary permissions. This is required for your tag-based access control
policy to work correctly with your S3 Tables analytics integration.

##### 1.1 - table bucket policy to restrict operations on the tables inside of the table bucket using tags

In this table bucket policy, the specified IAM principals (users and roles) can perform the `GetTable` action on any table in the table bucket only if the value of the table's `project` tag matches the value of the principal's `project` tag.

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowGetTable",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "111122223333"
      },
      "Action": "s3tables:GetTable",
      "Resource": "arn:aws::s3tables:us-west-2:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceTag/project": "${aws:PrincipalTag/project}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##### 1.2 - IAM policy to create or modify table buckets with specific tags

###### Note

If you are using AWS Lake Formation to manage access to your Amazon S3 tables, and you are using ABAC with Amazon S3 Tables, make sure that you also give the IAM role that Lake Formation assumes the required access. For more information on setting up the IAM role for Lake Formation, see [Prerequisites for integrating Amazon S3 tables catalog with the Data Catalog and Lake Formation](../../../lake-formation/latest/dg/s3tables-catalog-prerequisites.md) in the _AWS Lake Formation developer guide_.

In this IAM policy, users or roles with this policy can only create S3 table buckets if they tag the table bucket with the tag key `project` and tag value `Trinity` in the table bucket creation request. They can also add or modify tags on existing S3 table buckets as long as the `TagResource` request includes the tag key-value pair `project:Trinity`. This policy does not grant read, write, or delete permissions on the table buckets or its objects.

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CreateTableBucketWithTags",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3tables:CreateTableBucket",
        "s3tables:TagResource"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestTag/project": [
            "Trinity"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

##### 1.3 - IAM policy to control the modification of tags on existing resources maintaining tagging governance

In this IAM policy, IAM principals (users or roles) can modify tags on a table bucket only if the value of the table bucket's `project` tag matches the value of the principal's `project` tag. Only the four tags `project`, `environment`, `owner`, and `cost-center` specified in the `aws:TagKeys` condition keys are permitted for these table buckets. This helps enforce tag governance, prevents unauthorized tag modifications, and keeps the tagging schema consistent across your table buckets.

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "EnforceTaggingRulesOnModification",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3tables:TagResource",
        "s3tables:UntagResource"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws::s3tables:us-west-2:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceTag/project": "${aws:PrincipalTag/project}"
        },
        "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
          "aws:TagKeys": [
            "project",
            "environment",
            "owner",
            "cost-center"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

##### 1.4 - Using the s3tables:TableBucketTag condition key

In this IAM policy, the condition statement allows access to the table bucket's data only if the table bucket has the tag key `Environment` and tag value `Production`. The `s3tables:TableBucketTag/<tag-key>` differs from the `aws:ResourceTag/<tag-key>` condition key because, in addition to controlling access to table buckets depending on their tags, it allows you to control access to tables based on the tags on their parent table bucket.

```json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAccessToSpecificTables",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws::s3tables:us-west-2:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "s3tables:TableBucketTag/Environment": "Production"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Managing tags for table buckets

You can add or manage tags for S3 table buckets using the Amazon S3 Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), the AWS SDKs, or using the S3 APIs: [TagResource](../api/api-s3buckets-tagresource.md), [UntagResource](../api/api-s3buckets-untagresource.md), and [ListTagsForResource](../api/api-s3buckets-listtagsforresource.md).
