# Understanding your AWS billing and usage reports for Amazon S3

When you use Amazon S3, we include related codes in your AWS billing and usage reports. Reviewing these
codes helps you understand your Amazon S3 costs and usage patterns. Tracking and managing your expenses is
essential for optimizing your costs. For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

Amazon S3 billing and usage reports use codes and abbreviations. For usage types in the table that follows,
replace `region`, `region1`,
and `region2` with abbreviations from [AWS Region billing\
codes](../../../global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-region-billing-codes.md) in the _AWS Regions and Availability Zones User_
_Guide_.

For S3 Multi-Region Access Points usage types in the table that follows, replace
`regiongroup1` and
`regiongroup2` with abbreviations from
this list:

- **AP:** Asia Pacific

- **AU:** Australia

- **EU:** Europe

- **IN:** India

- **NA:** North America

- **SA:** South America

Region groups are geographical groupings of several AWS Regions. For more information, see
[Regions and Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az). For information about pricing by
AWS Region, see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

The first column in the following table lists usage types that appear in your billing
and usage reports. The typical unit of measurement for data is gigabytes (GB). However,
depending on the service and the report, terabytes (TB) might appear instead.

###### Notes

01. The `Global-Bucket-Hrs` and `Global-Bucket-Hrs-FreeTier` usage types
     apply to general purpose buckets in commercial AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).

02. If you terminate a transfer before completion, the amount of data that is
     transferred might exceed the amount of data that your application receives. This
     discrepancy can occur because a transfer termination request cannot be executed
     instantaneously, and some amount of data might be in transit, pending execution
     of the termination request. This data in transit is billed as data transferred
     "out."

03. For objects archived to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or
     S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes that are deleted, overwritten, or
     transitioned before their minimum storage commitment period (90 days for
     S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval and S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, 180 days for
     S3 Glacier Deep Archive), a prorated charge per gigabyte applies for the
     remaining days. These charges are reflected as `EarlyDelete-GIR`,
     `EarlyDelete-ByteHrs`, and `EarlyDelete-GDA` usage types
     respectively on your bill.

04. For objects that are in S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA storage, when they are
     deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class before 30
     days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte for the remaining days.

05. For small objects (smaller than 128 KB) that are in S3 Standard-IA or
     S3 One Zone-IA storage, when they are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a
     different storage class before 30 days, there is a prorated charge per gigabyte
     for the remaining days.

06. There is no minimum billable object size for objects in the
     S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Objects that are smaller than 128 KB are
     not monitored or eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects are always stored in
     the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Frequent Access tier.

07. When you initiate a `CreateMultipartUpload`,
     `UploadPart`, or `UploadPartCopy` request to either
     the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
     classes, requests are billed at S3 Standard request rates until you complete the
     multipart upload. After the upload is completed, the single
     `CompleteMultipartUpload` request is billed at the
     `PUT` rate for the destination S3 Glacier storage. In-progress
     multipart upload parts for a `PUT` to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
     storage class are billed as S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Staging Storage at
     S3 Standard storage rates until the upload is completed. Similarly, in-progress
     multipart upload parts for a `PUT` to the
     S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class are billed as
     S3 Glacier Deep Archive Staging Storage at S3 Standard storage rates
     until the upload is completed.

08. S3 Express One Zone applies a flat per-request charge for request sizes up to 512 KB.
     An additional per GB charge is applied for `PUT` requests and
     `GET` requests for the portion of request greater than 512
     KB.

09. For information about supported features for S3 Express One Zone storage class, see [Amazon S3 features not supported by directory buckets](s3-express-differences.md#s3-express-differences-unsupported-features).

10. Usage types with units that are billed in GB are calculated in bytes in the
     usage reports.

11. A GB-Month is derived by taking the total number of GB-hours, aggregating
     these over the course of a month, and then dividing by the number of hours in
     that month. To learn more see,
     [Frequently Asked Questions: How\
     will I be charged and billed for my use of Amazon S3?](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs)

###### Note

In general, S3 bucket owners are billed for requests with
HTTP `200 OK` successful responses and HTTP `4XX` client error responses. Bucket owners aren't billed for HTTP `5XX` server error responses, such as HTTP `503 Slow Down` errors.

For more information on S3 error codes under HTTP `3XX` and `4XX` status codes that aren't billed, see [Billing for Amazon S3 error responses](errorcodebilling.md).

For more information about billing charges if your bucket is configured as a Requester Pays bucket, see [How Requester Pays charges work](requesterpaysbuckets.md#ChargeDetails).

## Tracking Operations in Your Usage Reports

Operations describe the action taken on your AWS object or bucket by the
specified usage type. Operations are indicated by self-explanatory codes, such as
`PutObject` or `ListBucket`. To see which actions on your
bucket generated a specific type of usage, use these codes. When you create a usage
report, you can choose to include **All Operations**, or a specific
operation, for example, `GetObject`, to report on.
