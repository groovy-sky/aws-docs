# Data residency workloads

AWS Dedicated Local Zones (Dedicated Local Zones) are a type of AWS Infrastructure that are fully managed by AWS,
built for exclusive use by you or your community, and placed in a location or data center
specified by you to help comply with regulatory requirements. Dedicated Local Zones are a type of AWS Local Zones
(Local Zones) offering. For more information, see [AWS Dedicated Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/dedicatedlocalzones).

In Dedicated Local Zones, you can create S3 directory buckets to store data in a specific data
perimeter, which helps support data residency and isolation use cases.

Directory buckets in Dedicated Local Zones can support the S3 Express One Zone and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA; Z-IA) storage classes.
Directory buckets are not currently available in other [AWS Local Zones locations](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/locations).

You can use the
AWS Management Console, REST API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs in Dedicated Local Zones.
