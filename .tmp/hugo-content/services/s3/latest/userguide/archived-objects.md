# Working with archived objects

To reduce your storage costs for infrequently accessed objects, you can _archive_ those objects. When you archive an object, it is moved
into low-cost storage, which means that you can't access it in real time.

Although archived objects are not accessible in real time, you can restore them in minutes
or hours, depending on the storage class. You can restore an archived object by using the
Amazon S3 console, S3 Batch Operations, the REST API, the AWS SDKs, and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For
instructions, see [Restoring an archived object](restoring-objects.md).

Amazon S3 objects in the following storage classes or tiers are archived and are not accessible
in real time:

- The S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class

- The S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class

- The S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier

- The S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier

To restore archived objects, you must do the following:

- For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive
storage classes, you must initiate the restore request and wait until a temporary
copy of the object is available. When a temporary copy of the restored object is
created, the object's storage class remains the same. (A [HeadObject](../api/restobjecthead.md) or
[GetObject](../api/restobjectget.md) API
operation request returns S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive as the storage class.)

- For objects in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tiers, you
must initiate the restore request and wait until the object is moved into the
Frequent Access tier.

For more information about how all Amazon S3 storage classes compare, see [Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes](storage-class-intro.md). For more
information about S3 Intelligent-Tiering, see [How S3 Intelligent-Tiering works](intelligent-tiering-overview.md).

The time it takes a restore job to finish depends on which archive storage class or
storage tier you use and which retrieval option you specify: Expedited (only available
for S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access), Standard, or Bulk. For more
information, see [Understanding archive retrieval options](restoring-objects-retrieval-options.md).

You can be notified when your restore is complete by using Amazon S3 Event Notifications.
For more information, see [Amazon S3 Event Notifications](eventnotifications.md).

## Restoring objects from Amazon Glacier

When you use S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive, Amazon S3
restores a temporary copy of the object only for the specified duration. After that, it
deletes the restored object copy. You can modify the expiration period of a restored
copy by reissuing a restore request. In this case, Amazon S3 updates the expiration period
relative to the current time.

###### Note

When you restore an archived object from S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive, you pay for both the archived object and the copy
that you restored temporarily. For information about pricing, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

Amazon S3 calculates the expiration time of the restored object copy by adding the number
of days specified in the restoration request to the time when the requested restoration
is completed. Amazon S3 then rounds the resulting time to the next day at midnight Universal
Coordinated Time (UTC). For example, suppose that a restored object copy was created on
October 15, 2012, at 10:30 AM UTC, and the restoration period was specified as 3 days.
In this case, the restored copy expires on October 19, 2012, at 00:00 UTC, at which time
Amazon S3 deletes the object copy.

## Restoring objects from S3 Intelligent-Tiering

When you restore an object from the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier or
S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier, the object moves back into the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Frequent Access tier.
If the object is not accessed after 30 consecutive days, it automatically moves into the
Infrequent Access tier. After a minimum of 90 consecutive days of no access, the object moves
into the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier. If the object is not accessed after a minimum of
180 consecutive days, the object moves into the Deep Archive Access tier.

###### Note

Unlike in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
restore requests for S3 Intelligent-Tiering objects don't accept the
`Days` value.

## Using S3 Batch Operations with restore requests

To restore more than one Amazon S3 object with a single request, you can use
S3 Batch Operations.
You provide S3 Batch Operations with a list of objects to operate on. S3 Batch Operations calls the
respective API operation to perform the specified operation. A single Batch Operations job can perform the
specified operation on billions of objects containing exabytes of data.
