# Listing objects from a directory bucket

The following code examples show how to list objects in an Amazon S3
directory bucket by using the `ListObjectsV2` API operation.

The following `list-objects-v2` example command shows how you can use the AWS CLI
to list objects from Amazon S3. This command lists objects from the directory bucket
`bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3`. To run this command, replace the `user input placeholders`
with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3
```

For more information, see [list-objects-v2](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/list-objects-v2.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.
