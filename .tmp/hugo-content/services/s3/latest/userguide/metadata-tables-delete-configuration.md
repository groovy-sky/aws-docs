# Deleting metadata table configurations

If you want to stop updating the metadata table configuration for an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket,
you can delete the metadata table configuration that's attached to your bucket. Deleting a metadata
table configuration deletes only the configuration. The AWS managed table bucket and your metadata
tables still exist, even if you delete the metadata table configuration. However, the metadata tables
will no longer be updated.

###### Note

If you delete your metadata table configuration and want to re-create a configuration for the same
general purpose bucket, you must first manually delete the old journal and inventory tables from your
AWS managed table bucket. Otherwise, creating the new metadata table configuration fails because
those tables already exist. To delete your metadata tables, see [Deleting metadata tables](metadata-tables-delete-table.md).

To delete your metadata tables, see [Delete a metadata table](metadata-tables-delete-table.md#delete-metadata-table-procedure). To delete
your table bucket, see [Deleting table buckets](s3-tables-buckets-delete.md) and
[DeleteTableBucket](../api/api-s3tablebuckets-deletetablebucket.md) in the _Amazon S3 API_
_Reference_.

You can delete a metadata table configuration by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI), the AWS SDKs, or the Amazon S3 REST API.

## Delete a metadata table configuration

###### To delete a metadata table configuration

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose**
**buckets**.

3. Choose the general purpose bucket that you want to remove a metadata table
    configuration from.

4. On the bucket's details page, choose the **Metadata** tab.

5. On the **Metadata** tab, choose
    **Delete**.

6. In the **Delete metadata configuration** dialog box, enter
    `confirm` to confirm that you want to delete the
    configuration. Then choose **Delete**.

To run the following commands, you must have the AWS CLI installed and configured. If
you don’t have the AWS CLI installed, see [Install or update to the\
latest version of the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

Alternatively, you can run AWS CLI commands from the console by using AWS CloudShell.
AWS CloudShell is a browser-based, pre-authenticated shell that you can launch directly from
the AWS Management Console. For more information, see [What is CloudShell?](../../../cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.md) and
[Getting started with AWS CloudShell](../../../cloudshell/latest/userguide/getting-started.md) in the
_AWS CloudShell User Guide_.

###### To delete a metadata table configuration by using the AWS CLI

To use the following example commands, replace the `user input
              placeholders` with your own information.

1. Use the following command to delete the metadata table configuration from your general
    purpose bucket (for example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`):

```nohighlight

aws s3api delete-bucket-metadata-configuration \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
   --region us-east-2
```

2. To verify that the configuration was deleted, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-metadata-configuration \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
   --region us-east-2
```

You can send REST requests to delete a metadata table configuration. For more information, see
[DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration](../api/api-deletebucketmetadataconfiguration.md).

###### Note

You can use the V2 `DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration` API operation with V1 or
V2 metadata table configurations. However, if you try to use the V1
`DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` API operation with V2 configurations, you
will receive an HTTP `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

You can use the AWS SDKs to delete a metadata table configuration in Amazon S3. For
information, see the [list of supported SDKs](../api/api-deletebucketmetadataconfiguration.md#API_DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration_SeeAlso).
