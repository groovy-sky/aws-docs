# AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3

With AWS PrivateLink for Amazon S3, you can provision _interface VPC endpoints_
(interface endpoints) in your virtual private cloud (VPC). These endpoints are directly accessible from applications that are on premises
over VPN and Direct Connect, or in a different AWS Region over VPC peering.

Interface endpoints are represented by one or more elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that
are assigned private IP addresses from subnets in your VPC. Requests to Amazon S3 over interface
endpoints stay on the Amazon network. You can also access interface endpoints in your VPC from
on-premises applications through AWS Direct Connect or AWS Virtual Private Network (Site-to-Site VPN). For more information about
how to connect your VPC with your on-premises network, see the [Direct Connect User Guide](../../../directconnect/latest/userguide/welcome.md) and the [AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpc-vpn.md).

For general information about interface endpoints, see [Interface VPC endpoints\
(AWS PrivateLink)](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.md) in the _AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

## Types of VPC endpoints for Amazon S3

You can use two types of VPC endpoints to access Amazon S3: _gateway_
_endpoints_ and _interface endpoints_ (by using AWS PrivateLink).
A _gateway endpoint_ is a gateway that you specify in your
route table to access Amazon S3 from your VPC over the AWS network. _Interface endpoints_ extend the functionality of gateway endpoints by using
private IP addresses to route requests to Amazon S3 from within your VPC, on premises, or from a
VPC in another AWS Region by using VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway. For
more information, see [What is VPC peering?](../../../vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.md) and [Transit Gateway vs VPC peering](../../../whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/transit-gateway-vs-vpc-peering.md).

Interface endpoints are compatible with gateway endpoints. If you have an existing gateway
endpoint in the VPC, you can use both types of endpoints in the same VPC.

## Creating a VPC endpoint

To create a VPC interface endpoint, see [Create a VPC endpoint](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.md#create-interface-endpoint-aws) in the _AWS PrivateLink_
_Guide_. To create a VPC gateway endpoint, see [Create a gateway endpoint](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.md#create-gateway-endpoint-s3) in the _AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

## Accessing Amazon S3 interface endpoints

When you create an interface endpoint, Amazon S3 generates two types of endpoint-specific, S3
DNS names: _Regional_ and _zonal_.

- A _Regional_ DNS name includes a unique VPC endpoint ID, a
service identifier, the AWS Region, and `vpce.amazonaws.com` in its name. For
example, for VPC endpoint ID `vpce-1a2b3c4d`, the
DNS name generated might be similar to
`vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`.

- A _Zonal_ DNS name includes the Availability Zone—for
example, `vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f-us-east-1a.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`. You might use this
option if your architecture isolates Availability Zones. For example, you could use it for
fault containment or to reduce Regional data transfer costs.

Endpoint-specific S3 DNS names can be resolved from the S3 public DNS domain.

VPC endpoints for Amazon S3 support different types of IP addressing, including: IPv4, IPv6, and Dualstack. See [IP Address types for VPC endpoints](#privatelink-ip-address-types) and [DNS record IP types for VPC endpoints](#privatelink-dns-record-types).

## IP Address types for VPC endpoints

VPC endpoints for Amazon S3 support different types of IP addressing, including:

- **IPv4**

VPC endpoints can be configured to use only IPv4 addresses for connectivity.

- **IPv6**

VPC endpoints can be configured to use only IPv6 addresses for connectivity.

- **Dual-stack**

VPC endpoints can be configured in dual-stack mode, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses simultaneously. This provides flexibility to access Amazon S3 over either IPv4 or IPv6 networks.

The IP address type you choose for your VPC endpoint will depend on the networking requirements of your applications and infrastructure. Considerations may include the IP addressing schemes used in your VPC, on-premises networks, and across the internet connectivity to Amazon S3. For more information, see IP address types for [interface endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.md#aws-service-ip-address-type) and [gateway endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/gateway-endpoints.md#gateway-endpoint-ip-address-type) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud_ guide.

## DNS record IP types for VPC endpoints

Depending on your IP address type, when you call a VPC endpoint, the AWS service can return `A` records, `AAAA` records, or both `A` and `AAAA` records. You can customize which record types your AWS service returns by modifying the DNS record IP type. The following table shows the supported DNS record IP types and the IP address types:

Supported IP address typesDNS record IP typesIPv4IPv4IPv6IPv6DualstackDualstack, IPv4, IPv6, Service-defined

### Configuring the service-defined DNS record IP type for Amazon S3

If you create a gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 and configure the DNS record IP type as service-defined and use the regional service endpoint,(such as `s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`), Amazon S3 returns `A` records to your clients. In contrast, if you create a gateway endpoint and are using a dual-stack service endpoint, (such as `s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`) and select the DNS record IP type as `service-defined`, Amazon S3 returns both `A` and `AAAA` records to your clients.

Similarly, if you create an interface endpoint with Private DNS enabled and choose service-defined as the DNS record type, for the regional service endpoint, (such as, `s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`), Amazon S3 returns `A` records to your client. Whereas, for a dualstack service endpoint, (such as, `s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`), Amazon S3 returns both `A` and `AAAA` records. For more information, see DNS record IP type for [interface endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.md#aws-services-dns-record-ip-type) and [gateway endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/gateway-endpoints.md#gateway-endpoint-dns-record-ip-type) in the _VPC User Guide_.

The following table shows the supported DNS record IP types for gateway and interface endpoints:

IP address typeSupported DNS record IP types for S3 Gateway endpointsSupported DNS record IP types for S3 Interface endpoints IPv4IPv4, service-defined\*IPv4IPv6IPv6, service-defined\*IPv6DualstackIPv4, IPv6, Dualstack, service-defined\*Dualstack\*, IPv4, IPv6, service-defined

\\* Represents the default DNS record IP type.

To enable IPv6 connectivity on an existing S3 gateway or interface endpoint, update the IP address type for the endpoint to `Dualstack`. When updated, Amazon S3 automatically updates the routing tables with IPv6 addresses for gateway endpoints. Then you can use the dualstack service endpoint, such as `s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`, and Amazon S3 will return both `A` and `AAAA` records for dualstack S3 DNS queries. If you want to use IPV6 with the regional service endpoint, such as `s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`, modify the IP address type for the endpoint to `Dualstack`; and the DNS record IP type to `Dualstack`. Then Amazon S3 will return both `A` and `AAAA` records for the regional S3 DNS queries.

###### Considerations

- If your gateway endpoint has the default configuration of IP address type as `IPv4` and DNS record IP type as `service-defined`, then the dualstack service endpoint (such as `s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`), traffic that uses `AAAA` records won't be routed through the gateway endpoint. Instead, this traffic will be dropped or routed over an IPv6-compatible path if one is present. For example, if your virtual private cloud (VPC) has an internet gateway, your IPv6 traffic will be routed over the internet gateway in your VPC in this scenario. If you want to ensure your traffic is always routed over a VPC endpoint, you can use an Amazon S3 bucket policy that restricts access to a specific bucket if a specified VPC endpoint is not used. For more information, see [Restricting access to a specific VPC endpoint](example-bucket-policies-vpc-endpoint.md#example-bucket-policies-restrict-accesss-vpc-endpoint).

- If your interface endpoint has the default configuration of IP address type, which is IPv4, and DNS record IP type as IPv4, dualstack service endpoints, such as `ass3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`, are not supported. Traffic that uses the `A` or `AAAA` records of the dualstack service endpoints won't be routed through the interface endpoint. Instead, this traffic will be dropped or routed over another compatible path if one is present.

- Creating or modifying a gateway endpoint with a DNS record IP type other than service-defined requires both the `enableDnsSupport` and `enableDnsHostnames` VPC attributes to be set to true.

## Private DNS

Private DNS options for VPC interface endpoints simplify routing S3 traffic over VPC
endpoints and help you take advantage of the lowest-cost network path available to your
application. You can use private DNS options to route Regional S3 traffic without updating
your S3 clients to use the endpoint-specific DNS names of your interface endpoints, or
managing DNS infrastructure. With private DNS names enabled, Regional S3 DNS queries resolve
to the private IP addresses of AWS PrivateLink for the following endpoints:

- Regional bucket endpoints (for example,
`s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)

- Control endpoints (for example,
`s3-control.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)

- Access point endpoints (for example,
`s3-accesspoint.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)

If you have a gateway endpoint in your VPC, you can automatically route in-VPC
requests over your existing S3 gateway endpoint and on-premises requests over your interface
endpoint. This approach allows you to optimize your networking costs by using gateway
endpoints, which are not billed, for your in-VPC traffic. Your on-premises applications can
use AWS PrivateLink with the help of the inbound Resolver endpoint. Amazon provides a DNS
server, called the Route 53 Resolver, for your VPC. An inbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS
queries from the on-premises network to Route 53 Resolver.

###### Important

To
take
advantage of the lowest cost network path when using **Enable private DNS only for**
**inbound endpoints**, a gateway endpoint must be present in your VPC. The
presence of a gateway endpoint helps ensure that in-VPC traffic always routes over the
AWS private network when the **Enable private DNS only for inbound**
**endpoints** option is selected. You must maintain this gateway endpoint while you
have the **Enable private DNS only for inbound endpoints** option selected.
If you want to delete your gateway endpoint you must first clear **Enable private**
**DNS only for inbound endpoints**.

If you want to update an existing interface endpoint to **Enable private DNS**
**only for inbound endpoints**, first confirm that your VPC has an S3 gateway
endpoint. For more information about gateway endpoints and managing private DNS names, see
[Gateway VPC\
endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway.md) and [Manage DNS names](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/manage-dns-names.md) respectively
in the _AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

When enabling **Private DNS for inbound resolver only**, the `dnsRecordIpType` of the gateway endpoint must either match that of interface endpoint or be **service defined**.

The **Enable private DNS only for inbound endpoints** option is available
only for services that support gateway endpoints.

For more information about creating a VPC endpoint that uses **Enable private**
**DNS only for inbound endpoints**, see [Create an interface\
endpoint](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.md) in the _AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

**Using**
**the VPC console**

In the console you have two options: **Enable DNS name** and
**Enable private DNS only for inbound endpoints**. **Enable DNS**
**name** is an option supported by AWS PrivateLink. By using the **Enable DNS**
**name** option, you can use Amazon’s private connectivity to Amazon S3, while making
requests to the default public endpoint DNS names. When this option is enabled, customers can
take advantage of the lowest cost network path available to their application.

When you enable private DNS names on an existing or new VPC interface endpoint for Amazon S3,
the **Enable private DNS only for inbound endpoints** option is selected by
default. If this option is selected, your applications use only interface endpoints for your
on-premises traffic. This in-VPC traffic automatically uses the lower-cost gateway endpoints.
Alternatively, you can clear **Enable private DNS only for inbound**
**endpoints** to route all S3 requests over your interface endpoint.

**Using the AWS CLI**

If
you don't specify a value for `PrivateDnsOnlyForInboundResolverEndpoint`, it will
default to `true`. However, before your VPC applies your settings, it performs a
check to make sure that you have a gateway endpoint present in the VPC. If a gateway
endpoint is present in the VPC, the call succeeds. If not, you will see the following error
message:

**`To set PrivateDnsOnlyForInboundResolverEndpoint to true, the VPC**
**vpce_id must have a gateway endpoint for the**
**service.`**

**For a new VPC Interface endpoint**

Use the `private-dns-enabled` and `dns-options` attributes to enable
private DNS through the command line. The
`PrivateDnsOnlyForInboundResolverEndpoint` option in the `dns-options`
attribute must be set to `true`. Replace the `user input placeholders` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
--region us-east-1 \

```

**For an existing VPC endpoint**

If you want to use private DNS for an existing VPC endpoint, use the following example
command and replace the `user input placeholders` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-vpc-endpoint \
--region us-east-1 \

If you want to update an existing VPC endpoint to enable private DNS only for the
Inbound Resolver, use the following example and replace the sample values with your
own.

```nohighlight

--region us-east-1 \
--vpc-endpoint-id client-vpc-id \
--private-dns-enabled \
--dns-options PrivateDnsOnlyForInboundResolverEndpoint=true

```

## Accessing buckets, access points, and Amazon S3 Control API operations from S3 interface endpoints

You can use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to access buckets, S3 access points, and Amazon S3 Control API
operations through S3 interface endpoints.

The following image shows the VPC console **Details** tab, where you
can find the DNS name of a VPC endpoint. In this example, the _VPC endpoint ID_
_(vpce-id)_ is `vpce-0e25b8cdd720f900e` and the _DNS_
_name_ is
`*.vpce-0e25b8cdd720f900e-argc85vg.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`.

![The Details tab in the VPC console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/vpc-console-details-tab.png)

When using the DNS name to access a resource, replace `*` with
the appropriate value. The appropriate values to use in place of `*` are as
follows:

- `bucket`

- `accesspoint`

- `control`

For example, to access a bucket, use a _DNS name_ like this:

`bucket.vpce-0e25b8cdd720f900e-argc85vg.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`

For examples of how to use DNS names to access buckets, access points, and Amazon S3 Control
API operations, see the following sections of [AWS CLI examples](#privatelink-aws-cli-examples) and [AWS SDK examples](#privatelink-aws-sdk-examples).

For
more information about how to view your endpoint-specific DNS names, see [Viewing endpoint service private DNS name configuration](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/view-vpc-endpoint-service-dns-name.md) in the _VPC User_
_Guide_.

### AWS CLI examples

To access S3 buckets, S3 access points, or Amazon S3 Control API operations through S3 interface
endpoints in AWS CLI commands, use the `--region` and `--endpoint-url`
parameters.

###### Example: Use an endpoint URL to list objects in your bucket

In the following example, replace the bucket name `my-bucket`, Region
`us-east-1`, and the DNS name of the VPC endpoint
ID
`vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com` with your own
information.

```nohighlight

aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket/ --region us-east-1 --endpoint-url https://bucket.vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com
```

**Example: Use an endpoint URL to list objects from an access point**

- **Method 1** – Using the Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) of the access point with the access point endpoint

Replace the ARN
`us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/accesspointexamplename`,
the Region `us-east-1`, and the VPC endpoint ID
`vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`
with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/accesspointexamplename --region us-east-1 --endpoint-url https://accesspoint.vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com
```

If you can't run the command successfully, update your AWS CLI to the latest version and try again. For more information on the update instructions, see
[Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md#getting-started-install-instructions) in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

- **Method 2** – Using the alias of the access point with
the regional bucket endpoint

In the following example, replace the access point alias
`accesspointexamplename-8tyekmigicmhun8n9kwpfur39dnw4use1a-s3alias`, the
Region `us-east-1`, and the VPC endpoint ID
`vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`
with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket accesspointexamplename-8tyekmigicmhun8n9kwpfur39dnw4use1a-s3alias --region us-east-1 --endpoint-url https://bucket.vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com
```

- **Method 3** – Using the alias of the access point with
the access point endpoint

First, to construct an S3 endpoint with the bucket included as part of the hostname, set the addressing style to `virtual` for `aws s3api` to use.
For more information about `AWS configure`, see [Configuration and credential file settings](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.md) in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

```nohighlight

aws configure set default.s3.addressing_style virtual
```

Then, in the following example, replace the access point alias
`accesspointexamplename-8tyekmigicmhun8n9kwpfur39dnw4use1a-s3alias`, the
Region `us-east-1`, and the VPC endpoint ID
`vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`
with your own information. For more information about access point alias, see [Access point aliases](access-points-naming.md#access-points-alias).

```nohighlight

aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket accesspointexamplename-8tyekmigicmhun8n9kwpfur39dnw4use1a-s3alias --region us-east-1 --endpoint-url https://accesspoint.vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com
```

###### Example: Use an endpoint URL to list jobs with an S3 control API operation

In the following example, replace the Region
`us-east-1`, the VPC endpoint ID
`vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`,
and the account ID `12345678` with your own
information.

```nohighlight

aws s3control --region us-east-1 --endpoint-url https://control.vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com list-jobs --account-id 12345678
```

### AWS SDK examples

To access S3 buckets, S3 access points, or Amazon S3 Control API operations through S3 interface
endpoints when using the AWS SDKs, update your SDKs to the latest version. Then configure
your clients to use an endpoint URL for accessing a bucket, access point, or Amazon S3 Control API
operations through S3 interface endpoints.

###### Example: Use an endpoint URL to access the Amazon S3 Control API

In the following example, replace the VPC endpoint ID
`vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com`
and the Region `Region.US_EAST_1` with your
own information.

```java

// control client
Region region = Region.US_EAST_1;
s3ControlClient = S3ControlClient.builder().region(region)
                                 .endpointOverride(URI.create("https://control.vpce-1a2b3c4d-5e6f.s3.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com"))
                                 .build()
```

## Updating an on-premises DNS configuration

When using endpoint-specific DNS names to access the interface endpoints for Amazon S3, you
don’t have to update your on-premises DNS resolver. You can resolve the endpoint-specific DNS
name with the private IP address of the interface endpoint from the public Amazon S3 DNS domain.

### Using interface endpoints to access Amazon S3 without a gateway endpoint or an internet gateway in the VPC

Interface endpoints in your VPC can route both in-VPC applications and on-premises
applications to Amazon S3 over the Amazon network, as illustrated in the following
diagram.

![Data-flow diagram showing access to Amazon S3 using an interface endpoint and AWS PrivateLink.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/interface-endpoints.png)

The
diagram illustrates the following:

- Your on-premises network uses Direct Connect or Site-to-Site VPN to connect to VPC A.

- Your applications on-premises and in VPC A use endpoint-specific DNS names to access
Amazon S3 through the S3 interface endpoint.

- On-premises applications send data to the interface endpoint in the VPC through
Direct Connect (or Site-to-Site VPN). AWS PrivateLink moves the data from the interface endpoint to Amazon S3
over the AWS network.

- In-VPC applications also send traffic to the interface endpoint. AWS PrivateLink moves
the data from the interface endpoint to Amazon S3 over the AWS network.

### Using gateway endpoints and interface endpoints together in the same VPC to access Amazon S3

You can create interface endpoints and retain the existing gateway endpoint in the
same VPC, as the following diagram shows. By taking this approach, you allow in-VPC
applications to continue accessing Amazon S3 through the gateway endpoint, which is not billed.
Then, only your on-premises applications would use interface endpoints to access Amazon S3. To
access Amazon S3 this way, you must update your on-premises applications to use endpoint-specific
DNS names for Amazon S3.

![Data-flow diagram showing access to Amazon S3 using gateway endpoints and interface endpoints.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/interface-and-gateway-endpoints.png)

The diagram illustrates the following:

- On-premises applications use endpoint-specific DNS names to send data to the
interface endpoint within the VPC through Direct Connect (or Site-to-Site VPN). AWS PrivateLink moves the
data from the interface endpoint to Amazon S3 over the AWS network.

- Using default Regional Amazon S3 names, in-VPC applications send data to the gateway
endpoint that connects to Amazon S3 over the AWS network.

For more information about gateway endpoints, see [Gateway VPC endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway.md) in the
_VPC User Guide_.

## Creating a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3

You can attach an endpoint policy to your VPC endpoint that controls access to Amazon S3. The
policy specifies the following information:

- The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) principal that can perform actions

- The actions that can be performed

- The resources on which actions can be performed

You can also use Amazon S3 bucket policies to restrict access to specific buckets from a
specific VPC endpoint by using the `aws:sourceVpce` condition in your bucket
policy. The following examples show policies that restrict access to a bucket or to an
endpoint.

- [Example: Restricting access to buckets in a specific account from a VPC endpoint](#privatelink-example-access-bucket-in-specific-account-only)

- [Example: Restricting access to a specific VPC endpoint in the S3 bucket policy](#privatelink-example-restrict-access-to-vpc-endpoint)

### Example: Restricting access to a specific bucket from a VPC endpoint

You can create an endpoint policy that restricts access to only specific Amazon S3 buckets.
This type of policy is useful if you have other AWS services in your VPC that use
buckets. The following bucket policy restricts access to only the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. To use this endpoint
policy, replace `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` with the name
of your bucket.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy1415115909151",
  "Statement": [
    { "Sid": "Access-to-specific-bucket-only",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*"]
    }
  ]
}

```

### Example: Restricting access to buckets in a specific account from a VPC endpoint

You can create an endpoint policy that restricts access to only the S3 buckets in a
specific AWS account. To prevent clients within your VPC from accessing buckets that you
don't own, use the following statement in your endpoint policy. The following example
statement creates a policy that restricts access to resources owned by a single
AWS account ID, `111122223333`.

```json

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Access-to-bucket-in-specific-account-only",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceAccount": "111122223333"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

###### Note

To specify the AWS account ID of the resource being accessed, you can use either the
`aws:ResourceAccount` or the `s3:ResourceAccount` key in your
IAM policy. However, be aware that some AWS services rely on access to AWS managed
buckets. Therefore, using the `aws:ResourceAccount` or
`s3:ResourceAccount` key in your IAM policy might also affect access to
these resources.

### Example: Restricting access to a specific VPC endpoint in the S3 bucket policy

The following Amazon S3 bucket policy allows access to a specific bucket,
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket2`, from only the VPC endpoint
`vpce-1a2b3c4d`. The policy denies all access to
the bucket if the specified endpoint is not being used. The `aws:sourceVpce`
condition specifies the endpoint and doesn't require an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
VPC endpoint resource, only the endpoint ID. To use this bucket policy, replace
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket2` and
`vpce-1a2b3c4d` with your bucket name and
endpoint.

###### Important

- When applying the following Amazon S3 bucket policy to restrict access to only certain
VPC endpoints, you might block your access to the bucket without intending to do so.
Bucket policies that are intended to specifically limit bucket access to connections
originating from your VPC endpoint can block all connections to the bucket. For
information about how to fix this issue, see [My bucket\
policy has the wrong VPC or VPC endpoint ID. How can I fix the policy so that I\
can access the bucket?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-regain-access) in the _Support Knowledge_
_Center_.

- Before using the following example policy, replace the VPC endpoint ID with an
appropriate value for your use case. Otherwise, you won't be able to access your
bucket.

- This policy disables _console_ access to the specified bucket,
because console requests don't originate from the specified VPC endpoint.
