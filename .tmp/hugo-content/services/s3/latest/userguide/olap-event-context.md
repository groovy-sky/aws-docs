# Event context format and usage

###### Note

As of November 7th, 2025, S3 Object Lambda is available only to existing customers that are currently using the service as well as to select AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. For capabilities similar to S3 Object Lambda, learn more here - [Amazon S3 Object Lambda availability change](amazons3-ol-change.md).

Amazon S3 Object Lambda provides context about the request that's being made in the event that's
passed to your AWS Lambda function. The following shows an example request. Descriptions of
the fields are included after the example.

The following fields are included in the request:

- `xAmzRequestId` – The Amazon S3 request ID for this request. We
recommend that you log this value to help with debugging.

- `getObjectContext` – The input and output details for
connections to Amazon S3 and S3 Object Lambda.

- `inputS3Url` – A presigned URL that can be used to
fetch the original object from Amazon S3. The URL is signed by using the original
caller's identity, and that user's permissions will apply when the URL is
used. If there are signed headers in the URL, the Lambda function must
include these headers in the call to Amazon S3, except for the `Host`
header.

- `outputRoute` – A routing token that is added to the
S3 Object Lambda URL when the Lambda function calls
`WriteGetObjectResponse`.

- `outputToken` – An opaque token that's used by S3 Object Lambda
to match the `WriteGetObjectResponse` call with the original
caller.

- `configuration` – Configuration information about the
Object Lambda Access Point.

- `accessPointArn` – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
the Object Lambda Access Point that received this request.

- `supportingAccessPointArn` – The ARN of the
supporting access point that is specified in the Object Lambda Access Point configuration.

- `payload` – Custom data that is applied to the
Object Lambda Access Point configuration. S3 Object Lambda treats this data as an opaque string, so it
might need to be decoded before use.

- `userRequest` – Information about the original call to
S3 Object Lambda.

- `url` – The decoded URL of the request as received by
S3 Object Lambda, excluding any authorization-related query parameters.

- `headers` – A map of string to strings containing
the HTTP headers and their values from the original call, excluding any
authorization-related headers. If the same header appears multiple times,
the values from each instance of the same header are combined into a
comma-delimited list. The case of the original headers is retained in this
map.

- `userIdentity` – Details about the identity that made the
call to S3 Object Lambda. For more information, see [Logging data\
events for trails](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md) in the
_AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

- `type` – The type of identity.

- `accountId` – The AWS account to which the identity
belongs.

- `userName` – The friendly name of the identity that
made the call.

- `principalId` – The unique identifier for the identity
that made the call.

- `arn` – The ARN of the principal who made the call.
The last section of the ARN contains the user or role that made the
call.

- `sessionContext` – If the request was made with
temporary security credentials, this element provides information about
the session that was created for those credentials.

- `invokedBy` – The name of the AWS service that
made the request, such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

- `sessionIssuer` – If the request was made with
temporary security credentials, this element provides information about
how the credentials were obtained.

- `protocolVersion` – The version ID of the context provided.
The format of this field is `{Major Version}.{Minor Version}`. The
minor version numbers are always two-digit numbers. Any removal or change to the
semantics of a field necessitates a major version bump and requires active
opt-in. Amazon S3 can add new fields at any time, at which point you might experience
a minor version bump. Because of the nature of software rollouts, you might see
multiple minor versions in use at once.
