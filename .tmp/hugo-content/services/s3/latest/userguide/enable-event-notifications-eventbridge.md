# Enabling Amazon EventBridge

You can enable Amazon EventBridge by using the S3 console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or Amazon S3 REST API.

###### Note

After you enable EventBridge, it takes around five minutes for the
changes to take effect.

###### To enable EventBridge event delivery in the S3 console.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

3. In the buckets list, choose the name of the
    bucket that you want to enable events for.

4. Choose **Properties**.

5. Navigate to the **Event Notifications** section and
    find the **Amazon EventBridge** subsection. Choose
    **Edit**.

6. Under **Send notifications to Amazon EventBridge for all events in this**
**bucket** choose **On**.

The following example creates a bucket notification configuration for bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` with Amazon EventBridge
enabled.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --notification-configuration='{ "EventBridgeConfiguration": {} }'
```

You can programmatically enable Amazon EventBridge on a bucket by calling the Amazon S3 REST API. For
more information, see [PutBucketNotificationConfiguration](../api/api-putbucketnotificationconfiguration.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

The following example shows the XML used to create a bucket notification
configuration with Amazon EventBridge enabled.

```xml

<NotificationConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <EventBridgeConfiguration>
  </EventBridgeConfiguration>
</NotificationConfiguration>
```

## Creating EventBridge rules

Once enabled you can create Amazon EventBridge rules for certain tasks. For example, you can
send email notifications when an object is created. For a full tutorial, see [Tutorial: Send a\
notification when an Amazon S3 object is created](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-s3-object-created-tutorial.md) in the
_Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.
