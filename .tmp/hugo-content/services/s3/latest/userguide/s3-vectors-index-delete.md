# Deleting a vector index

You can delete a vector index when you no longer need it. This operation permanently removes the index and all vectors that are stored within it.

###### Important

When you delete a vector index, you need to know the following:

- You can delete vector indexes even when the indexes contain vectors.

- All vectors stored in the index are permanently deleted

- All metadata associated with those vectors is permanently lost

- The operation can't be undone or reversed

- Any ongoing operations on the index will fail immediately

- Applications querying the index will receive errors

- The index name becomes available for reuse within the bucket

Before you delete a vector index, verify the vector index. For more information about how to check the index details, see [GetIndex](../api/api-getindex.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_. For more information about how to list vectors inside the index to see what will be deleted, see [Listing vector indexes](s3-vectors-index-list.md).

To delete a vector index, use the following example commands. Replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

```bash

aws s3vectors delete-index --vector-bucket-name "amzn-s3-demo-vector-bucket" \
          --index-name "idx2"
```

For more information about how to verify whether the index is deleted, see [Listing vector indexes](s3-vectors-index-list.md).

SDK for Python

```

import boto3

# Create a S3 Vectors client in the AWS Region of your choice.
s3vectors = boto3.client("s3vectors", region_name="us-west-2")

#Delete a vector index
response = s3vectors.delete_index(
    vectorBucketName="media-embeddings",
    indexName="movies")
```
