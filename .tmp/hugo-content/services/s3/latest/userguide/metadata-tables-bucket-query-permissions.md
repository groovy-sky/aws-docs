# Permissions for querying metadata tables

Before you can query your S3 Metadata journal and live inventory tables, you must have certain S3
Tables permissions. If your metadata tables have been encrypted with server-side encryption using
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), you must also have the `kms:Decrypt` permission to decrypt
the table data.

When you create your metadata table configuration, your metadata tables are stored in an AWS
managed table bucket. All metadata table configurations in your account and in the same Region are
stored in a single AWS managed table bucket named `aws-s3`.

To query metadata tables, you can use the following example policy. To use this policy, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your own information.
