# Using Storage Browser for S3

In Storage Browser for S3, a _location_ is an S3 general purpose bucket or prefix, that you
grant end users access to using [S3 Access Grants](access-grants.md), IAM policies, or your
own managed authorization service. After you've authorized your end users to access a specific
location, they can work with any data within that location.

The Storage Browser for S3 user interface has four main views:

- **Home page:** The home page lists the S3 locations that
your users can access, as well as your permissions for each. This is the initial view for
users that shows the root level S3 resources that your end users have access to and the
permissions (READ/WRITE/READWRITE) for each S3 location.

- **Location details:** This view allows users to browse
files and folders in S3, and upload or download files. (Note that in Storage Browser for S3,
_objects_ are known as files, and _prefixes_ and
_buckets_ are known as folders.)

- **Location action:** After a user chooses an action (such as
**Upload**) in Storage Browser, it opens up another view of the
file location.

- **Vertical ellipsis:** The vertical ellipsis icon opens
the drop-down list of actions.

When using Storage Browser for S3, be aware of the following limitations:

- Folders starting or ending with dots (.) aren’t supported.

- S3 Access Grants with WRITE only permission isn't supported.

- Storage Browser for S3 supports the `PUT` operation for files up to 160 GB in
size.

- Storage Browser for S3 only supports the `COPY` operation for files smaller than 5 GB. If the file size
exceeds 5 GB, Storage Browser fails the request.
