# Creating Object Lambda Access Points

###### Note

As of November 7th, 2025, S3 Object Lambda is available only to existing customers that are currently using the service as well as to select AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. For capabilities similar to S3 Object Lambda, learn more here - [Amazon S3 Object Lambda availability change](amazons3-ol-change.md).

An Object Lambda Access Point is associated with exactly one standard access point, which you specify during creation. To
create an Object Lambda Access Point, you need the following resources:

- **A standard S3 access point.** When you're working with
Object Lambda Access Points, this standard access point is known as a _supporting_
_access point_ and is attached to an S3 bucket or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume. For
information about creating standard access points, see [Creating an access point](creating-access-points.md).

- **An AWS Lambda function.** You can either create your
own Lambda function, or you can use a prebuilt function. For more information about
creating Lambda functions, see [Writing Lambda functions for S3 Object Lambda Access Points](olap-writing-lambda.md). For more
information about prebuilt functions, see [Using AWS built Lambda functions](olap-examples.md).

- **(Optional) An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy.** Amazon S3 access points support
IAM resource policies that you can use to control the use of the access point by resource,
user, or other conditions. For more information about creating these policies, see
[Configuring IAM policies for Object Lambda Access Points](olap-policies.md).

The following sections describe how to create an Object Lambda Access Point by using:

- The AWS Management Console

- The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

- An AWS CloudFormation template

- The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

For information about how to create an Object Lambda Access Point by using the REST API, see [`CreateAccessPointForObjectLambda`](../api/api-control-createaccesspointforobjectlambda.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Create an Object Lambda Access Point

Use one of the following procedures to create your Object Lambda Access Point.

###### To create an Object Lambda Access Point by using the console

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the navigation bar, choose the name of the currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region that you want to switch to.

03. In the left navigation pane, choose **Object Lambda Access Points**.

04. On the **Object Lambda Access Points** page, choose **Create**
    **Object Lambda Access Point**.

05. For **Object Lambda Access Point name**, enter the name that you want to use
     for the access point.

    As with standard access points, there are rules for naming Object Lambda Access Points. For more information,
     see [Naming rules for access points](access-points-restrictions-limitations-naming-rules.md#access-points-names).

06. For **Supporting Access Point**, enter or browse to the standard
     access point that you want to use. The access point must be in the same AWS Region as the objects
     that you want to transform. For information about creating standard access points, see [Creating an access point](creating-access-points.md).

07. Under **Transformation configuration**, you can add a function
     that transforms your data for your Object Lambda Access Point. Do one of the following:

- If you already have a AWS Lambda function in your account you can choose it
under **Invoke Lambda function**. Here you may enter the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Lambda function in your AWS account or
choose a Lambda function from the drop-down menu.

- If you wish to use a AWS built function choose the function name under
**AWS built function** and select **Create**
**Lambda function**. This will take you to the Lambda console where
you can deploy a built function into your AWS account. For more
information about built functions, see [Using AWS built Lambda functions](olap-examples.md).

Under **S3 APIs**, choose one or more API operations to invoke.
For each API selected you must specify a Lambda function to invoke.

08. (Optional) Under **Payload**, add JSON text that you want to
     provide to your Lambda function as input. You can configure payloads with different
     parameters for different Object Lambda Access Points that invoke the same Lambda function, thereby
     extending the flexibility of your Lambda
     function.

    ###### Important

    When you're using Object Lambda Access Points, make sure that the payload does not contain any
    confidential information.

09. (Optional) For **Range and part number**, you must enable this
     option if you want to process `GET` and `HEAD` requests with
     range and part number headers. Enabling this option confirms that your Lambda
     function can recognize and process these requests. For more information about range
     headers and part numbers, see [Working with Range and partNumber headers](range-get-olap.md).

10. (Optional) For **Request metrics**, choose
     **Enable** or **Disable** to add Amazon S3
     monitoring to your Object Lambda Access Point. Request metrics are billed at the standard Amazon CloudWatch
     rate.

11. (Optional) Under **Object Lambda Access Point policy**, set a resource policy.
     Resource policies grant permissions for the specified Object Lambda Access Point and can control the use
     of the access point by resource, user, or other conditions. For more information about
     Object Lambda Access Point resource policies see, [Configuring IAM policies for Object Lambda Access Points](olap-policies.md).

12. Under **Block Public Access settings for this Object Lambda Access Point**, select the block
     public access settings that you want to apply. All block public
     access settings are enabled by default for new Object Lambda Access Points, and we recommend that
     you leave default settings enabled. Amazon S3 currently doesn't support changing an Object Lambda Access Point's block public
     access settings after the Object Lambda Access Points has been created.

    For more information about using Amazon S3 Block Public Access, see
     [Managing public access to access points for general purpose buckets](access-points-bpa-settings.md).

13. Choose **Create Object Lambda Access Point**.

###### To create an Object Lambda Access Point by using an AWS CloudFormation template

###### Note

To use the following commands, replace the `user input
                        placeholders` with your own information.

1. Download the AWS Lambda function deployment package
    `s3objectlambda_deployment_package.zip` at [S3 Object Lambda default configuration](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-s3-object-lambda-default-configuration).

2. Run the following `put-object` command to upload the package to an Amazon S3
    bucket.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object --bucket Amazon S3 bucket name --key s3objectlambda_deployment_package.zip --body release/s3objectlambda_deployment_package.zip
```

3. Download the AWS CloudFormation template
    `s3objectlambda_defaultconfig.yaml` at [S3 Object Lambda default configuration](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-s3-object-lambda-default-configuration).

4. Run the following `deploy` command to deploy the template to your
    AWS account.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation deploy --template-file s3objectlambda_defaultconfig.yaml \
    --stack-name CloudFormation stack name \
    --parameter-overrides ObjectLambdaAccessPointName=Object Lambda Access Point name \
     SupportingAccessPointName=Amazon S3 access point S3BucketName=Amazon S3 bucket \
     LambdaFunctionS3BucketName=Amazon S3 bucket containing your Lambda package \
     LambdaFunctionS3Key=Lambda object key LambdaFunctionS3ObjectVersion=Lambda object version \
     LambdaFunctionRuntime=Lambda function runtime --capabilities capability_IAM
```

You can configure this AWS CloudFormation template to invoke Lambda for `GET`,
`HEAD`, and `LIST` API operations. For more information about
modifying the template's default configuration, see [Automate S3 Object Lambda setup with a CloudFormation template](olap-using-cfn-template.md).

###### To create an Object Lambda Access Point by using the AWS CLI

###### Note

To use the following commands, replace the `user input
                        placeholders` with your own information.

The following example creates an Object Lambda Access Point named
`my-object-lambda-ap` for the bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` in the
account `111122223333`. This example
assumes that a standard access point named `example-ap`
has already been created. For information about creating a standard access point, see [Creating an access point](creating-access-points.md).

This example uses the AWS prebuilt function `decompress`. For more
information about prebuilt functions, see [Using AWS built Lambda functions](olap-examples.md).

1. Create a bucket. In this example, we will use
    `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.
    For information about creating buckets, see [Creating a general purpose bucket](create-bucket-overview.md).

2. Create a standard access point and attach it to your bucket. In this example, we will use
    `example-ap`. For information about
    creating standard access points, see [Creating an access point](creating-access-points.md).

3. Do one of the following:

- Create a Lambda function in your account that you would like to use to
transform your Amazon S3 object. For more information about creating Lambda
functions, see [Writing Lambda functions for S3 Object Lambda Access Points](olap-writing-lambda.md). To use your custom
function with the AWS CLI, see [Using Lambda with the\
AWS CLI](../../../lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-awscli.md) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

- Use an AWS prebuilt Lambda function. For more information about prebuilt
functions, see [Using AWS built Lambda functions](olap-examples.md).

4. Create a JSON configuration file named
    `my-olap-configuration.json`. In this configuration, provide
    the supporting access point and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Lambda function that
    you created in the previous steps or the ARN for the prebuilt function that you're
    using.

###### Example

```nohighlight

{
       "SupportingAccessPoint" : "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:111122223333:accesspoint/example-ap",
       "TransformationConfigurations": [{
           "Actions" : ["GetObject", "HeadObject", "ListObjects", "ListObjectsV2"],
           "ContentTransformation" : {
               "AwsLambda": {
                   "FunctionPayload" : "{\"compressionType\":\"gzip\"}",
                   "FunctionArn" : "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111122223333:function/compress"
               }
           }
       }]
}
```

5. Run the `create-access-point-for-object-lambda` command to create your
    Object Lambda Access Point.

```nohighlight

aws s3control create-access-point-for-object-lambda --account-id 111122223333 --name my-object-lambda-ap --configuration file://my-olap-configuration.json
```

6. (Optional) Create a JSON policy file named
    `my-olap-policy.json`.

Adding an Object Lambda Access Point resource policy can control the use of the access point by
    resource, user, or other conditions. This resource policy grants the
    `GetObject` permission for account
    `444455556666` to the
    specified Object Lambda Access Point.

###### Example

```nohighlight

{
       "Version": "2008-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "Grant account 444455556666 GetObject access",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "s3-object-lambda:GetObject",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root"
               },
               "Resource": "your-object-lambda-access-point-arn"
           }
       ]
}
```

7. (Optional) Run the `put-access-point-policy-for-object-lambda` command
    to set your resource policy.

```nohighlight

aws s3control put-access-point-policy-for-object-lambda --account-id 111122223333 --name my-object-lambda-ap --policy file://my-olap-policy.json
```

8. (Optional) Specify a payload.

A payload is optional JSON that you can provide to your AWS Lambda function as
    input. You can configure payloads with different parameters for different Object Lambda Access Points
    that invoke the same Lambda function, thereby extending the flexibility of your Lambda
    function.

The following Object Lambda Access Point configuration shows a payload with two parameters.

```nohighlight

{
   	"SupportingAccessPoint": "AccessPointArn",
   	"CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": false,
   	"TransformationConfigurations": [{
   		"Actions": ["GetObject", "HeadObject", "ListObjects", "ListObjectsV2"],
   		"ContentTransformation": {
   			"AwsLambda": {
   				"FunctionArn": "FunctionArn",
   				"FunctionPayload": "{\"res-x\": \"100\",\"res-y\": \"100\"}"
   			}
   		}
   	}]
}
```

The following Object Lambda Access Point configuration shows a payload with one parameter, and with
    `GetObject-Range`, `GetObject-PartNumber`,
    `HeadObject-Range`, and `HeadObject-PartNumber`
    enabled.

```nohighlight

{
       "SupportingAccessPoint":"AccessPointArn",
       "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": false,
       "AllowedFeatures": ["GetObject-Range", "GetObject-PartNumber", "HeadObject-Range", "HeadObject-PartNumber"],
       "TransformationConfigurations": [{
           "Action": ["GetObject", "HeadObject", "ListObjects", "ListObjectsV2"],
           "ContentTransformation": {
               "AwsLambda": {
                   "FunctionArn":"FunctionArn",
                   "FunctionPayload": "{\"compression-amount\": \"5\"}"
               }
           }
       }]
}
```

###### Important

When you're using Object Lambda Access Points, make sure that the payload does not contain any
confidential information.

You can create an Object Lambda Access Point by using the default configuration provided by Amazon S3. You can
download an AWS CloudFormation template and Lambda function source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-s3-object-lambda-default-configuration) and deploy these resources to set up a functional
Object Lambda Access Point.

For information about modifying the AWS CloudFormation template's default configuration, see [Automate S3 Object Lambda setup with a CloudFormation template](olap-using-cfn-template.md).

For information about configuring Object Lambda Access Points by using CloudFormation without the template, see [`AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint`](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-resource-s3objectlambda-accesspoint.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.
