# Associate or disassociate your IAM Identity Center instance

In Amazon S3 Access Grants, you can associate the AWS IAM Identity Center instance of your corporate identity
directory with an S3 Access Grants instance. After you do so, you can create access grants for your
corporate directory users and groups, in addition to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users and roles.

If you no longer want to create access grants for your corporate directory users and
groups, you can disassociate your IAM Identity Center instance from your S3 Access Grants instance.

You can associate or disassociate an IAM Identity Center instance by using the Amazon S3 console, the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the Amazon S3 REST API, and the AWS
SDKs.

Before you associate your IAM Identity Center instance with your S3 Access Grants instance, you must add your
corporate identity directory to IAM Identity Center. For more information, see [S3 Access Grants and corporate directory identities](access-grants-directory-ids.md).

###### To associate an IAM Identity Center instance with an S3 Access Grants instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Access Grants**.

3. On the **S3 Access Grants** page, choose the Region that contains
    the S3 Access Grants instance that you want to work with.

4. Choose **View details** for the instance.

5. On the details page, in the **IAM Identity Center** section, choose to
    either **Add** an IAM Identity Center instance or
    **Deregister** an already associated IAM Identity Center instance.

To install the AWS CLI, see [Installing the\
AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

To use the following example command, replace the `user input
						placeholders` with your own information.
