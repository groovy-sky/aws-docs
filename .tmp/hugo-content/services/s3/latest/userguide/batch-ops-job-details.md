# Viewing job details

If you want more information about an Amazon S3 Batch Operations job than you can retrieve
by listing jobs, you can view all the details for a single job. You can view details for
jobs that haven't yet finished, or jobs that finished within the last 90 days. In
addition to the information returned in a job list, a single job's details include
information such as:

- The operation parameters.

- Details about the manifest.

- Information about the completion report, if you configured one when you
created the job.

- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you assigned
to run the job.

By viewing an individual job's details, you can access a job's entire configuration.
To view a job’s details, you can use the Amazon S3 console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
