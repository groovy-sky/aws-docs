# Configuring hybrid post-quantum TLS for your client

To use PQ-TLS with Amazon S3, you need to configure your client to support post-quantum key
exchange algorithms. Also ensure that your client supports the hybrid approach, which
combines traditional elliptic curve cryptography with post-quantum algorithms like
ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism).

The specific configuration depends on your client library and programming language. For
more information, see [Enabling hybrid post-quantum TLS](../../../payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/pqtls-details.md).

## Client configuration example: AWS SDK for Java 2

In this procedure, add a Maven dependency for the AWS Common Runtime HTTP Client. Next,
configure an HTTP client that prefers post-quantum TLS. Then, create an Amazon S3 client
that uses the HTTP client.

###### Note

The AWS Common Runtime HTTP Client, which has been available as a preview, became
generally available in February 2023. In that release, the `tlsCipherPreference`
class and the `tlsCipherPreference()` method parameter are replaced by the
`postQuantumTlsEnabled()` method parameter. If you were using this example
during the preview, you need to update your code.

1. Add the AWS Common Runtime client to your Maven dependencies. We recommend using the
    latest available version.

For example, this statement adds version `2.30.22` of the AWS Common
    Runtime client to your Maven dependencies.

```xml

<dependency>
       <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
       <artifactId>aws-crt-client</artifactId>
       <version>2.30.22</version>
</dependency>
```

2. To enable the hybrid post-quantum cipher suites, add the AWS SDK for Java 2.x to your project
    and initialize it. Then enable the hybrid post-quantum cipher suites on your HTTP client
    as shown in the following example.

This code uses the `postQuantumTlsEnabled()` method parameter to configure
    an [AWS common runtime HTTP\
    client](../../../../reference/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/http-configuration-crt.md) that prefers the recommended hybrid post-quantum cipher suite, ECDH with
    ML-KEM. Then it uses the configured HTTP client to build an instance of
    the Amazon S3 asynchronous client, [`S3AsyncClient`](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/s3/S3AsyncClient.html). After this code completes, all [Amazon S3 API](../api.md) requests on the `S3AsyncClient`
    instance use hybrid post-quantum TLS.

###### Important

As of v2.35.11, callers no longer need to set `.postQuantumTlsEnabled(true)`
to enable hybrid post-quantum TLS for your client. All versions newer than v2.35.11 enable post-quantum TLS by default.

```java

// Configure HTTP client
SdkAsyncHttpClient awsCrtHttpClient = AwsCrtAsyncHttpClient.builder()
             .postQuantumTlsEnabled(true)
             .build();

// Create the Amazon S3 async client
S3AsyncClient s3Async = S3AsyncClient.builder()
            .httpClient(awsCrtHttpClient)
            .build();
```

3. Test your Amazon S3 calls with hybrid post-quantum TLS.

When you call Amazon S3 API operations on the configured Amazon S3 client, your calls are
    transmitted to the Amazon S3 endpoint using hybrid post-quantum TLS. To test your
    configuration, call an Amazon S3 API, such as

    `ListBuckets`.

```

ListBucketsResponse reponse = s3Async.listBuckets();
```

### Test your hybrid post-quantum TLS configuration

Consider running the following tests with hybrid cipher suites on your applications that
call Amazon S3.

- Run load tests and benchmarks. The hybrid cipher suites perform differently than
traditional key exchange algorithms. You might need to adjust your connection timeouts
to allow for the longer handshake times. If you’re running inside an AWS Lambda function,
extend the execution timeout setting.

- Try connecting from different locations. Depending on the network path your request
takes, you might discover that intermediate hosts, proxies, or firewalls with deep
packet inspection (DPI) block the request. This might result from using the new cipher
suites in the [ClientHello](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) part of the TLS handshake, or from the larger key exchange
messages. If you have trouble resolving these issues, work with your security team or IT
administrators to update the relevant configuration and unblock the new TLS cipher
suites.
