# Setting up permissions for configuring metadata tables

To create a metadata table configuration, you must have the necessary AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
to both create and manage your metadata table configuration and to create and manage your metadata
tables and the table bucket where your metadata tables are stored.

To create and manage your metadata table configuration, you must have these permissions:

- `s3:CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` – This permission allows you to
create a metadata table configuration for your general purpose bucket. To create a metadata table
configuration, additional permissions, including S3 Tables permissions, are required, as explained
in the following sections. For a summary of the required permissions, see [Bucket operations and permissions](using-with-s3-policy-actions.md#using-with-s3-policy-actions-related-to-buckets).

- `s3:GetBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` – This permission allows you to
retrieve information about your metadata table configuration.

- `s3:DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` – This permission allows you to
delete your metadata table configuration.

- `s3:UpdateBucketMetadataJournalTableConfiguration` – This permission allows
you to update your journal table configuration to expire journal table records.

- `s3:UpdateBucketMetadataInventoryTableConfiguration` – This permission allows
you to update your inventory table configuration to enable or disable the inventory table. To update
an inventory table configuration, additional permissions, including S3 Tables permissions, are
required. For a list of the required permissions, see [Bucket operations and permissions](using-with-s3-policy-actions.md#using-with-s3-policy-actions-related-to-buckets).

###### Note

The `s3:CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration`,
`s3:GetBucketMetadataTableConfiguration`, and
`s3:DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` permissions are used for both V1 and V2
S3 Metadata configurations. For V2, the names of the corresponding API operations are
`CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration`, `GetBucketMetadataConfiguration`, and
`DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration`.

To create and work with tables and table buckets, you must have certain
`s3tables` permissions. At a minimum, to create a metadata table configuration,
you must have the following `s3tables` permissions:

- `s3tables:CreateTableBucket` – This permission allows you to create an AWS
managed table bucket. All metadata table configurations in your account and in the same Region are
stored in a single AWS managed table bucket named `aws-s3`. For more information, see
[How metadata tables work](metadata-tables-overview.md#metadata-tables-how-they-work) and [Working with AWS managed\
table buckets](s3-tables-aws-managed-buckets.md).

- `s3tables:CreateNamespace` – This permission allows you to create a namespace
in a table bucket. Metadata tables typically use the
`b_general_purpose_bucket_name` namespace. For more
information about metadata table namespaces, see [How metadata tables work](metadata-tables-overview.md#metadata-tables-how-they-work).

- `s3tables:CreateTable` – This permission allows you to create your metadata
tables.

- `s3tables:GetTable` – This permission allows you to retrieve information about
your metadata tables.

- `s3tables:PutTablePolicy` – This permission allows you to add or update your
metadata table policies.

- `s3tables:PutTableEncryption` – This permission allows you to set server-side
encryption for your metadata tables. Additional permissions are required if you want to encrypt your
metadata tables with server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). For more
information, see [Permissions for SSE-KMS](#metadata-kms-permissions).

- `kms:DescribeKey` – This permission allows you to retrieve information about a
KMS key.

- `s3tables:PutTableBucketPolicy` – This permission allows you to create or update a new table bucket policy.

For detailed information about all table and table bucket permissions, see [Access\
management for S3 Tables](s3-tables-setting-up.md).

###### Important

If you also want to integrate your table bucket with AWS analytics services so that you can query your metadata table, you need additional permissions. For more information, see [Integrating Amazon S3 Tables with AWS analytics services](s3-tables-integrating-aws.md).

###### Permissions for SSE-KMS

To encrypt your metadata tables with server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS),
you must have additional permissions.

1. The user or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role needs the following permissions. You can grant these
    permissions by using the IAM console: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

1. `s3tables:PutTableEncryption` to configure table encryption

2. `kms:DescribeKey` on the AWS KMS key used

2. On the resource policy for the KMS key, you need the following permissions. You can grant
    these permissions by using the AWS KMS console: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms).

1. Grant `kms:GenerateDataKey` permission to
    `metadata.s3.amazonaws.com` and
    `maintenance.s3tables.amazonaws.com`.

2. Grant `kms:Decrypt` permission to `metadata.s3.amazonaws.com` and
    `maintenance.s3tables.amazonaws.com`.

3. Grant `kms:DescribeKey` permission to the invoking AWS principal.

In addition to these permissions, make sure that the customer managed KMS key used to encrypt the
tables still exists, is active, is in the same Region as your general purpose bucket.

###### Example policy

To create and work with metadata tables and table buckets, you can use the following example policy.
In this policy, the general purpose bucket that you're applying the metadata table configuration to is
referred to as `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`. To use this policy, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your own information.

When you create your metadata table configuration, your metadata tables are stored in an AWS
managed table bucket. All metadata table configurations in your account and in the same Region are
stored in a single AWS managed table bucket named `aws-s3`.

            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

To query metadata tables, you can use the following example policy. If your metadata tables have
been encrypted with SSE-KMS, you will need the `kms:Decrypt` permission as shown. To use this
policy, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own
information.

```json

    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {

                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],

                "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/aws-s3",

            ]
        }
    ]
}
