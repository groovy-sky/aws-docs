# Best practices design patterns: optimizing Amazon S3 performance

Your applications can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request
performance when uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3. Amazon S3 automatically scales to high
request rates. For example, your application can achieve at least 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or
5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per partitioned Amazon S3 prefix. There are no limits to the
number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by using
parallelization. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize
reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second. Similarly, you
can scale write operations by writing to multiple prefixes. The scaling, in the case of both read and write operations, happens gradually and is not instantaneous, and actual performance will vary based on your specific workload characteristics, usage patterns, and system configuration.
While Amazon S3 is scaling to your new higher request rate, you may see some 503 (Slow Down) errors.
These errors will dissipate when the scaling is complete.
For more information about creating
and using prefixes, see [Organizing objects using prefixes](using-prefixes.md).

Some data lake applications on Amazon S3 scan millions or billions of objects for queries that
run over petabytes of data. These data lake applications achieve single-instance transfer rates
that maximize the network interface use for their [Amazon EC2](../../../ec2/index.md) instance, which can be up to 100 Gb/s on a single instance. These applications
then aggregate throughput across multiple instances to get multiple terabits per second.

Other applications are sensitive to latency, such as social media messaging applications.
These applications can achieve consistent small object latencies (and first-byte-out latencies
for larger objects) of roughly 100–200 milliseconds.

Other AWS services can also help accelerate performance for different application
architectures. For example, if you want higher transfer rates over a single HTTP connection or
single-digit millisecond latencies, use [Amazon CloudFront](../../../cloudfront/index.md) or [Amazon ElastiCache](../../../elasticache/index.md) for
caching with Amazon S3.

Additionally, if you want fast data transport over long distances between a client and an S3
bucket, use [Configuring fast, secure file transfers using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](transfer-acceleration.md).
Transfer Acceleration uses the globally distributed edge locations in CloudFront to accelerate data
transport over geographical distances. If your Amazon S3 workload uses server-side encryption with AWS KMS, see [AWS KMS Limits](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/limits.md)
in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide for information about the request rates supported for your use
case.

The following topics describe best practice guidelines and design patterns for optimizing
performance for applications that use Amazon S3.
Refer to the [Performance guidelines for Amazon S3](optimizing-performance-guidelines.md) and [Performance design patterns for Amazon S3](optimizing-performance-design-patterns.md) for the most current information
about performance optimization for Amazon S3.
