# Specifying server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)

To use server-side encryption with customer provided keys (SSE-C) first make sure that
SSE-C is not a blocked encryption type in your Amazon S3 general purpose bucket's default
encryption configuration. If blocked, you can enable this encryption type by
updating your default encryption configuration for the bucket. Then, you can use
SSE-C in your upload requests by passing the required headers. See [Amazon S3 actions that support writing data with SSE-C](#amazon-s3-actions-that-support-writing-data-with-sse-c), and make sure to include the
[S3 API headers required for SSE-C object encryption and decryption requests](#s3-api-headers-required-for-sse-c-object-encryption-and-decryption-requests).

When you upload an object specifying SSE-C, Amazon S3 uses the encryption key that you provide
to apply AES-256 encryption to your data. Amazon S3 then removes the encryption key from
memory. When you retrieve an object, you must provide the same encryption key as
part of your request. Amazon S3 first verifies that the encryption key that you provided
matches, and then it decrypts the object before returning the object data to you.

Before using SSE-C, make sure you have reviewed the [Considerations before using SSE-C](serversideencryptioncustomerkeys.md#considerations-before-using-sse-c).

###### Note

Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key that you provide. Instead, it stores a randomly salted Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) value of the encryption key to validate future requests. The salted HMAC value cannot be used to derive the value of the encryption key or to decrypt the contents of the encrypted object. That means if you lose the encryption key, you lose the object.

## SSE-C Actions and Required Headers

Specifying SSE-C on supported S3 APIs requires passing specific request parameters.

###### Note

The `PutBucketEncryption` API in
Amazon S3 is used to configure default server-side encryption for a bucket. However,
`PutBucketEncryption` does not support enabling SSE-C as a default encryption
method for a bucket. SSE-C is an object-level encryption method where you provide the encryption
key to Amazon S3 with each object upload or download request. Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt
or decrypt the object during the request and then discards the key. This means SSE-C is enabled
on a per-object basis, not as a default bucket setting.

### Amazon S3 actions that support writing data with SSE-C

You can request server-side encryption with customer provided keys (SSE-C) when writing
objects to a general purpose bucket by using the following API operations or actions:

- [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md)

- [CreateMultipartUpload](../api/api-createmultipartupload.md)

- [CompleteMultipartUpload](../api/api-completemultipartupload.md)

- [POST\
Object](../api/restobjectpost.md)

- [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md)

- [UploadPart](../api/api-uploadpart.md)

- [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md)

###### Note

S3 Replication supports objects that are encrypted
with SSE-C. For more information about replicating encrypted objects, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md).

### S3 API headers required for SSE-C object encryption and decryption requests

You must provide the following three API headers to encrypt or decrypt objects with SSE-C:

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
Use this header to specify the encryption algorithm. The header value must be AES256.

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
Use this header to provide the 256-bit, base64-encoded encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to encrypt or decrypt your data.

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`
Use this header to provide the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

### S3 API headers required for requests to copy source objects encrypted with SSE-C

You must provide the following three API headers to copy source objects encrypted with SSE-C:

- `x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
Include this header to specify the algorithm Amazon S3 should use to decrypt the source object. This value must be AES256.

- `x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key`
Include this header to provide the base64-encoded encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object. This encryption key must be the one that you provided Amazon S3 when you created the source object. Otherwise, Amazon S3 cannot decrypt the object.

- `x-amz-copy-source-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`
Include this header to provide the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321.

## Example bucket policy to enforce SSE-C encryption

To require SSE-C for all objects written to an Amazon S3 bucket, you can use a bucket policy.
For example, the following bucket policy denies upload object ( `s3:PutObject`)
permissions for all requests that don't include the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header requesting SSE-C.

```

{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PutObjectPolicy",
    "Statement": [
        {
"Sid": "RequireSSECObjectUploads",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
            "Condition": {
            "Null": {
              "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Important

If you use a bucket policy to require SSE-C on `s3:PutObject`, you
must include the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header in
all multipart upload requests (CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, and CompleteMultipartUpload).

## Presigned URLs and SSE-C

You can generate a presigned URL that can be used for operations such as uploading a new
object, retrieving an existing object, or retrieving object metadata. Presigned URLs
support SSE-C as follows:

- When creating a presigned URL, you must specify the algorithm by using the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header in the
signature calculation.

- When using the presigned URL to upload a new object, retrieve an existing object, or
retrieve only object metadata, you must provide all the encryption headers in
your client application's request.

###### Note

For non-SSE-C objects, you can generate a presigned URL and directly paste that URL into
a browser to access the data.

However, you cannot do this for SSE-C objects, because in addition to the presigned URL,
you also must include HTTP headers that are specific to SSE-C objects.
Therefore, you can use presigned URLs for SSE-C objects only
programmatically.

For more information about presigned URLs, see [Download and upload objects with presigned URLs](using-presigned-url.md).

## Making requests with SSE-C

At the time of object creation with the REST API, you can specify server-side encryption with
customer-provided keys (SSE-C). When you use SSE-C, you must provide encryption key
information using the [S3 API headers required for requests to copy source objects encrypted with SSE-C](#s3-api-headers-required-for-requests-to-copy-source-objects-encrypted-with-sse-c).
You can use AWS SDK wrapper libraries to add these headers to your request. If you need to, you can make the Amazon S3 REST API calls directly in your application.

###### Important

Before specifying server-side encryption with customer provided keys (SSE-C), make
sure that SSE-C encryption is not blocked for your general purpose bucket. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.md).

###### Note

You cannot use the Amazon S3 console to upload an
object and request SSE-C. You also cannot use the console to update (for example, change the
storage class or add metadata) an existing object stored using SSE-C. For more information, see [S3 API headers required for SSE-C object encryption and decryption requests](#s3-api-headers-required-for-sse-c-object-encryption-and-decryption-requests).

## Using the REST API

### Amazon S3 REST APIs that support SSE-C

The following Amazon S3 APIs support server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
keys (SSE-C).

- **GET operation** – When retrieving
objects using the GET API (see [GET Object](../api/restobjectget.md)), you can specify the request headers.

- **HEAD operation** – To retrieve object
metadata using the HEAD API (see [HEAD Object](../api/restobjecthead.md)), you can
specify these request headers.

- **PUT operation** – When uploading data
using the PUT Object API (see [PUT Object](../api/restobjectput.md)), you can specify these request headers.

- **Multipart Upload** – When uploading
large objects using the multipart upload API, you can specify these headers.
You specify these headers in the initiate request (see [Initiate Multipart\
Upload](../api/mpuploadinitiate.md)) and each subsequent part upload request (see [Upload Part](../api/mpuploaduploadpart.md) or
[UploadPartCopy](../api/mpuploaduploadpartcopy.md)). For each part upload request, the encryption information must be the
same as what you provided in the initiate multipart upload request.

- **POST operation** – When using a POST
operation to upload an object (see [POST Object](../api/restobjectpost.md)), instead of
the request headers, you provide the same information in the form
fields.

- **Copy operation** – When you copy an object
(see [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md)), you have
both a source object and a target object:

- If you want to specify the target object's encryption type, you must provide the `x-amz-server-side-encryption ` request header.

- If you want the target object encrypted using SSE-C, you must provide encryption information using the S3 API [S3 API headers required for SSE-C object encryption and decryption requests](#s3-api-headers-required-for-sse-c-object-encryption-and-decryption-requests).

- If the source object is encrypted using SSE-C, you must provide encryption key information using the S3 API headers [S3 API headers required for requests to copy source objects encrypted with SSE-C](#s3-api-headers-required-for-requests-to-copy-source-objects-encrypted-with-sse-c).

## Using the AWS SDKs to specify SSE-C for PUT, GET, Head, and Copy operations

The following examples show how to request server-side encryption with customer-provided keys
(SSE-C) for objects. The examples perform the following operations. Each operation shows how
to specify SSE-C-related headers in the request:

- Put object – Uploads an object and requests server-side
encryption using a customer-provided encryption key.

- Get object – Downloads the object uploaded in the
previous step. In the request, you provide the same encryption information you
provided when you uploaded the object. Amazon S3 needs this information to decrypt the
object so that it can return it to you.

- Get object metadata – Retrieves the object's metadata.
You provide the same encryption information used when the object was created.

- Copy object – Makes a copy of the previously-uploaded
object. Because the source object is stored using SSE-C, you must provide its
encryption information in your copy request. By default, Amazon S3 encrypts the copy of
the object only if you explicitly request it. This example directs Amazon S3 to store an
encrypted copy of the object.

Java

###### Note

This example shows how to upload an object in a single operation. When using the Multipart
Upload API to upload large objects, you provide encryption information in the same way
shown in this example. For examples of multipart uploads that use the AWS SDK for Java, see
[Uploading an object using multipart upload](mpu-upload-object.md).

To add the required encryption information, you include an `SSECustomerKey` in
your request. For more information about the `SSECustomerKey` class, see the
REST API section.

For instructions on creating and
testing a working sample, see [Getting\
Started](../../../../reference/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.md) in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide.

## Using the AWS SDKs to specify SSE-C for multipart uploads

The example in the preceding section shows how to request server-side encryption with
customer-provided key (SSE-C) in the PUT, GET, Head, and Copy operations. This section
describes other Amazon S3 APIs that support SSE-C.

Java

To upload large objects, you can use multipart upload APIs. For more information, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md). You can use either
high-level or low-level APIs to upload large objects. These APIs support encryption-related headers in the request.

- When using the high-level `TransferManager` API, you provide the
encryption-specific headers in the `PutObjectRequest`. For more information, see [Uploading an object using multipart upload](mpu-upload-object.md).

- When using the low-level API, you provide encryption-related information in the
`InitiateMultipartUploadRequest`, followed by identical
encryption information in each `UploadPartRequest`. You do not need to provide any
encryption-specific headers in your `CompleteMultipartUploadRequest`. For
examples, see [Using the AWS SDKs (low-level API)](mpu-upload-object.md#mpu-upload-low-level).

The following example uses `TransferManager` to create objects and shows how
to provide SSE-C related information. The example does the following:

- Creates an object using the `TransferManager.upload()` method. In the
`PutObjectRequest` instance, you provide encryption key
information in the request. Amazon S3 encrypts the object using the customer-provided key.

- Makes a copy of the object by calling the `TransferManager.copy()` method. The
example directs Amazon S3 to encrypt the object copy using a new `SSECustomerKey`. Because the source
object is encrypted using SSE-C, the `CopyObjectRequest` also
provides the encryption key of the source object so that Amazon S3 can decrypt the
object before copying it.

.NET

To upload large objects, you can use multipart upload API (see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md)). AWS SDK for .NET
provides both high-level or low-level APIs to upload large objects. These APIs support
encryption-related headers in the request.

- When using high-level `Transfer-Utility ` API, you provide the
encryption-specific headers in the `TransferUtilityUploadRequest` as
shown. For code examples, see [Uploading an object using multipart upload](mpu-upload-object.md).

```nohighlight

TransferUtilityUploadRequest request = new TransferUtilityUploadRequest()
{
      FilePath = filePath,
      BucketName = existingBucketName,
      Key = keyName,
      // Provide encryption information.
      ServerSideEncryptionCustomerMethod = ServerSideEncryptionCustomerMethod.AES256,
      ServerSideEncryptionCustomerProvidedKey = base64Key,
};
```

- When using the low-level API, you provide encryption-related information in the initiate
multipart upload request, followed by identical encryption information in
the subsequent upload part requests. You do not need to provide any
encryption-specific headers in your complete multipart upload request. For
examples, see [Using the AWS SDKs (low-level API)](mpu-upload-object.md#mpu-upload-low-level).

The following is a low-level multipart upload example that makes a copy of an existing
large object. In the example, the object to be copied is stored in Amazon S3
using SSE-C, and you want to save the target object also using SSE-C. In the
example, you do the following:

- Initiate a multipart upload request by providing an encryption key and related
information.

- Provide source and target object encryption keys and related information in the
`CopyPartRequest`.

- Obtain the size of the source object to be copied by retrieving the object
metadata.

- Upload the objects in 5 MB parts.
