# Referencing access points for directory buckets

After you create an access point, you can use it as an endpoint to preform object operations.
For access points for directory buckets, the access point alias is the same as the access point name. You can use the access point name instead of a bucket name for all data operations. For a list of these supported
operations, see [Object operations for access points for directory buckets](access-points-directory-buckets-service-api-support.md).

## Referring to access points by virtual-hosted-style URIs

Access points only support virtual-host-style addressing. Access points use the same format as directory bucket endpoints. For more information, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets](s3-express-regions-and-zones.md).

S3 access points don't support access through HTTP. Access points support only secure
access through HTTPS.
