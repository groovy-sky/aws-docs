# Checking object integrity for data at rest in Amazon S3

If you need to verify the content of datasets stored in Amazon S3, the S3 Batch Operations [Compute checksum](batch-ops-compute-checksums.md) operation calculates both full object or composite checksums for
objects at rest. The **Compute checksum** operation uses Batch Operations to
asynchronously calculate the checksum values for a group of objects and automatically
generates a consolidated integrity report, without creating new copies of your data, or
restoring or downloading any data.

With the **Compute checksum** operation, you can efficiently verify
billions of objects with a single job request. For each
**Compute checksum** job request, S3 calculates the checksum values,
and includes it in an automatically generated integrity report (also known as a completion
report). You can then use the completion report to validate the integrity of your
dataset.

The **Compute checksum** operation works with any object stored in S3, regardless of storage
class or object size. Whether you need to verify your objects as a data preservation best
practice, or meet compliance requirements, the **Compute checksum**
operation reduces the cost, time, and effort required for data validation by performing
checksum calculations at rest. For information about **Compute checksum**
pricing, see the **Management and insights** tab on [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

Then, you can use the output of the generated completion report to compare against the
checksum values that you’ve stored in your databases to verify that your datasets remain
intact over time. This approach helps you maintain end-to-end data integrity for business
and compliance needs. For example, you can use the **Compute checksum**
operation to submit a list of stored objects in S3 Glacier storage classes for annual
security audits. Additionally, the range of supported checksum algorithms allow you to
maintain continuity with the algorithms that are used in your applications.

## Using supported checksum algorithms

For data at rest, you can calculate checksums, using any of the supported checksum algorithms:

- CRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`): Supports the full object checksum type
only.

- CRC-32 ( `CRC32`): Supports both full object and composite checksum
types.

- CRC-32C ( `CRC32C`): Supports both full object and composite
checksum types.

- SHA-1 ( `SHA1`): Supports both full object and composite checksum
types.

- SHA-256 ( `SHA256`): Supports both full object and composite
checksum types.

- MD5 ( `MD5`): Supports both full object and composite checksum
types.

## Using **Compute checksum**

For objects stored in Amazon S3, you can use the **Compute checksum**
operation with S3 Batch Operations to check the content of stored data at rest. You can
[create a\
Compute checksum Batch Operations job](batch-ops-create-job.md) by using the Amazon S3
console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), REST API, or AWS SDK. When the
**Compute checksum** job finishes, you receive a completion
report. For more information about how to use the completion report, see [Tracking job status and completion reports](batch-ops-job-status.md).

Before creating your **Compute checksum** job, you must create an
S3 Batch Operations AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to grant Amazon S3 permissions to perform actions on
your behalf. You’ll need to grant permissions to read the manifest file and to write a
completion report to the S3 bucket. For more information, see [Compute checksums](batch-ops-compute-checksums.md).

###### To use the **Compute checksum** operation

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the
     currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region in which you
     want to create your job.

    ###### Note

    For copy operations, you must create the job in the same Region as
    the destination bucket. For all other operations, you must create
    the job in the same Region as the objects in the manifest.

03. Choose **Batch Operations** on the left navigation
     pane of the Amazon S3 console.

04. Choose **Create job**.

05. View the AWS Region where you want to create your job.

    ###### Note

    For copy operations, you must create the job in the same Region as
    the destination bucket. For all other operations, you must create
    the job in the same Region as the objects in the manifest.

06. Under **Manifest format**, choose the type of
     manifest object to use.

- If you choose **S3 inventory report**
**(manifest.json)**, enter the path to the
`manifest.json` object, and (optionally) the
**Manifest object version ID** if you want
to use a specific object version. Alternatively, you can choose
**Browse S3** and choose the manifest JSON
file, which auto populates all the manifest object field
entries.

- If you choose **CSV**, choose the Manifest
location type, Then, either enter the path to a CSV-formatted
manifest object or choose **Browse S3** to
select a manifest object. The manifest object must follow the
format described in the console. If you want to use a specific
version of the manifest object, then you can also specify the
object version ID.

- If you choose **Create manifest using S3 Replication**
**configuration**, a list of objects will be
generated using the replication configuration and optionally
saved to the destination you choose. When using a replication
configuration to generate the manifest, the only operation that
will be available is **Replicate**.

07. Choose **Next**.

08. Under **Operation**, choose the **Compute**
    **checksum** operation to calculate the checksums on all
     objects listed in the manifest. Choose the **Checksum**
    **type** and **Checksum function** for your
     job. Then, choose **Next**.

09. Fill out the information for **Configure additional options**, and then
     choose **Next**.

10. On the **Configure additional options** page, fill
     out the information for your **Compute checksum**
     job.

    ###### Note

    Under **Completion report**, make sure to confirm
    the acknowledgement statement. This acknowledgement statement
    confirms that you understand that the completion report contains
    checksum values, which are used to verify the integrity of data
    stored in Amazon S3. Therefore, the completion report should be shared
    with caution. Also, be aware that if you're creating a
    Compute checksum request and you specify an external account
    owner's bucket location to store your completion report, make sure
    to specify the AWS account ID of the external bucket owner.

11. Choose **Next**.

12. On the **Review** page, review and confirm your
     settings.

13. (Optional) If you need to make changes, choose
     **Previous** to go back to the previous page, or
     choose **Edit** to update a specific step.

14. After you've confirmed your changes, choose **Create**
    **job**.

###### To list and monitor the progress of all **Compute checksum** requests

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Batch**
**Operations**.

3. On the **Batch Operations** page, you can review job
    details such as the job priority, job completion rate, and total
    objects.

4. If you want to manage or clone a specific **Compute**
**checksum** job, click on the **Job ID** to
    review additional job information.

5. On the specific **Compute checksum** job page, review
    the job details.

Each batch operations job progresses through different [job statuses](batch-ops-job-status.md#batch-ops-job-status-table). You can also [enable\
AWS CloudTrail events](enable-cloudtrail-logging-for-s3.md) in the S3 console to receive alerts on any job state
changes. For active jobs, you can review the running job and completion rate on
the **Job details** page.

###### Example: Creating a Compute checksum job

The following example shows you how to create a
**Compute checksum** job (as part of a
**Create job** request), and how to specify
a manifest:

```java

// Required parameters
String accountId = "111122223333";
String roleArn = "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/BatchOperations";
String manifestArn = "arn:aws:s3:::my_manifests/manifest.csv";
String manifestEtag = "60e460c9d1046e73f7dde5043ac3ae85";
String reportBucketArn = "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-completion-report-bucket";
String reportExpectedBucketOwner = "111122223333";
String reportPrefix = "demo-report";

// Job Operation
S3ComputeObjectChecksumOperation s3ComputeObjectChecksum = S3ComputeObjectChecksumOperation.builder()
    .checksumAlgorithm(ComputeObjectChecksumAlgorithm.CRC64)
    .checksumType(ComputeObjectChecksumType.COMPOSITE)
    .build();

JobOperation operation = JobOperation.builder()
    .s3ComputeObjectChecksum(s3ComputeObjectChecksum)
    .build();

// Job Manifest
JobManifestLocation location = JobManifestLocation.builder()
    .eTag(manifestEtag)
    .objectArn(manifestArn)
    .build();

JobManifestSpec spec = JobManifestSpec.builder()
    .format(JobManifestFormat.S3_BATCH_OPERATIONS_CSV_20180820)
    .fields(Arrays.asList(JobManifestFieldName.BUCKET, JobManifestFieldName.KEY))
    .build();

JobManifest manifest = JobManifest.builder()
    .location(location)
    .spec(spec)
    .build();

// Completion Report
JobReport report = JobReport.builder()
    .bucket(reportBucketArn)
    .enabled(true) // Must be true
    .expectedBucketOwner(reportExpectedBucketOwner)
    .format(JobReportFormat.REPORT_CSV_20180820)
    .prefix(reportPrefix)
    .reportScope(JobReportScope.ALL_TASKS)
    .build();

// Create Job Request
CreateJobRequest request = CreateJobRequest.builder()
    .accountId(accountId)
    .confirmationRequired(false)
    .manifest(manifest)
    .operation(operation)
    .priority(10)
    .report(report)
    .roleArn(roleArn);

// Create the client
S3ControlClient client = S3ControlClient.builder()
    .credentialsProvider(new ProfileCredentialsProvider())
    .region(Region.US_EAST_1)
    .build();

// Send the request
try {
    CreateJobResponse response = client.createJob(request);
    System.out.println(response);
} catch (AwsServiceException e) {
    System.out.println("AwsServiceException: " + e.getMessage());
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
} catch (SdkClientException e) {
    System.out.println("SdkClientException: " + e.getMessage());
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```

###### Example: Viewing Compute checksum job details

The following example shows how you can specify a job ID to
view the job details (such as the job completion rate) for a
**Compute checksum** job request:

```

DescribeJobRequest request = DescribeJobRequest.builder()
        .accountId("1234567890")
        .jobId("a16217a1-e082-48e5-b04f-31fac3a66b13")
        .build();
```

You can use the [create-job](../../../cli/latest/reference/s3control/create-job.md) command to create a new batch
operations job, and to provide the list of objects. Then, specify the checksum
algorithm and checksum type, and the destination bucket where you want to save
the **Compute checksum** report. The following example creates
an S3 Batch Operations **Compute checksum** job by using an S3
generated manifest for the AWS account
`111122223333`.

To use this command, replace the `user input
                        placeholders` with your own information:

```nohighlight

aws s3control create-job \
    --account-id 111122223333 \
    --manifest '{"Spec":{"Format":"S3BatchOperations_CSV_20180820","Fields":["Bucket","Key"]},"Location":{"ObjectArn":"arn:aws:s3:::my-manifest-bucket/manifest.csv","ETag":"e0e8bfc50e0f0c5d5a1a5f0e0e8bfc50"}}' \
    --manifest-generator '{
        "S3JobManifestGenerator": {
          "ExpectedBucketOwner": "111122223333",
          "SourceBucket": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket",
          "EnableManifestOutput": true,
          "ManifestOutputLocation": {
            "ExpectedManifestBucketOwner": "111122223333",
            "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-manifest-bucket",
            "ManifestPrefix": "prefix",
            "ManifestFormat": "S3InventoryReport_CSV_20211130"
          },
          "Filter": {
            "CreatedAfter": "2023-09-01",
            "CreatedBefore": "2023-10-01",
            "KeyNameConstraint": {
              "MatchAnyPrefix": [
                "prefix"
              ],
              "MatchAnySuffix": [
                "suffix"
              ]
            },
            "ObjectSizeGreaterThanBytes": 100,
            "ObjectSizeLessThanBytes": 200,
            "MatchAnyStorageClass": [
              "STANDARD",
              "STANDARD_IA"
            ]
          }
        }
      }' \
    --operation '{"S3ComputeObjectChecksum":{"ChecksumAlgorithm":"CRC64NVME","ChecksumType":"FULL_OBJECT"}}' \
    --report '{"Bucket":"arn:aws:s3:::my-report-bucket","Format":"Report_CSV_20180820","Enabled":true,"Prefix":"batch-op-reports/","ReportScope":"AllTasks","ExpectedBucketOwner":"111122223333"}' \
    --priority 10 \
    --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3BatchJobRole \
    --client-request-token 6e023a7e-4820-4654-8c81-7247361aeb73 \
    --description "Compute object checksums" \
    --region us-west-2
```

After you submit the **Compute checksum** job, you receive
the job ID as a response and it appears on the S3 Batch Operations list page. Amazon S3
processes the list of objects and calculates checksums for each object. After
the job finishes, S3 provides a consolidated
**Compute checksum** report at the specified
destination.

To monitor the progress of your **Compute checksum** job,
use the [describe-job](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3control/describe-job.html) command. This command checks the
status of the specified batch operations job. To use this command, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your own
information.

For example:

```nohighlight

aws s3control describe-job --account-id 111122223333 --job-id 1234567890abcdef0
```

To [obtain a\
list](batch-ops-list-jobs.md) of all **Active** and
**Complete** batch operations jobs, see [Listing\
jobs](batch-ops-list-jobs.md) or [list-jobs](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3control/list-jobs.html) in the _AWS CLI Command_
_Reference_.

You can send REST requests to verify object integrity with **Compute**
**checksum** using [CreateJob](../api/api-control-createjob.md). You
can monitor the progress of **Compute checksum** requests by
sending REST requests to the [DescribeJob](../api/api-control-describejob.md)
API operation. Each batch operations job progresses through the following
statuses:

- **NEW**

- **PREPARING**

- **READY**

- **ACTIVE**

- **PAUSING**

- **PAUSED**

- **COMPLETE**

- **CANCELLING**

- **FAILED**

The API response notifies you of the current job state.
