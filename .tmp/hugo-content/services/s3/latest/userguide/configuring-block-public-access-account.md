# Configuring block public access settings for your account

###### Important

If your account is managed by an organization-level Block Public Access policy, you cannot
modify these account-level settings. Organization-level policies override
account-level configurations. For more information on centralized management
options, see [S3 policy](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-policies-s3.md) in the _AWS Organizations user_
_guide_.

Amazon S3 Block Public Access provides settings for access points, buckets, organizations,
and accounts to help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources. By default, new
buckets, access points, and objects do not allow public access. For more information,
see [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](access-control-block-public-access.md).

###### Note

Account level settings override settings on individual objects. Configuring your account to
block public access will override any public access settings made to individual
objects within your account. When organization-level policies are active,
account-level settings automatically inherit from the organization policy and cannot
be modified directly.

You can use the S3 console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and REST API to configure block public access
settings for all the buckets in your account when not managed by organization policies.
For more information, see the sections below.

To configure block public access settings for your buckets, see [Configuring block public access settings for your S3 buckets](configuring-block-public-access-bucket.md). For information about
access points, see [Performing block public access operations on an access point](access-control-block-public-access.md#access-control-block-public-access-examples-access-point).

Amazon S3 block public access prevents the application of any settings that allow public access
to data within S3 buckets. This section describes how to edit block public access settings for
all the S3 buckets in your AWS account. For more information about blocking public access, see [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](access-control-block-public-access.md).

###### To edit block public access settings for all the S3 buckets in an AWS account

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. Choose **Block Public Access settings for this account**.

3. Choose **Edit** to change the block public access settings for all the
    buckets in your AWS account.

4. Choose the settings that you want to change, and then choose
    **Save changes**.

5. When you're asked for confirmation, enter `confirm`. Then choose
    **Confirm** to save your changes.

If you receive an error message that says, "This account does not allow changes to its
account-level S3 Block Public Access settings due to an organizational S3 Block Public Access
policy in effect," your account is managed by organization-level policies. Contact your
organization administrator to modify these settings.

You can use Amazon S3 Block Public Access through the AWS CLI. For more information
about setting up and using the AWS CLI, see [What is the AWS Command Line Interface?](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.md)

**Account**

- To perform block public access operations on an account, use the AWS CLI
service `s3control`. The account-level operations that use
this service are as follows:

- `PutPublicAccessBlock` (for an account)

- `GetPublicAccessBlock` (for an account)

- `DeletePublicAccessBlock` (for an account)

###### Note

`PutPublicAccessBlock` and `DeletePublicAccessBlock` operations
will return an "Access Denied" error when the account is managed by
organization-level policies. Account-level `GetPublicAccessBlock`
operations will return the enforced organization-level policy if
present.

For additional information and examples, see [put-public-access-block](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3control/put-public-access-block.html) in the _AWS CLI_
_Reference_.

Java

The following examples show you how to use Amazon S3 Block Public
Access with the AWS SDK for Java to put a public access block
configuration on an Amazon S3 account.

###### Note

`PutPublicAccessBlock` and
`DeletePublicAccessBlock` operations will fail
with an "Access Denied" error if the account is managed by
organization-level policies.

```java

AWSS3ControlClientBuilder controlClientBuilder = AWSS3ControlClientBuilder.standard();
controlClientBuilder.setRegion(<region>);
controlClientBuilder.setCredentials(<credentials>);

AWSS3Control client = controlClientBuilder.build();
client.putPublicAccessBlock(new PutPublicAccessBlockRequest()
		.withAccountId(<account-id>)
		.withPublicAccessBlockConfiguration(new PublicAccessBlockConfiguration()
				.withIgnorePublicAcls(<value>)
				.withBlockPublicAcls(<value>)
				.withBlockPublicPolicy(<value>)
				.withRestrictPublicBuckets(<value>)));

```

###### Important

This example pertains only to account-level operations, which
use the `AWSS3Control` client class. For bucket-level
operations, see the preceding example.

Other SDKs

For information about using the other AWS SDKs, see [Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDKs](../../../../reference/amazons3/latest/api/sdk-general-information-section.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

For information about using Amazon S3 Block Public Access through the REST APIs,
see the following topics in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

- Account-level operations

- [PutPublicAccessBlock](../api/api-putpublicaccessblock.md) \- Fails
when account is managed by organization policies

- [GetPublicAccessBlock](../api/api-getpublicaccessblock.md) \- Returns
effective configuration including organization policies.

- [DeletePublicAccessBlock](../api/api-deletepublicaccessblock.md) \- Fails
when account is managed by organization policies.

You'll see following error message for restricted operations: "This account
does not allow changes to its account-level S3 Block Public Access settings due
to an organizational S3 Block Public Access policy in effect."
