# Registering a delegated administrator for S3 Storage Lens

You can create organization-level dashboards by using your organization’s management
account or delegated administrator accounts. Delegated administrator accounts allow other
accounts besides your management account to create organization-level dashboards. Only the
management account of an organization can register and deregister other accounts as
delegated administrators for the organization.

After enabling trusted access, you can register delegate administrator access to
accounts in your organization by using the AWS Organizations REST API, AWS CLI,
or SDKs from the [management account](../../../managedservices/latest/userguide/management-account.md). (For more information, see [RegisterDelegatedAdministrator](../../../../reference/organizations/latest/apireference/api-registerdelegatedadministrator.md) in the
_AWS Organizations API Reference_.) When an account is registered as a delegated administrator,
the account receives authorization to access all read-only AWS Organizations API operations. This
provides visibility to the members and structures of your organization so that they can
create S3 Storage Lens dashboards on your behalf.

###### Note

Before you can designate a delegated administrator by using the AWS Organizations REST API, AWS CLI,
or SDKs, you must call the [EnableAWSServiceAccess](../../../../reference/organizations/latest/apireference/api-enableawsserviceaccess.md) operation.

###### To register delegated administrators for S3 Storage Lens
