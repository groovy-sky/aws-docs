# Authenticating and authorizing for directory buckets in Local Zones

Directory buckets in Local Zones support both AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authorization and session-based
authorization. For more information about authentication and authorization for
directory buckets, see [Authenticating and authorizing requests](s3-express-authenticating-authorizing.md).

## Resources

Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for directory buckets contain the
`s3express` namespace, the AWS parent Region, the AWS account ID, and
the directory bucket name which includes the Zone ID. To access and perform actions on
your directory bucket, you must use the following ARN format:

```nohighlight

arn:aws:s3express:region-code:account-id:bucket/bucket-base-name--ZoneID--x-s3
```

For directory buckets in a Local Zone, the Zone ID is the ID of the Local Zone. For more
information about directory buckets in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md). For more information about ARNs, see [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-arns.md)
in the _IAM User Guide_. For more information about resources, see
[IAM JSON\
Policy Elements: Resource](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-elements-resource.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Condition keys for directory buckets in Local Zones

In Local Zones, you can use all of these [condition keys](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-amazons3express.md#amazons3express-policy-keys) in your IAM policies.
Additionally, to create a data perimeter around your Local Zone network border groups, you can
use the condition key `s3express:AllAccessRestrictedToLocalZoneGroup` to deny
all requests from outside the groups.

The following condition key can be used to further refine the conditions under which an IAM policy statement applies. For a complete list of API
operations, policy actions, and condition keys that are supported by directory buckets,
see [Policy actions for directory buckets](s3-express-security-iam.md#s3-express-security-iam-actions).

###### Note

The following condition key only applies to Local Zones and isn't supported in Availability Zones and AWS Regions.

API operationsPolicy actionsDescriptionCondition keyDescriptionType[Zonal\
endpoint API operations](s3-express-apis.md)`s3express:CreateSession`

Grants permission to create a session token, which is used for
granting access to all Zonal endpoint API operations, such as
`CreateSession`, `HeadBucket`,
`CopyObject`, `PutObject`, and
`GetObject`.

`s3express:AllAccessRestrictedToLocalZoneGroup`

Filters all access to the bucket unless the request originates from the AWS Local Zone network
border groups provided in this condition key.

**Values:**
Local Zone network border group value

`String`

## Example policies

To
restrict object access to requests from within a data residency boundary that you define
(specifically, a Local Zone Group which is a set of Local Zones parented to the same
AWS Region), you can set any of the following policies:

- The service control policy (SCP). For information about SCPs, see [Service\
control policies (SCPs)](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-policies-scps.md) in the
_AWS Organizations User Guide_.

- The IAM identity-based policy for the IAM role.

- The VPC endpoint policy. For more information about the VPC endpoint policies,
see [Control access to VPC\
endpoints using endpoint policies](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.md) in the
_AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

- The S3 bucket policy.

###### Note

The condition key `s3express:AllAccessRestrictedToLocalZoneGroup` doesn't support access from an on-premises environment.
To support the access from an on-premises environment, you must add
the source IP to the policies. For more information, see [aws:SourceIp](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourceip) in the IAM User Guide.
