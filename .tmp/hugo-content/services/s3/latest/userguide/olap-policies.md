# Configuring IAM policies for Object Lambda Access Points

###### Note

As of November 7th, 2025, S3 Object Lambda is available only to existing customers that are currently using the service as well as to select AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. For capabilities similar to S3 Object Lambda, learn more here - [Amazon S3 Object Lambda availability change](amazons3-ol-change.md).

Amazon S3 access points support AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resource policies that you can use to control the use
of the access point by resource, user, or other conditions. You can control access through an optional
resource policy on your Object Lambda Access Point, or a resource policy on supporting access point. For step-by-step examples, see [Tutorial: Transforming data for your application with S3 Object Lambda](tutorial-s3-object-lambda-uppercase.md) and [Tutorial: Detecting and redacting PII data with S3 Object Lambda and Amazon Comprehend](tutorial-s3-object-lambda-redact-pii.md).

The following four resources must have permissions granted to work with Object Lambda Access Points:

- The IAM identity, such as user or role. For more information about IAM identities and best practices, see
[IAM identities (users, user groups, and roles)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- The standard access point connected to an underlying data source such as an S3 bucket or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume. When you're working with Object Lambda Access Points, this
standard access point is known as a _supporting access point_.

- The Object Lambda Access Point.

- The AWS Lambda function.

###### Important

Before you save your policy, make sure to resolve security warnings, errors, general
warnings, and suggestions from AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer. IAM Access Analyzer runs policy checks to
validate your policy against IAM [policy grammar](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-grammar.md) and [best\
practices](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md). These checks generate findings and provide actionable recommendations to
help you author policies that are functional and conform to security best practices.

To learn more about validating policies by using IAM Access Analyzer, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy\
validation](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-policy-validation.md) in the _IAM User Guide_. To view a
list of the warnings, errors, and suggestions that are returned by IAM Access Analyzer, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy check\
reference](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks.md).

The following policy examples assume that you have the following resources:

- An Amazon S3 bucket with the following Amazon Resource Name (ARN):

`arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`

- An Amazon S3 standard access point on this bucket with the following ARN:

`arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:111122223333:accesspoint/my-access-point`

- An Object Lambda Access Point with the following ARN:

`arn:aws:s3-object-lambda:us-east-1:111122223333:accesspoint/my-object-lambda-ap`

- An AWS Lambda function with the following ARN:

`arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111122223333:function:MyObjectLambdaFunction`

###### Note

If you're using a Lambda function from your account, you must include the specific function version
in your policy statement. In the following example ARN, the version is indicated by `1`:

`arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111122223333:function:MyObjectLambdaFunction:1`

Lambda doesn't support adding IAM policies to the version `$LATEST`. For more information about Lambda function versions, see [Lambda function versions](../../../lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.md) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

###### Example– Bucket policy that delegates access control to standard access points

The following S3 bucket policy example delegates access control for a bucket to the
bucket's standard access points. This policy allows full access to all access points that are owned by the
bucket owner's account. Thus, all access to this bucket is controlled by the policies that are
attached to its access points. Users can read from the bucket only through an access point, which means that
operations can be invoked only through access points. For more information, see [Delegating access control to access points](access-points-policies.md#access-points-delegating-control).

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement" : [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal" : { "AWS":"account-ARN"},
        "Action" : "*",
        "Resource" : [
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
        ],
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals" : { "s3:DataAccessPointAccount" : "Bucket owner's account ID" }
        }
    }]
}

```

###### Example– IAM policy that grants a user the necessary permissions to use an Object Lambda Access Point

The following IAM policy grants a user permissions to the Lambda function, the standard
access point, and the Object Lambda Access Point.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowLambdaInvocation",
      "Action": [
        "lambda:InvokeFunction"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111122223333:function:MyObjectLambdaFunction:1",
      "Condition": {
        "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {
          "aws:CalledVia": [
            "s3-object-lambda.amazonaws.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowStandardAccessPointAccess",
      "Action": [

      "Condition": {
        "ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {
          "aws:CalledVia": [
            "s3-object-lambda.amazonaws.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowObjectLambdaAccess",
      "Action": [
        "s3-object-lambda:Get*",
        "s3-object-lambda:List*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3-object-lambda:us-east-1:111122223333:accesspoint/my-object-lambda-ap"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Enable permissions for Lambda execution roles

When `GET` requests are made to an Object Lambda Access Point, your Lambda function needs permission
to send data to S3 Object Lambda Access Point. This permission is provided by enabling the
`s3-object-lambda:WriteGetObjectResponse` permission on your Lambda function's
execution role. You can create a new execution role or update an existing one.

###### Note

Your function needs the `s3-object-lambda:WriteGetObjectResponse` permission
only if you're making a `GET` request.

###### To create an execution role in the IAM console

01. Open the IAM console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

03. Choose **Create role**.

04. Under **Common use cases**, choose **Lambda**.

05. Choose **Next**.

06. On the **Add permissions** page, search for the AWS managed policy
     [`AmazonS3ObjectLambdaExecutionRolePolicy`](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home), and then select the
     check box beside the policy name.

    This policy should contain the `s3-object-lambda:WriteGetObjectResponse` Action.

07. Choose **Next**.

08. On the **Name, review, and create** page, for **Role**
    **name**, enter `s3-object-lambda-role`.

09. (Optional) Add a description and tags for this role.

10. Choose **Create role**.

11. Apply the newly created `s3-object-lambda-role` as your Lambda
     function's execution role. This can be done during or after Lambda function creation in the Lambda console.

For more information about execution roles, see [Lambda execution role](../../../lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.md) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

## Using context keys with Object Lambda Access Points

S3 Object Lambda will evaluate context keys such as `s3-object-lambda:TlsVersion` or
`s3-object-lambda:AuthType` that are related to the connection or signing of the
request. All other context keys, such as `s3:prefix`, are evaluated by Amazon S3.
