# Hosting a static website using Amazon S3

You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a _static_ website,
individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side
scripts.

###### Note

We recommend that you use [AWS Amplify Hosting](../../../amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.md) to
host static website content stored on S3. Amplify Hosting is a fully managed service
that makes it easy to deploy your websites on a globally available content delivery
network (CDN) powered by Amazon CloudFront, allowing secure static website hosting.

With AWS Amplify Hosting, you can select the location of your objects within your
general purpose bucket, deploy your content to a managed CDN, and generate a public
HTTPS URL for your website to be accessible anywhere. For more information about Amplify
Hosting, see [Deploying a static\
website to AWS Amplify Hosting from an S3 general purpose bucket](website-hosting-amplify.md) and
[Deploying a static\
website from S3 using the Amplify console](../../../amplify/latest/userguide/deploy-from-amplify-console.md) in the _AWS Amplify_
_Console User Guide_.

For more information about hosting a static website on Amazon S3, including instructions and
step-by-step walkthroughs, see the following topics.

###### Important

If the bucket that you're using to host your static website has been encrypted using server-side
encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), you must create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve your
website because SSE-KMS doesn't support anonymous users. When you create your CloudFront distribution, you
must use origin access control (OAC) instead of origin access identity (OAI) to secure the origin. OAI
doesn't support SSE-KMS, so you must use OAC instead.

For more information about OAC, see [Restrict\
access to an Amazon S3 origin](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_. For a tutorial that shows
how to host a static website using Amazon CloudFront, see [Tutorial: Hosting on-demand streaming video with Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53](tutorial-s3-cloudfront-route53-video-streaming.md).
