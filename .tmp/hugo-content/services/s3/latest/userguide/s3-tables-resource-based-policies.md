# Resource-based policies for S3 Tables

S3 Tables provides resource-based policies for managing access to table buckets and
tables: table bucket policies and table policies. You can use a table bucket policy to grant
API access permissions at the table bucket, namespace, or table-level. The permissions
attached to the table bucket can apply to all tables in the bucket or to specific tables in
the bucket, depending on the policy definition. You can use a table policy to grant
permissions at the table-level.

When S3 Tables receives a request, it first verifies that the requester has the necessary
permissions. It evaluates all the relevant access policies, user policies, and
resource-based policies in deciding whether to authorize the request (IAM user policy,
IAM role policy, table bucket policy, and table policy). For example, if a table bucket
policy grants a user permissions to perform all actions on the tables in the bucket
(including `DeleteTable`), but an individual table has a table policy that denies
the `DeleteTable` action for all users, then the user cannot delete the
table.

The following topic includes examples of table and table bucket policies. To use these policies,
replace the `user input placeholders` with your own
information.

###### Note

- Every policy that grants permissions to modify tables should include permissions
for `GetTableMetadataLocation` to access the table root file.
For more information, see [`GetTableMetadataLocation`](../api/api-s3tablebuckets-gettablemetadatalocation.md).

- Every time that you perform a write or delete activity on your table, include
permissions to `UpdateTableMetadataLocation` in your access
policy.

- We recommend using a table bucket policy for governing access to bucket-level
actions and a table policy for governing access to table-level actions.
In cases where you want to define the same set of permissions across
multiple tables, then we recommend using a table bucket policy.

## Example 1: Table bucket policy allows access to `PutBucketMaintenanceConfiguration` for buckets in an account

The following example table bucket policy allows the IAM `data steward` to delete unreferenced objects for all the buckets in an account by allowing access to `PutBucketMaintenanceConfiguration`.

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/datasteward"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3tables:PutTableBucketMaintenanceConfiguration"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example 2: Table bucket policy to allows read (SELECT) access to tables stored in the `hr` namespace

The following an example table bucket policy allows Jane, a user from
AWS account ID `123456789012` to access tables stored in the `hr` namespace in a
table bucket.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Jane"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3tables:GetTableData",
                "s3tables:GetTableMetadataLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket/table/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "s3tables:namespace": "hr"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example 3: Table policy to allow user to delete a table

The following example table policy that allows the IAM role `data steward` to delete a table.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "DeleteTable",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/datasteward"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3tables:DeleteTable",
                "s3tables:UpdateTableMetadataLocation",
                "s3tables:PutTableData",
                "s3tables:GetTableMetadataLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/table/tableUUID"
        }
    ]
}
