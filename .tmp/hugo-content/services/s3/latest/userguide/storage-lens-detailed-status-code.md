# Using S3 Storage Lens metrics to improve performance

If you have [S3 Storage Lens advanced\
metrics](storage-lens-basics-metrics-recommendations.md#storage_lens_basics_metrics_selection) enabled, you can use detailed status-code metrics to get counts for
successful or failed requests. You can use this information to troubleshoot access or
performance issues. Detailed status-code metrics show counts for HTTP status codes, such as
403 Forbidden and 503 Service Unavailable. You can examine overall trends for detailed
status-code metrics across S3 buckets, accounts, and organizations. Then, you can drill down
into bucket-level metrics to identify workloads that are currently accessing these buckets
and causing errors.

For example, you can look at the **403 Forbidden error count** metric to
identify workloads that are accessing buckets without the correct permissions applied. After
you've identified these workloads, you can do a deep dive outside of S3 Storage Lens to
troubleshoot your 403 Forbidden errors.

This example shows you how to do a trend analysis for the 403 Forbidden error by using the
**403 Forbidden error count** and the **% 403 Forbidden**
**errors** metrics. You can use these metrics to identify workloads that are
accessing buckets without the correct permissions applied. You can do a similar trend
analysis for any of the other **Detailed status code metrics**. For more
information, see [Amazon S3 Storage Lens metrics glossary](storage-lens-metrics-glossary.md).

###### Prerequisite

To see **Detailed status code metrics** in your S3 Storage Lens dashboard,
you must enable S3 Storage Lens **Advanced metrics and recommendations**, and
then select **Detailed status code metrics**. For more information, see
[Using the S3 console](storage-lens-editing.md#storage_lens_console_editing).

- [Step 2: Analyze error counts by bucket](#storage-lens-detailed-status-code-step2)

- [Step 3: Troubleshoot errors](#storage-lens-detailed-status-code-step3)

## Step 1: Do a trend analysis for an individual HTTP status code

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
    **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name of the dashboard
    that you want to view.

4. In the **Trends and distributions** section, for
    **Primary metric**, choose **403 Forbidden error**
**count** from the **Detailed status codes**
    category. For **Secondary metric**, choose **% 403**
**Forbidden errors**.

5. Scroll down to the **Top N overview for _date_** section. For **Metrics**,
    choose **403 Forbidden error count** or **% 403**
**Forbidden errors** from the **Detailed status**
**codes** category.

The **Top N overview for _date_** section updates to display the top 403 Forbidden
    error counts by account, AWS Region, and bucket.

## Step 2: Analyze error counts by bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
    **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name of the dashboard
    that you want to view.

4. In your Storage Lens dashboard, choose the **Bucket**
    tab.

5. Scroll down to the **Buckets** section. For **Metrics**
**categories**, select **Detailed status code**
    metrics. Then clear **Summary**.

The **Buckets** list updates to display all the available
    detailed status code metrics. You can use this information to see which buckets
    have a large proportion of certain HTTP status codes and which status codes are
    common across buckets.

6. To filter the **Buckets** list to display only specific
    detailed status-code metrics, choose the preferences icon (![A screenshot that shows the preferences icon in the S3 Storage Lens dashboard.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/preferences.png)).

7. Clear the toggles for any detailed status-code metrics that you don't want to
    view in the **Buckets** list.

8. (Optional) Under **Page size**, choose the number of buckets
    to display in the list.

9. Choose **Confirm**.

The **Buckets** list displays error count metrics for the
    number of buckets that you specified. You can use this information to identify
    specific buckets that are experiencing many errors and troubleshoot errors by
    bucket.

## Step 3: Troubleshoot errors

After you identify buckets with a high proportion of specific HTTP status codes, you
can troubleshoot these errors. For more information, see the following:
