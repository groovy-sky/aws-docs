# Using EventBridge for S3 Replication on Outposts

Amazon S3 on Outposts is integrated with Amazon EventBridge and uses the `s3-outposts`
namespace. EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that you can use to connect your
applications with data from a variety of sources. For more information, see [What is\
Amazon EventBridge?](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.md) in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

To assist in troubleshooting any replication configuration issues, you can set up Amazon EventBridge
to receive notifications about replication failure events. EventBridge can notify you in instances
when objects don't replicate to their destination Outposts. For more information about the
current state of an object that's being replicated, see [Replication status overview](manage-outposts-replication.md#outposts-replication-status-overview).

Whenever certain events happen in your Outposts bucket, S3 on Outposts can send events to
EventBridge. Unlike other destinations, you don't need to select which event types that you want to
deliver. You can also use EventBridge rules to route events to additional targets. After EventBridge is
enabled, S3 on Outposts sends all of the following events to EventBridge.

Event typeDescription Namespace

`OperationFailedReplication`

The replication of an object within a replication rule failed. For
more information about S3 Replication on Outposts failure reasons, see [Using EventBridge to view S3 Replication on Outposts failure reasons](#outposts-replication-failure-codes).

`s3-outposts`

## Using EventBridge to view S3 Replication on Outposts failure reasons

The following table lists S3 Replication on Outposts failure reasons. You can configure an EventBridge
rule to publish and view the failure reason through Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS), AWS Lambda, or Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For more information about the permissions that are
required to use these resources for EventBridge, see [Using resource-based\
policies for EventBridge](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-use-resource-based.md).

Replication failure reasonDescription`AssumeRoleNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't assume the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that's specified
in the replication configuration.`DstBucketNotFound`S3 on Outposts can't find the destination bucket that's specified in
the replication configuration.`DstBucketUnversioned`Versioning isn't enabled on the Outposts destination bucket. To
replicate objects with S3 Replication on Outposts, you must enable versioning on
the destination bucket.`DstDelObjNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't replicate deletes to the destination bucket. The
`s3-outposts:ReplicateDelete` permission might be missing
for the destination bucket.`DstMultipartCompleteNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't complete a multipart upload of objects in the
destination bucket. The `s3-outposts:ReplicateObject`
permission might be missing for the destination bucket. `DstMultipartInitNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't initiate a multipart upload of objects to the
destination bucket. The `s3-outposts:ReplicateObject`
permission might be missing for the destination bucket. `DstMultipartPartUploadNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't upload multipart upload objects in the destination
bucket. The `s3-outposts:ReplicateObject` permission might be
missing for the destination bucket. `DstOutOfCapacity`S3 on Outposts can't replicate to the destination Outpost because the
Outpost is out of S3 storage capacity.`DstPutObjNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't replicate objects to the destination bucket. The
`s3-outposts:ReplicateObject` permission might be missing
for the destination bucket. `DstPutTaggingNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't replicate object tags to the destination bucket.
The `s3-outposts:ReplicateObject` permission might be missing
for the destination bucket. `DstVersionNotFound`S3 on Outposts can't find the required object version in the
destination bucket in order to replicate that object version's metadata.`SrcBucketReplicationConfigMissing`S3 on Outposts can't find a replication configuration for the access point
that's associated with the source Outposts bucket. `SrcGetObjNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't access the object in the source bucket for
replication. The `s3-outposts:GetObjectVersionForReplication`
permission might be missing for the source bucket. `SrcGetTaggingNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't access the object tag information from the source
bucket. The `s3-outposts:GetObjectVersionTagging` permission
might be missing for the source bucket.`SrcHeadObjectNotPermitted`S3 on Outposts can't retrieve object metadata from the source bucket.
The `s3-outposts:GetObjectVersionForReplication` permission
might be missing for the source bucket. `SrcObjectNotEligible`The object isn't eligible for replication. The object or its object
tags don't match the replication configuration.

## Monitoring EventBridge with CloudWatch

For monitoring, Amazon EventBridge integrates with Amazon CloudWatch. EventBridge automatically sends metrics to
CloudWatch every minute. These metrics include the number of [events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.md) that have been
matched by a [rule](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.md) and the number of
times a [target](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.md) is invoked by a rule. When a rule runs in EventBridge, all of the targets
associated with the rule are invoked. You can monitor your EventBridge behavior through CloudWatch in
the following ways.

- You can monitor the available [EventBridge\
metrics](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-monitoring.md#eb-metrics) for your EventBridge rules from the CloudWatch dashboard. Then, you can
use CloudWatch features, such as CloudWatch alarms, to set alarms on certain metrics. If
those metrics reach the custom threshold values that you've specified in the
alarms, you receive notifications and can take action accordingly.

- You can set Amazon CloudWatch Logs as a target of your EventBridge rule. Then, EventBridge creates log
streams and CloudWatch Logs stores the text from the events as log entries. For more
information, see [EventBridge and CloudWatch Logs](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-use-resource-based.md#eb-cloudwatchlogs-permissions).

and using dead-letter queues](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rule-dlq.md)

events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-archive-event.md)
