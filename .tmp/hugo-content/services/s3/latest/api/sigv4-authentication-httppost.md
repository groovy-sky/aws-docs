# Authenticating Requests: Browser-Based Uploads Using POST (AWS Signature Version 4)

Amazon S3 supports HTTP POST requests so that users can upload content directly to Amazon S3. Using
HTTP POST to upload content simplifies uploads and reduces upload latency where users upload
data to store in Amazon S3. This section describes how you authenticate HTTP POST requests. For
more information about HTTP POST requests, how to create a form, create a POST policy, and
an example, see [Browser-Based Uploads Using POST (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-usinghttppost.md).

To authenticate an HTTP POST request you do the following:

1. The form must include the following fields to provide signature and relevant
    information that Amazon S3 can use to re-calculate the signature upon receiving
    the request:

Element NameDescription`policy`

The Base64-encoded security policy that describes what
is permitted in the request. For signature calculation this
policy is the string you sign. Amazon S3 must get this
policy so it can re-calculate the signature.

`x-amz-algorithm`

The signing algorithm used. For AWS Signature Version
4, the value is `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`.

`x-amz-credential`

In addition to your access key ID, this provides scope
information you used in calculating the signing key for
signature calculation.

It is a string of the following form:

`<your-access-key-id>/<date>/<aws-region>/<aws-service>/aws4_request
   										`

For example:

`
   											AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20130728/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request`.
.

For Amazon S3, the _aws-service_ string is `s3`. For a list of
Amazon S3 `aws-region` strings, see [Regions and Endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#s3_region) in the _AWS General Reference_.

`x-amz-date`

It is the date value in ISO8601 format. For example,
`20130728T000000Z`.

It is the same date you used in creating the signing
key. This must also be the same value you provide in the
policy ( `x-amz-date`) that you signed.

`x-amz-signature`

(AWS Signature Version 4) The HMAC-SHA256 hash of the
security policy.

For more information on options for the signature, see [Add the signature to the HTTP request](../../../../general/latest/gr/sigv4-add-signature-to-request.md) in the _AWS General Reference_.

2. The POST policy must include the following elements:

Element NameDescription`x-amz-algorithm`

The signing algorithm that you used to calculation the
signature. For AWS Signature Version 4, the value is
`AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`.

`x-amz-credential`

In addition to your access key ID, this provides scope
information you used in calculating the signing key for
signature calculation.

It is a string of the following form:

`<your-access-key-id>/<date>/<aws-region>/<aws-service>/aws4_request
   										`

For example,

`
   											AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20130728/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request`.
.

`x-amz-date`

The date value specified in the ISO8601 formatted
string. For example, "20130728T000000Z". The date must be the
same that you used in creating the signing key for signature
calculation.

3. For signature calculation the POST policy is the string to sign.

## Calculating a Signature

The following diagram illustrates the signature calculation process.

![Diagram showing AWS signature calculation process with StringToSign, SigningKey, and Signature steps.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/API/images/sigV4-post.png)

###### To Calculate a signature

1. Create a policy using UTF-8 encoding.

2. Convert the UTF-8-encoded policy to Base64. The result is the string to
    sign.

3. Create the signature as an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the string to sign. You will
    provide the signing key as key to the hash function.

4. Encode the signature by using hex encoding.
