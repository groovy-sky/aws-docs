# ListParts

Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload.

To use this operation, you must provide the `upload ID` in the request. You obtain this
uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload request through [CreateMultipartUpload](api-createmultipartupload.md).

The `ListParts` request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The limit of 1,000
parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of parts in a response by specifying the
`max-parts` request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts,
the response returns an `IsTruncated` field with the value of `true`, and a
`NextPartNumberMarker` element. To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent
`ListParts` requests, include the `part-number-marker` query string parameter
and set its value to the `NextPartNumberMarker` field value from the previous
response.

For more information on multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](../dev/uploadobjusingmpu.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
         `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- For information
about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](../dev/mpuandpermissions.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If the upload was created using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys
(SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), you must have
permission to the `kms:Decrypt` action for the `ListParts` request to
succeed.

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use.
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md).

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `
                  Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

The following operations are related to `ListParts`:

- [CreateMultipartUpload](api-createmultipartupload.md)

- [UploadPart](api-uploadpart.md)

- [CompleteMultipartUpload](api-completemultipartupload.md)

- [AbortMultipartUpload](api-abortmultipartupload.md)

- [GetObjectAttributes](api-getobjectattributes.md)

- [ListMultipartUploads](api-listmultipartuploads.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /Key+?max-parts=MaxParts&part-number-marker=PartNumberMarker&uploadId=UploadId HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-request-payer: RequestPayer
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner
x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm: SSECustomerAlgorithm

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_ListParts_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the bucket to which the parts are being uploaded.

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `
                     Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming\
rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/s3onoutposts.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

## Examples

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets

Assume you have uploaded parts with sequential part numbers starting with 1. The following List
Parts request specifies `max-parts` and `part-number-marker` query parameters.
The request lists the first two parts that follow part number 1, that is, you will get parts 2 and 3
in the response. If more parts exist, the result is a truncated result and therefore the response
will return an `IsTruncated` element with the value `true`. The response will
also return the `NextPartNumberMarker` element with the value `3`, which
should be used for the value of the `part-number-marker` request query string parameter
in the next ListParts request.
