# GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

This implementation of the GET action uses the `accelerate` subresource to return the
Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket, which is either `Enabled` or `Suspended`.
Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers
to and from Amazon S3.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
`s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default.
The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to your Amazon S3\
Resources](../userguide/s3-access-control.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to `Enabled` or
`Suspended` by using the [PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration](api-putbucketaccelerateconfiguration.md) operation.

A GET `accelerate` request does not return a state value for a bucket that has no
transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state has never been set
on the bucket.

For more information about transfer acceleration, see [Transfer Acceleration](../dev/transfer-acceleration.md) in the
Amazon S3 User Guide.

The following operations are related to `GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration`:

- [PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration](api-putbucketaccelerateconfiguration.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /?accelerate HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner
x-amz-request-payer: RequestPayer

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the bucket for which the accelerate configuration is retrieved.

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration_RequestSyntax)**

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about
downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays\
Buckets](../dev/objectsinrequesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 200
x-amz-request-charged: RequestCharged
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<AccelerateConfiguration>
   <Status>string</Status>
</AccelerateConfiguration>
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The response returns the following HTTP headers.

**[x-amz-request-charged](#API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration_ResponseSyntax)**

If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request. For more
information, see [Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](../userguide/requesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon Simple_
_Storage Service user guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

The following data is returned in XML format by the service.

**[AccelerateConfiguration](#API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration_ResponseSyntax)**

Root level tag for the AccelerateConfiguration parameters.

Required: Yes

**[Status](#API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration_ResponseSyntax)**

The accelerate configuration of the bucket.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Enabled | Suspended`

## Examples

This implementation of the GET action returns the following responses.

### Example

If the transfer acceleration state is set to `Enabled` on a bucket, the response is
as follows:

```xml

<AccelerateConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Status>Enabled</Status>
</AccelerateConfiguration>

```

### Example

If the transfer acceleration state is set to `Suspended` on a bucket, the response is
as follows:

```xml

<AccelerateConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Status>Suspended</Status>
</AccelerateConfiguration>

```

### Example

If the transfer acceleration state on a bucket has never been set to `Enabled` or
`Suspended`, the response is as follows:

```xml

<AccelerateConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/" />

```

### Retrieve the transfer acceleration configuration for a bucket

The following example shows a GET /? `accelerate` request to retrieve the transfer
acceleration state of the bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

```HTTP

GET /?accelerate HTTP/1.1
Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
Authorization: authorization string
Content-Type: text/plain

```

### Example

The following is a sample of the response body (only) that shows bucket transfer acceleration is
enabled.

```xml

<AccelerateConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Status>Enabled</Status>
</AccelerateConfiguration>

```
