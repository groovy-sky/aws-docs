# RecordsEvent

The container for the records event.

## Contents

**Payload**

The byte array of partial, one or more result records. S3 Select doesn't guarantee that a record
will be self-contained in one record frame. To ensure continuous streaming of data, S3 Select might
split the same record across multiple record frames instead of aggregating the results in memory. Some
S3 clients (for example, the AWS SDK for Java) handle this behavior by creating a
`ByteStream` out of the response by default. Other clients might not handle this behavior
by default. In those cases, you must aggregate the results on the client side and parse the
response.

Type: Base64-encoded binary data object

Required: No
