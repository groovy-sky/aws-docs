# NoncurrentVersionTransition

Container for the transition rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to the
`STANDARD_IA`, `ONEZONE_IA`, `INTELLIGENT_TIERING`,
`GLACIER_IR`, `GLACIER`, or `DEEP_ARCHIVE` storage class. If your
bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3
transition noncurrent object versions to the `STANDARD_IA`, `ONEZONE_IA`,
`INTELLIGENT_TIERING`, `GLACIER_IR`, `GLACIER`, or
`DEEP_ARCHIVE` storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

## Contents

**NewerNoncurrentVersions**

Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain in the same storage class before
transitioning objects. You can specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain. Amazon S3 will transition any
additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified number to retain. For more information about
noncurrent versions, see [Lifecycle configuration elements](../userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**NoncurrentDays**

Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3 can perform the associated action.
For information about the noncurrent days calculations, see [How Amazon S3 Calculates\
How Long an Object Has Been Noncurrent](../dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.md#non-current-days-calculations) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**StorageClass**

The class of storage used to store the object.

Type: String

Valid Values: `GLACIER | STANDARD_IA | ONEZONE_IA | INTELLIGENT_TIERING | DEEP_ARCHIVE | GLACIER_IR`

Required: No
