# DeleteBucketInventoryConfiguration

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Deletes an S3 Inventory configuration (identified by the inventory ID) from the bucket.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
`s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The
bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\
Resources](../userguide/s3-access-control.md).

For information about the Amazon S3 inventory feature, see [Amazon S3 Inventory](../dev/storage-inventory.md).

###### Note

After deleting a configuration, Amazon S3 might still deliver one additional inventory
report during a brief transition period while the system processes the deletion.

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
