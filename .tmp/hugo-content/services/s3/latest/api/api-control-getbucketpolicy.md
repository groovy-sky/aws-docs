# GetBucketPolicy

###### Note

This action gets a bucket policy for an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To get a policy for
an S3 bucket, see [GetBucketPolicy](api-getbucketpolicy.md) in the
_Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Returns the policy of a specified Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using\
Amazon S3 on Outposts](../userguide/s3onoutposts.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the
bucket, the calling identity must have the `GetBucketPolicy` permissions on the
specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in order to use this
action.

Only users from Outposts bucket owner account with the right permissions can perform
actions on an Outposts bucket. If you don't have `s3-outposts:GetBucketPolicy`
permissions or you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account,
Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied` error.

###### Important

As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can
always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability
to perform this action.

For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User\
Policies](../dev/using-iam-policies.md).

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](api-control-getbucketpolicy.md#API_control_GetBucketPolicy_Examples) section.

The following actions are related to `GetBucketPolicy`:

- [GetObject](api-getobject.md)

- [PutBucketPolicy](api-control-putbucketpolicy.md)

- [DeleteBucketPolicy](api-control-deletebucketpolicy.md)

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /v20180820/bucket/name/policy HTTP/1.1

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[name](#API_control_GetBucketPolicy_RequestSyntax)**

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the AWS SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`.
