# HeadObject

The `HEAD` operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object
itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's metadata.

###### Note

A `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` operation on an object. The
response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is no response body. Because
of this, if the `HEAD` request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as
`400 Bad Request`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `405
          Method Not Allowed`, `412 Precondition Failed`, or `304 Not Modified`.
It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.

Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see [Common Request Headers](restcommonrequestheaders.md).

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- To use
`HEAD`, you must have the `s3:GetObject` permission. You need the
relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see
[Actions, resources,\
and condition keys for Amazon S3](../dev/list-amazons3.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more
information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for\
Amazon S3 API operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-policy-actions.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether
you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.

- If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an
HTTP status code `404 Not Found` error.

- If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP
status code `403 Forbidden` error.

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use.
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md).

If you enable `x-amz-checksum-mode` in the request and the object is encrypted
with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), you must also have the
`kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM
identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key to retrieve the checksum of
the object.

Encryption

###### Note

Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be
sent for `HEAD` requests if your object uses server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or
server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The
`x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is used when you `PUT` an object
to S3 and want to specify the encryption method. If you include this header in a
`HEAD` request for an object that uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP
`400 Bad Request` error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when
you retrieve the object.

If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption
keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the
object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able
to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using\
Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)](../dev/serversideencryptioncustomerkeys.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

**Directory bucket** -
For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more
information, see [Protecting data with server-side encryption](../userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Versioning

- If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was
deleted and includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.

- If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a `405 Method Not
                    Allowed` error and the `Last-Modified: timestamp` response header.

###### Note

- **Directory buckets** -
Delete marker is not supported for directory buckets.

- **Directory buckets** -
S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify `null` to the
`versionId` query parameter in the request.

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `
                  Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

###### Note

For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
                  `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

The following actions are related to `HeadObject`:

- [GetObject](api-getobject.md)

- [GetObjectAttributes](api-getobjectattributes.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the bucket that contains the object.

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `
                     Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming\
rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/s3onoutposts.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Required: Yes

**[If-Match](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is the same as the one specified; otherwise, return
a 412 (precondition failed) error.

If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present in the
request as follows:

- `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;

- `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`;

Then Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and the data requested.

For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).

**[If-Modified-Since](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Return the object only if it has been modified since the specified time; otherwise, return a 304
(not modified) error.

If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in
the request as follows:

- `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;

- `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;

Then Amazon S3 returns the `304 Not Modified` response code.

For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).

**[If-None-Match](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Return the object only if its entity tag (ETag) is different from the one specified; otherwise,
return a 304 (not modified) error.

If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in
the request as follows:

- `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;

- `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;

Then Amazon S3 returns the `304 Not Modified` response code.

For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).

**[If-Unmodified-Since](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Return the object only if it has not been modified since the specified time; otherwise, return a 412
(precondition failed) error.

If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present in the
request as follows:

- `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;

- `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`;

Then Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and the data requested.

For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).

**[Key](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

The object key.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: Yes

**[partNumber](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Part number of the object being read. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Effectively
performs a 'ranged' HEAD request for the part specified. Useful querying about the size of the part and
the number of parts in this object.

**[Range](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

HeadObject returns only the metadata for an object. If the Range is satisfiable, only the
`ContentLength` is affected in the response. If the Range is not satisfiable, S3 returns a
`416 - Requested Range Not Satisfiable` error.

**[response-cache-control](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Sets the `Cache-Control` header of the response.

**[response-content-disposition](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Sets the `Content-Disposition` header of the response.

Sets the `Content-Encoding` header of the response.

**[response-content-language](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Sets the `Content-Language` header of the response.

**[response-content-type](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Sets the `Content-Type` header of the response.

**[response-expires](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Sets the `Expires` header of the response.

**[versionId](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Version ID used to reference a specific version of the object.

###### Note

For directory buckets in this API operation, only the `null` value of the version ID is supported.

**[x-amz-checksum-mode](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.

**General purpose buckets** -
If you enable checksum mode and the object is uploaded with a [checksum](api-checksum.md) and encrypted with
an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key, you must have permission to use the `kms:Decrypt` action to
retrieve the checksum.

**Directory buckets** \- If you enable `ChecksumMode`
and the object is encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), you must also have the
`kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM identity-based
policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.

Valid Values: `ENABLED`

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about
downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays\
Buckets](../dev/objectsinrequesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is
used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must
be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` header.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5](#API_HeadObject_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header
for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-checksum-crc32](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32 checksum` of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded
with the object. When you use an API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated
with multipart uploads, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md#large-object-checksums) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-crc32c](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32C` checksum of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded
with the object. When you use an API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated
with multipart uploads, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md#large-object-checksums) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-crc64nvme](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The Base64 encoded, 64-bit `CRC64NVME` checksum of the object. For more information, see
[Checking\

**[x-amz-checksum-sha1](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The Base64 encoded, 160-bit `SHA1` digest of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded
with the object. When you use the API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated
with multipart uploads, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md#large-object-checksums) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-sha256](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The Base64 encoded, 256-bit `SHA256` digest of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded
with the object. When you use an API operation on an object that was uploaded using multipart uploads, this value may not be a direct checksum value of the full object. Instead, it's a calculation based on the checksum values of each individual part. For more information about how checksums are calculated
with multipart uploads, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md#large-object-checksums) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-type](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The checksum type, which determines how part-level checksums are combined to create an object-level
checksum for multipart objects. You can use this header response to verify that the checksum type that
is received is the same checksum type that was specified in `CreateMultipartUpload` request.
For more information, see [Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3\
User Guide](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md).

Valid Values: `COMPOSITE | FULL_OBJECT`

**[x-amz-delete-marker](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

Specifies whether the object retrieved was (true) or was not (false) a Delete Marker. If false, this
response header does not appear in the response.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-expiration](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

If the object expiration is configured (see [`PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration`](api-putbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md)), the response includes this header. It
includes the `expiry-date` and `rule-id` key-value pairs providing object
expiration information. The value of the `rule-id` is URL-encoded.

###### Note

Object expiration information is not returned in directory buckets and this header returns the
value " `NotImplemented`" in all responses for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-missing-meta](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

This is set to the number of metadata entries not returned in `x-amz-meta` headers. This
can happen if you create metadata using an API like SOAP that supports more flexible metadata than the
REST API. For example, using SOAP, you can create metadata whose values are not legal HTTP
headers.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-mp-parts-count](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The count of parts this object has. This value is only returned if you specify
`partNumber` in your request and the object was uploaded as a multipart upload.

**[x-amz-object-lock-legal-hold](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

Specifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the
requester has the `s3:GetObjectLegalHold` permission. This header is not returned if the
specified version of this object has never had a legal hold applied. For more information about S3
Object Lock, see [Object\
Lock](../dev/object-lock.md).

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `ON | OFF`

**[x-amz-object-lock-mode](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The Object Lock mode, if any, that's in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the
requester has the `s3:GetObjectRetention` permission. For more information about S3 Object
Lock, see [Object Lock](../dev/object-lock.md).

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `GOVERNANCE | COMPLIANCE`

**[x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The date and time when the Object Lock retention period expires. This header is only returned if the
requester has the `s3:GetObjectRetention` permission.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-replication-status](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a bucket that is either a source or a
destination in a replication rule.

In replication, you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket
or buckets where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object ( `GetObject`) or
object metadata ( `HeadObject`) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the
`x-amz-replication-status` header in the response as follows:

- **If requesting an object from the source bucket**, Amazon S3 will
return the `x-amz-replication-status` header if the object in your request is eligible
for replication.

For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix
`TaxDocs` requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix `TaxDocs`.
Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example `TaxDocs/document1.pdf`,
are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the
`x-amz-replication-status` header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating
object replication status.

- **If requesting an object from a destination bucket**, Amazon S3 will
return the `x-amz-replication-status` header with value REPLICA if the object in your
request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in
progress.

- **When replicating objects to multiple destination buckets**, the
`x-amz-replication-status` header acts differently. The header of the source object
will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header
will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more
destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.

For more information, see [Replication](../dev/notificationhowto.md).

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `COMPLETE | PENDING | FAILED | REPLICA | COMPLETED`

**[x-amz-request-charged](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request. For more
information, see [Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](../userguide/requesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon Simple_
_Storage Service user guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

**[x-amz-restore](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

If the object is an archived object (an object whose storage class is GLACIER), the response
includes this header if either the archive restoration is in progress (see [RestoreObject](api-restoreobject.md) or an archive copy is already
restored.

If an archive copy is already restored, the header value indicates when Amazon S3 is scheduled to delete
the object copy. For example:

`x-amz-restore: ongoing-request="false", expiry-date="Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:00:00
      GMT"`

If the object restoration is in progress, the header returns the value
`ongoing-request="true"`.

For more information about archiving objects, see [Transitioning Objects: General Considerations](../dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.md#lifecycle-transition-general-considerations).

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The server-side encryption algorithm used when you store this object in Amazon S3 or Amazon FSx.

###### Note

When accessing data stored in Amazon FSx file systems using S3 access points, the only valid server side
encryption option is `aws:fsx`.

Valid Values: `AES256 | aws:fsx | aws:kms | aws:kms:dsse`

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

If present, indicates the ID of the KMS key that was used for object encryption.

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

Indicates whether the object uses an S3 Bucket Key for server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
keys (SSE-KMS).

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will
include this header to confirm the encryption algorithm that's used.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was requested, the response will
include this header to provide the round-trip message integrity verification of the customer-provided
encryption key.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-storage-class](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

Provides storage class information of the object. Amazon S3 returns this header for all objects except
for S3 Standard storage class objects.

For more information, see [Storage Classes](../dev/storage-class-intro.md).

###### Note

**Directory buckets** -
Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

Valid Values: `STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY | STANDARD_IA | ONEZONE_IA | INTELLIGENT_TIERING | GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE | OUTPOSTS | GLACIER_IR | SNOW | EXPRESS_ONEZONE | FSX_OPENZFS | FSX_ONTAP`

**[x-amz-tagging-count](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

The number of tags, if any, on the object, when you have the relevant permission to read object
tags.

You can use [GetObjectTagging](api-getobjecttagging.md) to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-version-id](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

Version ID of the object.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-website-redirect-location](#API_HeadObject_ResponseSyntax)**

If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in
the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object
metadata.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

## Errors
