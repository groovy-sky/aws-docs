# Signature calculations for trailing headers (chunked uploads) (AWS Signature Version 4)

When authenticating requests using the
`Authorization` header, you can also upload the payload in
chunks. When you send the data for the object in chunks, you
also have the option of including trailing headers. (For more information, see [Signature Calculations for the Authorization Header: Transferring Payload in Multiple Chunks (Chunked Upload) (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-streaming.md).) This section describes the steps
you need to take when you want to include a trailing header at the end of your multiple chunk
upload.

###### Important

When you are including trailing headers, you must send the following in your initial header:

- You must set `x-amz-content-sha256` to an appropriate value that indicates
a trailer will be included. To see the acceptable values for `x-amz-content-sha256`,
see [Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.md).

- You must set `x-amz-trailer` to indicate the contents your are including in
your trailing header.

Trailing headers are only sent after the chunks have been uploaded. Previous chunks are sent
as normal and signed as described in the previous sections, including sending the final chunk
with a payload of 0 bytes. The trailing headers are included as their own chunk and sent
after the final chunk with a payload of 0 bytes. For example, if your data ended with a 100 KB
chunk, you would send the following:

- Previous data chunks

- 100 KB final chunk of the object

- 0 bytes chunk signifying the end of the object

- Trailing headers chunk

## Examples: Checking signature calculations

You can use the examples in this section as a reference to check signature
calculations in your code. Before you review the examples, note the following:

- The signature calculations in these examples use the following example
security credentials.

ParameterValue`AWSAccessKeyId``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED``AWSSecretAccessKey``wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

- All examples use the request timestamp 20130524T000000Z ( `Fri, 24 May 2013 00:00:00
  						GMT`).

- All examples use `examplebucket` as the bucket name.

- The bucket is assumed to be in the
US East (N. Virginia) Region, and the credential `Scope` and the
`Signing Key` calculations use `us-east-1` as the
Region specifier.
For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#s3_region) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

- You can use either path style or virtual-hosted style requests. The following
examples use virtual-hosted style requests, for example:

```

https://examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/photo1.jpg
```

For more information, see [Virtual\
Hosting of Buckets](../userguide/virtualhosting.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

The following example sends a `PUT` request to upload an object. The
signature calculations assume the following:

- You are uploading a 65 KB text file, and the file content is a
one-character string made up of the letter 'a'.

- The chunk size is 64 KB. As a result, the payload is uploaded in three
chunks, 64 KB, 1 KB, and the final chunk with 0 bytes of chunk data.

- The resulting object has the key name `chunkObject.txt`.

- You are requesting `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY` as the storage class by
adding the `x-amz-storage-class` request header.

- The transfer is including a CRC32C checksum value as a trailing header.

For information about the API action, see [PutObject](api-putobject.md). The general request syntax is as follows:

```nohighlight

PUT /examplebucket/chunkObject.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-date: 20130524T000000Z
x-amz-storage-class: REDUCED_REDUNDANCY
Authorization: SignatureToBeCalculated
x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER
Content-Encoding: aws-chunked
x-amz-decoded-content-length: 66560
x-amz-trailer: x-amz-checksum-crc32c
Content-Length: 66824
<Payload>
```

The following steps show signature calculations.

1. ###### Seed signature — Create String to Sign

1. ###### CanonicalRequest

      ```

      PUT
      /examplebucket/chunkObject.txt

      content-encoding:aws-chunked
      host:s3.amazonaws.com
      x-amz-content-sha256:STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER
      x-amz-date:20130524T000000Z
      x-amz-decoded-content-length:66560
      x-amz-storage-class:REDUCED_REDUNDANCY
      x-amz-trailer:x-amz-checksum-crc32c

      content-encoding;host;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date;x-amz-decoded-content-length;x-amz-storage-class;x-amz-trailer
      STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER
      ```

      In the canonical request, the third line is empty because there
       are no query parameters in the request. The last line is the
       constant string provided as the value of the hashed Payload, which
       should be same as the value of `x-amz-content-sha256
      								header`.

2. ###### StringToSign

      For information about each line in the string to sign, see the diagram in the preceding topic ( [Calculating the Seed Signature](sigv4-streaming.md#sigv4-chunked-upload-sig-calculation-chunk0)) that shows various components of the string to
      sign. For example, the last three lines consist of the following:

- `previous-signature`

- `hash("")`

- `hash(current-chunk-data)`

      ```

      ###### Note

      The last two lines are `previous-signature` (the 0 byte data chunk signature), `hash`( `trailing-checksum-header-name`: `base64-encoded-trailing-checksum-value`\\n).

      The hash is calculated as follows with no whitespace:

- The trailing checksum header name

- A colon ( `:`)

- The base64-encoded trailing checksum value

- A newline character ( `\n`).

In this example, where we are using the `crc32c` hash algorithm, with the base64-encoded checksum value `sOO8/Q==`, we can represent the computation as follows: `hash('x-amz-checksum-crc32c:sOO8/Q==\n')`.
