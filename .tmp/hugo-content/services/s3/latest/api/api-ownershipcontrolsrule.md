# OwnershipControlsRule

The container element for an ownership control rule.

## Contents

**ObjectOwnership**

The container element for object ownership for a bucket's ownership controls.

`BucketOwnerPreferred` \- Objects uploaded to the bucket change ownership to the bucket
owner if the objects are uploaded with the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.

`ObjectWriter` \- The uploading account will own the object if the object is uploaded with
the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.

`BucketOwnerEnforced` \- Access control lists (ACLs) are disabled and no longer affect
permissions. The bucket owner automatically owns and has full control over every object in the bucket.
The bucket only accepts PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or specify bucket owner full control ACLs
(such as the predefined `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL or a custom ACL in XML format
that grants the same permissions).

By default, `ObjectOwnership` is set to `BucketOwnerEnforced` and ACLs are
disabled. We recommend keeping ACLs disabled, except in uncommon use cases where you must control access
for each object individually. For more information about S3 Object Ownership, see [Controlling\
ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](../userguide/about-object-ownership.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets use the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership.
