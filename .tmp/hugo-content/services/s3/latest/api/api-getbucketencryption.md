# GetBucketEncryption

Returns the default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, all buckets have a
default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). This operation also returns the [BucketKeyEnabled](api-serversideencryptionrule.md#AmazonS3-Type-ServerSideEncryptionRule-BucketKeyEnabled) and [BlockedEncryptionTypes](api-serversideencryptionrule.md#AmazonS3-Type-ServerSideEncryptionRule-BlockedEncryptionTypes) statuses.

###### Note

- **General purpose buckets** \- For information about the bucket
default encryption feature, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption](../userguide/bucket-encryption.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- **Directory buckets** -
For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. For information about the default encryption configuration in
directory buckets, see [Setting default server-side\
encryption behavior for directory buckets](../userguide/s3-express-bucket-encryption.md).

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- The
`s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration` permission is required in a policy. The bucket
owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others.
For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your\
Amazon S3 Resources](../userguide/s3-access-control.md).

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to
this API operation, you must have the `s3express:GetEncryptionConfiguration`
permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the AWS account that owns the resource.
For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](../userguide/s3-express-security-iam.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

The following operations are related to `GetBucketEncryption`:

- [PutBucketEncryption](api-putbucketencryption.md)

- [DeleteBucketEncryption](api-deletebucketencryption.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /?encryption HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_GetBucketEncryption_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the bucket from which the server-side encryption configuration is retrieved.

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
                  `. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_GetBucketEncryption_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

###### Note

For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this API operation. If you specify this header, the request fails with the HTTP status code
`501 Not Implemented`.

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 200
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration>
   <Rule>
      <ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault>
         <KMSMasterKeyID>string</KMSMasterKeyID>

      <BucketKeyEnabled>boolean</BucketKeyEnabled>
   </Rule>
   ...
</ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration>
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in XML format by the service.

**[ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration](#API_GetBucketEncryption_ResponseSyntax)**

Root level tag for the ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration parameters.

Required: Yes

**[Rule](#API_GetBucketEncryption_ResponseSyntax)**

Container for information about a particular server-side encryption configuration rule.

Type: Array of [ServerSideEncryptionRule](api-serversideencryptionrule.md) data types

## Examples
