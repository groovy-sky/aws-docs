# AccessGrantsLocationConfiguration

The configuration options of the S3 Access Grants location. It contains the `S3SubPrefix` field. The grant scope, the data to which you are granting access, is the result of appending the `Subprefix` field to the scope of the registered location.

## Contents

**S3SubPrefix**

The `S3SubPrefix` is appended to the location scope creating the grant scope. Use this field to narrow the scope of the grant to a subset of the location scope. This field is required if the location scope is the default location `s3://` because you cannot create a grant for all of your S3 data in the Region and must narrow the scope. For example, if the location scope is the default location `s3://`, the `S3SubPrefx` can be a <bucket-name>/\*, so the full grant scope path would be `s3://<bucket-name>/*`. Or the `S3SubPrefx` can be `<bucket-name>/<prefix-name>*`, so the full grant scope path would be or `s3://<bucket-name>/<prefix-name>*`.

If the `S3SubPrefix` includes a prefix, append the wildcard character `*` after the prefix to indicate that you want to include all object key names in the bucket that start with that prefix.
