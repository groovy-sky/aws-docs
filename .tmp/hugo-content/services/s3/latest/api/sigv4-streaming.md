# Signature Calculations for the Authorization Header: Transferring Payload in Multiple Chunks (Chunked Upload) (AWS Signature Version 4)

As described in the [Overview](sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.md#sigv4-auth-header-overview), when authenticating requests using the
`Authorization` header, you have an option of uploading the payload in
chunks. You can send data in fixed size or variable size chunks. This section describes the
signature calculation process in chunked upload, how you create the chunk body, and how the
delayed signing works where you first upload the chunk, and send its signature in the
subsequent chunk. The example section (see [Example: PUT Object](#example-signature-calculations-streaming)) shows signature calculations
and resulting `Authorization` headers that you can use as a test suite to verify
your code.

###### Note

When transferring data in a series of chunks, you must do one of the following:

- Explicitly specify the total content length (object length in bytes plus
metadata in each chunk) using the `Content-Length` HTTP header. To do
this, you must pre-compute the total length of the payload, including the
metadata that you send in each chunk, before starting your request.

- Specify the `Transfer-Encoding` HTTP header. If you include the
`Transfer-Encoding` header and specify any value other than
`identity`, you must omit the `Content-Length`
header.

For all requests, you must include the `x-amz-decoded-content-length`
header, specifying the size of the object in bytes.

Each chunk signature calculation includes the signature of the previous chunk. To begin,
you create a _seed_ signature using only the headers. You use the seed
signature in the signature calculation of the first chunk. For each subsequent chunk, you
create a chunk signature that includes the signature of the previous chunk. Thus, the chunk
signatures are chained together; that is, the signature of chunk _n_ is a
function _F(chunk n, signature(chunk n-1))_. The chaining ensures that
you send the chunks in the correct order.

To perform a chunked upload, do the following:

1. Decide the payload chunk size. You need this when you write the code.

The chunk size must be at least 8 KB. We recommend a chunk size of a least 64 KB for better
    performance. This chunk size applies to all chunks except the last one. The last
    chunk you send can be smaller than 8 KB. If your payload is small and can fit into
    one chunk, then it can be smaller than the 8 KB.

2. Create the seed signature for inclusion in the first chunk. For more information,
    see [Calculating the Seed Signature](#sigv4-chunked-upload-sig-calculation-chunk0).

3. Create the first chunk and stream it. For more information, see [Defining the Chunk Body](#sigv4-chunked-body-definition).

4. For each subsequent chunk, calculate the chunk signature that includes the
    previous signature in the string you sign, construct the chunk, and send it. For
    more information, see [Defining the Chunk Body](#sigv4-chunked-body-definition).

5. Send the final additional chunk, which is the same as the other chunks in the
    construction, but it has zero data bytes. For more information, see [Defining the Chunk Body](#sigv4-chunked-body-definition).

## Calculating the Seed Signature

The following diagram illustrates the process of calculating the seed
signature.

![Diagram showing the process of calculating the seed signature.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/API/images/sigV4-auth-header-chunked-seed-signature.png)

The following table describes the functions that are shown in the diagram.
You need to implement code for these functions.

FunctionDescription`Lowercase()`Convert the string to lowercase.`Hex()`Lowercase base 16 encoding.`SHA256Hash()`Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) cryptographic hash function.`HMAC-SHA256()`Computes HMAC by using the SHA256 algorithm with the signing key provided. This is the final signature.`Trim()`Remove any leading or trailing whitespace. `UriEncode()`

URI encode every byte. UriEncode() must enforce the following rules:

- URI encode every byte except the unreserved
characters: 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '-', '.',
'\_', and '~'.

- The space character is a reserved character and must be
encoded as "%20" (and not as "+").

- Each URI encoded byte is formed by a '%' and the
two-digit hexadecimal value of the byte.

- Letters in the hexadecimal value must be uppercase, for
example "%1A".

- Encode the forward slash character, '/', everywhere
except in
the object key name. For example, if the object key name is
`photos/Jan/sample.jpg`, the forward
slash in the key name is not encoded.

###### Important

The standard UriEncode functions provided by your development platform may not work
because of differences in implementation and
related ambiguity in the underlying RFCs. We recommend that you write your own custom UriEncode
function to ensure that your encoding will
work.

To see an example of a UriEncode function in Java, see
[Java Utilities](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/util/SdkHttpUtils.java)
on the GitHub website.

For information about the signing process, see [Signature Calculations for the Authorization Header: Transferring Payload in a Single Chunk (AWS Signature Version 4)](sig-v4-header-based-auth.md). The
process is the same, except that the creation of `CanonicalRequest` differs
as follows:

- In addition to the request headers you plan to add, you must include the
following headers:

HeaderDescription`x-amz-content-sha256`

This header is required for all AWS Signature Version 4
requests. Set the value to
`STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD` to
indicate that the signature covers only headers and that
there is no payload.

`Content-Encoding`

Set the value to `aws-chunked`.

Amazon S3 supports multiple content encoding values. You can specify your custom content-encoding when using the Signature Version 4 streaming API.

For example:

```

Content-Encoding : aws-chunked,gzip
```

Amazon S3 stores the resulting object without the `aws-chunked` value in the `content-encoding` header. If `aws-chunked` is the only value that you pass in the `content-encoding` header, S3 considers the `content-encoding` header empty and does not return this header when your retrieve the object.

`x-amz-decoded-content-length` Set the value to the length, in bytes, of the data to be
chunked, without counting any metadata. For example, if you are
uploading a 4 GB file, set the value to 4294967296. This is the
raw size of the object to be uploaded (data you want to store in
Amazon S3).`Content-Length`

Set the value to the actual size of the transmitted HTTP body, which includes the
length of your data (value set for
`x-amz-decoded-content-length`), plus chunk
metadata. Each chunk has metadata, such as the signature of
the previous chunk. Chunk calculations are discussed in the
following section. If you include the
`Transfer-Encoding` header and specify any
value other than `identity`, you must not include
the `Content-Length`
header.

You send the first chunk with the seed signature. You must construct the chunk as
described in the following section.

## Defining the Chunk Body

All chunks include some metadata. Each chunk must conform to the following
structure:

```nohighlight

string(IntHexBase(chunk-size)) + ";chunk-signature=" + signature + \r\n + chunk-data + \r\n
```

Where:

- `IntHexBase()` is a function that you write to convert an integer
chunk-size to hexadecimal. For example, if chunk-size is 65536, hexadecimal
string is "10000".

- `chunk-size` is the size, in bytes, of the
chunk-data, without metadata. For example, if you are uploading a 65 KB object
and using a chunk size of 64 KB, you upload the data in three chunks: the first
would be 64 KB, the second 1 KB, and the final chunk with 0 bytes.

- `signature`

For each chunk, you calculate the signature using the following string to sign.
For the first chunk, you use the seed-signature as the previous signature.

![Diagram of the process of calculating the seed signature showing various components of the string to sign.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/API/images/sigV4-auth-header-chunk-signature.png)

The size of the final chunk data that you send is 0, although the chunk body still
contains metadata, including the signature of the previous chunk.

## Example: PUT Object

You can use the examples in this section as a reference to check signature
calculations in your code. Before you review the examples, note the following:

- The signature calculations in these examples use the following example
security credentials.

ParameterValue`AWSAccessKeyId``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED``AWSSecretAccessKey``wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

- All examples use the request timestamp 20130524T000000Z ( `Fri, 24 May 2013 00:00:00
  						GMT`).

- All examples use `examplebucket` as the bucket name.

- The bucket is assumed to be in the
US East (N. Virginia) Region, and the credential `Scope` and the
`Signing Key` calculations use `us-east-1` as the
Region specifier.
For more information, see [Regions and Endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#s3_region) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

- You can use either path style or virtual-hosted style requests. The following
examples use virtual-hosted style requests, for example:

```

https://examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/photo1.jpg
```

For more information, see [Virtual\
Hosting of Buckets](../userguide/virtualhosting.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

The following example sends a `PUT` request to upload an object. The
signature calculations assume the following:

- You are uploading a 65 KB text file, and the file content is a
one-character string made up of the letter 'a'.

- The chunk size is 64 KB. As a result, the payload is uploaded in three
chunks, 64 KB, 1 KB, and the final chunk with 0 bytes of chunk data.

- The resulting object has the key name `chunkObject.txt`.

- You are requesting `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY` as the storage class by
adding the `x-amz-storage-class` request header.

For information about the API action, see [PutObject](api-putobject.md). The general request syntax is as follows:

```nohighlight

PUT /examplebucket/chunkObject.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-date: 20130524T000000Z
x-amz-storage-class: REDUCED_REDUNDANCY
Authorization: SignatureToBeCalculated
x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD
Content-Encoding: aws-chunked
x-amz-decoded-content-length: 66560
Content-Length: 66824
<Payload>
```

The following steps show signature calculations.

1. ###### Seed signature — Create String to Sign

1. ###### CanonicalRequest

      ```

      PUT
      /examplebucket/chunkObject.txt

      content-encoding:aws-chunked
      content-length:66824
      host:s3.amazonaws.com
      x-amz-content-sha256:STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD
      x-amz-date:20130524T000000Z
      x-amz-decoded-content-length:66560
      x-amz-storage-class:REDUCED_REDUNDANCY

      content-encoding;content-length;host;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date;x-amz-decoded-content-length;x-amz-storage-class
      STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD
      ```

      In the canonical request, the third line is empty because there
       are no query parameters in the request. The last line is the
       constant string provided as the value of the hashed Payload, which
       should be same as the value of `x-amz-content-sha256
      								header`.
