# Browser-based uploads using POST (AWS signature version 2)

Amazon S3 supports POST, which allows your users to upload content directly to Amazon S3. POST is
designed to simplify uploads, reduce upload latency, and save you money on applications
where users upload data to store in Amazon S3.

###### Note

The request authentication discussed in this section is based on AWS Signature Version 2, a
protocol for authenticating inbound API requests to AWS services.

Amazon S3 now supports Signature Version 4, a protocol for authenticating inbound API
requests to AWS services, in all AWS Regions. At this time, AWS Regions created
before January 30, 2014 will continue to support the previous protocol, Signature
Version 2. Any new regions after January 30, 2014 will support only Signature
Version 4 and therefore all requests to those regions must be made with Signature
Version 4. For more information, see [Authenticating Requests in\
Browser-Based Uploads Using POST (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-authentication-httppost.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.
