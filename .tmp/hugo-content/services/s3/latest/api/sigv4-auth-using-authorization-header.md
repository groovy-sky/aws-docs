## Overview

Using the HTTP `Authorization` header is the most common method of providing
authentication information. Except for [POST\
requests](restobjectpost.md) and requests that are signed by using query parameters, all Amazon S3
operations use the `Authorization` request header to provide
authentication information.

The following is an example of the `Authorization` header value. Line
breaks are added to this example for readability:

```

Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
Credential=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20130524/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request,
SignedHeaders=host;range;x-amz-date,
Signature=fe5f80f77d5fa3beca038a248ff027d0445342fe2855ddc963176630326f1024
```

The following table describes the various components of the `Authorization` header value in
the preceding example:

ComponentDescription`AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`

The algorithm that was used to calculate the signature.
You must provide this value when you use AWS Signature
Version 4 for authentication.

The string specifies AWS Signature Version 4 ( `AWS4`) and
the signing algorithm ( `HMAC-SHA256`).

`Credential`

Your access key ID and the scope information, which includes the date, Region, and
service that were used to calculate the signature.

This string has the following form:

```nohighlight

<your-access-key-id>/<date>/<aws-region>/<aws-service>/aws4_request
```

Where:

- `<date>` value is
specified using `YYYYMMDD`
format.

- `<aws-service>`
value is `s3` when sending request to
Amazon S3.

`SignedHeaders`

A semicolon-separated list of request headers that you
used to compute `Signature`. The list includes
header names only, and the header names must be in
lowercase. For example:

```

host;range;x-amz-date
```

`Signature`The 256-bit signature expressed as 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters. For example:

```

fe5f80f77d5fa3beca038a248ff027d0445342fe2855ddc963176630326f1024
```

Note
that the signature calculations vary depending on the option you
choose to transfer the payload.

The signature calculations vary depending on the method you choose to transfer the request
payload. S3 supports the following options:

- Transfer payload in a single chunk
– In this case, you have the following signature
calculation options:

- **Signed payload option** – You can
optionally compute the entire payload checksum and
include it in signature calculation. This provides added
security but you need to read your payload twice or
buffer it in memory.

For example, in order to upload a file, you need to read the file first to
compute a payload hash for signature calculation and again
for transmission when you create the request. For smaller
payloads, this approach might be preferable. However, for
large files, reading the file twice can be inefficient,
so you might want to upload data in chunks instead.

We recommend you include payload checksum for added
security.

- **Unsigned payload option** –
Do not include payload checksum in signature calculation.

For step-by-step instructions to calculate signature and construct the Authorization
header value, see [Signature Calculations for the Authorization Header: Transferring Payload in a Single Chunk (AWS Signature Version 4)](sig-v4-header-based-auth.md).

- Transfer payload in multiple chunks (chunked upload) –
In this case you transfer payload
in chunks. You can transfer a payload in chunks regardless of the
payload size.

You can break up your payload into chunks. These can be fixed or
variable-size chunks. By uploading data in chunks, you avoid reading the
entire payload to calculate the signature. Instead, for the first chunk,
you calculate a seed signature that uses only the request headers. The
second chunk contains the signature for the first chunk, and each
subsequent chunk contains the signature for the chunk that precedes it.
At the end of the upload, you send a final chunk with 0 bytes of data
that contains the signature of the last chunk of the payload. For more
information, see [Signature Calculations for the Authorization Header: Transferring Payload in Multiple Chunks (Chunked Upload) (AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-streaming.md).

When signing your requests, you can use either AWS Signature Version 4 or AWS Signature Version 4A.
The key difference between the two is determined by how the signature is calculated. With
AWS Signature Version 4A, the signature does not include Region-specific information and is calculated
using the `AWS4-ECDSA-P256-SHA256` algorithm.

In addition to these options, you have the option of including a trailer with your request.
In order to include a trailer with your request, you need to specify that in the header by
setting `x-amz-content-sha256` to the appropriate value. If you are using a trailing
header, you must include `x-amz-trailer` in the header and specify the trailing header names
as a string in a comma-separated list. All trailing headers are written after the final chunk. If you're
uploading the data in multiple chunks, you must send a final chunk with 0 bytes of data before sending
the trailing header.

When you send a request, you must tell Amazon S3 which of the preceding options you have
chosen in your signature calculation, by adding the
`x-amz-content-sha256` header with one of the following
values:

Header valueDescription

Actual payload checksum value

This value is the actual checksum of your object and is only possible
when you are uploading the data in a single chunk.

UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD

Use this when you are uploading the object as a single unsigned chunk.

STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER

Use this when sending an unsigned payload over multiple chunks. In this
case you also have a trailing header after the chunk is uploaded.

STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD

Use this when sending a payload over multiple chunks, and the chunks
are signed using `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`. This produces a SigV4
signature.

STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER

Use this when sending a payload over multiple chunks, and the chunks
are signed using `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`. This produces a SigV4
signature. In addition, the digest for the chunks is included as a
trailing header.

STREAMING-AWS4-ECDSA-P256-SHA256-PAYLOAD

Use this when sending a payload over multiple chunks, and the chunks
are signed using `AWS4-ECDSA-P256-SHA256`. This produces a
SigV4A signature.

STREAMING-AWS4-ECDSA-P256-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER

Use this when sending a payload over multiple chunks, and the chunks
are signed using `AWS4-ECDSA-P256-SHA256`. This produces a
SigV4A signature. In addition, the digest for the chunks is included
as a trailing header.

Upon receiving the request, Amazon S3 re-creates the string to sign using information in the
`Authorization` header and the `date` header. It then
verifies with authentication service the signatures match. The request date can be
specified by using either the HTTP `Date` or the `x-amz-date`
header. If both headers are present, `x-amz-date` takes precedence.

If the signatures match, Amazon S3 processes your request; otherwise, your request
will fail.
