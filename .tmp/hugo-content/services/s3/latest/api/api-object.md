# Object

An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

## Contents

**ChecksumAlgorithm**

The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of the object.

Type: Array of strings

Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`

Required: No

**ChecksumType**

The checksum type that is used to calculate the object’s checksum value. For more information, see
[Checking\
object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `COMPOSITE | FULL_OBJECT`

Required: No

**ETag**

The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents of an object,
not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is
depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:

- Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the AWS
Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of
their object data.

- Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the AWS
Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of
their object data.

- If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the ETag is not
an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption. If an object is larger than 16 MB, the AWS
Management Console will upload or copy that object as a Multipart Upload, and therefore the ETag
will not be an MD5 digest.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- MD5 is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: String

Required: No

**Key**

The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key to retrieve the object.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: No

**LastModified**

Creation date of the object.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**Owner**

The owner of the object

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- The bucket owner is returned as the
object owner.

Type: [Owner](api-owner.md) data type

Required: No

**RestoreStatus**

Specifies the restoration status of an object. Objects in certain storage classes must be restored
before they can be retrieved. For more information about these storage classes and how to work with
archived objects, see [Working with archived objects](../userguide/archived-objects.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

Type: [RestoreStatus](api-restorestatus.md) data type

Required: No

**Size**

Size in bytes of the object

Type: Long

Required: No

**StorageClass**

The class of storage used to store the object.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** -
Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

Type: String

Valid Values: `STANDARD | REDUCED_REDUNDANCY | GLACIER | STANDARD_IA | ONEZONE_IA | INTELLIGENT_TIERING | DEEP_ARCHIVE | OUTPOSTS | GLACIER_IR | SNOW | EXPRESS_ONEZONE | FSX_OPENZFS | FSX_ONTAP`

Required: No
