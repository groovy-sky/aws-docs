Container for all response elements.

## Contents

**ChecksumCRC32**

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32` checksum of the object. This checksum is only present if the object was uploaded
with the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumCRC32C**

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32C` checksum of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded
with the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumCRC64NVME**

The Base64 encoded, 64-bit `CRC64NVME` checksum of the object. This checksum is present
if the object being copied was uploaded with the `CRC64NVME` checksum algorithm, or if the
object was uploaded without a checksum (and Amazon S3 added the default checksum, `CRC64NVME`, to
the uploaded object). For more information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumSHA1**

The Base64 encoded, 160-bit `SHA1` digest of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded
with the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumSHA256**

The Base64 encoded, 256-bit `SHA256` digest of the object. This checksum is only present if the checksum was uploaded
with the object. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumType**

The checksum type that is used to calculate the object’s checksum value. For more information, see
[Checking\
object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `COMPOSITE | FULL_OBJECT`

Required: No

**ETag**
