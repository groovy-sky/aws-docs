CLI

**AWS CLI**

The following command applies a tagging configuration to a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --tagging file://tagging.json

```

The file `tagging.json` is a JSON document in the current folder that specifies tags:

```nohighlight

{
   "TagSet": [
     {
       "Key": "organization",
       "Value": "marketing"
     }
   ]
}
```

Or apply a tagging configuration to `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` directly from the command line:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=organization,Value=marketing}]'

```

PowerShell

**Tools for PowerShell V4**

**Example 1: This command applies two tags to a bucket named `cloudtrail-test-2018`: a tag with a key of Stage and a value of Test, and a tag with a key of Environment and a value of Alpha. To verify that the tags were added to the bucket, run `Get-S3BucketTagging -BucketName bucket_name`. The results should show the tags that you applied to the bucket in the first command. Note that `Write-S3BucketTagging` overwrites the entire existing tag set on a bucket. To add or delete individual tags, run the Resource Groups and Tagging API cmdlets, `Add-RGTResourceTag` and `Remove-RGTResourceTag`. Alternatively, use Tag Editor in the AWS Management Console to manage S3 bucket tags.**

```powershell

Write-S3BucketTagging -BucketName amzn-s3-demo-bucket -TagSet @( @{ Key="Stage"; Value="Test" }, @{ Key="Environment"; Value="Alpha" } )

```

**Example 2: This command pipes a bucket named `cloudtrail-test-2018` into the `Write-S3BucketTagging` cmdlet. It applies tags Stage:Production and Department:Finance to the bucket. Note that `Write-S3BucketTagging` overwrites the entire existing tag set on a bucket.**

```powershell

Get-S3Bucket -BucketName amzn-s3-demo-bucket | Write-S3BucketTagging -TagSet @( @{ Key="Stage"; Value="Production" }, @{ Key="Department"; Value="Finance" } )

```
