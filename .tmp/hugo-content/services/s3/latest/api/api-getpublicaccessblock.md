# GetPublicAccessBlock

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Retrieves the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. This
operation returns the bucket-level configuration only. To understand the effective public
access behavior, you must also consider account-level settings (which may inherit from
organization-level policies). To use this operation, you must have the
`s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information about Amazon S3
permissions, see [Specifying Permissions in a\
Policy](../dev/using-with-s3-actions.md).

###### Important

When Amazon S3 evaluates the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for a bucket or an
object, it checks the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for both the bucket (or
the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. Account-level settings
automatically inherit from organization-level policies when present. If the
`PublicAccessBlock` settings are different between the bucket and the account,
Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level
settings.

For more information about when Amazon S3 considers a bucket or an object public, see [The Meaning of "Public"](../dev/access-control-block-public-access.md#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status).

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /?publicAccessBlock HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_GetPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose `PublicAccessBlock` configuration you want to retrieve.

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_GetPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 200
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<PublicAccessBlockConfiguration>
   <BlockPublicAcls>boolean</BlockPublicAcls>
   <IgnorePublicAcls>boolean</IgnorePublicAcls>
   <BlockPublicPolicy>boolean</BlockPublicPolicy>
   <RestrictPublicBuckets>boolean</RestrictPublicBuckets>
</PublicAccessBlockConfiguration>
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in XML format by the service.

**[PublicAccessBlockConfiguration](#API_GetPublicAccessBlock_ResponseSyntax)**

Root level tag for the PublicAccessBlockConfiguration parameters.

Required: Yes

**[BlockPublicAcls](#API_GetPublicAccessBlock_ResponseSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for this bucket and objects
in this bucket. Setting this element to `TRUE` causes the following behavior:

- PUT Bucket ACL and PUT Object ACL calls fail if the specified ACL is public.

- PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

- PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

Type: Boolean

**[BlockPublicPolicy](#API_GetPublicAccessBlock_ResponseSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for this bucket. Setting this element to
`TRUE` causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy
allows public access.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

Type: Boolean

**[IgnorePublicAcls](#API_GetPublicAccessBlock_ResponseSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket and objects in this bucket. Setting
this element to `TRUE` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on this bucket and objects in
this bucket.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new
public ACLs from being set.

Type: Boolean

**[RestrictPublicBuckets](#API_GetPublicAccessBlock_ResponseSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for this bucket. Setting this element
to `TRUE` restricts access to this bucket to only AWS service principals and
authorized users within this account if the bucket has a public policy.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket policies, except that public and
cross-account access within any public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to specific
accounts, is blocked.

Type: Boolean

## Examples
