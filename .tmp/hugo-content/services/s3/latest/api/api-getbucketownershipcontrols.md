# GetBucketOwnershipControls

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Retrieves `OwnershipControls` for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use this operation, you must have
the `s3:GetBucketOwnershipControls` permission. For more information about Amazon S3 permissions,
see [Specifying\
permissions in a policy](../userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md).

###### Note

A bucket doesn't have `OwnershipControls` settings in the following cases:

- The bucket was created before the `BucketOwnerEnforced` ownership setting was
introduced and you've never explicitly applied this value

- You've manually deleted the bucket ownership control value using the
`DeleteBucketOwnershipControls` API operation.

By default, Amazon S3 sets `OwnershipControls` for all newly created buckets.

For information about Amazon S3 Object Ownership, see [Using Object Ownership](../userguide/about-object-ownership.md).

The following operations are related to `GetBucketOwnershipControls`:

- [PutBucketOwnershipControls](api-putbucketownershipcontrols.md)

- [DeleteBucketOwnershipControls](api-deletebucketownershipcontrols.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
