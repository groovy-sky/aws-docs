# QueryVectors

Performs an approximate nearest neighbor search query in a vector index using a query
vector. By default, it returns the keys of approximate nearest neighbors. You can
optionally include the computed distance (between the query vector and each vector in the
response), the vector data, and metadata of each vector in the response.

To specify the vector index, you can either use both the vector bucket name and the
vector index name, or use the vector index Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Permissions

You must have the `s3vectors:QueryVectors` permission to use this
operation. Additional permissions are required based on the request parameters you
specify:

- With only `s3vectors:QueryVectors` permission, you can
retrieve vector keys of approximate nearest neighbors and computed distances
between these vectors. This permission is sufficient only when you don't set
any metadata filters and don't request vector data or metadata (by keeping the
`returnMetadata` parameter set to
`false` or not specified).

- If you specify a metadata filter or set
`returnMetadata` to true, you must have both
`s3vectors:QueryVectors` and `s3vectors:GetVectors`
permissions. The request fails with a `403 Forbidden error` if
you request metadata filtering, vector data, or metadata without the
`s3vectors:GetVectors` permission.

{
   "filter": JSON value,
   "indexArn": "string",
   "indexName": "string",
   "queryVector": { ... },

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[filter](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

Metadata filter to apply during the query. For more information about metadata keys, see
[Metadata\
filtering](../userguide/s3-vectors-metadata-filtering.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: JSON value

Required: No

**[indexArn](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The ARN of the vector index that you want to query.

Type: String

Pattern: `arn:aws[-a-z0-9]*:s3vectors:[a-z0-9-]+:[0-9]{12}:bucket/[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-.]{1,61}[a-z0-9]/index/[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-.]{1,61}[a-z0-9]`

Required: No

**[indexName](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the vector index that you want to query.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 63.

Required: No

**[queryVector](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The query vector. Ensure that the query vector has the same dimension as the dimension
of the vector index that's being queried. For example, if your vector index contains
vectors with 384 dimensions, your query vector must also have 384 dimensions.

Type: [VectorData](api-s3vectorbuckets-vectordata.md) object

**Note:** This object is a Union. Only one member of this object can be specified or returned.

Required: Yes

**[returnDistance](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates whether to include the computed distance in the response. The default value is
`false`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[returnMetadata](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates whether to include metadata in the response. The default value is
`false`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[topK](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The number of results to return for each query.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.

Required: Yes

**[vectorBucketName](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the vector bucket that contains the vector index.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 63.

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-type: application/json

{
   "distanceMetric": "string",
   "vectors": [
      {
         "distance": number,
         "key": "string",
         "metadata": JSON value
      }
   ]
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[distanceMetric](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_ResponseSyntax)**

The distance metric that was used for the similarity search calculation. This is the same distance metric that was configured for the vector index when it was created.

Type: String

Valid Values: `euclidean | cosine`

**[vectors](#API_S3VectorBuckets_QueryVectors_ResponseSyntax)**

The vectors in the approximate nearest neighbor search.

Type: Array of [QueryOutputVector](api-s3vectorbuckets-queryoutputvector.md) objects

## Errors

**AccessDeniedException**

Access denied.

HTTP Status Code: 403

**InternalServerException**

The request failed due to an internal server error.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**KmsDisabledException**

The specified AWS KMS key isn't enabled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**KmsInvalidKeyUsageException**

The request was rejected for one of the following reasons:

- The `KeyUsage` value of the KMS key is incompatible with the API
operation.

- The encryption algorithm or signing algorithm specified for the operation is
incompatible with the type of key material in the KMS key
( `KeySpec`).

For more information, see [InvalidKeyUsageException](../../../../reference/kms/latest/apireference/api-encrypt.md#API_Encrypt_Errors) in the _AWS Key Management Service API_
_Reference_.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**KmsInvalidStateException**

The key state of the KMS key isn't compatible with the operation.

For more information, see [KMSInvalidStateException](../../../../reference/kms/latest/apireference/api-encrypt.md#API_Encrypt_Errors) in the _AWS Key Management Service API_
_Reference_.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**KmsNotFoundException**

The KMS key can't be found.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**NotFoundException**

The request was rejected because the specified resource can't be found.

HTTP Status Code: 404

**RequestTimeoutException**

The request timed out. Retry your request.

HTTP Status Code: 408

**ServiceUnavailableException**

The service is unavailable. Wait briefly and retry your request. If it continues to
fail, increase your waiting time between retries.

HTTP Status Code: 503

**TooManyRequestsException**

The request was denied due to request throttling.

HTTP Status Code: 429

**ValidationException**

The requested action isn't valid.

**fieldList**

A list of specific validation failures that are encountered during input processing. Each entry
in the list contains a path to the field that failed validation and a detailed message that
explains why the validation failed. To satisfy multiple constraints, a field can appear multiple times in this list if it
failed. You can use the information to identify and fix
the specific validation issues in your request.

HTTP Status Code: 400
