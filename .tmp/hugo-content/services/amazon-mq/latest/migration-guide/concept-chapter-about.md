# What is the Amazon MQ migration guide?

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that makes it easy to migrate to a message broker in the cloud.
Amazon MQ currently supports [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) engines.

Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ simplifies the migration of commercial brokers, such as IBM MQ and TIBCO
Enterprise Management Service (EMS), to the cloud. Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ brokers are compatible with popular APIs and protocols, such as
Java Message Service (JMS), allowing you to migrate applications with minimal code changes.
Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ offers cross-region data replication capabilities.

## Concepts for migrating to Amazon MQ

Before migrating, review the following key concepts to consider when migrating a commercial message
broker to Amazon MQ.

### Messaging protocols

You can connect your broker to Amazon MQ without any code changes if you currently use one
of the following industry-standard protocols:

- [AMQP](http://activemq.apache.org/amqp.html)

- [MQTT](http://activemq.apache.org/mqtt.html)

- MQTT over [WebSocket](http://activemq.apache.org/websockets.html)

- [OpenWire](http://activemq.apache.org/openwire.html)

- [STOMP](http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html)

- STOMP over WebSocket

For more information about
connecting
to an Amazon MQ managed broker, see
[Working\
Examples of Using Java Message Service (JMS) with\
ActiveMQ](../developer-guide/amazon-mq-working-java-example.md) in the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

### Message persistence

To replicate _persistence mode_ or _sync point_
_control_ options with Amazon MQ, you can deploy your brokers as [active/standby brokers](../developer-guide/active-standby-broker-deployment.md). In the active/standby deployment, brokers use
shared storage across multiple Availability Zones, with an optional time to live
(TTL).

For more information about how Amazon MQ ensures message durability, see [Availability options](#high-availability).

### Network options

Depending on the
interlopability
of your applications and the type of access that they need, you can
permit public access, [VPN\
access](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpc-vpn.md), or [VPC access](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.md) using
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
(Amazon VPC).

In a _hybrid architecture_ where on-premises systems
need access to resources in the cloud, we recommend setting up your Amazon MQ managed
brokers with
_public_
_network access_. You can also achieve a hybrid solution
by using
[Site-to-Site VPN](https://aws.amazon.com/vpn) or [Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect).

###### Tip

If your resources are primarily deployed within the
AWS
Cloud, we recommend configuring your Amazon MQ brokers with Amazon VPC.
For network access across multiple VPCs, you can use [VPC peering](../../../vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.md).

### Availability options

Amazon MQ supports durability-optimized brokers backed by [Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)](https://aws.amazon.com/efs). You can configure [single-instance\
brokers](../developer-guide/single-broker-deployment.md) (one broker in one Availability Zone) or [active/standby brokers](../developer-guide/active-standby-broker-deployment.md) (two brokers in two different Availability Zones).
In either configuration, Amazon MQ can automatically provision infrastructure for high
message durability by storing messages redundantly across multiple Availability
Zones.

###### Note

In the event of a broker or Availability Zone failure, active/standby brokers
automatically
fail
over to a standby instance in another Availability Zone.

To achieve high availability and message durability, you can use a [network of brokers](../developer-guide/network-of-brokers.md). A network of brokers is a series of simultaneously
active single-instance or active/standby brokers that allows you to rapidly scale your
throughput and connection count. You can configure a network of brokers in a variety of
topologies depending on your application's needs.

### Messaging patterns

Amazon MQ offers the following topology options to support a variety of messaging
patterns:

- Point-to-point

- Request-response

- Hub and spoke

- Mesh

- Enterprise service bus

For more information about using Amazon MQ to set up the right broker topology for your
cloud architecture, see [Amazon MQ Broker\
Architecture](../developer-guide/amazon-mq-broker-architecture.md) in the _Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

###### Important

Revising a broker configuration or an ActiveMQ user does
not
immediately apply those changes. For your changes to take effect, you must wait for
the next maintenance window or reboot the broker. For more information, see [Amazon MQ Broker Configuration Lifecycle](../developer-guide/amazon-mq-broker-configuration-lifecycle.md) in the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

### Performance and scalability

With Amazon MQ you can scale your messaging middleware horizontally, vertically, or in a
hybrid
model.

_Horizontal scaling_
enables
you to increase your throughput and connection count without interruptions, because your
resources remain active and online. To scale horizontally, you can deploy a [network of brokers](../developer-guide/network-of-brokers.md) in an active/standby configuration across multiple
Availability Zones.

To
scale your resources _vertically_, you can
increase the compute capacity of your broker instances from
`mq.t2.micro`
(1 vCPU and 1 GiB) up to `mq.m5.4xlarge` (16 vCPU and 64
GiB). For more information about Amazon MQ instance types, see [Instance\
Types](../developer-guide/broker.md#broker-instance-types) in the _Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

###### Note

Choosing
larger broker instance types might not improve overall system throughput. Overall
latency is due to many factors, such as message size, the type of protocol, the
number of active producers and consumers, consumption speed, and message
persistence.

Amazon MQ also supports creating throughput-optimized message brokers backed by [Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs). These brokers are ideal for
applications such as high-volume order processing, stock trading, and text
processing.

To instruct Amazon MQ to optimize for queues with slow consumers, set the
`concurrentStorageAndDispatchQueues` attribute to
`false`.

The following table shows the throughput of an `mq.m5.2xlarge` broker
configured with these options:

- **Broker instance** –
`mq.m5.2xlarge`

- **Persistent** – `TRUE`

- **Client** – `m5.xlarge`

- **CSAD** –
`TRUE`

- **Protocol** –
OpenWire

###### Note

Performance numbers can vary depending on multiple configuration parameters. For
more information on Amazon MQ throughput measurements, see [Throughput Benchmarks](chapter-benchmarks.md).

You can measure the throughput of your Amazon MQ brokers using [JMS\
Benchmark](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/measuring-the-throughput-for-amazon-mq-using-the-jms-benchmark).

### Latency

You can set up your Amazon MQ brokers for low-latency messaging, with latency often as low
as single-digit milliseconds. Use an _always-on_ connection to help
reduce the amount of time that it takes to deliver messages to a consumer.

Using _in-memory_ storage can further reduce overall latency across
your messaging architecture. For more information on how different storage types can
affect latency, see [Differences Between Storage Types](../developer-guide/broker-storage.md#differences-between-storage-types) in the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

### Destination options

You can set up Amazon MQ managed brokers as _queues_ or
_topics_. Amazon MQ queues are, by default, _first in, first out (FIFO)_
queues,
also known as ordered queues. You can scale FIFO queues using [Message Groups](https://activemq.apache.org/message-groups). You can
configure your broker destinations with _at-least-once delivery_,
_at-most-once delivery_, or _exactly-once_
_delivery_ options.

Topics in Amazon MQ use the _publisher/subscriber_ pattern and can be
durable or non-durable. Amazon MQ topics also support [Virtual\
Destinations](https://activemq.apache.org/virtual-destinations.html), where publishers broadcast messages to a pool of subscribers
through queues. We recommend using this method instead of durable topics.

###### Tip

You can optimize and fine-tune the performance of your topics. For more
information, see [Performance Tuning](https://activemq.apache.org/performance-tuning.html)
on
the Apache ActiveMQ website.

### Security and authentication

With Amazon MQ you control who is
allowed
to create or modify brokers, and which applications are allowed to send and receive
messages. For more information about authentication options, and how to integrate the
[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://ldap.com/)
with your Amazon MQ brokers, see [Messaging Authentication and Authorization for ActiveMQ](../developer-guide/security-authentication-authorization.md) in the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

Connections to Amazon MQ brokers use Transport Layer Security (TLS). To isolate your
brokers in a private virtual network, you can restrict access to a private endpoint
within a
VPC.
To control network access to your brokers, you can configure security groups in the VPC.
For more information, see [Security Best\
Practices for Amazon MQ](../developer-guide/using-amazon-mq-securely.md) in the _Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

Amazon MQ encrypts messages at rest and in transit using encryption keys that it manages
and stores securely in [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms).
AWS KMS
helps reduce the operational burden and complexity involved in protecting sensitive
data. With encryption at rest, you can build security-sensitive
applications that meet encryption compliance and regulatory requirements.

###### Tip

For additional security, we highly recommend designing your application to use
[client-side\
encryption](../../../../reference/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.md).

For more information about Amazon MQ security and how messaging data is encrypted, see
[Data Protection in Amazon MQ](../developer-guide/data-protection.md) in the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

### Broker quotas

By default, each Amazon MQ broker can support 1,000 connections (or 100 connections for
`mq.t2.micro` brokers). To allow multiple consumers to share connections
to your Amazon MQ brokers and to improve overall performance, we recommend using
_pooled connections_. For more information, see [Always Use Connection Pooling](../developer-guide/connecting-to-amazon-mq.md#always-use-connection-pooling) in the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

You can request an increase for many [broker\
usage quotas](../developer-guide/amazon-mq-limits.md#broker-limits) for your AWS account. For more information, see [AWS service\
quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md) in the _AWS General Reference_.

### Configuration options

Amazon MQ supports standard JMS features including
point-to-point
(message
queues),
publish-subscribe (topics), request/reply, persistent and
non-persistent modes, JMS transactions, and distributed (XA)
transactions.

Amazon MQ brokers can also support more complex messaging patterns such
as composite destinations, which enable producers to send the same message to multiple
destinations, and virtual destinations, which enable publishers to broadcast messages
via a topic to a pool of receivers subscribing through queues.

For more information, see [Amazon MQ Broker Configuration Parameters](../developer-guide/amazon-mq-broker-configuration-parameters.md) in the
_Amazon MQ Developer Guide_.

### Cost estimation

With Amazon MQ, you pay only for the provisioned capacity that you use. Factors such as
broker instance type, the amount of data stored on each broker instance,
and the AWS Region in which you deploy your brokers can affect your total cost of ownership.
To estimate your broker costs for Amazon MQ, you can us the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/).

###### Note

For data transferred in and out of Amazon MQ, you pay standard AWS data transfer
charges.

To get started, Amazon MQ offers a Free Tier, which includes up to 750 hours of a
single-instance `mq.t2.micro`
or
`mq.t3.micro` broker per month, and up to 5 GB of
durability-optimized storage per month for one year. For more
information on the Free Tier, pricing, and associated costs, see [Amazon MQ Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/pricing).
