# Creating and applying RabbitMQ broker configurations

A _configuration_ contains all of the settings for your RabbitMQ broker in Cuttlefish format. You can create a configuration before creating any brokers. You can then apply the configuration to one or more brokers

The following examples show how you can create and apply a RabbitMQ broker configuration
using the AWS Management Console.

###### Important

You can only **delete**
a configuration using the `DeleteConfiguration` API.
For more information,
see [Configurations](../api-reference/configurations-configuration-id.md)
in the _Amazon MQ API Reference_.

## Create a New Configuration

To apply a configuration to your broker, you must first create the configuration.

1. Sign in to the [Amazon MQ console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq).

2. On the left, expand the navigation panel and choose
    **Configurations**.

![Amazon MQ navigation panel showing Brokers and Configurations options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/images/amazon-mq-tutorials-create-configuration.png)

3. On the **Configurations** page, choose **Create**
**configuration**.

4. On the **Create configuration** page, in the
    **Details** section, type the **Configuration**
**name** (for example, `MyConfiguration`) and select a
    **Broker engine** version.

To learn more about RabbitMQ engine versions supported by Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ, see [Managing Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ engine versions](rabbitmq-version-management.md).

5. Choose **Create configuration**.

## Create a New Configuration Revision

After you create a configuration, you must edit the configuration using
a configuration revision.

1. From the configuration list, choose
    **`MyConfiguration`**.

###### Note

The first configuration revision is always created for you when Amazon MQ
creates the configuration.

On the **`MyConfiguration`**
    page, the broker engine type and version that your new configuration
    revision uses (for example, **RabbitMQ 3.xx.xx**) are
    displayed.

2. On the **Configuration details** tab, the configuration
    revision number, description, and broker configuration in Cuttlefish format are displayed.

###### Note

Editing the current configuration creates a new configuration revision.

3. Choose **Edit configuration** and make changes to the Cuttlefish configuration.

4. Choose **Save**.

The **Save revision** dialog box is displayed.

5. (Optional) Type `A description of the changes in this revision`.

6. Choose **Save**.

The new revision of the configuration is saved.

###### Important

Making changes to a configuration does _not_ apply the changes to the broker immediately.
To apply your changes, you must wait for the next maintenance window
or [reboot the broker](amazon-mq-rebooting-broker.md).

Currently, you can't delete a configuration.

## Apply a Configuration Revision to Your Broker

After creating the configuration revision, you can apply the configuration
revision to your broker.

1. On the left, expand the navigation panel and choose
    **Brokers**.

![Amazon MQ navigation panel showing Brokers and Configurations options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/images/amazon-mq-tutorials-apply-configuration.png)

2. From the broker list, select your broker (for example, **MyBroker**) and then choose **Edit**.

3. On the **Edit `MyBroker`** page, in the
    **Configuration** section, select a **Configuration**
    and a **Revision** and then choose **Schedule Modifications**.

4. In the **Schedule broker modifications** section, choose whether to apply modifications
    **During the next scheduled maintenance window** or **Immediately**.

###### Important

Single instance brokers are offline while being rebooted. For cluster brokers,
only one node is down at a time while the broker reboots.

5. Choose **Apply**.

Your configuration revision is applied to your
    broker at the specified time.
