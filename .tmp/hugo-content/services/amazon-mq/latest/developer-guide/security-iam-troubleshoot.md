# Troubleshooting Amazon MQ identity and access

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with Amazon MQ and IAM.

## I Am Not Authorized to Perform an Action in Amazon MQ

If the AWS Management Console tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then you
must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person that
provided you with your sign-in credentials.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` user
tries to use the console to view details about a `widget` but
does not have `mq:GetWidget`
permissions.

```nohighlight

User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: mq:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget
```

In this case, Mateo asks his administrator to update his policies to allow him to
access the `my-example-widget` resource using the
`mq:GetWidget`
action.

## I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to Amazon MQ.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
Amazon MQ. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.

```nohighlight

User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon MQ resources

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.

To learn more, consult the following:

- To learn whether Amazon MQ supports these features, see [How Amazon MQ works with IAM](security-iam-service-with-iam.md).

- To learn how to provide access to your resources across AWS accounts that you own, see [Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you\
own](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-common-scenarios-aws-accounts.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- To learn how to provide access to your resources to third-party AWS accounts, see [Providing access to AWS accounts owned by third parties](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-common-scenarios-third-party.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- To learn how to provide access through identity federation, see [Providing access to externally authenticated users (identity federation)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-common-scenarios-federated-users.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- To learn the difference between using roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-cross-account-resource-access.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.
