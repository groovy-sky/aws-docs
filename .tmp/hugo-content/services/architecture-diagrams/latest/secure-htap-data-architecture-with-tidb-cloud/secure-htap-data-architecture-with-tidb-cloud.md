# Secure HTAP Data Architecture Using TiDB Cloud

Publication date: **June 13, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This reference architecture outlines a modern hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) data stack on AWS. It uses TiDB, an advanced, open-source, distributed SQL database that powers REST and GraphQL APIs, and near real-time analytics.

1. Create RESTful microservices using **Amazon API Gateway** or
    **AWS AppSync** and **AWS Lambda**.
    It can use TiDB Cloud as the online transactional
    processing (OLTP) database. **Lambda** receives all requests and sends them to
    the TiDB Server using an **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud** (Amazon VPC) endpoint.

2. Powered by **AWS PrivateLink**, the endpoint connection is secure and
    private and does not expose your data to the public internet. The **AWS PrivateLink**
    connection also supports a secure connection between VPCs with overlapping
    Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).

3. Equipped with a massively parallel processing (MPP) engine, TiDB can efficiently handle
    both OLTP and online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads. TiDB uses row-based storage
    (TiKV) for OLTP workloads and column-based storage (TiFlash) for OLAP workloads. Data is
    asynchronously replicated to TiFlash using an extended Raft consensus algorithm for strong
    consistency. TiFlash is a separate set of nodes that isolates workloads and performance
    impact on the OLTP system.

4. Build business intelligence (BI) reports using **Amazon Quick**.
    Queries on TiDB are internally routed to TiFlash and optimized to handle analytical
    workloads. TiDB provides unified architecture and zero-ETL integration between
    OLTP and OLAP workloads.
