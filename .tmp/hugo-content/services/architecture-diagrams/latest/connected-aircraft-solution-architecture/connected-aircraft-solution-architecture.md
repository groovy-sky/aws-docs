1. Flight (avionics) and telemetry (sensor) data is collected by **AWS IoT Greengrass**, running on the flight-data acquisition unit on board.

2. Near real-time events are anonymized and sent to Flight Operations on the ground.
    Flight data is offloaded to **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) with aircraft
    at the gate and analyzed by the Flight Operations Team for fuel burn optimization, fault
    analysis, and other use cases.

3. Engine flight data is processed and analyzed with **Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink** for engine health maintenance and the Flight
    Operations Team notified of any anomalies.

4. Anonymized flight and fault data is aggregated using **Amazon Athena** and stored in an **Amazon S3**
    data lake.

5. Models trained from aggregated flight and fault data are deployed to **AWS IoT Greengrass** on the aircraft for Machine Learning inference driving predictive
    maintenance.

6. App developers build new digital solutions for the connected ecosystem using **Amazon API Gateway**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Athena**.

7. Anonymized data is offered to third-party developers on a subscription basis with **AWS Data Exchange**.

8. Fleet–wide analytics is performed by the Engine Health Management team by querying processed
    flight data using **Amazon Quick** and **Athena**.
