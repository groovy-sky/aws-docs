# Wafer Inspection with Machine Learning

Publication date: **September 16, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture shows you how computer vision wafer inspection accelerates defect detection and reduces human error in detecting (ring/scratch and so on), improving fab productivity.

1. Users upload images from wafer inspection to an **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket through a web user interface (UI) using transfer
    acceleration.

2. **Amazon S3** calls an **AWS Lambda** function, logging the new image location in an **DynamoDB** table.

3. The web interface calls an **Amazon API Gateway**
    instance with the images metadata, which is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB** by a second **Lambda** function.

4. The **Lambda** function calls **Amazon SageMaker AI** for inference. Amazon Elastic Inference lowers the cost of
    inference by only attaching a graphics processing unit (GPU) when data needs to be
    processed.

5. The **Lambda** function adds the Inference results to the
    **Amazon DynamoDB** table.

6. Users are notified in the UI of detected defects. The UI fetches the image and
    metadata of the defected wafer from **Amazon API Gateway**. Wafers without defects move faster to the next
    step.

7. To accelerate user access to the image and inference results **Amazon CloudFront** caches both static content and API calls.

8. **Amazon S3** lifecycle policies move older images to cold
    storage for cost optimization.

9. Images analyzed by engineers are added to the next model-training datasets to improve inference accuracy.
