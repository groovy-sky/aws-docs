# Serverless In-Game Screenshot Processor Pipeline for Game Studios

Publication date: **December 23, 2021 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture helps you build a serverless image processing pipeline for your games that receives players’ in-game screenshots, checks them for profanity, performs transformation, and stores them in the cloud. The processed images can be retrieved for the players’ gallery by the game client and the community site.

## Serverless In-Game Screenshot Processor Pipeline for Game Studios

![Reference architecture diagram showing how you can use AWS services to build a serverless image processing pipeline for your games that receives players’ in-game screenshots, checks them for profanity, performs transformation, and stores them in the cloud.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/serverless-in-game-screenshot-processor-pipeline-game-studios/images/serverless-in-game-studios.png)

01. Players take screenshots in-game, which invokes an API to upload those screenshots. The game client needs to send player metadata to the application program interface (API).

02. An **Amazon API Gateway** instance hosts the REST API for the
     image uploader and processor function.

03. It is recommended to use an authentication method such as **Amazon Cognito** to authenticate all requests processed by **API Gateway**.

    **API Gateway** also supports custom authorization using an
     **AWS Lambda** function to perform the authentication with
     an external identity provider.

04. An **AWS Lambda** function is invoked by the **API Gateway** to receive the image and pre-process it.

05. As part of pre-processing, the image is sent to the **Amazon Rekognition** `DetectModerationLabels` API.

06. You can send a notification for the result of the filtering process to your user
     through **Amazon Simple Notification Service** (Amazon SNS).

07. Optionally, the raw image can be stored in an **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket.

08. The _image processor_ **Lambda** function can perform transformations/resizing of
     the image and add watermarks. The processed image is uploaded to an S3 bucket meant for
     processed screenshots.

09. The **image processor** **Lambda** function extracts the associated in-game metadata (such as player ID,
     timestamp, and in-game location) in the request object. The metadata is then stored
     in **Amazon DynamoDB**. The image’s associated S3 key is also
     included in the same **DynamoDB** item. This step completes the
     image processing portion of this pipeline.

10. The community site and game client might want to retrieve the stored screenshots to
     present the gallery of images to players by retrieving the URLs stored in **DynamoDB**. To retrieve the image, the client or community site
     initiates a request using **API Gateway**.

11. The retrieval request invokes the image retrieval **Lambda** function, which gets the associated item from **DynamoDB**, which contains the S3 key for the image. Optionally, you can use
     **DynamoDB** Accelerator to cache your read requests.

12. The game client and community site requests the image from **CloudFront** content delivery network (CDN) fronting the S3 bucket to serve the
     screenshots.
