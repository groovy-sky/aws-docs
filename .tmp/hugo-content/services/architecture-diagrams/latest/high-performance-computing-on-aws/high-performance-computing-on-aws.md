# High Performance Computing on AWS

Publication date: **September 1, 2021 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture enables you to deploy and burst a suite of high performance computing (HPC) cases to the cloud directly from the desktop.

## High Performance Computing on AWS

![Reference architecture diagram showing how you can use AWS services to deploy and burst a suite of high performance computing (HPC) cases to the cloud directly from the desktop.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/high-performance-computing-on-aws/images/high-performance-computing.png)

1. Users deploy HPC cases with one of the AWS SDKs or the **AWS Command Line Interface** (AWS CLI). Users can interface directly with the cluster through
    NICE DCV.

2. Data is staged both to and from AWS with **Amazon Simple Storage Service**
    (Amazon S3). **Amazon S3** offers low-cost, reliable storage while
    interfacing directly to **Amazon FSx for Lustre** for a fully
    managed, high-performance storage.

3. Serverless services manage case workflow. **AWS Step Functions**
    provides workflow management and orchestrates other services, such as serverless compute
    with **AWS Lambda**. **AWS Systems Manager** can be used for operational management of compute clusters.

4. **AWS ParallelCluster**, **AWS Batch**, and custom-made clusters lie at the core of the HPC
    infrastructure, each with access to high-performance **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (Amazon EC2) instances connected by a high performance network with an
    optional Elastic Fabric Adapter. Cost optimization with Amazon EC2 is achieved with
    payment-model choice and environment right sizing

5. Manage applications with a consistent, versioned, and repeatable framework. AWS Developer Tools accelerate software development. Installed software can be stored in containers or snapshots, depending on the compute cluster.
