# AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard

Publication date: **April 12, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture automates the process of ingesting, analyzing, and visualizing continuous
integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) metrics. This architecture can also
be [deployed on AWS](../../../solutions/latest/aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard/welcome.md) using an CloudFormation template that
launches, configures, and runs the AWS services required to deploy this solution using AWS best
practices for security and availability.

## AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard

![Reference architecture diagram showing how you can use AWS services to ingest, analyze, and visualize continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) metrics.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard/images/aws-devops-monitoring-dashboard.png)

1. An **Amazon EventBridge** events rule detects the events based on
    predefined event patterns and then sends the event data to an **Amazon Data Firehose** delivery stream. One event rule is created per event source. For
    activities in **AWS CodeBuild**, a **CloudWatch** metric stream is set up to capture **CloudWatch** metrics and deliver them to a **Firehose**
    delivery stream. For GitHub push events, an Amazon API endpoint is created to post these
    events and deliver them to a **Firehose** delivery
    stream.

2. An **Amazon EventBridge** events rule is also created to capture
    events from an **Amazon CloudWatch** alarm that monitors the status of
    an **CloudWatch** synthetics canary, if you have set up the canary
    and alarm in your account. This alarm is needed to gather data for calculating Mean Time
    to Recovery (MTTR) metrics.

3. **Firehose** uses an **Lambda**
    function for data transformation. The **Lambda** function
    extracts relevant data to each metric and sends it to an **Amazon S3** bucket for downstream processing.

4. The data in **Amazon S3** is linked to an **Amazon Athena** database, which runs queries against this data and
    returns query results to **Quick**.

5. **Quick** obtains the query results and builds dashboard
    visualizations for your management team.
