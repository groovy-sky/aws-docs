# Modernize Applications with Microservices Using Amazon EKS

Publication date: **July 24, 2023 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture enables you to integrate Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with VMware Cloud on AWS. Use AWS DevOps tools to accelerate
application modernization.

## Modernize Applications with Microservices Using Amazon EKS Diagram

![Reference architecture diagram showing how to integrate Amazon EKS with VMware Cloud on AWS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/architecture-diagrams/latest/modernize-applications-with-microservices-using-amazon-eks/images/modernize-applications-with-microservices-using-amazon-eks.png)

01. The Elastic Network Interface is automatically attached to the **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud**
     (Amazon EC2) bare metal (ESXi) hosts in VMware Cloud on AWS during the software-defined data center (SDDC) provisioning.

02. Provision fully managed **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** (Amazon EKS) clusters for different
     environments (dev/test/production).

03. Use tools such as **AWS App2Container** (App2Container) to accelerate
     refactoring/rearchitecting applications into containerized microservices. Use
     **Amazon EKS** to manage and automate the testing and deployment
     of container workloads.

04. Transform and containerize legacy systems to modern applications with minimal
     disruptions. The existing database tier can keep running on **VMware Cloud on AWS**
     to avoid the complexity and delay of database migrations.

05. **Network Load Balancer** integrates with the Kubernetes Ingress
     Controller, providing a secure and consistent approach for exposing applications.

06. **Amazon Route 53** resolves incoming requests to
     **Network Load Balancer** in the primary AWS Region.

07. The dev team commits code to an **AWS CodeCommit** repository, which
     initiates **AWS CodePipeline** to start processing the code changes through the pipeline.

08. **AWS CodeBuild** packages the code changes and dependencies and builds a Docker image.

09. The new Docker image is pushed to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry** (Amazon ECR).

10. **CodeBuild** uses a Kubectl command line tool to invoke
     Kubernetes API and update the image tag for the microservice deployment.

11. Kubernetes performs a rolling update of the pods in the application deployment
     according to the new docker image specified in **Amazon ECR**.
