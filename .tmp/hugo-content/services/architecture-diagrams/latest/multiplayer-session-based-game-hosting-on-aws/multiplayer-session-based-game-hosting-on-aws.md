01. The game client requests an **Amazon Cognito** identity and
     temporary AWS credentials.

02. The client signs a matchmaking request to **API Gateway** with
     the temporary credentials. The request includes client latency information to supported
     AWS Regions.

03. **API Gateway** calls an **AWS Lambda** function with player identity information.

04. The **Lambda** function gets the player skill level from a
     **DynamoDB** table.

05. The **Lambda** function requests matchmaking from
     **Amazon GameLift Servers FlexMatch** with player skill and latency
     data.

06. **Amazon GameLift Servers FlexMatch** creates a match with multiple
     players, and an **Amazon GameLift Servers** queue allocates a session in an
     **Amazon GameLift Servers** fleet location based on the latency
     data.

07. **Amazon GameLift Servers FlexMatch** publishes an event to **Amazon SNS** on matchmaking success.

08. **Amazon SNS** triggers a subscribed **Lambda** function for ticket processing.

09. The **Lambda** function stores the ticket result in a
     **DynamoDB** table.

10. The game client polls for matchmaking success on a defined interval from **API Gateway**.

11. The **Lambda** function checks matchmaking information
     from the **DynamoDB** table and informs the client of a
     successful match by returning server IP, port, and player session ID.

12. The client connects directly to the server and sends the player session ID. The
     **Amazon GameLift Servers Server SDK** is used to validate the player
     session.

13. Game servers send logs and metrics to **Amazon CloudWatch** with
     the **CloudWatch** agent.
