# Connected Mobility Platform

Publication date: **December 13, 2022 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This architecture addresses three elements of the connected platform: in-vehicle, external infrastructure, and backend services on the cloud. The adoption of serverless architecture will help to reduce the operational overhead for the connected mobility platform.

1. Use an **AWS IoT FleetWise** edge agent and **AWS IoT Core** to
    send and receive data from the cloud. **AWS IoT Greengrass** can host the edge
    components and is used for machine learning (ML) at the edge.

2. Use **AWS IoT Device Management** to onboard vehicles and manage lifecycles. Perform remote
    operations with **AWS IoT Device Shadow service**.

3. An **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) bucket stores raw telemetry data and meaningful
    values from **Amazon Timestream**. **Amazon DynamoDB**
    stores aggregated data and **AWS Lake Formation** governs the data lake.

4. **AWS Data Exchange** and **Amazon API Gateway** expose service
    and data APIs for internal and external use.

5. **Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink** generates alerts and insight in near real time.

6. Personalize use cases with **Amazon Rekognition** and develop custom models
    with **Amazon SageMaker AI** for preventive or predictive use cases.

7. Create a fleet management portal for fleet operators to monitor vehicles in near
    real time using **Amazon Location Service**.

8. **Amazon Connect** and **Amazon Chime** enable
    the call center. You can visualize call insights through **Amazon Quick**.
