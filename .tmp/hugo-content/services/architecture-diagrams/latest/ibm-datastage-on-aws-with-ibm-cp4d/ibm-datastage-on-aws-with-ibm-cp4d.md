1. Data is collected from multiple data sources across the enterprise data bases
    and **AWS Cloud** data stores, such as **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3)
    and **Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)**.

2. [IBM DataStage](https://www.ibm.com/products/datastage) for IBM Cloud Pak for Data (IBM CP4D), an integration tool that
    helps jobs move and transfer data from multiple data sources, is built on a **Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS** (ROSA) platform.

3. You can use [IBM DB2 Warehouse](https://www.ibm.com/products/db2/warehouse) to
    store and analyze large amounts of data. Data from multiple data sources uses in-memory capability to
    process and provide sales and marketing analytics.

4. Use IBM DB2 Warehouse data mart to deliver high-performance complex analytics and the
    processed data with facts and dimensions for reporting and analytics.

5. IBM CP4D runs as a container workload running on OpenShift. **ROSA** is a fully
    managed OpenShift implementation on **AWS**. Red Hat site reliability
    engineering (SRE) teams manage the OpenShift clusters, allowing customers to focus on
    other critical business aspects.

6. Marketing and finance users access the data from data marts and build visualization and dashboards
    using tools like IBM Cognos Analytics and **Amazon Quick**.

7. Users can create self-service data access and business and compliance reports.
    Data from data marts helps users self-serve analytics with scale and performance.
