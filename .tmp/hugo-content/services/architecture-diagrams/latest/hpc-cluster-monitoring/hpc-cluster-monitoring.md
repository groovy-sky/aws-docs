# Cross-Account Amazon EC2 Status Monitoring for HPC Clusters

Publication date: **February 22, 2024 ( [Diagram history](#diagram-history))**

This reference architecture demonstrates how to build a mechanism to
monitor [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2) (Amazon EC2) state changes for high performance computing
(HPC) clusters across multiple AWS accounts. It includes a dashboard to
help monitor the cluster status as well as each individual Amazon EC2 instance's
status.

The following two use cases might use this architecture:

- A customer organization has many separate divisions using separate AWS accounts
deploying elastic Amazon EC2-based HPC clusters. A central IT admin group wants to
monitor these resources in real time from a single centralized source to better
manage workflows and to be aware of current resource use.

- A third-party partner is managing HPC deployments in a customer account, but wants to help
the customer meter usage, create budgets, send notifications, and improve overall visibility
into their HPC use. The customers don’t want to share all logs and activities within an
account with the partner, only the relevant HPC resources.

1. In this diagram, there are two types of AWS accounts:

- **HPC cluster account(s)** \- These accounts are where the **Amazon EC2** instance-based HPC compute clusters are deployed.

- **Centralized monitoring account** \- This is a centralized account where one or more HPC cluster accounts sends cluster notification statuses.

These are **Amazon EC2** instances to be monitored. When the
[instance state changes](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/monitoring-instances-status-check.md)
(start, stop, terminate), it sends the status of related events to [**Amazon EventBridge**](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge).

2. **EventBridge** events are filtered by an [**Amazon EC2** tag](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-tags.md),
    and only those matching the
    tag string are passed to the monitoring account in the form of a **Amazon CloudWatch** log. You need to have
    an **Amazon EC2** tag attached (by default, the _HPC_ tag) in order to be
    monitored. This limits the volume and type account activity being shared with the centralized monitoring account.

3. Once events are logged in [**Amazon CloudWatch Logs**](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/whatiscloudwatchlogs.md)
    in the HPC cluster account, it shares these logs with the centralized monitoring account by enabling the
    [cross-account observability](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-cloudwatch-cross-account-observability)
    feature in **Amazon CloudWatch**.

4. Monitor the latest cluster status in the **CloudWatch** dashboard. A dashboard is preconfigured and deployed
    into the centralized monitoring account as a part of the deployment.
