1. **Amazon CloudWatch** is scheduled to invoke
    **AWS Lambda** at a set intervals (such as
    monthly or quarterly).

2. **LambdaLambda** is invoked and starts to
    compute resources.

3. An **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud** (Amazon EC2) compute instance is
    started.

4. Precisely datasets are updated at established intervals. Automatic Data
    Downloader monitors changes and automatically downloads data from Precisely
    Data Experience into **Amazon Simple Storage Service** (Amazon S3) in a
    variety of formats, including flat files (.txt, .csv), spatial data (.shp,
    .tab), and geocoding reference data (.spd).

5. Use **Amazon S3** to get the Geo Addressing SDK
    from Precisely Fulfillment.

6. Reference data is downloaded to your **Amazon S3** bucket.

7. Reference data and SDKs are ready to be used for geo addressing on
    **Amazon SageMaker AI** or **Amazon EMR** Studio.
