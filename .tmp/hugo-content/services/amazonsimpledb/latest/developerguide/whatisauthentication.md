# What Is Authentication?

Authentication is a process for identifying and verifying who is sending a request. The
following diagram shows a simplified version of an authentication process.

General Process of Authentication

![Red circle with number 1 inside, indicating a numerical step or priority.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/callouts/1.png)

The sender obtains the necessary credential.

![Red circle with number 2 inside, likely representing a step or item in a sequence.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/callouts/2.png)

The sender sends a request with the credential to the
recipient.

The recipient uses the credential to verify the sender truly sent the
request.

If yes, the recipient processes the request. If no, the recipient rejects
the request and responds accordingly.

During authentication, AWS verifies both the identity of the sender and
whether the sender is registered to use services offered by AWS. If either test fails, the request
is not processed further.

The subsequent sections describe how Amazon SimpleDB implements authentication to protect you and your
customers' data.
