# Working with shards in ElastiCache

A shard (API/CLI: node group) is a collection of one to six ElastiCache for Valkey or Redis OSS nodes.
A Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) cluster will never have more than one shard. With shards, you can separate large databases into smaller, faster,
and more easily managed parts called data shards. This can increase database efficiency by
distributing operations across multiple separate sections. Using shards can offer many benefits including
improved performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.

You can create a cluster with higher number of shards and lower number of replicas totaling up to 90 nodes per cluster.
This cluster configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number of replicas allowed.
The cluster's data is partitioned across the cluster's shards.
If there is more than one node in a shard, the shard implements replication
with one node being the read/write primary node and the other nodes read-only
replica nodes.

The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the engine version is Valkey 7.2 and higher, or Redis OSS 5.0.6 to 7.1. For example, you can choose to configure a 500 node cluster that ranges between
83 shards (one primary and 5 replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single primary and no replicas). Make sure there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase.
Common pitfalls include the subnets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or the subnets are shared and heavily used by other clusters. For more information, see
[Creating a subnet group](subnetgroups-creating.md).

For versions below 5.0.6,
the limit is 250 per cluster.

To request a limit increase, see
[AWS service limits](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md)
and choose the limit type **Nodes per cluster per instance type**.

When you create a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster using the ElastiCache console,
you specify the number of shards in the cluster and the number of
nodes in the shards. For more information, see [Creating a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster (Console)](clusters-create.md#Clusters.Create.CON.RedisCluster).
If you use the ElastiCache API or AWS CLI to create a cluster (called _replication group_ in the API/CLI), you
can configure the number of nodes in a shard (API/CLI: node group)
independently. For more information, see the following:

- API: CreateReplicationGroup

- CLI: create-replication-group

Each node in a shard has the same compute, storage and memory specifications.
The ElastiCache API lets you control shard-wide attributes, such as the number of nodes,
security settings, and system maintenance windows.

## Finding a shard's ID

You can find a shard's ID using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI or the ElastiCache API.

### Using the AWS Management Console

###### Topics

- [For Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Disabled)](#shard-find-id-con-classic)

- [For Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Enabled)](#shard-find-id-con-cluster)

#### For Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Disabled)

Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication group shard IDs are always `0001`.

#### For Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Enabled)

The following procedure uses the AWS Management Console to find a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)'s replication group's
shard ID.

###### To find the shard ID in a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ElastiCache console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Valkey** or **Redis OSS**, then choose the name of the
    Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group you want to find the shard IDs
    for.

3. In the **Shard Name** column, the shard ID is the last four digits of
    the shard name.

### Using the AWS CLI

To find shard (node group) ids for either Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) or Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication
groups use the AWS CLI operation `describe-replication-groups` with the following
optional parameter.

- **`--replication-group-id`**—An optional parameter
which when used limits the output to the details of the specified replication group. If this
parameter is omitted, the details of up to 100 replication groups is returned.

###### Example

This command returns the details for `sample-repl-group`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache describe-replication-groups \
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache describe-replication-groups ^
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group
```

Output from this command looks something like this. The shard (node group) ids are
`highlighted` here to make finding them easier.

To find shard (node group) ids for either Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) or Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication
groups use the AWS CLI operation `describe-replication-groups` with the following
optional parameter.

- **`ReplicationGroupId`**—An optional parameter
which when used limits the output to the details of the specified replication group. If this
parameter is omitted, the details of up to `xxx` replication groups is
returned.

###### Example

This command returns the details for `sample-repl-group`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight
