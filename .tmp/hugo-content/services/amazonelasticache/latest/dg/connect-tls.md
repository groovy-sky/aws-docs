# Connecting to ElastiCache (Valkey) or Amazon ElastiCache for Redis OSS with in-transit encryption using valkey-cli

To access data from ElastiCache for Redis OSS caches enabled with in-transit encryption, you use clients that work with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). You can also use valkey-cli with TLS/SSL on Amazon Linux and Amazon Linux 2.
If your client does not support TLS, you can use the `stunnel` command on your client host to create an SSL tunnel to the Redis OSS nodes.

## Encrypted connection with Linux

To use valkey-cli to connect to a Valkey or Redis OSS cluster enabled with in-transit encryption on Amazon Linux 2 or Amazon Linux, follow these steps.

1. Download and compile the valkey-cli utility. This utility is included in the Valkey software distribution.

2. At the command prompt of your EC2 instance, type the appropriate commands for the version of Linux you are using.

**Amazon Linux 2**

If using Amazon Linux 2, enter this:

```nohighlight

sudo yum -y install openssl-devel gcc
wget -O valkey-7.2.6.tar.gz https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/archive/refs/tags/7.2.6.tar.gz
tar xvzf valkey-7.2.6.tar.gz
cd valkey-7.2.6
make distclean
make valkey-cli BUILD_TLS=yes
sudo install -m 755 src/valkey-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

**Amazon Linux**

If using Amazon Linux, enter this:

```nohighlight

sudo yum install gcc jemalloc-devel openssl-devel tcl tcl-devel clang wget
wget -O valkey-8.0.0.tar.gz https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/archive/refs/tags/8.0.0.tar.gz
tar xvzf valkey-8.0.0.tar.gz
cd valkey-8.0.0
make valkey-cli CC=clang BUILD_TLS=yes
sudo install -m 755 src/valkey-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

On Amazon Linux, you may also need to run the following additional steps:

```

sudo yum install clang
CC=clang make
sudo make install
```

3. After you have downloaded and installed the valkey-cli utility, it is recommended that you run the optional `make-test` command.

4. To connect to a cluster with encryption and authentication enabled, enter this command:

```nohighlight

valkey-cli -h Primary or Configuration Endpoint --tls -a 'your-password' -p 6379
```

###### Note

If you install redis6 on Amazon Linux 2023, you can now use the command `redis6-cli` instead of `valkey-cli`:

```

redis6-cli -h Primary or Configuration Endpoint --tls -p 6379
```

## Encrypted connection with stunnel

To use valkey-cli to connect to a Redis OSS cluster enabled with in-transit encryption using stunnel, follow these steps.

1. Use SSH to connect to your client and install `stunnel`.

```

sudo yum install stunnel
```

2. Run the following command to create and edit file `'/etc/stunnel/valkey-cli.conf'` simultaneously to add a ElastiCache for Redis OSS cluster endpoint to one or more connection parameters, using the provided output below as template.

```

vi /etc/stunnel/valkey-cli.conf

fips = no
setuid = root
setgid = root
pid = /var/run/stunnel.pid
debug = 7
delay = yes
options = NO_SSLv2
options = NO_SSLv3
[valkey-cli]
      client = yes
      accept = 127.0.0.1:6379
      connect = primary.ssltest.wif01h.use1.cache.amazonaws.com:6379
[valkey-cli-replica]
      client = yes
      accept = 127.0.0.1:6380
      connect = ssltest-02.ssltest.wif01h.use1.cache.amazonaws.com:6379
```

In this example, the config file has two connections, the `valkey-cli` and the `valkey-cli-replica`.
    The parameters are set as follows:

- **client** is set to yes to specify this stunnel instance is a client.

- **accept** is set to the client IP. In this example, the
primary is set to the Redis OSS default 127.0.0.1 on port 6379. The replica must
call a different port and set to 6380. You can use ephemeral ports
1024–65535. For more information, see [Ephemeral ports](../../../amazonvpc/latest/userguide/vpc-acls.md#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide._

- **connect** is set to the Redis OSS server endpoint. For more information, see
[Finding connection endpoints in ElastiCache](endpoints.md).

3. Start `stunnel`.

```

sudo stunnel /etc/stunnel/valkey-cli.conf
```

Use the `netstat` command to confirm that the tunnels started.

```

sudo netstat -tulnp | grep -i stunnel

tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:6379              0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      3189/stunnel
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:6380              0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      3189/stunnel
```

4. Connect to the encrypted Redis OSS node using the local endpoint of the tunnel.

- If no AUTH password was used during ElastiCache for Redis OSS cluster creation, this example uses the valkey-cli to connect to the ElastiCache for Redis OSS server using complete path for valkey-cli, on Amazon Linux:

```

/home/ec2-user/redis-7.2.5/src/valkey-cli -h localhost -p 6379
```

If AUTH password was used during Redis OSS cluster creation, this example uses valkey-cli to connect to the Redis OSS server using complete path for valkey-cli, on Amazon Linux:

```nohighlight

/home/ec2-user/redis-7.2.5/src/valkey-cli -h localhost -p 6379 -a my-secret-password
```

OR

- Change directory to redis-7.2.5 and do the following:

If no AUTH password was used during ElastiCache for Redis OSS cluster creation, this example uses the valkey-cli to connect to the ElastiCache for Redis OSS server using complete path for valkey-cli, on Amazon Linux:

```

src/valkey-cli -h localhost -p 6379
```

If AUTH password was used during Redis OSS cluster creation, this example uses valkey-cli to connect to the Valkey or Redis OSS server using complete path for valkey-cli, on Amazon Linux:

```nohighlight

src/valkey-cli -h localhost -p 6379 -a my-secret-password
```

This example uses Telnet to connect to the Valkey Redis OSS server.

```

telnet localhost 6379

Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
auth MySecretPassword
+OK
get foo
$3
bar
```

5. To stop and close the SSL tunnels, `pkill` the stunnel process.

```

sudo pkill stunnel
```
