# Scaling Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Enabled) clusters

As demand on your clusters changes, you might decide to improve performance or reduce costs
by changing the number of shards in your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster. We recommend using
online horizontal scaling to do so, because it allows your cluster to continue serving
requests during the scaling process.

Conditions under which you might decide to rescale your cluster include the
following:

- **Memory pressure:**

If the nodes in your cluster are under memory pressure, you might decide to scale out so
that you have more resources to better store data and serve requests.

You can determine whether your nodes are under memory pressure by monitoring the
following metrics: _FreeableMemory_, _SwapUsage_,
and _BytesUsedForCache_.

- **CPU or network bottleneck:**

If latency/throughput issues are plaguing your cluster, you might need to scale out to
resolve the issues.

You can monitor your latency and throughput levels by monitoring the following metrics:
_CPUUtilization_, _NetworkBytesIn_,
_NetworkBytesOut_, _CurrConnections_,
and _NewConnections_.

- **Your cluster is over-scaled:**

Current demand on your cluster is such that scaling in doesn't hurt performance and
reduces your costs.

You can monitor your cluster's use to determine whether or not you can safely
scale in using the following metrics:
_FreeableMemory_, _SwapUsage_,
_BytesUsedForCache_,
_CPUUtilization_, _NetworkBytesIn_,
_NetworkBytesOut_, _CurrConnections_,
and _NewConnections_.

###### Performance Impact of Scaling

When you scale using the offline process, your cluster is offline for a significant portion
of the process and thus unable to serve requests.
When you scale using the online method, because scaling is a compute-intensive operation, there
is some degradation in performance, nevertheless, your cluster continues to serve requests throughout
the scaling operation. How much degradation you experience depends upon your normal CPU utilization
and your data.

There are two ways to scale your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster; horizontal and vertical scaling.

- Horizontal scaling allows you to change the number of node groups (shards) in the replication group by adding or removing node groups (shards).
The online resharding process allows scaling in/out while the cluster continues serving incoming requests.

Configure the slots in your new cluster differently than they were
in the old cluster. Offline method only.

- Vertical Scaling - Change the node type to resize the cluster. The online vertical scaling allows scaling up/down while the cluster continues serving incoming requests.

If you are reducing the size and memory capacity of the cluster, by either scaling in or scaling down, ensure that the new configuration has sufficient memory for your data and Valkey or Redis OSS overhead.

For more information, see [Choosing your node size](cachenodes-selectsize.md).

## Offline resharding for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)

The main advantage you get from offline shard reconfiguration is that you can do more than
merely add or remove shards from your replication group. When you reshard and rebalance offline,
in addition to changing the number of shards in your replication group, you can do
the following:

###### Note

Offline resharding is not supported on Valkey or Redis OSS clusters with data tiering enabled. For more information, see [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md).

- Change the node type of your replication group.

- Specify the Availability Zone for each node in the replication group.

- Upgrade to a newer engine version.

- Specify the number of replica nodes in each shard independently.

- Specify the keyspace for each shard.

The main disadvantage of offline shard reconfiguration is that your cluster is offline
beginning with the restore portion of the process and continuing until you update
the endpoints in your application. The length of time that your cluster is offline
varies with the amount of data in your cluster.

###### To reconfigure your shards Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster offline

1. Create a manual backup of your existing Valkey or Redis OSS cluster.
    For more information, see [Taking manual backups](backups-manual.md).

2. Create a new cluster by restoring from the backup.
    For more information, see [Restoring from a backup into a new cache](backups-restoring.md).

3. Update the endpoints in your application to the new
    cluster's endpoints.
    For more information, see [Finding connection endpoints in ElastiCache](endpoints.md).

## Online resharding for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)

By using online resharding and shard rebalancing with ElastiCache Valkey 7.2 or newer, or Redis OSS version 3.2.10 or newer, you can scale
your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster dynamically with no downtime. This approach means that your cluster
can continue to serve requests even while scaling or rebalancing is in process.

You can do the following:

- **Scale out** –
Increase read and write capacity by adding shards (node groups)
to your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster (replication group).

If you add one or more shards to your replication group, the number of nodes in each new
shard is the same as the number of nodes in the smallest of the existing
shards.

- **Scale in** –
Reduce read and write capacity,
and thereby costs, by removing shards from your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster.

- **Rebalance** – Move the keyspaces among the shards in your
Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster so they are as equally distributed among the shards as possible.

You can't do the following:

- **Configure shards independently:**

You can't specify the keyspace for shards independently. To do this, you must use
the offline process.

Currently, the following limitations apply to ElastiCache online resharding and
rebalancing:

- These processes require Valkey 7.2 and newer or Redis OSS 3.2.10 or newer. For information on
upgrading your engine version, see [Version Management for ElastiCache](versionmanagement.md).

- There are limitations with slots or keyspaces and large items:

If any of the keys in a shard contain a large item, that key isn't migrated to a
new shard when scaling out or rebalancing. This functionality can result in
unbalanced shards.

If any of the keys in a shard contain a large item (items greater than 256 MB after
serialization), that shard isn't deleted when scaling in. This
functionality can result in some shards not being deleted.

- When scaling out, the number of nodes in any new shards equals the number of nodes in the
smallest existing shard.

- When scaling out, any tags that are common to all existing shards are copied to the new shards.

- When scaling out a Global Data Store cluster, ElastiCache will not automatically replicate Functions from one of the existing nodes to the new node(s). We recommend loading your Functions in the new shard(s) after scaling out your cluster so that every shards have the same functions.

###### Note

In ElastiCache for Valkey 7.2 and above, and ElastiCache for Redis OSS version 7 and above: When scaling out your cluster, ElastiCache will automatically replicate the Functions loaded in one of the existing nodes (selected at random) to the new node(s).
If your application uses [Functions](https://valkey.io/topics/functions-intro), we recommend loading all of your functions to all the shards before scaling out so that your cluster does not end up with different function definitions on different shards.

For more information, see [Online cluster resizing](best-practices-online-resharding.md).

You can horizontally scale or rebalance your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) clusters using the AWS Management Console, the
AWS CLI, and the ElastiCache API.

### Adding shards with online resharding

You can add shards to your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or ElastiCache
API. When you add shards to a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster, any tags on the existing
shards are copied over to the new shards.

###### Topics

You can use the AWS Management Console to add one or more shards to your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)
cluster. The following procedure describes the process.

###### To add shards to your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster

1. Open the ElastiCache console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache).

2. From the navigation pane, choose **Valkey clusters** or **Redis OSS clusters**.

3. Locate and choose the name, not the box to the left of the cluster's name, of the Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)
    cluster that you want to add shards to.

###### Tip

Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) show **Clustered Valkey** or **Clustered Redis OSS** in the **Mode** column

4. Choose **Add shard**.
1. For **Number of shards to be added**, choose the number of shards
       you want added to this cluster.

2. For **Availability zone(s)**, choose either **No**
      **preference** or **Specify availability**
      **zones**.

3. If you chose **Specify availability zones**,
       for each node in each shard, select the node's Availability Zone
       from the list of Availability Zones.

4. Choose **Add**.

The following process describes how to reconfigure the shards in your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)
cluster by adding shards using the AWS CLI.

Use the following parameters with `modify-replication-group-shard-configuration`.

###### Parameters

- `--apply-immediately` –
Required. Specifies the shard reconfiguration operation is
to be started immediately.

- `--replication-group-id` –
Required. Specifies which replication group (cluster)
the shard reconfiguration operation is to be performed on.

- `--node-group-count` – Required. Specifies the number of shards (node
groups) to exist when the operation is completed. When adding
shards, the value of `--node-group-count` must be greater
than the current number of shards.

Optionally, you can specify the Availability Zone for each node in the replication
group using `--resharding-configuration`.

- `--resharding-configuration` –
Optional. A list of preferred Availability Zones for each node in each shard
in the replication group.
Use this parameter only if the value of `--node-group-count`
is greater than the current number of shards.
If this parameter is omitted when adding shards, Amazon ElastiCache selects
the Availability Zones for the new nodes.

The following example reconfigures the keyspaces over four shards in a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)
cluster named `my-cluster`. The example also specifies the Availability
Zone for each node in each shard. The operation begins immediately.

- [Removing shards (AWS CLI)](#redis-cluster-resharding-online-remove-cli)

- [Removing shards (ElastiCache API)](#redis-cluster-resharding-online-remove-api)

#### Removing shards (Console)

The following process describes how to reconfigure the shards in your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)
cluster by removing shards using the AWS Management Console.

Before removing node groups (shards) from your replication group, ElastiCache makes sure that
all your data will fit in the remaining shards. If the data will fit, the specified
shards are deleted from the replication group as requested. If the data
won't fit in the remaining node groups, the process is terminated and the replication group is left with the same node group configuration as before the request was made.

You can use the AWS Management Console to remove one or more shards from your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster.
You cannot remove all the shards in a replication group. Instead, you must
delete the replication group. For more information, see [Deleting a replication group](replication-deletingrepgroup.md). The following procedure
describes the process for deleting one or more shards.

###### To remove shards from your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster

1. Open the ElastiCache console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache).

2. From the navigation pane, choose **Valkey clusters** or **Redis OSS clusters**.

3. Locate and choose the name, not the box to the left of the cluster's name, of the
    Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster you want to remove shards from.

###### Tip

Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) clusters have a value of 1 or greater in the
**Shards** column.

4. From the list of shards, choose the box to the left of the name of each shard
    that you want to delete.

5. Choose **Delete shard**.

#### Removing shards (AWS CLI)

The following process describes how to reconfigure the shards in your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)
cluster by removing shards using the AWS CLI.

###### Important
