# Restoring from a backup into a new cache

You can restore an existing backup from Valkey into a new Valkey cache or node-based cluster, and
restore an existing Redis OSS backup into a new Redis OSS cache or node-based cluster.
You can also restore an existing Memcached serverless cache backup into a new Memcached serverless cache.

###### Note

ElastiCache Serverless supports RDB files compatible with Valkey 7.2 and above, and Redis OSS versions between 5.0 and the latest version available.

**To restore a backup to a new serverless cache (AWS CLI)**

The following AWS CLI example creates a new cache using `create-serverless-cache` and imports data from a backup.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache create-serverless-cache \

    --serverless-cache-name CacheName \
    --engine redis
    --snapshot-arns-to-restore Snapshot-ARN
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache create-serverless-cache ^

    --serverless-cache-name CacheName ^
    --engine redis ^
    --snapshot-arns-to-restore Snapshot-ARN
```
