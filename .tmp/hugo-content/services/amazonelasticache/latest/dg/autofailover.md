# Minimizing downtime in ElastiCache by using Multi-AZ with Valkey and Redis OSS

There are a number of instances where ElastiCache for Valkey and Redis OSS may need to replace a primary node; these include certain types of planned maintenance and the unlikely event of a primary node or Availability Zone failure.

This replacement results in some downtime for the cluster, but if Multi-AZ is enabled, the downtime is minimized.
The role of primary node will automatically fail over to one of the read replicas. There is no need to create and provision a new primary node, because ElastiCache will handle this transparently.
This failover and replica promotion ensure that you can resume writing to the new primary as soon as promotion is complete.

ElastiCache also propagates the Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the promoted replica. It does
so because then if your application is writing to the primary endpoint, no endpoint change
is required in your application. If you are reading from individual endpoints, make sure
that you change the read endpoint of the replica promoted to primary to the new
replica's endpoint.

In case of planned node replacements initiated due to maintenance updates or self-service
updates, be aware of the following:

- For Valkey and Redis OSS clusters, the planned node replacements complete while the cluster
serves incoming write requests.

- For Valkey and Redis OSS cluster mode disabled clusters with Multi-AZ enabled that run on the 5.0.6 or later
engine, the planned node replacements complete while the cluster serves incoming
write requests.

- For Valkey and Redis OSS cluster mode disabled clusters with Multi-AZ enabled that run on the 4.0.10 or

earlier engine, you might notice a brief write interruption associated with DNS
updates. This interruption might take up to a few seconds. This process is much
faster than recreating and provisioning a new primary, which is what occurs if you
don't enable Multi-AZ.

You can enable Multi-AZ using the ElastiCache Management Console,
the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API.

Enabling ElastiCache Multi-AZ on your Valkey or Redis OSS cluster (in the API and CLI,
replication group) improves your fault tolerance. This is true particularly in cases where
your cluster's read/write primary cluster becomes unreachable or fails for any reason.
Multi-AZ is only supported on Valkey and Redis OSS clusters with more than one node in each shard.

## Enabling Multi-AZ

You can enable Multi-AZ when you create or modify a cluster
(API or CLI, replication group) using the ElastiCache console, AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache
API.

You can enable Multi-AZ only on Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) clusters that
have at least one available read replica. Clusters without
read replicas do not provide high availability or fault tolerance. For information about
creating a cluster with replication, see [Creating a Valkey or Redis OSS replication group](replication-creatingrepgroup.md). For information about adding a read
replica to a cluster with replication, see [Adding a read replica for Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Disabled)](replication-addreadreplica.md).

### Enabling Multi-AZ (Console)

You can enable Multi-AZ using the ElastiCache console when you create a new Valkey or Redis OSS cluster
or by modifying an existing cluster with replication.

Multi-AZ is enabled by default on Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) clusters.

###### Important

ElastiCache will automatically enable Multi-AZ only if the cluster contains at least one replica in a different Availability Zone from the primary in all shards.

#### Enabling Multi-AZ when creating a cluster using the ElastiCache console

For more information on this process, see [Creating a Valkey (cluster mode disabled) cluster (Console)](subnetgroups-designing-cluster-pre-valkey.md#Clusters.Create.CON.valkey-gs). Be sure to have one or more
replicas and enable Multi-AZ.

#### Enabling Multi-AZ on an existing cluster (Console)

For more information on this process, see Modifying a Cluster [Using the ElastiCache AWS Management Console](clusters-modify.md#Clusters.Modify.CON).

### Enabling Multi-AZ (AWS CLI)

The following code example uses the AWS CLI to enable Multi-AZ for the
replication group `redis12`.

###### Important

The replication group `redis12` must already exist and have at least
one available read replica.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache modify-replication-group \
    --replication-group-id redis12 \
    --automatic-failover-enabled \
    --multi-az-enabled \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache modify-replication-group ^
    --replication-group-id redis12 ^
    --automatic-failover-enabled ^
    --multi-az-enabled ^
    --apply-immediately
```

The JSON output from this command should look something like the following.

```json

### Enabling Multi-AZ (ElastiCache API)

The following code example uses the ElastiCache API to enable Multi-AZ for the
replication group `redis12`.

###### Note

To use this example, the replication group `redis12` must already exist
and have at least one available read replica.

```nohighlight

## Failure scenarios with Multi-AZ responses

Before the introduction of Multi-AZ, ElastiCache detected and replaced a cluster's
failed nodes by recreating and reprovisioning the failed node. If you enable Multi-AZ, a
failed primary node fails over to the replica with the least replication lag. The
selected replica is automatically promoted to primary, which is much faster than
creating and reprovisioning a new primary node. This process usually takes just a few
seconds until you can write to the cluster again.

When Multi-AZ is enabled, ElastiCache continually monitors the state of the primary node. If
the primary node fails, one of the following actions is performed depending on the type
of failure.

###### Topics

- [Failure scenarios when only the primary node fails](#AutoFailover.Scenarios.PrimaryOnly)

- [Failure scenarios when the primary node and some read replicas fail](#AutoFailover.Scenarios.PrimaryAndReplicas)

- [Failure scenarios when the entire cluster fails](#AutoFailover.Scenarios.AllFail)

### Failure scenarios when only the primary node fails

If only the primary node fails, the read replica with the least replication lag is
promoted to primary. A replacement read replica is then created and provisioned in
the same Availability Zone as the failed primary.

When only the primary node fails, ElastiCache Multi-AZ does the following:

1. The failed primary node is taken offline.

2. The read replica with the least replication lag is promoted to primary.

Writes can resume as soon as the promotion process is complete, typically
    just a few seconds. If your application is writing to the primary endpoint,
    you don't need to change the endpoint for writes or reads. ElastiCache
    propagates the DNS name of the promoted replica.

3. A replacement read replica is launched and provisioned.

The replacement read replica is launched in the Availability Zone that the
    failed primary node was in so that the distribution of nodes is maintained.

4. The replicas sync with the new primary node.

After the new replica is available, be aware of these effects:

- **Primary endpoint** – You don't
need to make any changes to your application, because the DNS name of the
new primary node is propagated to the primary endpoint.

- **Read endpoint** – The reader endpoint is automatically updated to point to the new replica nodes.

For information about finding the endpoints of a cluster, see the following topics:

- [Finding a Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Disabled) Cluster's Endpoints (Console)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.Redis)

- [Finding the Endpoints for Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Groups (AWS CLI)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.CLI.ReplGroups)

- [Finding Endpoints for Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Groups (ElastiCache API)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.API.ReplGroups)

### Failure scenarios when the primary node and some read replicas fail

If the primary and at least one read replica fails, the available replica with the
least replication lag is promoted to primary cluster. New read replicas are also
created and provisioned in the same Availability Zones as the failed nodes and
replica that was promoted to primary.

When the primary node and some read replicas fail, ElastiCache Multi-AZ does the
following:

1. The failed primary node and failed read replicas are taken offline.

2. The available replica with the least replication lag is promoted to primary node.

Writes can resume as soon as the promotion process is complete, typically
    just a few seconds. If your application is writing to the primary endpoint,
    there is no need to change the endpoint for writes. ElastiCache propagates the DNS
    name of the promoted replica.

3. Replacement replicas are created and provisioned.

The replacement replicas are created in the Availability Zones of the failed nodes
    so that the distribution of nodes is maintained.

4. All clusters sync with the new primary node.

Make the following changes to your application after the new nodes are
available:

- **Primary endpoint** – Don't make
any changes to your application. The DNS name of the new primary node is
propagated to the primary endpoint.

- **Read endpoint** – The read endpoint
is automatically updated to point to the new replica nodes.

For information about finding the endpoints of a replication group, see the following topics:

- [Finding a Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Disabled) Cluster's Endpoints (Console)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.Redis)

- [Finding the Endpoints for Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Groups (AWS CLI)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.CLI.ReplGroups)

- [Finding Endpoints for Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Groups (ElastiCache API)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.API.ReplGroups)

### Failure scenarios when the entire cluster fails

If everything fails, all the nodes are recreated and provisioned in the same
Availability Zones as the original nodes.

In this scenario, all the data in the cluster is lost due to the failure of every
node in the cluster. This occurrence is rare.

When the entire cluster fails, ElastiCache Multi-AZ does the following:

1. The failed primary node and read replicas are taken offline.

2. A replacement primary node is created and provisioned.

3. Replacement replicas are created and provisioned.

The replacements are created in the Availability Zones of the failed nodes
    so that the distribution of nodes is maintained.

Because the entire cluster failed,
    data is lost and all the new nodes start cold.

Because each of the replacement nodes has the same endpoint as the node it's
replacing, you don't need to make any endpoint changes in your application.

For information about finding the endpoints of a replication group, see the following topics:

- [Finding a Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Disabled) Cluster's Endpoints (Console)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.Redis)

- [Finding the Endpoints for Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Groups (AWS CLI)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.CLI.ReplGroups)

- [Finding Endpoints for Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Groups (ElastiCache API)](endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.API.ReplGroups)

We recommend that you create the primary node and read replicas in different Availability
Zones to raise your fault tolerance level.

## Testing automatic failover

After you enable automatic failover, you can test it using the ElastiCache console, the
AWS CLI, and the ElastiCache API.

When testing, note the following:

- You can use this operation to test automatic failover on up to 15 shards
(called node groups in the ElastiCache API and AWS CLI) in any rolling 24-hour
period.

- If you call this operation on shards in different clusters (called replication
groups in the API and CLI), you can make the calls concurrently.

- In some cases, you might call this operation multiple times on different
shards in the same Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group. In such cases, the first
node replacement must complete before a subsequent call can be made.

- To determine whether the node replacement is complete, check events using the
Amazon ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API. Look for the following events
related to automatic failover, listed here in order of likely occurrence:

1. Replication group message: `Test Failover API called for node group <node-group-id>`

2. Cache cluster message: `Failover from primary node <primary-node-id> to replica node <node-id> completed`

3. Replication group message: `Failover from primary node <primary-node-id> to replica node <node-id> completed`

4. Cache cluster message: `Recovering cache nodes <node-id>`

5. Cache cluster message: `Finished recovery for cache nodes <node-id>`

For more information, see the following:

- [Viewing ElastiCache events](ecevents-viewing.md)
in the _ElastiCache User Guide_

- [DescribeEvents](../../../../reference/amazonelasticache/latest/apireference/api-describeevents.md) in the _ElastiCache API_
_Reference_

- [describe-events](../../../cli/latest/reference/elasticache/describe-events.md) in the _AWS CLI Command_
_Reference._

- This API is designed for testing the behavior of your application in case of ElastiCache failover. It is not designed to be an operational tool for initiating a failover to address an issue with the cluster. Moreover, in certain conditions such as large-scale operational events, AWS may block this API.

- [Testing automatic failover using the AWS CLI](#auto-failover-test-cli)

- [Testing automatic failover using the ElastiCache API](#auto-failover-test-api)

### Testing automatic failover using the AWS Management Console

Use the following procedure to test automatic failover with the console.

###### To test automatic failover

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ElastiCache console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Valkey** or **Redis OSS**.

3. From the list of clusters, choose the box to the left of the cluster you want to test.
    This cluster must have at least one read replica node.

4. In the **Details** area, confirm that this cluster is
    Multi-AZ enabled. If the cluster isn't Multi-AZ enabled, either choose a
    different cluster or modify this cluster to enable Multi-AZ. For more
    information, see [Using the ElastiCache AWS Management Console](clusters-modify.md#Clusters.Modify.CON).

![Image: Details area of a Multi-AZ enabled cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/images/ElastiCache-AutoFailover-MultiAZ-Enabled.png)

5. For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled), choose the cluster's name.

For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled), do the following:

1. Choose the cluster's name.

2. On the **Shards** page, for the shard (called
       node group in the API and CLI) on which you want to test failover,
       choose the shard's name.
6. On the Nodes page, choose **Failover Primary**.

7. Choose **Continue** to fail over the primary, or
    **Cancel** to cancel the operation and not fail over
    the primary node.

During the failover process, the console continues to show the node's
    status as _available_. To track the progress of your
    failover test, choose **Events** from the console
    navigation pane. On the **Events** tab, watch for events
    that indicate your failover has started ( `Test Failover API
                               called`) and completed ( `Recovery completed`).

### Testing automatic failover using the AWS CLI

You can test automatic failover on any Multi-AZ
enabled cluster using the AWS CLI operation `test-failover`.

###### Parameters

- `--replication-group-id` – Required. The
replication group (on the console, cluster) that is to be tested.

- `--node-group-id` – Required. The name of
the node group you want to test automatic failover on. You can test a
maximum of 15 node groups in a rolling 24-hour period.

The following example uses the AWS CLI to test automatic failover on the node group `redis00-0003`
in the Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster `redis00`.

###### Example Test automatic failover

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache test-failover \
   --replication-group-id redis00 \
   --node-group-id redis00-0003
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache test-failover ^
   --replication-group-id redis00 ^
   --node-group-id redis00-0003
```

Output from the preceding command looks something like the following.

```json

### Testing automatic failover using the ElastiCache API

You can test automatic failover on any cluster enabled with Multi-AZ using the ElastiCache API operation `TestFailover`.

###### Parameters

- `ReplicationGroupId` – Required. The replication group
(on the console, cluster) to be tested.

- `NodeGroupId` – Required. The name of the node group that
you want to test automatic failover on. You can test a maximum of 15 node
groups in a rolling 24-hour period.

The following example tests automatic failover on the node group
`redis00-0003` in the replication group (on the console, cluster)
`redis00`.

###### Example Testing automatic failover

```nohighlight

https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/

    &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
    &Timestamp=20140401T192317Z
    &X-Amz-Credential=<credential>
```

To track the progress of your failover, use the ElastiCache `DescribeEvents`
API operation.

## Limitations on Multi-AZ

Be aware of the following limitations for Multi-AZ:

- Multi-AZ is supported on Valkey, and on Redis OSS version 2.8.6 and later.

- Multi-AZ isn't supported on T1 node types.

- Valkey and Redis OSS replication is asynchronous. Therefore, when a primary node fails over to a replica, a small
amount of data might be lost due to replication lag.

When choosing the replica to promote to primary, ElastiCache chooses the replica
with the least replication lag. In other words, it chooses the replica that is
most current. Doing so helps minimize the amount of lost data. The replica with
the least replication lag can be in the same or different Availability Zone from
the failed primary node.

- When you manually promote read replicas to primary on Valkey or Redis OSS clusters with cluster mode disabled, you can
do so only when Multi-AZ and automatic failover are disabled. To promote a read
replica to primary, take the following steps:

1. Disable Multi-AZ on the
    cluster.

2. Disable automatic failover on the cluster. You can do this through the
    console by clearing the **Auto failover** check
    box for the replication group. You can also do this using the AWS CLI by
    setting the `AutomaticFailoverEnabled` property to
    `false` when calling the
    `ModifyReplicationGroup` operation.

3. Promote the read replica to primary.

4. Re-enable Multi-AZ.

- ElastiCache for Redis OSS Multi-AZ and append-only file (AOF) are mutually exclusive.
If you enable one, you can't enable the other.

- A node's failure can be caused by the rare event of an entire
Availability Zone failing. In this case, the replica replacing the failed
primary is created only when the Availability Zone is back up. For example,
consider a replication group with the primary in AZ-a and replicas in AZ-b and
AZ-c. If the primary fails, the replica with the least replication lag is
promoted to primary cluster. Then, ElastiCache creates a new replica in AZ-a (where
the failed primary was located) only when AZ-a is back up and available.

- A customer-initiated reboot of a primary doesn't trigger automatic
failover. Other reboots and failures do trigger automatic failover.

- When the primary is rebooted, it's cleared of data when it comes back online.
When the read replicas see the cleared primary cluster, they clear their copy of
the data, which causes data loss.

- After a read replica has been promoted, the other replicas sync with the new
primary. After the initial sync, the replicas' content is deleted and they
sync the data from the new primary. This sync process causes a brief
interruption, during which the replicas are not accessible. The sync process
also causes a temporary load increase on the primary while syncing with the
replicas. This behavior is native to Valkey and Redis OSS and isn't unique to ElastiCache
Multi-AZ. For details about this behavior, see [Replication](http://valkey.io/topics/replication) on the Valkey website.

###### Important

For Valkey 7.2.6 and later or Redis OSS version 2.8.22 and later, you can't create external replicas.

For Redis OSS versions before 2.8.22, we recommend that you don't connect an
external replica to an ElastiCache cluster that is Multi-AZ enabled. This
unsupported configuration can create issues that prevent ElastiCache from properly
performing failover and recovery. To connect an external replica to an ElastiCache
cluster, make sure that Multi-AZ isn't enabled before you make the
connection.
