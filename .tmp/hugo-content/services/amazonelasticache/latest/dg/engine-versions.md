# Engine versions and upgrading in ElastiCache

This section covers the supported Valkey, Memcached, and Redis OSS engines and how to upgrade.
Note that all features available with Redis OSS 7.2 are available in Valkey 7.2 and above by default.
You can also upgrade from some existing ElastiCache for Redis OSS engines to a Valkey engine.

## ElastiCache version 8.2 for Valkey

Here are some of the new features introduced in Valkey 8.2 (compared to ElastiCache Valkey 8.1):

- ElastiCache for Valkey v8.2 provides native support for [vector search](vector-search.md), delivering latency as low as microseconds-the lowest latency vector search with the highest throughput and best price-performance at 95%+ recall rate among popular vector databases on AWS.

For more information on Valkey, see [Valkey.](https://valkey.io/)

ElastiCache version 8.2 for Valkey enhances Valkey 8.1 with vector search capabilities based on [valkey-search module](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-search). For more information on the Valkey 8.2 release, see [release notes](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-search/blob/main/00-RELEASENOTES) for valkey-search. Please note that ElastiCache v8.2 is compatible with Valkey v8.1.

## ElastiCache version 8.1 for Valkey

Here are some of the new features introduced in Valkey 8.1 (compared to ElastiCache Valkey 8.0):

- A [new hash table](https://valkey.io/blog/new-hash-table) implementation that reduces memory overhead to lower memory usage by as much as 20% for common key/value patterns.

- Native support for [Bloom filters](https://valkey.io/topics/bloomfilters), a new data type allowing you to perform lookups using as much as 98% less memory compared to using the Set data type.

- New command [COMMANDLOG](https://valkey.io/commands/commandlog-get) that records slow executions, large requests, and large replies.

- New conditional update support to the SET command using IFEQ argument.

- Performance improvements, including up to 45% lower latency for the ZRANK command, up to 12x faster performance for PFMERGE and PFCOUNT, and up to 514% higher throughput for BITCOUNT.

### ElastiCache version 7.1 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

This release contains performance improvements which enable workloads to drive
higher throughput and lower operation latencies. ElastiCache version 7.1 for Redis OSS introduces [two main enhancements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/achieve-over-500-million-requests-per-second-per-cluster-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis-7-1) :

We extended the enhanced I/O threads functionality to also handle the
presentation layer logic. By presentation layer, we mean the Enhanced I/O
threads which are now not only reading client input, but also parsing the
input into Redis OSS binary command format. This is then forwarded to the main
thread for execution which provides performance gain. Improved Redis OSS memory access pattern. Execution steps from many data
structure operations are interleaved, to ensure parallel memory access and
reduced memory access latency. When running ElastiCache on Graviton3-based
`R7g.4xlarge` or larger, customers can achieve over 1 million
requests per second per node. With the performance improvements to ElastiCache for Redis OSS v7.1, customers can achieve up to 100% more throughput and 50% lower
P99 latency relative to ElastiCache for Redis OSS v7.0. These enhancements are enabled
on node sizes with at least 8 physical cores ( `2xlarge` on
Graviton, and `4xlarge` on x86), regardless of the CPU type and
require no client changes.

###### Note

ElastiCache v7.1 is compatible with Redis OSS v7.0.

### ElastiCache version 7.0 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

ElastiCache for Redis OSS 7.0 adds a number of improvements and support for new functionality:

- [Functions](https://valkey.io/topics/functions-intro): ElastiCache for Redis OSS 7 adds support for Redis OSS Functions, and provides a managed experience enabling developers to execute
[LUA scripts](https://valkey.io/topics/eval-intro) with application logic stored on the ElastiCache
cluster, without requiring clients to re-send the scripts to the server with
every connection.

- [ACL\
improvements](https://valkey.io/topics/acl): Valkey and Redis OSS 7 adds support for the next
version of Access Control Lists (ACLs). Clients can now specify multiple sets of permissions on specific keys or
keyspaces in Valkey and Redis OSS.

- [Sharded\
Pub/Sub](https://valkey.io/topics/pubsub): ElastiCache for Valkey and Redis OSS 7 adds support to run Pub/Sub
functionality in a sharded way when running ElastiCache in Cluster Mode Enabled
(CME). Pub/Sub capabilities enable publishers to issue messages to any
number of subscribers on a channel. Channels
are bound to a shard in the ElastiCache cluster, eliminating the need to
propagate channel information across shards resulting in improved
scalability.

- Enhanced I/O multiplexing: ElastiCache for Valkey and Redis OSS 7 introduces enhanced
I/O multiplexing, which delivers increased throughput and reduced latency
for high-throughput workloads that have many concurrent client connections
to an ElastiCache cluster. For example, when using a cluster of r6g.xlarge
nodes and running 5200 concurrent clients, you can achieve up to 72%
increased throughput (read and write operations per second) and up to 71%
decreaseed P99 latency, compared with ElastiCache version 6 for Redis OSS.

For more information on Valkey, see [Valkey](https://valkey.io/).
For more information on the Redis OSS 7.0 release, see [Redis OSS 7.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0/00-RELEASENOTES) at Redis OSS on GitHub.

### ElastiCache version 6.2 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

ElastiCache for Redis OSS 6.2 includes performance improvements for TLS-enabled clusters using x86
node types with 8 vCPUs or more or Graviton2 node types with 4 vCPUs or more. These
enhancements improve throughput and reduce client connection establishment time by
offloading encryption to other vCPUs. With Redis OSS 6.2, you can also manage access to
Pub/Sub channels with Access Control List (ACL) rules.

With this version, we also introduce support for data tiering on cluster nodes
containing locally attached NVMe SSD. For more information, see [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md).

Redis OSS engine version 6.2.6 also introduces support for native JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) format, a simple, schemaless way to encode complex datasets inside
Redis OSS clusters. With JSON support, you can leverage the performance and Redis OSS APIs
for applications that operate over JSON. For more information, see [Getting\
started with JSON](json-gs.md). Also included are JSON-related metrics,
`JsonBasedCmds` and `JsonBasedCmdsLatency`, that are
incorporated into CloudWatch to monitor the usage of this datatype. For more information,
see [Metrics for Valkey and Redis OSS](cachemetrics-redis.md).

You specify the engine version by using 6.2. ElastiCache will automatically invoke the
preferred patch version of Redis OSS 6.2 that is available. For example, when you
create/modify a cluster, you set the `--engine-version` parameter
to 6.2. The cluster will be launched with the current available preferred patch
version of Redis OSS 6.2 at the creation/modification time. Specifying engine version
6.x in the API will result in the latest minor version of Redis OSS 6.

For existing 6.0 clusters, you can opt-in to the next auto minor version upgrade
by setting the `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade` parameter to `yes` in
the `CreateCacheCluster`, `ModifyCacheCluster`,
`CreateReplicationGroup` or `ModifyReplicationGroup` APIs.
ElastiCache will upgrade the minor version of your existing 6.0 clusters to 6.2 using
self-service updates. For more information, see [Self-service\
updates in Amazon ElastiCache](self-service-updates.md).

When calling the DescribeCacheEngineVersions API, the `EngineVersion`
parameter value will be set to 6.2 and the actual engine version with the patch
version will be returned in the `CacheEngineVersionDescription`
field.

For more information on the Redis OSS 6.2 release, see [Redis OSS 6.2 Release Notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/6.2/00-RELEASENOTES) at Redis OSS on GitHub.

### ElastiCache version 6.0 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

Amazon ElastiCache introduces the next version of ElastiCache for the Redis OSS engine, which includes
[Authenticating Users with Role Based Access Control](clusters-rbac.md), client-side
caching and significant operational improvements.

Beginning with Redis OSS 6.0, ElastiCache will offer a single version for each Redis OSS
minor release, rather than offering multiple patch versions. ElastiCache will
automatically manage the patch version of your running clusters, ensuring
improved performance and enhanced security.

You can also opt-in to the next auto minor version upgrade by setting the
`AutoMinorVersionUpgrade` parameter to `yes` and ElastiCache
will manage the minor version upgrade, through self-service updates. For more
information, see [Service updates in ElastiCache](self-service-updates.md).

You specify the engine version by using `6.0`. ElastiCache will
automatically invoke the preferred patch version of Redis OSS 6.0 that is available. For
example, when you create/modify a cluster, you set the
`--engine-version` parameter to 6.0. The cluster will be launched
with the current available preferred patch version of Redis OSS 6.0 at the
creation/modification time. Any request with a specific patch version value will be
rejected, an exception will be thrown and the process will fail.

When calling the DescribeCacheEngineVersions API, the `EngineVersion`
parameter value will be set to 6.0 and the actual engine version with the patch
version will be returned in the `CacheEngineVersionDescription`
field.

For more information on the Redis OSS 6.0 release, see [Redis OSS 6.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/6.0/00-RELEASENOTES) at Redis OSS on GitHub.

### ElastiCache version 5.0.6 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

Amazon ElastiCache introduces the next version of ElastiCache for the Redis OSS engine, which includes bug
fixes and the following cumulative updates:

- Engine stability guarantee in special conditions.

- Improved Hyperloglog error handling.

- Enhanced handshake commands for reliable replication.

- Consistent message delivery tracking via `XCLAIM`
command.

- Improved `LFU ` field management in objects.

- Enhanced transaction management when using `ZPOP`.

- Ability to rename commands: A parameter called
`rename-commands` that allows you to rename potentially
dangerous or expensive Redis OSS commands that might cause accidental data loss,
such as `FLUSHALL` or `FLUSHDB`. This is similar to
the rename-command configuration in open source Redis OSS. However, ElastiCache
has improved the experience by providing a fully managed workflow. The
command name changes are applied immediately, and automatically propagated
across all nodes in the cluster that contain the command list. There is no
intervention required on your part, such as rebooting nodes.

The following examples demonstrate how to modify existing parameter
groups. They include the `rename-commands` parameter, which is a
space-separated list of commands you want to rename:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache modify-cache-parameter-group --cache-parameter-group-name custom_param_group
  --parameter-name-values "ParameterName=rename-commands,  ParameterValue='flushall restrictedflushall'" --region region

```

In this example, the _rename-commands_
parameter is used to rename the `flushall` command to
`restrictedflushall`.

To rename multiple commands, use the following:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache modify-cache-parameter-group --cache-parameter-group-name custom_param_group
  --parameter-name-values "ParameterName=rename-commands,  ParameterValue='flushall restrictedflushall flushdb restrictedflushdb''" --region region

```

To revert any change, re-run the command and exclude any renamed values
from the `ParameterValue` list that you want to retain, as shown
following:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache modify-cache-parameter-group --cache-parameter-group-name custom_param_group
  --parameter-name-values "ParameterName=rename-commands,  ParameterValue='flushall restrictedflushall'" --region region

```

In this case, the `flushall` command is renamed to
`restrictedflushall` and any other renamed commands revert to
their original command names.

###### Note

When renaming commands, you are restricted to the following
limitations:

- All renamed commands should be alphanumeric.

- The maximum length of new command names is 20 alphanumeric
characters.

- When renaming commands, ensure that you update the parameter
group associated with your cluster.

- To prevent a command's use entirely, use the keyword
`blocked`, as shown following:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache modify-cache-parameter-group --cache-parameter-group-name custom_param_group
  --parameter-name-values "ParameterName=rename-commands,  ParameterValue='flushall blocked'" --region region

```

For more information on the parameter changes and a list of what commands
are eligible for renaming, see [Redis OSS 5.0.3 parameter changes](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Redis.5-0-3).

- Redis OSS Streams: This models a log data structure that allows producers to
append new items in real time. It also allows consumers to consume messages
either in a blocking or nonblocking fashion. Streams also allow consumer
groups, which represent a group of clients to cooperatively consume
different portions of the same stream of messages, similar to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation). For
more information, see [Streams](https://valkey.io/topics/streams-intro).

- Support for a family of stream commands, such as `XADD`,
`XRANGE` and `XREAD`. For more information, see
[Streams Commands](https://valkey.io/commands).

- A number of new and renamed parameters. For more information, see [Redis OSS 5.0.0 parameter changes](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Redis.5.0).

- A new Redis OSS metric, `StreamBasedCmds`.

- Slightly faster snapshot time for Redis OSS nodes.

###### Important

ElastiCache has back-ported two critical bug fixes from [Redis OSS open source version 5.0.1](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES). They are listed following:

- RESTORE mismatch reply when certain keys have already expired.

- The `XCLAIM` command can potentially return a wrong entry
or desynchronize the protocol.

Both of these bug fixes are included in ElastiCache for Redis OSS support for Redis OSS engine
version 5.0.0 and are consumed in future version updates.

For more information, see [Redis OSS 5.0.6 Release Notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES) at Redis OSS on GitHub.

Amazon ElastiCache introduces the next version of ElastiCache for the Redis OSS engine;. It includes online
configuration changes for ElastiCache of auto-failover clusters during all planned
operations. You can now scale your cluster, upgrade the Redis OSS engine version and
apply patches and maintenance updates while the cluster stays online and continues
serving incoming requests. It also includes bug fixes.

For more information, see [Redis OSS 5.0.5 Release Notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES) at Redis OSS on GitHub.

Amazon ElastiCache introduces the next version of ElastiCache for the Redis OSS engine,
which includes bug fixes.

### ElastiCache version 5.0.0 for Redis OSS (deprecated, use version 5.0.6)

Amazon ElastiCache introduces the next major version of ElastiCache for the Redis OSS engine. ElastiCache version 5.0.0 for Redis OSS
brings support for the following improvements:

- Redis OSS Streams: This models a log data structure that allows producers to
append new items in real time. It also allows consumers to consume messages
either in a blocking or nonblocking fashion. Streams also allow consumer
groups, which represent a group of clients to cooperatively consume
different portions of the same stream of messages, similar to [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation). For
more information, see [Streams](https://valkey.io/topics/streams-intro).

- Support for a family of stream commands, such as `XADD`,
`XRANGE` and `XREAD`. For more information, see
[Streams Commands](https://valkey.io/commands).

- A number of new and renamed parameters. For more information, see [Redis OSS 5.0.0 parameter changes](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Redis.5.0).

- A new Redis OSS metric, `StreamBasedCmds`.

- Slightly faster snapshot time for Redis OSS nodes.

### ElastiCache version 4.0.10 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

Amazon ElastiCache introduces the next major version of ElastiCache for the Redis OSS engine.
ElastiCache version 4.0.10 for Redis OSS brings support for the following improvements:

- Both online cluster resizing and encryption in a single ElastiCache version.
For more information, see the following:

- [Scaling Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Enabled) clusters](scaling-redis-cluster-mode-enabled.md)

- [Online resharding for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)](scaling-redis-cluster-mode-enabled.md#redis-cluster-resharding-online)

- A number of new parameters. For more information, see [Redis OSS 4.0.10 parameter changes](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Redis.4-0-10).

- Support for family of memory commands, such as `MEMORY`. For
more information, see [Commands](https://valkey.io/commands) (search on MEMO).

- Support for memory defragmentation while online thus allowing more
efficient memory utilization and more memory available for your data.

- Support for asynchronous flushes and deletes. ElastiCache for Redis OSS supports commands
like `UNLINK`, `FLUSHDB` and `FLUSHALL` to
run in a different thread from the main thread. Doing this helps improve
performance and response times for your applications by freeing memory
asynchronously.

- A new Redis OSS metric, `ActiveDefragHits`. For more information,
see [Metrics for Redis OSS](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cachemetrics-redis.md).

- `cluster set-config-epoch`

- `cluster reset`

For information about Redis OSS 3.2.4 parameters, see [Redis OSS 3.2.4 parameter changes](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Redis.3-2-4).

### Past End of Life (EOL) versions (2.x)

#### ElastiCache version 2.8.24 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

Redis OSS improvements added since version 2.8.23 include bug fixes and logging of
bad memory access addresses. For more information, see [Redis OSS 2.8 release notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/2.8/00-RELEASENOTES).

#### ElastiCache version 2.8.23 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

Redis OSS improvements added since version 2.8.22 include bug fixes. For more
information, see [Redis OSS 2.8 release notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/2.8/00-RELEASENOTES). This release also includes support for the
new parameter `close-on-slave-write` which, if enabled, disconnects
clients who attempt to write to a read-only replica.

For more information on Redis OSS 2.8.23 parameters, see [Redis OSS 2.8.23 (enhanced) added parameters](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Redis.2-8-23) in the ElastiCache User
Guide.

#### ElastiCache version 2.8.22 for Redis OSS (enhanced)

Redis OSS improvements added since version 2.8.21 include the following:

- Support for forkless backups and synchronizations, which allows you to
allocate less memory for backup overhead and more for your application.
For more information, see [How synchronization and backup are implemented](replication-redis-versions.md). The forkless process
can impact both latency and throughput. When there is high write
throughput, when a replica re-syncs, it can be unreachable for the
entire time it is syncing.

- If there is a failover, replication groups now recover faster because
replicas perform partial syncs with the primary rather than full syncs
whenever possible. Additionally, both the primary and replicas no longer
use the disk during syncs, providing further speed gains.

- Support for two new CloudWatch metrics.

- `ReplicationBytes` – The number of bytes a
replication group's primary cluster is sending to the read
replicas.

- `SaveInProgress` – A binary value that
indicates whether or not there is a background save process
running.

For more information, see [Monitoring use with CloudWatch Metrics](cachemetrics.md).

- A number of critical bug fixes in replication PSYNC behavior. For more
information, see [Redis OSS 2.8 release notes](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/2.8/00-RELEASENOTES).

- To maintain enhanced replication performance in Multi-AZ replication
groups and for increased cluster stability, non-ElastiCache replicas are no
longer supported.

- To improve data consistency between the primary cluster and replicas
in a replication group, the replicas no longer evict keys independent of
the primary cluster.

- Redis OSS configuration variables `appendonly` and
`appendfsync` are not supported on Redis OSS version 2.8.22
and later.

- In low-memory situations, clients with a large output buffer might be
disconnected from a replica cluster. If disconnected, the client needs
to reconnect. Such situations are most likely to occur for PUBSUB
clients.
