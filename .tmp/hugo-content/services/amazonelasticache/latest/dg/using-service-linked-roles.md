# Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ElastiCache

Amazon ElastiCache uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [service-linked roles](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-terms-and-concepts.md#iam-term-service-linked-role). A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is
linked directly to an AWS service, such as Amazon ElastiCache. Amazon ElastiCache service-linked roles are
predefined by Amazon ElastiCache. They include all the permissions that the service requires to call
AWS services on behalf of your clusters.

A service-linked role makes setting up Amazon ElastiCache easier because you don’t have to
manually add the necessary permissions. The roles already exist within your AWS account but
are linked to Amazon ElastiCache use cases and have predefined permissions. Only Amazon ElastiCache can
assume these roles, and only these roles can use the predefined permissions policy. You can
delete the roles only after first deleting their related resources. This protects your
Amazon ElastiCache resources because you can't inadvertently remove necessary permissions to access
the resources.

For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md) and look for the services that
have **Yes** in the **Service-Linked**
**Role** column. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the
service-linked role documentation for that service.

## Service-Linked Role Permissions for Amazon ElastiCache

### Permissions to create service-linked role

**To allow an IAM entity to create AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache service-linked**
**role**

Add the following policy statement to the permissions for that IAM entity:

```

{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/elasticache.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache*",
    "Condition": {"StringLike": {"iam:AWSServiceName": "elasticache.amazonaws.com"}}
}
```

**To allow an IAM entity to delete AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache service-linked**
**role**

Add the following policy statement to the permissions for that IAM entity:

```

{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "iam:DeleteServiceLinkedRole",
        "iam:GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/elasticache.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache*",
    "Condition": {"StringLike": {"iam:AWSServiceName": "elasticache.amazonaws.com"}}
}
```

Alternatively, you can use an AWS managed policy to provide full access to
Amazon ElastiCache.

## Creating a Service-Linked Role (IAM)

You can create a service-linked role using the IAM console, CLI, or API.

### Creating a Service-Linked Role (IAM Console)

You can use the IAM console to create a service-linked role.

###### To create a service-linked role (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose **Roles**. Then
    choose **Create new role**.

3. Under **Select type of trusted entity** choose **AWS Service**.

4. Under **Or select a service to view its use cases**, choose **ElastiCache**.

5. Choose **Next: Permissions**.

6. Under **Policy name**, note that the `ElastiCacheServiceRolePolicy` is required for this role. Choose **Next:Tags**.

7. Note that tags are not supported for Service-Linked roles. Choose **Next:Review**.

8. (Optional) For **Role description**, edit the description for the
    new service-linked role.

9. Review the role and then choose **Create role**.

### Creating a Service-Linked Role (IAM CLI)

You can use IAM operations from the AWS Command Line Interface to create a service-linked role. This
role can include the trust policy and inline policies that the service needs to assume the
role.

**To create a service-linked role (CLI)**

Use the following operation:

```nohighlight

$ aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name elasticache.amazonaws.com
```

### Creating a Service-Linked Role (IAM API)

You can use the IAM API to create a service-linked role. This role can contain the
trust policy and inline policies that the service needs to assume the role.

**To create a service-linked role (API)**

Use the CreateServiceLinkedRole API call.
In the request, specify a service name of `elasticache.amazonaws.com`.

## Editing the Description of a Service-Linked Role for Amazon ElastiCache

Amazon ElastiCache does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache service-linked role. After you
create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities
might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using
IAM.

### Editing a Service-Linked Role Description (IAM Console)

You can use the IAM console to edit a service-linked role description.

###### To edit the description of a service-linked role (console)

1. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose
    **Roles**.

2. Choose the name of the role to modify.

3. To the far right of **Role description**, choose
    **Edit**.

4. Enter a new description in the box and choose **Save**.

### Editing a Service-Linked Role Description (IAM CLI)

You can use IAM operations from the AWS Command Line Interface to edit a service-linked role description.

###### To change the description of a service-linked role (CLI)

1. (Optional) To view the current description for a role, use the AWS CLI for IAM operation `get-role`.

###### Example

```nohighlight

$ aws iam get-role --role-name AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache
```

Use the role name, not the ARN, to refer to roles with the CLI operations. For
    example, if a role has the following ARN:
    `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/myrole`, refer to the role as `myrole`.

2. To update a service-linked role's description, use the AWS CLI for IAM operation `update-role-description`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

$ aws iam update-role-description \
       --role-name AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache \
       --description "new description"
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

$ aws iam update-role-description ^
       --role-name AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache ^
       --description "new description"
```

### Editing a Service-Linked Role Description (IAM API)

You can use the IAM API to edit a service-linked role description.

###### To change the description of a service-linked role (API)

1. (Optional) To view the current description for a role, use the IAM API operation GetRole.

###### Example

```http

https://iam.amazonaws.com/
      ?Action=GetRole
      &RoleName=AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache
      &Version=2010-05-08
      &AUTHPARAMS
```

2. To update a role's description, use the IAM API operation UpdateRoleDescription.

###### Example

```http

https://iam.amazonaws.com/
      ?Action=UpdateRoleDescription
      &RoleName=AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache
      &Version=2010-05-08
      &Description="New description"
```

## Deleting a Service-Linked Role for Amazon ElastiCache

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we
recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not
actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up your service-linked role before
you can delete it.

Amazon ElastiCache does not delete the service-linked role for you.

### Cleaning Up a Service-Linked Role

Before you can use IAM to delete a service-linked role, first
confirm that the role has no resources (clusters or replication groups) associated with
it.

###### To check whether the service-linked role has an active session in the IAM console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose **Roles**. Then
    choose the name (not the check box) of the AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache role.

3. On the **Summary** page for the selected role, choose the
    **Access Advisor** tab.

4. On the **Access Advisor** tab, review recent activity for the
    service-linked role.

###### To delete Amazon ElastiCache resources that require AWSServiceRoleForElastiCache

- To delete a cluster, see the following:

- [Using the AWS Management Console](clusters-delete.md#Clusters.Delete.CON)

- [Using the AWS CLI to delete an ElastiCache cluster](clusters-delete.md#Clusters.Delete.CLI)

- [Using the ElastiCache API](clusters-delete.md#Clusters.Delete.API)

- To delete a replication group, see the following:

- [Deleting a Replication Group (Console)](replication-deletingrepgroup.md#Replication.DeletingRepGroup.CON)

- [Deleting a Replication Group (AWS CLI)](replication-deletingrepgroup.md#Replication.DeletingRepGroup.CLI)

- [Deleting a replication group (ElastiCache API)](replication-deletingrepgroup.md#Replication.DeletingRepGroup.API)

### Deleting a Service-Linked Role (IAM Console)

You can use the IAM console to delete a service-linked role.

###### To delete a service-linked role (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose **Roles**. Then
    select the check box next to the role name that you want to delete, not the name or row
    itself.

3. For **Role actions** at the top of the page, choose
    **Delete role**.

4. In the confirmation dialog box, review the service last accessed data, which shows
    when each of the selected roles last accessed an AWS service. This helps you to
    confirm whether the role is currently active. If you want to proceed, choose
    **Yes, Delete** to submit the service-linked role for
    deletion.

5. Watch the IAM console notifications to monitor the progress of the service-linked
    role deletion. Because the IAM service-linked role deletion is asynchronous, after you
    submit the role for deletion, the deletion task can succeed or fail. If the task fails,
    you can choose **View details** or **View Resources**
    from the notifications to learn why the deletion failed.

### Deleting a Service-Linked Role (IAM CLI)

You can use IAM operations from the AWS Command Line Interface to delete a service-linked role.

###### To delete a service-linked role (CLI)

1. If you don't know the name of the service-linked role that you want to delete, enter
    the following command. This command lists the roles and their Amazon Resource Names
    (ARNs) in your account.

```nohighlight

$ aws iam get-role --role-name role-name
```

Use the role name, not the ARN, to refer to roles with the CLI operations. For
    example, if a role has the ARN `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/myrole`,
    you refer to the role as `myrole`.

2. Because a service-linked role cannot be deleted if it is being used or has
    associated resources, you must submit a deletion request. That request can be denied if
    these conditions are not met. You must capture the `deletion-task-id` from
    the response to check the status of the deletion task. Enter the following to submit a
    service-linked role deletion request.

```nohighlight

$ aws iam delete-service-linked-role --role-name role-name
```

3. Enter the following to check the status of the deletion task.

```nohighlight

$ aws iam get-service-linked-role-deletion-status --deletion-task-id deletion-task-id
```

The status of the deletion task can be `NOT_STARTED`,
    `IN_PROGRESS`, `SUCCEEDED`, or `FAILED`. If the
    deletion fails, the call returns the reason that it failed so that you can
    troubleshoot.

### Deleting a Service-Linked Role (IAM API)

You can use the IAM API to delete a service-linked role.

###### To delete a service-linked role (API)

1. To submit a deletion request for a service-linked roll, call DeleteServiceLinkedRole.
    In the request, specify a role name.

Because a service-linked role cannot be deleted if it is being used or has
    associated resources, you must submit a deletion request. That request can be denied if
    these conditions are not met. You must capture the `DeletionTaskId` from the
    response to check the status of the deletion task.

2. To check the status of the deletion, call GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus.
    In the request, specify the `DeletionTaskId`.

The status of the deletion task can be `NOT_STARTED`,
    `IN_PROGRESS`, `SUCCEEDED`, or `FAILED`. If the
    deletion fails, the call returns the reason that it failed so that you can
    troubleshoot.
