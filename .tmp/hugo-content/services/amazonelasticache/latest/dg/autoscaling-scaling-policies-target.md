# Target tracking scaling policies

With target tracking scaling policies, you select a metric and set a target value.
ElastiCache for Valkey and Redis OSS Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling
policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target
value. The scaling policy adds or removes shards as required to keep the metric at,
or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to
the target value, a target tracking scaling policy also adjusts to the fluctuations
in the metric due to a fluctuating load pattern and minimizes rapid fluctuations in
the capacity of the fleet.

For example, consider a scaling policy that uses the predefined average
`ElastiCachePrimaryEngineCPUUtilization` metric with configured
target value. Such a policy can keep CPU utilization at, or close to the specified
target value.

## Predefined metrics

A predefined metric is a structure that refers to a specific name, dimension,
and statistic ( `average`) of a given CloudWatch metric. Your Auto Scaling
policy defines one of the below predefined metrics for your cluster:

Predefined Metric NameCloudWatch Metric NameCloudWatch Metric DimensionIneligible Instance Types `ElastiCachePrimaryEngineCPUUtilization`

`EngineCPUUtilization`

ReplicationGroupId, Role = Primary

None`ElastiCacheDatabaseCapacityUsageCountedForEvictPercentage`

`DatabaseCapacityUsageCountedForEvictPercentage`

Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Group Metrics

None`ElastiCacheDatabaseMemoryUsageCountedForEvictPercentage`

`DatabaseMemoryUsageCountedForEvictPercentage`

Valkey or Redis OSS Replication Group Metrics

R6gd

Data-tiered instance types cannot use
`ElastiCacheDatabaseMemoryUsageCountedForEvictPercentage`, as
these instance types store data in both memory and SSD. The expected use case
for data-tiered instances is to have 100 percent memory usage and fill up SSD as
needed.

## Auto Scaling criteria for shards

When the service detects that your predefined metric is equal to or greater
than the Target setting, it will increase your shards capacity automatically.
ElastiCache for Valkey and Redis OSS scales out your cluster shards by a count equal to the larger of two
numbers: Percent variation from Target and 20 percent of current shards. For
scale-in, ElastiCache won't auto scale-in unless the overall metric value is
below 75 percent of your defined Target.

For a scale out example, if you have 50 shards and

- if your Target breaches by 30 percent, ElastiCache scales out by 30
percent, which results in 65 shards per cluster.

- if your Target breaches by 10 percent, ElastiCache scales out by default
Minimum of 20 percent, which results in 60 shards per cluster.

For a scale-in example, if you have selected a Target value of 60 percent,
ElastiCache won't auto scale-in until the metric is less than or equal to 45
percent (25 percent below the Target 60 percent).

## Auto Scaling considerations

Keep the following considerations in mind:

- A target tracking scaling policy assumes that it should perform scale
out when the specified metric is above the target value. You cannot use
a target tracking scaling policy to scale out when the specified metric
is below the target value. ElastiCache for Valkey and Redis OSS scales out shards by a minimum of 20
percent deviation of target of existing shards in the cluster.

- A target tracking scaling policy does not perform scaling when the
specified metric has insufficient data. It does not perform scale-in
because it does not interpret insufficient data as low utilization.

- You may see gaps between the target value and the actual metric data
points. This is because ElastiCache Auto Scaling always acts conservatively
by rounding up or down when it determines how much capacity to add or
remove. This prevents it from adding insufficient capacity or removing
too much capacity.

- To ensure application availability, the service scales out
proportionally to the metric as fast as it can, but scales in more
conservatively.

- You can have multiple target tracking scaling policies for an ElastiCache for Valkey and Redis OSS
cluster, provided that each of them uses a different metric. The
intention of ElastiCache Auto Scaling is to always prioritize availability,
so its behavior differs depending on whether the target tracking
policies are ready for scale out or scale in. It will scale out the
service if any of the target tracking policies are ready for scale out,
but will scale in only if all of the target tracking policies (with the
scale-in portion enabled) are ready to scale in.

- Do not edit or delete the CloudWatch alarms that ElastiCache Auto Scaling manages
for a target tracking scaling policy. ElastiCache Auto Scaling deletes the
alarms automatically when you delete the scaling policy.

- ElastiCache Auto Scaling doesn't prevent you from manually modifying
cluster shards. These manual adjustments don't affect any existing
CloudWatch alarms that are attached to the scaling policy but can impact
metrics that may trigger these CloudWatch alarms.

- These CloudWatch alarms managed by Auto Scaling are defined over the AVG
metric across all the shards in the cluster. So, having hot shards can
result in either scenario of:

- scaling when not required due to load on a few hot shards
triggering a CloudWatch alarm

- not scaling when required due to aggregated AVG across all
shards affecting alarm not to breach.

- ElastiCache default limits on Nodes per cluster still applies. So, when
opting for Auto Scaling and if you expect maximum nodes to be more than
default limit, request a limit increase at [AWS Service Limits](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md) and choose the limit type
**Nodes per cluster per instance type**.

- Ensure that you have enough ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)
available in your VPC, which are required during scale-out. For more
information, see [Elastic\
network interfaces](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-elasticnetworkinterfaces.md).

- If there is not enough capacity available from EC2, ElastiCache Auto
Scaling would not scale and be delayed til the capacity is
available.

- ElastiCache for Redis OSS Auto Scaling during scale-in will not remove shards with slots
having an item size larger than 256 MB post-serialization.

- During scale-in it will not remove shards if insufficient memory
available on resultant shard configuration.
