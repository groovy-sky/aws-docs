# Choosing regions and availability zones for ElastiCache

You can provide additional scalability and reliability to your ElastiCache clusters by designating Regions and Availability Zones using the corresponding endpoint.

AWS Cloud computing resources are housed in highly available data center
facilities. To provide additional scalability and reliability, these data center
facilities are located in different physical locations. These locations are
categorized by _regions_ and _Availability Zones_.

AWS Regions are large and widely dispersed into separate geographic locations.
Availability Zones are distinct locations within an AWS Region that are engineered to be
isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. They provide inexpensive, low-latency
network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same AWS Region.

###### Important

Each region is completely independent. Any ElastiCache activity you initiate (for example,
creating clusters) runs only in your current default region.

To create or work with a cluster in a specific region, use the corresponding regional
service endpoint. For service endpoints, see [Supported Regions & endpoints](#SupportedRegions).

## Availability Zone considerations with Memcached

Distributing your Memcached nodes over multiple Availability Zones within a region helps
protect you from the impact of a catastrophic failure, such as a power loss
within an Availability Zone.

**Serverless Caching**

ElastiCache serverless caching creates a highly available cache that spans multiple Availability Zones.
You can specify subnets from different availability zones and same VPC as you create your serverless cluster or
ElastiCache will choose subnets automatically from your default VPC.

**Designing your own ElastiCache for Memcached cluster**

A Memcached cluster can have up to 300 nodes. When you create or add nodes to your
Memcached cluster, you can specify a single Availability Zone for all your
nodes, allow ElastiCache to choose a single Availability Zone for all your nodes,
specify the Availability Zones for each node, or allow ElastiCache to choose an
Availability Zone for each node. New nodes can be created in different
Availability Zones as you add them to an existing Memcached cluster. Once a
cache node is created, its Availability Zone cannot be modified.

If you want a cluster in a single Availability Zone cluster to have its nodes
distributed across multiple Availability Zones, ElastiCache can create new nodes in
the various Availability Zones. You can then delete some or all of the original
cache nodes. We recommend this approach.

###### To migrate Memcached nodes from a single Availability Zone to multiple availability zones

1. Modify your cluster by creating new cache nodes in the Availability Zones where you want them.
    In your request, do the following:

- Set `AZMode` (CLI: `- -az-mode`) to `cross-az`.

- Set `NumCacheNodes` (CLI: `- -num-cache-nodes`) to the number of currently active cache nodes plus the number
of new cache nodes you want to create.

- Set `NewAvailabilityZones` (CLI: `- -new-availability-zones`) to a list
of the zones you want the new cache nodes created in. To let
ElastiCache determine the Availability Zone for each new node, don't
specify a list.

- Set `ApplyImmediately` (CLI: `- -apply-immediately`) to true.

###### Note

If you are not using auto discovery, be sure to update your client application with the new
cache node endpoints.

Before moving on to the next step, be sure the Memcached nodes are fully created and available.

2. Modify your cluster by removing the nodes you no longer want in the original
    Availability Zone. In your request, do the following:

- Set `NumCacheNodes` (CLI: `- -num-cache-nodes`) to the number of active cache nodes you want after this modification is applied.

- Set `CacheNodeIdsToRemove` (CLI: `- -nodes-to-remove`) to a list of the cache nodes you want to remove from the cluster.

The number of cache node IDs listed must equal the number of currently active nodes
minus the value in `NumCacheNodes`.

- (Optional) Set `ApplyImmediately` (CLI: `- -apply-immediately`) to
true.

If you don't set `ApplyImmediately` (CLI: `- -apply-immediately`)
to true, the node deletions will take place at your next
maintenance window.

## Locating your nodes

Amazon ElastiCache supports locating all of a cluster's nodes in a single or multiple
Availability Zones (AZs). Further, if you elect to locate your nodes in
multiple AZs (recommended), ElastiCache enables you to either choose the AZ for each node, or allow
ElastiCache to choose them for you.

By locating the nodes in different AZs, you eliminate the chance that a failure,
such as a power outage, in one AZ will cause your entire system to fail.
Testing has demonstrated that there is no significant latency difference
between locating all nodes in one AZ or spreading them across multiple AZs.

You can specify an AZ for each node when you create a cluster, or by adding nodes
when you modify an existing cluster. When specifying an AZ for each node while creating a cluster, the AZ must be available in that subnet group.

## Supported Regions & endpoints

Amazon ElastiCache is available in multiple AWS Regions. This means that you can launch ElastiCache clusters in locations that meet
your requirements. For example, you can launch in the AWS Region closest to your customers, or launch in a particular AWS Region to meet certain legal
requirements.

Each Region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Regions. Within each Region are multiple Availability Zones (AZ).
ElastiCache Serverless caches automatically replicate data across multiple availability zones
(except `us-west-1`, where data is replicated in two availability zones) for high availability.
When designing your own ElastiCache cluster, you can choose to launch your nodes in different AZs to achieve fault tolerance.
For more information on Regions and Availability Zones, see
[Choosing regions and availability zones for ElastiCache](regionsandazs.md) at the top of this topic.
