# Decreasing the number of replicas in a shard

You can decrease the number of replicas in a shard for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled), or in a
replication group for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled):

- For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled), you can decrease the number of replicas to one if Multi-AZ
is enabled, and to zero if it isn't enabled.

- For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled), you can decrease the number of replicas to zero. However,
you can't fail over to a replica if your primary node fails.

You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI or the ElastiCache API to decrease the number of replicas
in a node group (shard) or replication group.

## Using the AWS Management Console

The following procedure uses the console to decrease the number of replicas in a
Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group.

###### To decrease the number of replicas in a Valkey or Redis OSS shard

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ElastiCache console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Valkey** or **Redis OSS**, then choose the name
    of the replication group from which you want to delete replicas.

3. Choose the box for each shard you want to remove a replica node from.

4. Choose **Delete replicas**.

5. Complete the **Delete Replicas from Shards** page:
1. For **New number of replicas/shard**, enter the
       number of replicas that you want the selected shards to have. This number
       must be greater than or equal to 1. We recommend at least two replicas
       per shard as a working minimum.

2. Choose **Delete** to delete the replicas or
       **Cancel** to cancel the operation.

###### Important

- If you don’t specify the replica nodes to be deleted, ElastiCache for Redis OSS automatically selects replica nodes for deletion.
While doing so, ElastiCache for Redis OSS attempts to retain the Multi-AZ architecture for your replication group followed by retaining
replicas with minimum replication lag with the primary.

- You can't delete the primary or primary nodes in a replication group. If you specify a primary node for deletion, the operation fails with an error event
indicating that the primary node was selected for deletion.

## Using the AWS CLI

To decrease the number of replicas in a Valkey or Redis OSS shard, use the
`decrease-replica-count` command with the following parameters:

- `--replication-group-id` – Required. Identifies which
replication group you want to decrease the number of replicas in.

- `--apply-immediately` or
`--no-apply-immediately` – Required. Specifies whether to
decrease the replica count immediately ( `--apply-immediately`) or at
the next maintenance window ( `--no-apply-immediately`). Currently,
`--no-apply-immediately` is not supported.

- `--new-replica-count` – Optional. Specifies the number of
replica nodes that you want. The value of `--new-replica-count` must
be a valid value less than the current number of replicas in the node groups.
For minimum permitted values, see [Decreasing the number of replicas in a shard](decrease-replica-count.md). If the value of
`--new-replica-count` doesn't meet this requirement, the
call fails.

- `--replicas-to-remove` – Optional. Contains a list of node
IDs specifying the replica nodes to remove.

- `--replica-configuration` – Optional. Allows you to set
the number of replicas and Availability Zones for each node group
independently. Use this parameter for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) groups where you want to
configure each node group independently.

`--replica-configuration` has three optional members:

- `NodeGroupId` – The four-digit ID for the node group
that you are configuring. For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication groups, the
shard ID is always `0001`. To find a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) node
group's (shard's) ID, see [Finding a shard's ID](shards.md#shard-find-id).

- `NewReplicaCount` – An optional parameter that
specifies the number of replica nodes you want. The value of
`NewReplicaCount` must be a valid value less than the
current number of replicas in the node groups. For minimum permitted
values, see [Decreasing the number of replicas in a shard](decrease-replica-count.md). If the value of
`NewReplicaCount` doesn't meet this requirement, the
call fails.

- `PreferredAvailabilityZones` – A list of
`PreferredAvailabilityZone` strings that specify which
Availability Zones the replication group's nodes are in. The number of
`PreferredAvailabilityZone` values must equal the value of
`NewReplicaCount` plus 1 to account for the primary node.
If this member of `--replica-configuration` is omitted, ElastiCache for Redis OSS
chooses the Availability Zone for each of the new replicas.

###### Important

You must include one and only one of the `--new-replica-count`,
`--replicas-to-remove`, or `--replica-configuration`
parameters.

###### Example

The following example uses `--new-replica-count` to decrease the
number of replicas in the replication group `sample-repl-group` to one.
When the example is finished, there is one replica in each node group. This number
applies whether this is a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) group with a single node group or a
Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) group with multiple node groups.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group \
    --new-replica-count 1 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count ^
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group ^
    --new-replica-count 1 ^
    --apply-immediately
```

The following example decreases the number of replicas in the replication group `sample-repl-group`
by removing two specified replicas ( `0001` and `0003`) from the node group.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count \
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group \
    --replicas-to-remove 0001,0003 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count ^
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group ^
    --replicas-to-remove 0001,0003 \
    --apply-immediately
```

The following example uses `--replica-configuration` to decrease the
number of replicas in the replication group `sample-repl-group` to the
value specified for the two specified node groups. Given that there are multiple
node groups, this is a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group. When specifying the
optional `PreferredAvailabilityZones`, the number of Availability Zones
listed must equal the value of `NewReplicaCount` plus 1 more. This
approach accounts for the primary node for the group identified by
`NodeGroupId`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count \
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group \
    --replica-configuration \
        NodeGroupId=0001,NewReplicaCount=1,PreferredAvailabilityZones=us-east-1a,us-east-1c \
        NodeGroupId=0003,NewReplicaCount=2,PreferredAvailabilityZones=us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count ^
    --replication-group-id sample-repl-group ^
    --replica-configuration ^
        NodeGroupId=0001,NewReplicaCount=2,PreferredAvailabilityZones=us-east-1a,us-east-1c ^
        NodeGroupId=0003,NewReplicaCount=3,PreferredAvailabilityZones=us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c \
    --apply-immediately
```

[decrease-replica-count](../../../cli/latest/reference/elasticache/decrease-replica-count.md) in the _Amazon ElastiCache Command Line Reference._

## Using the ElastiCache API

To decrease the number of replicas in a Valkey or Redis OSS shard, use the
`DecreaseReplicaCount` action with the following parameters:

- `ReplicationGroupId` – Required. Identifies which
replication group you want to decrease the number of replicas in.

- `ApplyImmediately` – Required. Specifies whether to decrease
the replica count immediately ( `ApplyImmediately=True`) or at the
next maintenance window ( `ApplyImmediately=False`). Currently,
`ApplyImmediately=False` is not supported.

- `NewReplicaCount` – Optional. Specifies the number of
replica nodes you want. The value of `NewReplicaCount` must be a
valid value less than the current number of replicas in the node groups. For
minimum permitted values, see [Decreasing the number of replicas in a shard](decrease-replica-count.md). If the value of
`--new-replica-count` doesn't meet this requirement, the
call fails.

- `ReplicasToRemove` – Optional. Contains a list of node IDs
specifying the replica nodes to remove.

- `ReplicaConfiguration` – Optional. Contains a list of node
groups that allows you to set the number of replicas and Availability Zones for
each node group independently. Use this parameter for Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) groups
where you want to configure each node group independently.

`ReplicaConfiguraion` has three optional members:

- `NodeGroupId` – The four-digit ID for the node group
you are configuring. For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication groups, the node
group ID is always `0001`. To find a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) node
group's (shard's) ID, see [Finding a shard's ID](shards.md#shard-find-id).

- `NewReplicaCount` – The number of replicas that you
want in this node group at the end of this operation. The value must be
less than the current number of replicas down to a minimum of 1 if
Multi-AZ is enabled or 0 if Multi-AZ with
Automatic Failover isn't enabled. If this value is not less than the
current number of replicas in the node group, the call fails with an
exception.

- `PreferredAvailabilityZones` – A list of
`PreferredAvailabilityZone` strings that specify which
Availability Zones the replication group's nodes are in. The number of
`PreferredAvailabilityZone` values must equal the value of
`NewReplicaCount` plus 1 to account for the primary node.
If this member of `ReplicaConfiguration` is omitted, ElastiCache for Redis OSS
chooses the Availability Zone for each of the new replicas.

###### Important

You must include one and only one of the `NewReplicaCount`, `ReplicasToRemove`,
or `ReplicaConfiguration` parameters.

###### Example

The following example uses `NewReplicaCount` to decrease the number
of replicas in the replication group `sample-repl-group` to one. When
the example is finished, there is one replica in each node group. This number
applies whether this is a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) group with a single node group or a
Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) group with multiple node groups.

```

https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
      ?Action=DecreaseReplicaCount
      &ApplyImmediately=True
      &NewReplicaCount=1
      &ReplicationGroupId=sample-repl-group
      &Version=2015-02-02
      &SignatureVersion=4
      &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
      &Timestamp=20150202T192317Z
      &X-Amz-Credential=<credential>
```

The following example decreases the number of replicas in the replication group `sample-repl-group`
by removing two specified replicas ( `0001` and `0003`) from the node group.

```

https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
      ?Action=DecreaseReplicaCount
      &ApplyImmediately=True
      &ReplicasToRemove.ReplicaToRemove.1=0001
      &ReplicasToRemove.ReplicaToRemove.2=0003
      &ReplicationGroupId=sample-repl-group
      &Version=2015-02-02
      &SignatureVersion=4
      &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
      &Timestamp=20150202T192317Z
      &X-Amz-Credential=<credential>
```

The following example uses `ReplicaConfiguration` to decrease the
number of replicas in the replication group `sample-repl-group` to the
value specified for the two specified node groups. Given that there are multiple
node groups, this is a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group. When specifying the
optional `PreferredAvailabilityZones`, the number of Availability Zones
listed must equal the value of `NewReplicaCount` plus 1 more. This
approach accounts for the primary node for the group identified by
`NodeGroupId`.

```

https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
      ?Action=DecreaseReplicaCount
      &ApplyImmediately=True
      &ReplicaConfiguration.ConfigureShard.1.NodeGroupId=0001
      &ReplicaConfiguration.ConfigureShard.1.NewReplicaCount=1
      &ReplicaConfiguration.ConfigureShard.1.PreferredAvailabilityZones.PreferredAvailabilityZone.1=us-east-1a
