# Storing large composite items (Valkey and Redis OSS)

In some scenarios, an application may store large composite items in Valkey or Redis OSS (such as a multi-GB hash dataset). This is not a recommended practice because it often leads to performance problems in Valkey or Redis OSS.
For example, the client can do a HGETALL command to retrieve the entire multi GB hash collection. This can generate significant memory pressure to the Valkey or Redis OSS server buffering the large item in the client output buffer.
Also, for slot migration in cluster mode, ElastiCache doesn't migrate slots that contain items with serialized size that is larger than 256 MB.

To solve the large item problems, we have the following recommendations:

- Break up the large composite item into multiple smaller items. For example, break up a large hash collection into individual key-value fields with a key name scheme that appropriately reflects the collection, such as using a common prefix
in the key name to identify the collection of items. If you must access multiple fields in the same collection atomically, you can use the MGET command to retrieve multiple key-values in the same command.

- If you evaluated all options and still can't break up the large collection dataset, try to use commands that operate on a subset of the data in the collection instead of the entire collection. Avoid having a use case that requires you to
atomically retrieve the entire multi-GB collection in the same command. One example is using HGET or HMGET commands instead of HGETALL on hash collections.
