# Connecting to a cache running in an Amazon VPC

This example shows how to launch an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC.
You can then log in to this instance and access the ElastiCache cache that is running in the Amazon VPC.

## Connecting to a cache running in an Amazon VPC (Console)

In this example, you create an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC. You can use this Amazon EC2
instance to connect to cache nodes running in the Amazon VPC.

###### Note

For information about using Amazon EC2, see the [Amazon EC2 Getting Started Guide](../../../ec2/latest/gettingstartedguide.md) in the [Amazon EC2 documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2).

###### To create an Amazon EC2 instance in your Amazon VPC using the Amazon EC2 console

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the console, choose **Launch Instance** and follow these steps:

03. On the **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** page,
     choose the 64-bit Amazon Linux AMI, and then choose **Select**.

04. On the **Choose an Instance Type** page,
     choose **3\. Configure Instance**.

05. On the **Configure Instance Details** page,
     make the following selections:

    1. In the **Network** list, choose your Amazon VPC.

    2. In the **Subnet** list, choose your public
        subnet.

       ![Interface screenshot for choosing your public subnet.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/images/vpc-05.png)

When the settings are as you want them,
choose **4\. Add Storage**.

06. On the **Add Storage** page,
     choose **5\. Tag Instance**.

07. On the **Tag Instance** page,
     type a name for your Amazon EC2 instance,
     and then choose **6\. Configure Security Group**.

08. On the **Configure Security Group** page,
     choose **Select an existing security group**. For more information on security groups,
     see [Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-security-groups.md).

    ![Interface screenshot of selecting an existing security group.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/images/vpc-06.png)

    Choose the name of your Amazon VPC security group,
     and then choose **Review and Launch**.

09. On the **Review Instance and Launch** page,
     choose **Launch**.

10. In the **Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair** window,
     specify a key pair that you want to use with this instance.

    ###### Note

    For information about managing key pairs, see the [Amazon EC2 Getting Started Guide](../../../ec2/latest/gettingstartedguide.md).

11. When you are ready to launch your Amazon EC2 instance,
     choose **Launch**.

You can now assign an Elastic IP address to the Amazon EC2 instance that you just created.
You need to use this IP address to connect to the Amazon EC2 instance.

###### To assign an elastic IP address (Console)

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation list, choose **Elastic IPs**.

3. Choose **Allocate Elastic IP address**.

4. In the **Allocate Elastic IP address** dialog box,
    accept the default **Network Border Group** and choose **Allocate** .

5. Choose the Elastic IP address that you just allocated from the list and
    choose **Associate Address**.

6. In the **Associate Address** dialog box,
    in the **Instance** box,
    choose the ID of the Amazon EC2 instance that you launched.

In the **Private IP address** box, select the box to obtain the private IP address and then
    choose **Associate**.

You can now use SSH to connect to the Amazon EC2 instance using the Elastic IP address
    that you created.

### To connect to your Amazon EC2 instance

- Open a command window. At the command prompt, issue the following command, replacing
_mykeypair.pem_ with the name of your key pair file
and _54.207.55.251_ with your Elastic IP address.

```nohighlight

ssh -i mykeypair.pem ec2-user@54.207.55.251
```

###### Important

Do not log out of your Amazon EC2 instance yet.

You are now ready to interact with your ElastiCache cluster.
Before you can do that, if you haven't already done so,
you need to install the _telnet_ utility.

###### To install _telnet_ and interact with your cluster (AWS CLI)

- Open a command window.
At the command prompt, issue the following command.
At the confirmation prompt, type _y_.

```nohighlight

sudo yum install telnet
Loaded plugins: priorities, security, update-motd, upgrade-helper
Setting up Install Process
Resolving Dependencies
  --> Running transaction check

...(output omitted)...

Total download size: 63 k
Installed size: 109 k
Is this ok [y/N]: y
Downloading Packages:
telnet-0.17-47.7.amzn1.x86_64.rpm                        |  63 kB     00:00

...(output omitted)...

Complete!

```

You can now connect to a VPC with either Memcached or Redis.

### Connecting to a VPC with Memcached

1. Go to the ElastiCache console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache) and obtain the
    endpoint for one of the nodes in your cluster. For more information, see [Finding connection endpoints](endpoints.md).

2. Use _telnet_ to connect to your cache node endpoint
    over port 11211. Replace the hostname shown below with the hostname of your
    cache node.

```nohighlight

telnet my-cache-cluster.7wufxa.0001.use1.cache.amazonaws.com 11211
```

You are now connected to the cache engine and can issue commands. In this
    example, you add a data item to the cache and then get it immediately
    afterward. Finally, you'll disconnect from the cache node.

To store a key and a value, type the following two lines:

```nohighlight

add mykey 0 3600 28
This is the value for mykey
```

The cache engine responds with the following:

```nohighlight

OK
```

To retrieve the value for `mykey`, type the following:

```nohighlight

get mykey
```

The cache engine responds with the following:

```nohighlight

VALUE mykey 0 28
This is the value for my key
END
```

To disconnect from the cache engine, type the following:

```nohighlight

quit
```

### Connecting to a VPC with Redis

1. Go to the ElastiCache console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache) and obtain the
    endpoint for one of the nodes in your cluster. For more information, see
    [Finding connection endpoints](endpoints.md) for Redis.

2. Use _telnet_ to connect to your cache node endpoint
    over port 6379. Replace the hostname shown below with the hostname of your
    cache node.

```nohighlight

telnet my-cache-cluster.7wufxa.0001.use1.cache.amazonaws.com 6379
```

You are now connected to the cache engine and can issue commands. In this
    example, you add a data item to the cache and then get it immediately
    afterward. Finally, you'll disconnect from the cache node.

To store a key and a value, type the following two lines:

```nohighlight

set mykey myvalue

```

The cache engine responds with the following:

```nohighlight

OK
```

To retrieve the value for `mykey`, type the following:

```nohighlight

get mykey
```

To disconnect from the cache engine, type the following:

```nohighlight

quit
```

3. Go to the ElastiCache console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache) and obtain the
    endpoint for one of the nodes in your cluster. For more information,

    [Finding connection endpoints](endpoints.md) for Redis OSS.

4. Use _telnet_ to connect to your cache node endpoint
    over port 6379. Replace the hostname shown below with the hostname of your
    cache node.

```nohighlight

telnet my-cache-cluster.7wufxa.0001.use1.cache.amazonaws.com 6379
```

You are now connected to the cache engine and can issue commands. In this
    example, you add a data item to the cache and then get it immediately
    afterward. Finally, you'll disconnect from the cache node.

To store a key and a value, type the following:

```nohighlight

set mykey myvalue

```

The cache engine responds with the following:

```nohighlight

OK
```

To retrieve the value for `mykey`, type the following:

```nohighlight

get mykey
```

The cache engine responds with the following:

```nohighlight

get mykey
myvalue

```

To disconnect from the cache engine, type the following:

```nohighlight

quit
```
