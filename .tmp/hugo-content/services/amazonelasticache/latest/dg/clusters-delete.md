# Deleting a cluster in ElastiCache

As long as an ElastiCache cluster is in the _available_ state, you are being charged for it, whether or not
you are actively using it. To stop incurring charges, delete the cluster.

###### Warning

When you delete an ElastiCache cluster, your manual snapshots are retained. You can also create a final snapshot before the cluster is deleted. Automatic cache snapshots are not retained.

The following procedure deletes a single cluster from your deployment. To delete multiple
clusters, repeat the procedure for each cluster that you want to delete. You do not
need to wait for one cluster to finish deleting before starting the procedure to
delete another cluster.

###### To delete a cluster

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon ElastiCache console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache).

2. In the ElastiCache engine dashboard, choose the engine that is running in the cluster that you want to delete.

A list of all clusters running that engine appears.

3. To choose the cluster to delete, choose the cluster's name from the list of
    clusters.

###### Important

You can only delete one cluster at a time from the ElastiCache console. Choosing multiple clusters
disables the delete operation.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Delete**.

5. In the **Delete Cluster** confirmation screen, choose
    **Delete** to delete the cluster, or choose
    **Cancel** to keep the cluster.

If you chose **Delete**, the status of the cluster changes to _deleting_.

As soon as your cluster is no longer listed in the list of clusters, you stop incurring charges for it.

The following code deletes the ElastiCache cluster `my-cluster`.

```nohighlight

aws elasticache delete-cache-cluster --cache-cluster-id my-cluster
```

The `delete-cache-cluster` CLI action only deletes one cluster. To delete
multiple clusters, call `delete-cache-cluster` for each cache
cluster that you want to delete. You do not need to wait for one cluster to
finish deleting before deleting another.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache delete-cache-cluster \
    --cache-cluster-id my-cluster \
    --region us-east-2
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache delete-cache-cluster ^
    --cache-cluster-id my-cluster ^
    --region us-east-2
```

For more information, see the AWS CLI for ElastiCache topic [`delete-cache-cluster`](../../../cli/latest/reference/elasticache/delete-cache-cluster.md).

The following code deletes the cluster `my-cluster`.

```nohighlight

https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
    ?Action=DeleteCacheCluster
    &CacheClusterId=my-cluster
    &Region us-east-2
    &SignatureVersion=4
    &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
    &Timestamp=20150202T220302Z
    &X-Amz-Algorithm=&AWS;4-HMAC-SHA256
    &X-Amz-Date=20150202T220302Z
    &X-Amz-SignedHeaders=Host

    &X-Amz-Credential=<credential>
    &X-Amz-Signature=<signature>
```

The `DeleteCacheCluster` API operation only deletes one cluster. To delete
multiple clusters, call `DeleteCacheCluster` for each cluster
that you want to delete. You do not need to wait for one cluster to finish
deleting before deleting another.

For more information, see the ElastiCache API reference topic [`DeleteCacheCluster`](../../../../reference/amazonelasticache/latest/apireference/api-deletecachecluster.md).
