# Configuring your ElastiCache client for efficient load balancing (Memcached)

###### Note

This section applies to node-based multi-node Memcached clusters.

To effectively use multiple ElastiCache Memcached nodes, you need to be able to spread your cache
keys across the nodes. A simple way to load balance a cluster with
_n_ nodes is to calculate the hash of the object's key and mod
the result by _n_: `hash(key) mod n`. The resulting value
(0 through _n_–1) is the number of the node where you place the object.

This approach is simple and works well as long as the number of nodes
( _n_) is constant. However, whenever you add or remove a node
from the cluster, the number of keys that need to be moved is _(n - 1) /_
_n_ (where _n_ is the new number of nodes). Thus, this
approach results in a large number of keys being moved, which translates to a large
number of initial cache misses, especially as the number of nodes gets large. Scaling
from 1 to 2 nodes results in (2-1) / 2 (50 percent) of the keys being moved,
the best case. Scaling from 9 to 10 nodes results in (10–1)/10 (90 percent) of the
keys being moved. If you're scaling up due to a spike in traffic, you don't want to
have a large number of cache misses. A large number of cache misses results in hits to
the database, which is already overloaded due to the spike in traffic.

The solution to this dilemma is consistent hashing. Consistent hashing uses an algorithm
such that whenever a node is added or removed from a cluster, the number of keys that
must be moved is roughly _1 / n_ (where _n_ is the
new number of nodes). Scaling from 1 to 2 nodes results in 1/2 (50 percent) of the keys
being moved, the worst case. Scaling from 9 to 10 nodes results in 1/10 (10 percent) of
the keys being moved.

As the user, you control which hashing algorithm is used for multi-node clusters. We
recommend that you configure your clients to use consistent hashing. Fortunately, there
are many Memcached client libraries in most popular languages that implement consistent
hashing. Check the documentation for the library you are using to see if it supports
consistent hashing and how to implement it.

If you are working in Java, PHP, or .NET, we recommend you use one of the Amazon ElastiCache
client libraries.

## Consistent Hashing Using Java

The ElastiCache Memcached Java client is based on the open-source spymemcached Java client, which
has consistent hashing capabilities built in. The library includes a
KetamaConnectionFactory class that implements consistent hashing. By default,
consistent hashing is turned off in spymemcached.

For more information, see the KetamaConnectionFactory documentation at
[KetamaConnectionFactory](https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/spymemcached/blob/master/src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/KetamaConnectionFactory.java).

## Consistent hashing using PHP with Memcached

The ElastiCache Memcached PHP client is a wrapper around the built-in Memcached PHP library.
By default, consistent hashing is turned off by the Memcached PHP library.

Use the following code to turn on consistent hashing.

```nohighlight

$m = new Memcached();
$m->setOption(Memcached::OPT_DISTRIBUTION, Memcached::DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT);
```

In addition to the preceding code,
we recommend that you also turn `memcached.sess_consistent_hash`
on in your php.ini file.

For more information, see the run-time configuration documentation for Memcached PHP at
[http://php.net/manual/en/memcached.configuration.php](http://php.net/manual/en/memcached.configuration.php).
Note specifically the `memcached.sess_consistent_hash` parameter.

## Consistent hashing using .NET with Memcached

The ElastiCache Memcached .NET client is a wrapper around Enyim Memcached.
By default, consistent hashing is turned on by the Enyim Memcached client.

For more information, see the `memcached/locator` documentation at [https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/MemcachedClient-Configuration#user-content-memcachedlocator](https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached/wiki/MemcachedClient-Configuration).
