# Data Validation

Data Validation is a crucial step early in the forecast creation process that ensures
the input data meets the necessary quality standards for forecasting. This feature runs a
series of checks on your data, surfacing data errors that need to be fixed before proceeding
to forecast creation, helping you identify and resolve issues early in the process.

The data validation step is preceded by a set of preprocessing activities to prepare the
data, based on the plan settings or definition, which includes the following:

- _Aggregation to align with forecast granularity._ For example:

- If your forecast granularity is set to weekly, daily demand history data will be aggregated to weekly totals.

- If your demand history contains product, site, customer, and channel dimensions, but your forecast granularity
is set to product-site level, the system will aggregate sales across all customers and channels for each product-site combination.

- _Data transformations from Demand Plan settings._ These transformations are
based on your Demand Planning configuration settings. For example, if you have
configured the system to ignore negative values, these will be handled
accordingly.

- _Product lineage consideration_. The system takes into account product
relationships, such as predecessor-successor pairs or product alternatives, as defined
in your configuration.

- _Supplementary time series transformation_. The system transforms
supplementary time series data into demand drivers that can influence the forecast
generation. These transformed demand drivers provide additional context to the items
above.
