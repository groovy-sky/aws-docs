# Ingesting data for existing connections

The following are the ingestion options if you're using Amazon S3:

- **Append** – To append the ingestion data
or for incremental ingestion, all files from the source path are combined into
a single dataset before being ingested into data lake. This method ensures
completeness of data for files spanning multiple days. When you remove files
from the source path in your S3 bucket, files that are only available in the
source path are ingested into data lake.

The _Append_ option
make
sure that your files in Amazon S3 are replicated and synchronized
in data lake.

- **Overwrite** – During replace, data files are ingested
into data lake as they're updated in the source path. Each new file replaces the
dataset entirely.

###### Note

You can delete source flows and corresponding data in both the _Append_ and _Overwrite_ options.

The following are the ingestion operation options for _EDI_,
_SAP S/4 HANA_, and _SAP ECC_:

- **Update** – Updates existing rows of data
using the same fields that are used in the recipe.

- **Replace** – Deletes existing, uploaded
data and replaces it with the new, incoming data.

- **Delete** – Deletes one or more rows of
data by using the primary IDs.

###### To start data ingestion, follow the procedure below.

1. On the AWS Supply Chain dashboard, on the left navigation pane, choose
    **Data Lake**.

2. On the **Data Ingestion** tab, choose **Connections**.

3. Select the connection to ingest data and choose **Data Ingestion**.

The **Data Ingestion Configuration** page appears.

4. Choose **Get started**.

5. On the **Data Ingestion Details** page, select if you would like to _Update_, _Replace_, or _Delete_ the data. Copy the Amazon S3 path by choosing **Copy**.
