# Prequisites before uploading your dataset

To successfully generate a forecast, make sure your dataset adheres to the following.

- At least one _product\_id_ has a sales history of at least four times the forecast time horizon provided in the _outbound\_order\_line_ dataset. For example, if the forecast time horizon is 26 weeks, the minimum order data requirement is 26\*4 = 104 weeks.

- _Product\_id_ under the product data entity should not contain any incomplete data (null or empty string) or duplicates.

- All the additional columns selected for granularity in the forecast configuration (that are _conditionally required_ ‘) does not contain incomplete data (null or empty string).

- The column _id_ across all data entities (for example, product\_id, site\_id, ship\_from\_site\_id) does not contain special characters, such as asterisk (\*) and double quotes (" ").

- The _order\_date_ does not contain invalid date. For example, 2/29/2023, that is 29th February 2023 is only valid on a leap year.

To improve forecast accuracy, Demand Planning highly recommends the following.

- Upload two to three years of outbound order line history as input to generate an accurate forecast. This duration allows the forecasting models to capture your business cycles and ensure a more robust and reliable prediction.

- For improved forecast accuracy, it is also recommended to include product attributes such as _brand_, _color_, _product\_group\_id_, _product\_introduction\_day_ and _discontinue\_day_ in the product data entity.

- You can provide additional demand drivers information through the _supplementary\_time\_series_ data entity. Note, only numerical values are supported.

- You provide alternate product mapping when you have similar products or previous version for a new product.

- Remove any non-recurring or one-time event such as COVID before uploading the historical sales data.
