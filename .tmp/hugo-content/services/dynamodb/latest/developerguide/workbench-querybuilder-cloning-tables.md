# Cloning tables with NoSQL Workbench

Cloning tables will copy a table’s key schema (and optionally GSI schema and items)
between your development environments. You can clone a table between DynamoDB local to an
Amazon DynamoDB account, and even clone a table from one account to another in different
Regions for faster experimentation.

###### To clone a table

1. In the **Operation Builder**, select your
    connection and Region (Region selection is not available for DynamoDB local).

2. Once you are connected to DynamoDB, browse your tables and select the table you
    want to clone.

3. From the horizontal ellipsis menu, select the **Clone** option.

4. Input your clone destination details:
1. Select a connection.

2. Select a Region (Region is not available for DynamoDB local).

3. Enter a new table name.

4. Choose a clone option:
      1. **Key schema** is selected by
          default and cannot be unselected. By default, cloning a table
          will copy your primary key and sort key if they are
          available.

      2. **GSI schema** is selected by
          default if your table to be cloned has a GSI. Cloning a table
          will copy your GSI primary key and sort key if they are
          available. You have the option to deselect GSI schema to skip
          cloning the GSI schema. Cloning a table will copy your base
          table’s capacity settings as the GSI’s capacity settings. You
          can use the `UpdateTable` operation in Operation
          Builder to update the table’s GSI capacity setting after cloning
          is complete.
5. Enter the number of items to clone. To only clone the key schema and
    optionally the GSI schema, you can keep the **Items to**
**clone** value at 0. The maximum number of items that can be cloned
    is 5000.

6. Choose a capacity mode:
1. **On-demand mode** is selected by
       default. DynamoDB on-demand offers pay-per-request pricing for read and
       write requests so that you pay only for what you use. To learn more, see
       [DynamoDB On-demand mode](capacity-mode.md#capacity-mode-on-demand)
       .

2. **Provisioned mode** lets you specify the
       number of reads and writes per second that you require for your
       application. You can use auto scaling to adjust your table’s provisioned
       capacity automatically in response to traffic changes. To learn more,
       see [DynamoDB\
       Provisioned mode](provisioned-capacity-mode.md).
7. Select **Clone** to begin cloning.

8. The cloning process will run in the background. The **Operation builder** tab will show a notification when there is a
    change in the cloning table status. You can access this status by selecting the
    **Operation builder** tab and then selecting
    the arrow button. The arrow button is located on the cloning table status widget
    located near the bottom of the menu sidebar.
