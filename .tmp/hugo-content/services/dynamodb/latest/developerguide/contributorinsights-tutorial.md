# Getting started with CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB

This section describes how to enable and use Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights in different
modes to meet your monitoring needs using the Amazon DynamoDB console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

In the following examples, you use the DynamoDB table that is defined in the [Getting started\
with DynamoDB](gettingstarteddynamodb.md) tutorial.

## Choosing a Contributor Insights mode

Before enabling Contributor Insights, you should understand the two available modes.
Review the mode comparison to select the option that best aligns with your specific
requirements.

AspectAccessed and throttled keys modeThrottled keys mode**Monitors**All requests (successful and throttled)Only throttled requests**Graphs**Most Accessed Items + Most Throttled ItemsMost Throttled Items only**Best for**Targeted analysis and optimizationThrottling monitoring**Use when**You need complete visibility into access patterns. You're doing
short-term analysis or debugging.Your primary concern is identifying and resolving throttling issues.
You want to keep Contributor Insights enabled continuously for real-time
throttling alerts.

## Using Contributor Insights (console)

The console provides an intuitive way to enable Contributor Insights and select the
appropriate mode for your monitoring needs.

###### To use Contributor Insights in the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose
    **Tables**.

3. Choose the `Music` table.

4. Choose the **Monitor** tab.

5. Choose **Turn on CloudWatch Contributor Insights**.

![Console screenshot showing monitor tab and button.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CI_ChooseAndManageNew.PNG)

6. In the **Manage CloudWatch Contributor Insights settings** dialog
    box, toggle **Turn on** for both the `Music` base
    table and the `AlbumTitle-index` global secondary index.

7. Leave the **Only throttled keys mode** toggle in the off
    position for both and then choose **Save changes**.

![Console screenshot showing Contributor Insights status list options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CI_Enable.png)

This enables the default _accessed and throttled keys_ mode
    for both the table and GSI, which provides monitoring of both accessed and
    throttled items. Switching the **Only throttled keys mode**
    toggle to the on position would enable the _throttled keys_
    mode.

If the operation fails, see [DescribeContributorInsights FailureException](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-describecontributorinsights.md#DDB-DescribeContributorInsights-response-FailureException) in
    the _Amazon DynamoDB API Reference_ for possible reasons.

8. The CloudWatch Contributor Insights graphs are now visible on the
    **Monitor** tab for the `Music` table. Since you
    enabled _accessed and throttled keys_ mode, you see both
    accessed and throttled item graphs.

### Switching between modes

You can switch between modes at any time without disabling Contributor
Insights.

###### To switch Contributor Insights modes

1. On the **Monitor** tab of your table, choose
    **Manage CloudWatch Contributor Insights**.

2. In the **Manage Contributor Insights settings** dialog
    box, for each base table or GSIs:

- Toggle **Only throttled keys mode** on or off to
enable the _throttled keys_ mode or go back to
the default _accessed and throttled keys_
mode.

- Toggle **Turn on** off to disable CloudWatch
Contributor Insight for a table or GSI.

3. Choose **Save changes**.

Once complete, the graphs will reflect the new mode.

### Creating CloudWatch alarms

Follow these steps to create a CloudWatch alarm and be notified when any partition
key consumes more than 50,000 [ConsumedThroughputUnits](contributorinsights-howitworks.md#contributorinsights_HowItWorks.Graphs.most-accessed) or experiences throttling.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch)

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose
    **Contributor Insights**.

3. Choose the appropriate rule based on your mode and what you want to
    monitor:

- For accessed items monitoring (accessed and throttled keys mode
only): Choose
**DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKC-Music**

- For throttled items monitoring (both modes): Choose
**DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKT-Music**

4. Choose the **Actions** drop down.

5. Choose **View in metrics**.

6. Choose **Max Contributor Value**.

###### Note

Only `Max Contributor Value` and `Maximum`
return useful statistics. The other statistics in this list don't return
meaningful values.

![Console screenshot showing Contributor Insights tab and button.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CI_AlarmsViewinMetrics.png)

7. On the **Actions** column, Choose **Create**
**Alarm**.

![Console screenshot showing Contributor Insights status list options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CI_AlarmsSetAlarm.png)

8. Enter an appropriate threshold value and choose
    **Next**:

- For accessed items (PKC rules): Enter 50000 for
`ConsumedThroughputUnits`

- For throttled items (PKT rules): Enter 1 for
`ThrottleCount` to be alerted on any
throttling

9. See [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/alarmthatsendsemail.md) for details on how to
    configure the notification for the alarm.

## Using Contributor Insights (AWS CLI)

The AWS CLI provides programmatic access to Contributor Insights with full support for
both modes. You can specify the mode when enabling Contributor Insights or switch modes
later.

### Basic operations with default mode

###### To use Contributor Insights with default settings

1. Enable CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB on the `Music` base
    table with the _accessed and throttled keys_ mode. Since
    `ACCESSED_AND_THROTTLED_KEYS` is the default mode, you can
    omit the
    `--contributor-insights-mode=ACCESSED_AND_THROTTLED_KEYS`
    parameter.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb update-contributor-insights \
                       --table-name Music \
                       --contributor-insights-action=ENABLE
```

2. Enable Contributor Insights for DynamoDB on the `AlbumTitle-index`
    global secondary index.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb update-contributor-insights \
                       --table-name Music \
                       --index-name AlbumTitle-index \
                       --contributor-insights-action=ENABLE
```

3. Get the status and rules for the `Music` table and all its
    indexes.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb describe-contributor-insights
                       --table-name Music
```

The response will include the `ContributorInsightsMode` field
    showing `ACCESSED_AND_THROTTLED_KEYS`.

4. List the status of the `Music` table and all its
    indexes.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb list-contributor-insights --table-name Music
```

### Enabling throttled keys mode

###### To enable Contributor Insights in throttled keys mode

1. Enable CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB on the `Music` base
    table with _throttled keys_ mode.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb update-contributor-insights \
       --table-name Music \
       --contributor-insights-action=ENABLE \
       --contributor-insights-mode=THROTTLED_KEYS
```

2. Enable Contributor Insights in _throttled keys_ mode
    for the `AlbumTitle-index` global secondary index.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb update-contributor-insights \
       --table-name Music \
       --index-name AlbumTitle-index \
       --contributor-insights-action=ENABLE \
       --contributor-insights-mode=THROTTLED_KEYS
```

3. Verify the mode by describing the Contributor Insights
    configuration.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb describe-contributor-insights --table-name Music
```

The response will show `ContributorInsightsMode` as
    `THROTTLED_KEYS` and fewer rules compared to the default
    mode.

### Switching between modes

###### To switch Contributor Insights modes

1. Switch from _throttled keys_ mode to _accessed_
_and throttled keys_ mode.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb update-contributor-insights \
       --table-name Music \
       --contributor-insights-action=ENABLE \
       --contributor-insights-mode=ACCESSED_AND_THROTTLED_KEYS
```

2. Switch from _accessed and throttled keys_ mode to
    _throttled keys_ mode.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb update-contributor-insights \
       --table-name Music \
       --contributor-insights-action=ENABLE \
       --contributor-insights-mode=THROTTLED_KEYS
```

3. Check the status during the transition.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb describe-contributor-insights --table-name Music
```

During the mode switch, the `ContributorInsightsStatus` will
    show as `ENABLING`. Once complete, it will show as
    `ENABLED` with the new mode.

### Managing Contributor Insights

###### To manage Contributor Insights settings

1. Disable CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB on the
    `AlbumTitle-index` global secondary index.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb update-contributor-insights \
                       --table-name Music --index-name AlbumTitle-index \
                       --contributor-insights-action=DISABLE
```

2. List all Contributor Insights configurations in your account.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb list-contributor-insights
```

This shows all tables and indexes with Contributor Insights enabled, along
    with their modes.

3. Get detailed information about a specific configuration.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb describe-contributor-insights \
                       --table-name Music \
                       --index-name AlbumTitle-index
```

### Example responses

Here are example responses showing the differences between modes:

#### Accessed and throttled keys mode response

```json

{
    "TableName": "Music",
    "ContributorInsightsRuleList": [
        "DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKC-Music-1234567890123",
        "DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKT-Music-1234567890123",
        "DynamoDBContributorInsights-SKC-Music-1234567890123",
        "DynamoDBContributorInsights-SKT-Music-1234567890123"
    ],
    "ContributorInsightsStatus": "ENABLED",
    "ContributorInsightsMode": "ACCESSED_AND_THROTTLED_KEYS",
    "LastUpdateDateTime": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Throttled keys mode response

```json

{
    "TableName": "Music",
    "ContributorInsightsRuleList": [
        "DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKT-Music-1234567890123",
        "DynamoDBContributorInsights-SKT-Music-1234567890123"
    ],
    "ContributorInsightsStatus": "ENABLED",
    "ContributorInsightsMode": "THROTTLED_KEYS",
    "LastUpdateDateTime": "2024-01-15T10:35:00.000Z"
}
```

Notice that throttled keys mode has fewer rules (only PKT and SKT), which
corresponds to a more focused monitoring.
