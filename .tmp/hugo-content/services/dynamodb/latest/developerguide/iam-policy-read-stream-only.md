# IAM policy to grant read access for a DynamoDB stream only (not for the table)

When you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, information is captured about every modification
to items in the table. For more information, see [Change data capture for DynamoDB Streams](streams.md).

In some cases, you might want to prevent an application from reading data from a
DynamoDB table, but still allow access to that table's streams. For example, you can
configure AWS Lambda to poll a stream and invoke a Lambda function when item updates
are detected, and then perform additional processing.

The following actions are available for controlling access to DynamoDB
streams:

- `dynamodb:DescribeStream`

- `dynamodb:GetRecords`

- `dynamodb:GetShardIterator`

- `dynamodb:ListStreams`

The following example policy grants users permissions to access the streams of a
table named `GameScores`. The wildcard character (\*) in the ARN matches
any stream associated with that table.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AccessGameScoresStreamOnly",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:DescribeStream",
                "dynamodb:GetRecords",
                "dynamodb:GetShardIterator",
                "dynamodb:ListStreams"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/GameScores/stream/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

Note that this policy grants access to the `GameScores` table's
streams, but not to the table itself.
