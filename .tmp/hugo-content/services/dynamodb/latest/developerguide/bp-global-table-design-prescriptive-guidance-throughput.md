# Throughput capacity planning for DynamoDB global tables

Migrating traffic from one Region to another requires careful consideration of DynamoDB table settings
regarding capacity.

Here are some considerations for managing write capacity:

- A global table must be in on-demand mode or provisioned with auto scaling enabled.

- If provisioned with auto scaling, the write settings (minimum, maximum, and target
utilization) are replicated across Regions. Although the auto scaling settings are
synchronized, the actual provisioned write capacity can float independently between
Regions.

- One reason you could see different provisioned write capacity is due to the TTL feature. When
you enable TTL in DynamoDB, you can specify an attribute name whose value indicates the time
of expiration for the item, in Unix epoch time format in seconds. After that time, DynamoDB
can delete the item without incurring write costs. With global tables, you can configure
TTL in any Region, and the setting is automatically replicated to other Regions that are
associated with the global table. When an item is eligible for deletion through a TTL
rule, that work can be done in any Region. The delete operation is performed without
consuming write units on the source table, but the replica tables will get a replicated
write of that delete operation and will incur replicated write unit costs. TTL isn't
supported in MRSC tables.

- If you’re using auto scaling, make sure that the maximum provisioned write capacity setting is
sufficiently high to handle all write operations as well as all potential TTL delete operations.
Auto scaling adjusts each Region according to its write consumption. On-demand tables have no
maximum provisioned write capacity setting, but the _table-level maximum write throughput_
_limit_ specifies the maximum sustained write capacity the on-demand table will allow. The
default limit to 40,000, but it is adjustable. We recommend that you set it high enough to handle
all write operations (including TTL write operations) that the on-demand table might need. This
value must be the same across all participating Regions when you set up global tables.

Here are some considerations for managing read capacity:

- Read capacity management settings are allowed to differ between Regions because it’s assumed
that different Regions might have independent read patterns. When you first add a global
replica to a table, the capacity of the source Region is propagated. After creation you can adjust
the read capacity settings, which aren’t transferred to the other side.

- When you use DynamoDB auto scaling, make sure that the maximum provisioned read capacity
settings are sufficiently high to handle all read operations across all Regions. During standard
operations the read capacity will perhaps be spread across Regions, but during failover the table
should be able to automatically adapt to the increased read workload. On-demand tables have
no maximum provisioned read capacity setting, but the _table-level maximum read throughput_
_limit_ specifies the maximum sustained read capacity the on-demand table will allow. The default
limit is 40,000, but it is adjustable. We recommend that you set it high enough to handle all read
operations that the table might need if all read operations were to route to this single Region.

- If a table in one Region doesn’t usually receive read traffic but might have to absorb a large
amount of read traffic after a failover, you can pre-warm the capacity of the to accept a
higher level of read traffic.

ARC has [readiness checks](../../../r53recovery/latest/dg/recovery-readiness-rules-resources.md) that can be useful for confirming that DynamoDB Regions have similar
table settings and account quotas, whether or not you use Route 53 to route requests. These
readiness checks can also help in adjusting account-level quotas to make sure they
match.
