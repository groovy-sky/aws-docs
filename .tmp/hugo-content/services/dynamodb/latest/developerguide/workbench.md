# NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB

NoSQL Workbench for Amazon DynamoDB is a cross-platform, client-side GUI application that you can use for modern database development and operations.
It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. NoSQL Workbench lets you design DynamoDB data models, define access patterns as real DynamoDB operations,
and validate them using sample data. Additionally you can organize your data models into projects.
NoSQL Workbench includes DynamoDB local, which makes it possible to test your tables and indexes before committing your data model to the cloud.
To learn more about DynamoDB local and its requirements,
see [Setting up DynamoDB local (downloadable version)](dynamodblocal.md).

**Data modeler**

With NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB, you can start a new project from scratch or use a sample project that matches your use case.
Then, you design tables and Global Secondary Indexes, define attributes, and configure sample data.
You can also visualize your access patterns as real DynamoDB operations (PutItem, UpdateItem, Query, and others) and run these operations against the configured sample data
to validate that the access pattern works as intended, making adjustments to the data model based on validation results.
Finally, once validated, you commit the model to either DynamoDB local or your AWS account for further testing and production use.
For collaboration, you can import and export designed data models.
For more information, see [Building data models with NoSQL Workbench](workbench-modeler.md).

**Operation builder**

NoSQL Workbench provides a rich graphical user interface for you to develop
and test queries. You can use the _operation builder_ to
view, explore, and query live datasets. The structured operation builder
supports projection expression, condition expression, and generates sample code in
multiple languages. You can directly clone tables from one Amazon DynamoDB account to
another one in different Regions. You can also directly clone tables between
DynamoDB local and an Amazon DynamoDB account for faster copying of your table’s key
schema (and optionally GSI schema and items) between your development
environments. For more information, see [Exploring datasets and building operations with NoSQL Workbench](workbench-querybuilder.md).
