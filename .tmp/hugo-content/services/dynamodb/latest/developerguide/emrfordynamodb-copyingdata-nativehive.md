# Copying data between DynamoDB and a native Hive table

If you have data in a DynamoDB table, you can copy the data to a native Hive table.
This will give you a snapshot of the data, as of the time you copied it.

You might decide to do this if you need to perform many HiveQL queries, but do not
want to consume provisioned throughput capacity from DynamoDB. Because the data in the
native Hive table is a copy of the data from DynamoDB, and not "live" data, your
queries should not expect that the data is up-to-date.

###### Note

The examples in this section are written with the assumption you followed the
steps in [Tutorial: Working with Amazon DynamoDB and Apache Hive](emrfordynamodb-tutorial.md) and have an external table in
DynamoDB named _ddb\_features_.

###### Example From DynamoDB to native Hive table

You can create a native Hive table and populate it with data from
_ddb\_features_, like this:

```nohighlight

CREATE TABLE features_snapshot AS
SELECT * FROM ddb_features;
```

You can then refresh the data at any time:

```nohighlight

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE features_snapshot
SELECT * FROM ddb_features;
```

In these examples, the subquery `SELECT * FROM ddb_features` will
retrieve all of the data from _ddb\_features_. If you only
want to copy a subset of the data, you can use a `WHERE` clause in
the subquery.

The following example creates a native Hive table, containing only some of the
attributes for lakes and summits:

```nohighlight

CREATE TABLE lakes_and_summits AS
SELECT feature_name, feature_class, state_alpha
FROM ddb_features
WHERE feature_class IN ('Lake','Summit');
```

###### Example From native Hive table to DynamoDB

Use the following HiveQL statement to copy the data from the native Hive table
to _ddb\_features_:

```nohighlight

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE ddb_features
SELECT * FROM features_snapshot;
```
