# DynamoDB item sizes and formats

DynamoDB tables are schemaless, except for the primary key, so the items in a table can
all have different attributes, sizes, and data types.

The total size of an item is the sum of the lengths of its attribute names and values,
plus any applicable overhead as described below. You can use the following guidelines to
estimate attribute sizes:

- Strings are Unicode with UTF-8 binary encoding. The size of a string is
_(number of UTF-8-encoded bytes of attribute name) + (number of_
_UTF-8-encoded bytes)_.

- Numbers are variable length, with up to 38 significant digits. Leading and
trailing zeroes are trimmed. The size of a number is approximately _(number of UTF-8-encoded bytes of attribute name) + (1 byte per two significant_
_digits) + (1 byte)_.

- A binary value must be encoded in base64 format before it can be sent to
DynamoDB, but the value's raw byte length is used for calculating size. The size of
a binary attribute is _(number of UTF-8-encoded bytes of attribute name) +_
_(number of raw bytes)._

- The size of a null attribute or a Boolean attribute is _(number of UTF-8-encoded bytes of attribute name) + (1 byte)_.

- An attribute of type `List` or `Map` requires 3 bytes of
overhead, regardless of its contents. The size of a `List` or
`Map` is _(number of UTF-8-encoded bytes of attribute name) + sum_
_(size of nested elements) + (3 bytes)_. The size of an empty
`List` or `Map` is _(number of UTF-8-encoded bytes of attribute name) + (3 bytes)_.

- Each `List` or `Map` element also requires 1 byte of
overhead.

###### Note

We recommend that you choose shorter attribute names rather than long ones. This
helps you reduce the amount of storage required, but also can lower the amount of
RCU/WCUs you use.

For storage billing purposes, each item includes a per-item storage overhead that
depends on the features you have enabled.

- All items in DynamoDB require 100 bytes of storage overhead for indexing.

- Some DynamoDB features (global tables, transactions, change data capture for
Kinesis Data Streams with DynamoDB) require additional storage overhead to account for
system-created attributes resulting from enabling those features. For example,
global tables requires an additional 48 bytes of storage overhead.
