# DynamoDB detective security best practices

The following best practices for Amazon DynamoDB can help you detect potential security
weaknesses and incidents.

**Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor AWS managed KMS key usage**

If you are using an [AWS managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#aws-managed-cmk) for encryption at rest, usage of this key is
logged into AWS CloudTrail. CloudTrail provides visibility into user activity by
recording actions taken on your account. CloudTrail records important information
about each action, including who made the request, the services used, the
actions performed, parameters for the actions, and the response elements
returned by the AWS service. This information helps you track changes made
to your AWS resources and troubleshoot operational issues. CloudTrail makes it
easier to ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory
standards.

You can use CloudTrail to audit key usage. CloudTrail creates log files that contain a
history of AWS API calls and related events for your account. These log
files include all AWS KMS API requests made using the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs,
and command line tools, in addition to those made through integrated AWS
services. You can use these log files to get information about when the
KMS key was used, the operation that was requested, the identity of the
requester, the IP address that the request came from, and so on. For more
information, see [Logging\
AWS KMS API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.md) and the [AWS CloudTrail User\
Guide](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md).

**Monitor DynamoDB operations using CloudTrail**

CloudTrail can monitor both control plane events and data plane events. Control
plane operations let you create and manage DynamoDB tables. They also let you
work with indexes, streams, and other objects that are dependent on tables.
Data plane operations let you perform create, read, update, and delete (also
called _CRUD_) actions on data in a table.
Some data plane operations also let you read data from a secondary index. To
enable logging of data plane events in CloudTrail, you'll need to enable logging
of data plane API activity in CloudTrail. See [Logging data events for trails](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md) for more information.

When activity occurs in DynamoDB, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event
along with other AWS service events in the event history. For more
information, see [Logging DynamoDB Operations by Using AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md). You can view,
search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more
information, see [Viewing\
Events with CloudTrail Event History](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md) in the _AWS CloudTrail User_
_Guide_.

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events
for DynamoDB, create a [trail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.md). A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service
(Amazon S3) bucket. By default, when you create a trail on the console, the trail
applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the
AWS partition and delivers the log files to the S3 bucket that you
specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further
analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs.

**Use DynamoDB Streams to monitor data plane operations**

DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create triggers—pieces
of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. With triggers, you can
build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables.

If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) with a Lambda function that you write. Immediately after
an item in the table is modified, a new record appears in the table's
stream. AWS Lambda polls the stream and invokes your Lambda function
synchronously when it detects new stream records. The Lambda function can
perform any actions that you specify, such as sending a notification or
initiating a workflow.

For an example, see [Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda\
with Amazon DynamoDB Streams](../../../lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb-example.md). This example receives a DynamoDB event input,
processes the messages that it contains, and writes some of the incoming
event data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

**Monitor DynamoDB configuration with AWS Config**

Using [AWS Config](../../../config/latest/developerguide/whatisconfig.md), you
can continuously monitor and record configuration changes of your AWS
resources. You can also use AWS Config to inventory your AWS resources. When a
change from a previous state is detected, an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification
can be delivered for you to review and take action. Follow the guidance in
[Setting Up AWS Config with\
the Console](../../../config/latest/developerguide/gs-console.md), ensuring that DynamoDB resource types are
included.

You can configure AWS Config to stream configuration changes and notifications
to an Amazon SNS topic. For example, when a resource is updated, you can get a
notification sent to your email, so that you can view the changes. You can
also be notified when AWS Config evaluates your custom or managed rules against
your resources.

For an example, see [Notifications that AWS Config Sends to an Amazon SNS topic](../../../config/latest/developerguide/notifications-for-aws-config.md) in the
_AWS Config Developer Guide_.

**Monitor DynamoDB compliance with AWS Config rules**

AWS Config continuously tracks the configuration changes that occur among your
resources. It checks whether these changes violate any of the conditions in
your rules. If a resource violates a rule, AWS Config flags the resource and the
rule as noncompliant.

By using AWS Config to evaluate your resource configurations, you can assess how
well your resource configurations comply with internal practices, industry
guidelines, and regulations. AWS Config provides [AWS managed rules](../../../config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.md), which are predefined, customizable rules
that AWS Config uses to evaluate whether your AWS resources comply with common
best practices.

**Tag your DynamoDB resources for identification and automation**

You can assign metadata to your AWS resources in the form of tags. Each
tag is a simple label consisting of a customer-defined key and an optional
value that can make it easier to manage, search for, and filter resources.

Tagging allows for grouped controls to be implemented. Although there are
no inherent types of tags, they enable you to categorize resources by
purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. The following are some
examples:

- Security – Used to determine requirements such as
encryption.

- Confidentiality – An identifier for the specific
data-confidentiality level a resource supports.

- Environment – Used to distinguish between development,
test, and production infrastructure.

For more information, see [AWS Tagging Strategies](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies) and [Tagging for\
DynamoDB](tagging.md).

**Monitor your usage of Amazon DynamoDB as it relates to security best practices by**
**using AWS Security Hub CSPM.**

Security Hub CSPM uses security controls to evaluate resource configurations and
security standards to help you comply with various compliance
frameworks.

For more information about using Security Hub CSPM to evaluate DynamoDB resources, see
[Amazon DynamoDB\
controls](../../../securityhub/latest/userguide/dynamodb-controls.md) in the _AWS Security Hub CSPM User_
_Guide_.
