# Monitoring tools for DynamoDB Accelerator

AWS provides tools that you can use to monitor Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX). You can
configure some of these tools to do the monitoring for you, and some require manual
intervention. We recommend that you automate monitoring tasks as much as
possible.

## Automated monitoring tools

You can use the following automated monitoring tools to watch
DAX and report when something is wrong:

- **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms** – Watch a single metric over a time period
that you specify, and perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative
to a given threshold over a number of time periods. The action is a notification sent to an
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because
they are in a particular state; the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified
number of periods. For more information, see [Monitoring metrics in DynamoDB with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-metrics-with-amazon-cloudwatch.md).

- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** – Monitor, store, and access your log files from AWS CloudTrail
or other sources. For more information, see [Monitoring Log Files](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/developerguide/whatiscloudwatchlogs.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

- **Amazon CloudWatch Events** – Match events and route them to one
or more target functions or streams to make changes, capture state
information, and take corrective action. For more information, see [What is Amazon CloudWatch Events](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/developerguide/whatiscloudwatchevents.md) in
the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

- **AWS CloudTrail Log Monitoring** – Share log files
between accounts, monitor CloudTrail log files in real time by sending them to
CloudWatch Logs, write log processing applications in Java, and validate that your log
files have not changed after delivery by CloudTrail. For more information, see
[Working with\
CloudTrail Log Files](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-working-with-log-files.md) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

## Manual monitoring tools

Another important part of monitoring DAX involves manually monitoring those
items that the CloudWatch alarms don't cover. The DAX, CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor, and other
AWS Management Console dashboards provide an at-a-glance view of the state of your AWS
environment. We recommend that you also check the log files on DAX.

- The DAX dashboard shows the following:

- Service health

- The CloudWatch home page shows the following:

- Current alarms and status

- Graphs of alarms and resources

- Service health status

In addition, you can use CloudWatch to do the following:

- Create [customized dashboards](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-dashboards.md) to monitor the services that you
care about.

- Graph metric data to troubleshoot issues and discover
trends.

- Search and browse all of your AWS resource metrics.

- Create and edit alarms to be notified of problems.
