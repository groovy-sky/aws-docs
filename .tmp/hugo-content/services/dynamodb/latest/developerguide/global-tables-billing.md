# Understanding Amazon DynamoDB billing for global tables

This guide describes how DynamoDB billing works for global tables, identifying the
components that contribute to the cost of global tables, including a practical example.

[Amazon DynamoDB global tables](globaltables.md) is a fully managed,
serverless, multi-Region, and multi-active database. Global tables are designed for
[99.999% availability](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/sla),
delivering increased application resiliency, and improved business continuity. Global
tables replicate your DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS Regions so
you can achieve fast, local read and write performance.

## How it works

The billing model for global tables differs from single-Region DynamoDB tables. Write
operations for single-Region DynamoDB tables are billed using the following
units:

- Write Request Units (WRUs) for on-demand capacity mode, where one WRU is
charged for each write up to 1KB

- Write Capacity Units (WCUs) for provisioned capacity mode, where one WCU
provides one write per second for up to 1 KB

When you create a global table by adding a replica table to an existing
single-Region table, that single-Region table becomes a replica table, which means
the units used to bill for writes to the table also change. Write operations to
replica tables are billed using the following units:

- Replicated Write Request Units (rWRUs) for on-demand capacity mode, where
one rWRU per replica table is charged for each write up to 1KB

- Replicated Write Capacity Units (rWCUs) for provisioned capacity mode,
where one WCU per replica table provides one write per second for up to 1
KB

Updates to Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) are billed using the same units as
single-Region DynamoDB tables, even if the base table for the GSI is a replica
table. Update operations for GSIs are billed using the following units:

- Write Request Units (WRUs) for on-demand capacity mode, where one WRU is
charged for each write up to 1KB

- Write Capacity Units (WCUs) for provisioned capacity mode, where one WCU
provides one write per second for up to 1 KB

Replicated write units (rWCUs and rWRUs) are priced the same as single-Region
write units (WCUs and WRUs). Cross-Region data transfer fees apply for global tables
as data is replicated across Regions. Replicated write (rWCU or rWRU) charges are
incurred in every Region containing a replica table for the global table.

Read operations from single-Region tables and from replica tables use the
following units::

- Read Request Units (RRUs) for on-demand capacity mode, where one RRU is
charged for each strongly consistent read up to 4KB

- Read Capacity Units (RCUs) for provisioned tables, where one RCU provides
one strongly consistent read per second for up to 4KB

## Consistency modes and billing

The replicated write units (rWCUs and rWRUs) used to bill for write operations are
identical for both multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) and multi-Region eventual
consistency (MREC) modes. Global tables using multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC)
mode configured with a witness don't incur replicated write unit costs
(rWCUs and rWRUs), storage costs, or data transfer costs for replication to the witness.

## DynamoDB global tables billing example

Let's walk through a multi-day example scenario to see how global table write
request billing works in practice (note that this example only considers write
requests, and does not include the table restore and cross-Region data transfer
charges that would be incurred in the example):

**Day 1 - Single-Region table:** You have a
single-Region on-demand DynamoDB table named Table\_A in the us-west-2 Region. You
write 100 1KB items to Table\_A. For these single-Region write operations, you are
charged 1 write request unit (WRU) per 1KB written. Your day 1 charges are:

- 100 WRUs in the us-west-2 Region for single-Region writes

The total request units charged on day 1: **100**
**WRUs**.

**Day 2 - Creating a global table:** You create a
global table by adding a replica to Table\_A in the us-east-2 Region. Table\_A is now
a global table with two replica tables; one in the us-west-2 Region, and one in the
us-east-2 Region. You write 150 1KB items to the replica table in the us-west-2
Region. Your day 2 charges are:

- 150 rWRUs in the us-west-2 Region for replicated writes

- 150 rWRUs in the us-east-2 Region for replicated writes

The total request units charged on day 2: **300**
**rWRUs**.

**Day 3 - Adding a Global Secondary Index:** You add
a global secondary index (GSI) to the replica table in the us-east-2 Region that
projects all attributes from the base (replica) table. The global table
automatically creates the GSI on the replica table in the us-west-2 Region for you.
You write 200 new 1KB records to the replica table in the us-west-2 Region. Your day
3 charges are:

- • 200 rWRUs in the us-west-2 Region for replicated writes

- • 200 WRUs in the us-west-2 Region for GSI updates

- • 200 rWRUs in the us-east-2 Region for replicated writes

- • 200 WRUs in the us-east-2 Region for GSI updates

The total write request units charged on day 3: **400 WRUs and**
**400 rWRUs**.

The total write unit charges for all three days are 500WRUs (100 WRU on day 1 +
400 WRUs on day 3) and 700 rWRUs (300 rWRUs on Day2 + 400 rWRUs on Day 3).

In summary, replica table write operations are billed in replicated write units in
all Regions that contain a replica table. If you have global secondary indexes, you
are charged write units for updates to GSIs in all regions that contain a GSI (which
in a global table is all Regions that contain a replica table).
