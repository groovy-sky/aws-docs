# Differences in scanning a table

In SQL, a `SELECT` statement without a `WHERE` clause will
return every row in a table. In Amazon DynamoDB, the `Scan` operation does the
same thing. In both cases, you can retrieve all of the items or just some of
them.

Whether you are using a SQL or a NoSQL database, scans should be used sparingly
because they can consume large amounts of system resources. Sometimes a scan is
appropriate (such as scanning a small table) or unavoidable (such as performing a
bulk export of data). However, as a general rule, you should design your
applications to avoid performing scans. For more information, see [Querying tables in DynamoDB](query.md).

###### Note

Doing a bulk export also creates at least 1 file per partition. All of the
items in each file are from that particular partition's hashed keyspace.

## Scanning a table with SQL

When using SQL you can scan a table and retrieve all of its data by using a
`SELECT` statement without specifying a `WHERE`
clause. You can request one or more columns in the result. Or you can request
all of them if you use the wildcard character (\*).

The following are examples of using a `SELECT` statement.

```nohighlight

/* Return all of the data in the table */
SELECT * FROM Music;
```

```nohighlight

/* Return all of the values for Artist and Title */
SELECT Artist, Title FROM Music;
```

## Scanning a table in DynamoDB

In Amazon DynamoDB, you can use either the DynamoDB API or [PartiQL](ql-reference.md) (a SQL-compatible query
language) to perform a scan on a table.

DynamoDB API

With the DynamoDB API, you use the `Scan` operation to
return one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item
in a table or a secondary index.

```nohighlight

// Return all of the data in the table
{
    TableName:  "Music"
}
```

```nohighlight

// Return all of the values for Artist and Title
{
    TableName:  "Music",
    ProjectionExpression: "Artist, Title"
}
```

The `Scan` operation also provides a
`FilterExpression` parameter, which you can use to
discard items that you do not want to appear in the results. A
`FilterExpression` is applied after the scan is
performed, but before the results are returned to you. (This is not
recommended with large tables. You are still charged for the entire
`Scan`, even if only a few matching items are
returned.)

PartiQL for DynamoDB

With PartiQL, you perform a scan by using the
`ExecuteStatement` operation to return all the
contents for a table using the `Select` statement.

```sql

SELECT AlbumTitle, Year, Price
FROM Music
```

Note that this statement will return all items for in the Music
table.

For code examples using `Select` and
`ExecuteStatement`, see [PartiQL select statements for DynamoDB](ql-reference-select.md).
