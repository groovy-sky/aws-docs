# DynamoDBContext class from the .NET object persistence model

The `DynamoDBContext` class is the entry point to the Amazon DynamoDB database.
It provides a connection to DynamoDB and enables you to access your data in various tables,
perform various CRUD operations, and run queries. The `DynamoDBContext` class
provides the following methods.

## Create​MultiTable​BatchGet

Creates a `MultiTableBatchGet` object, composed of multiple individual
`BatchGet` objects. Each of these `BatchGet` objects can
be used for retrieving items from a single DynamoDB table.

To retrieve the items from tables, use the `ExecuteBatchGet` method,
passing the `MultiTableBatchGet` object as a parameter.

## Create​MultiTable​BatchWrite

Creates a `MultiTableBatchWrite` object, composed of multiple
individual `BatchWrite` objects. Each of these `BatchWrite`
objects can be used for writing or deleting items in a single DynamoDB table.

To write to tables, use the `ExecuteBatchWrite` method, passing the
`MultiTableBatchWrite` object as a parameter.

## CreateBatchGet

Creates a `BatchGet` object that you can use to retrieve multiple items
from a table.

## CreateBatchWrite

Creates a `BatchWrite` object that you can use to put multiple items
into a table, or to delete multiple items from a table.

## Delete

Deletes an item from the table. The method requires the primary key of the item
you want to delete. You can provide either the primary key value or a client-side
object containing a primary key value as a parameter to this method.

- If you specify a client-side object as a parameter and you have enabled
optimistic locking, the delete succeeds only if the client-side and the
server-side versions of the object match.

- If you specify only the primary key value as a parameter, the delete
succeeds regardless of whether you have enabled optimistic locking or
not.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the `DeleteAsync`
method instead.

## Dispose

Disposes of all managed and unmanaged resources.

## Execute​Batch​Get

Reads data from one or more tables, processing all of the `BatchGet`
objects in a `MultiTableBatchGet`.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the
`ExecuteBatchGetAsync` method instead.

## Execute​Batch​Write

Writes or deletes data in one or more tables, processing all of the
`BatchWrite` objects in a `MultiTableBatchWrite`.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the
`ExecuteBatchWriteAsync` method instead.

## FromDocument

Given an instance of a `Document`, the `FromDocument` method
returns an instance of a client-side class.

This is helpful if you want to use the document model classes along with the
object persistence model to perform any data operations. For more information about
the document model classes provided by the AWS SDK for .NET, see [Working with the .NET document model in DynamoDB](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/dotnetsdkmidlevel.md).

Suppose that you have a `Document` object named `doc`, that
contains a representation of a `Forum` item. (To see how to construct
this object, see the description for the `ToDocument` method later in
this topic.) You can use `FromDocument` to retrieve the
`Forum` item from the `Document`, as shown in the
following C# code example.

###### Example

```csharp

forum101 = context.FromDocument<Forum>(101);
```

###### Note

If your `Document` object implements the `IEnumerable`
interface, you can use the `FromDocuments` method instead. This
allows you to iterate over all of the class instances in the
`Document`.

## FromQuery

Runs a `Query` operation, with the query parameters defined in a
`QueryOperationConfig` object.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the
`FromQueryAsync` method instead.

## FromScan

Runs a `Scan` operation, with the scan parameters defined in a
`ScanOperationConfig` object.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the
`FromScanAsync` method instead.

## Get​Target​Table

Retrieves the target table for the specified type. This is useful if you are
writing a custom converter for mapping arbitrary data to a DynamoDB table, and you need
to determine which table is associated with a custom data type.

## Load

Retrieves an item from a table. The method requires only the primary key of the
item you want to retrieve.

By default, DynamoDB returns the item with values that are eventually consistent. For
information about the eventual consistency model, see [DynamoDB read consistency](howitworks-readconsistency.md).

`Load` or `LoadAsync` method calls the [GetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-getitem.md) operation, which requires you to specify the primary key for
the table. Because `GetItem` ignores the `IndexName`
parameter, you can’t load an item using an index’s partition or sort key. Therefore,
you must use the table's primary key to load an item.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the `LoadAsync`
method instead. To view an example of using the `LoadAsync` method to
perform high-level CRUD operations on a DynamoDB table, see the following
example.

```csharp

    /// <summary>
    /// Shows how to perform high-level CRUD operations on an Amazon DynamoDB
    /// table.
    /// </summary>
    public class HighLevelItemCrud
    {
        public static async Task Main()
        {
            var client = new AmazonDynamoDBClient();
            DynamoDBContext context = new DynamoDBContext(client);
            await PerformCRUDOperations(context);
        }

        public static async Task PerformCRUDOperations(IDynamoDBContext context)
        {
            int bookId = 1001; // Some unique value.
            Book myBook = new Book
            {
                Id = bookId,
                Title = "object persistence-AWS SDK for.NET SDK-Book 1001",
                Isbn = "111-1111111001",
                BookAuthors = new List<string> { "Author 1", "Author 2" },
            };

            // Save the book to the ProductCatalog table.
            await context.SaveAsync(myBook);

            // Retrieve the book from the ProductCatalog table.
            Book bookRetrieved = await context.LoadAsync<Book>(bookId);

            // Update some properties.
            bookRetrieved.Isbn = "222-2222221001";

            // Update existing authors list with the following values.
            bookRetrieved.BookAuthors = new List<string> { " Author 1", "Author x" };
            await context.SaveAsync(bookRetrieved);

            // Retrieve the updated book. This time, add the optional
            // ConsistentRead parameter using DynamoDBContextConfig object.
            await context.LoadAsync<Book>(bookId, new DynamoDBContextConfig
            {
                ConsistentRead = true,
            });

            // Delete the book.
            await context.DeleteAsync<Book>(bookId);

            // Try to retrieve deleted book. It should return null.
            Book deletedBook = await context.LoadAsync<Book>(bookId, new DynamoDBContextConfig
            {
                ConsistentRead = true,
            });

            if (deletedBook == null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Book is deleted");
            }
        }
    }

```

## Query

Queries a table based on query parameters you provide.

You can query a table only if it has a composite primary key (partition key and
sort key). When querying, you must specify a partition key and a condition that
applies to the sort key.

Suppose that you have a client-side `Reply` class mapped to the
`Reply` table in DynamoDB. The following C# code example queries the
`Reply` table to find forum thread replies posted in the past 15
days. The `Reply` table has a primary key that has the `Id`
partition key and the `ReplyDateTime` sort key.

###### Example

```csharp

DynamoDBContext context = new DynamoDBContext(client);

string replyId = "DynamoDB#DynamoDB Thread 1"; //Partition key
DateTime twoWeeksAgoDate = DateTime.UtcNow.Subtract(new TimeSpan(14, 0, 0, 0)); // Date to compare.
IEnumerable<Reply> latestReplies = context.Query<Reply>(replyId, QueryOperator.GreaterThan, twoWeeksAgoDate);
```

This returns a collection of `Reply` objects.

The `Query` method returns a "lazy-loaded" `IEnumerable`
collection. It initially returns only one page of results, and then makes a service
call for the next page if needed. To obtain all the matching items, you need to
iterate only over the `IEnumerable`.

If your table has a simple primary key (partition key), you can't use the
`Query` method. Instead, you can use the `Load` method and
provide the partition key to retrieve the item.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the `QueryAsync`
method instead.

## Save

Saves the specified object to the table. If the primary key specified in the input
object doesn't exist in the table, the method adds a new item to the table. If the
primary key exists, the method updates the existing item.

If you have optimistic locking configured, the update succeeds only if the client
and the server-side versions of the item match. For more information, see [Optimistic locking using DynamoDB and the AWS SDK for .NET object persistence model](dynamodbcontext-versionsupport.md).

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the `SaveAsync`
method instead.

## Scan

Performs an entire table scan.

You can filter scan results by specifying a scan condition. The condition can be
evaluated on any attributes in the table. Suppose that you have a client-side class
`Book` mapped to the `ProductCatalog` table in DynamoDB. The
following C# example scans the table and returns only the book items priced less
than 0.

###### Example

```csharp

IEnumerable<Book> itemsWithWrongPrice = context.Scan<Book>(
                    new ScanCondition("Price", ScanOperator.LessThan, price),
                    new ScanCondition("ProductCategory", ScanOperator.Equal, "Book")
      );
```

The `Scan` method returns a "lazy-loaded" `IEnumerable`
collection. It initially returns only one page of results, and then makes a service
call for the next page if needed. To obtain all the matching items, you only need to
iterate over the `IEnumerable`.

For performance reasons, you should query your tables and avoid a table
scan.

###### Note

To perform this operation in the background, use the `ScanAsync`
method instead.

## ToDocument

Returns an instance of the `Document` document model class from your
class instance.

This is helpful if you want to use the document model classes along with the
object persistence model to perform any data operations. For more information about
the document model classes provided by the AWS SDK for .NET, see [Working with the .NET document model in DynamoDB](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/dotnetsdkmidlevel.md).

Suppose that you have a client-side class mapped to the sample `Forum`
table. You can then use a `DynamoDBContext` to get an item as a
`Document` object from the `Forum` table, as shown in the
following C# code example.

###### Example

```csharp

DynamoDBContext context = new DynamoDBContext(client);

Forum forum101 = context.Load<Forum>(101); // Retrieve a forum by primary key.
Document doc = context.ToDocument<Forum>(forum101);
```

## Specifying optional parameters for DynamoDBContext

When using the object persistence model, you can specify the following optional
parameters for the `DynamoDBContext`.

- `ConsistentRead`—When
retrieving data using the `Load`, `Query`, or
`Scan` operations, you can add this optional parameter to
request the latest values for the data.

- `IgnoreNullValues`—This
parameter informs `DynamoDBContext` to ignore null values on
attributes during a `Save` operation. If this parameter is false
(or if it is not set), then a null value is interpreted as a directive to
delete the specific attribute.

- `SkipVersionCheck`— This
parameter informs `DynamoDBContext` not to compare versions when
saving or deleting an item. For more information about versioning, see [Optimistic locking using DynamoDB and the AWS SDK for .NET object persistence model](dynamodbcontext-versionsupport.md).

- `TableNamePrefix`—
Prefixes all table names with a specific string. If this parameter is null
(or if it is not set), then no prefix is used.

- `DynamoDBEntryConversion` – Specifies the conversion
schema that is used by the client. You can set this parameter to version V1
or V2. V1 is the default version.

Based on the version that you set, the behavior of this parameter changes.
For example:

- In V1, the `bool` data type is converted to the
`N` number type, where 0 represents false and 1
represents true. In V2, `bool` is converted to
`BOOL`.

- In V2, lists and arrays aren’t grouped together with HashSets.
Lists and arrays of numerics, string-based types, and binary-based
types are converted to the `L` (List) type, which can be
sent empty to update a list. This is unlike V1, where an empty list
isn't sent over the wire.

In V1, collection types, such as List, HashSet, and arrays are
treated the same. List, HashSet, and array of numerics is converted
to the `NS` (number set) type.

The following example sets the conversion schema version to V2, which
changes the conversion behavior between .NET types and DynamoDB data
types.

```csharp

var config = new DynamoDBContextConfig
{
    Conversion = DynamoDBEntryConversion.V2
};
var contextV2 = new DynamoDBContext(client, config);
```

The following C# example creates a new `DynamoDBContext` by specifying
two of the preceding optional parameters, `ConsistentRead` and
`SkipVersionCheck`.

###### Example

```csharp

AmazonDynamoDBClient client = new AmazonDynamoDBClient();
...
DynamoDBContext context =
       new DynamoDBContext(client, new DynamoDBContextConfig { ConsistentRead = true, SkipVersionCheck = true});
```

`DynamoDBContext` includes these optional parameters with each request
that you send using this context.

Instead of setting these parameters at the `DynamoDBContext` level, you
can specify them for individual operations you run using
`DynamoDBContext`, as shown in the following C# code example. The
example loads a specific book item. The `Load` method of
`DynamoDBContext` specifies the `ConsistentRead` and
`SkipVersionCheck` optional parameters.

###### Example

```csharp

AmazonDynamoDBClient client = new AmazonDynamoDBClient();
...
DynamoDBContext context = new DynamoDBContext(client);
Book bookItem = context.Load<Book>(productId,new DynamoDBContextConfig{ ConsistentRead = true, SkipVersionCheck = true });
```

In this case, `DynamoDBContext` includes these parameters only when
sending the `Get` request.
