# Take advantage of sparse indexes

For any item in a table, DynamoDB writes a corresponding index entry **only if the index key attributes are present in the item**. For a global secondary index, this
means the index partition key must be defined on the item, and if the index also has a sort
key, that attribute must be present too. If either key attribute is missing from an item, that
item does not appear in the index. An index where only a subset of items from the base table
appear is called a _sparse_ index.

Sparse indexes are useful for queries over a small subsection of a table. For example,
suppose that you have a table where you store all your customer orders, with the following key
attributes:

- Partition key: `CustomerId`

- Sort key: `OrderId`

To track open orders, you can insert an attribute named `isOpen` in order items
that have not already shipped. Then when the order ships, you can delete the attribute. If you
then create an index on `CustomerId` (partition key) and `isOpen` (sort
key), only those orders with `isOpen` defined appear in it. When you have thousands
of orders of which only a small number are open, it's faster and less expensive to query that
index for open orders than to scan the entire table.

Instead of using a type of attribute like `isOpen`, you could use an attribute
with a value that results in a useful sort order in the index. For example, you could use an
`OrderOpenDate` attribute set to the date on which each order was placed, and
then delete it after the order is fulfilled. That way, when you query the sparse index, the
items are returned sorted by the date on which each order was placed.

## Examples of sparse indexes in DynamoDB

Global secondary indexes are sparse by default. When you create a global secondary
index, you specify a partition key and optionally a sort key. Only items in the base table
that contain the required key attributes appear in the index. If an item is missing the
index partition key—or the sort key, when one is defined—that item is excluded
from the index.

By designing a global secondary index to be sparse, you can provision it with lower
write throughput than that of the base table, while still achieving excellent
performance.

For example, a gaming application might track all scores of every user, but generally
only needs to query a few high scores. The following design handles this scenario
efficiently:

Here, Rick has played three games and achieved `Champ` status in one of them.
Padma has played four games and achieved `Champ` status in two of them. Notice
that the `Award` attribute is present only in items where the user achieved an
award. The associated global secondary index looks like the following:

The global secondary index contains only the high scores that are frequently queried,
which are a small subset of the items in the base table.
