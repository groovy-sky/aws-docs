# DynamoDB API

To work with Amazon DynamoDB, your application must use a few simple API operations. The
following is a summary of these operations, organized by category.

###### Note

For a full list of the API operations, see the [Amazon DynamoDB API\
Reference](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/welcome.md).

###### Topics

- [Control plane](#HowItWorks.API.ControlPlane)

- [Data plane](#HowItWorks.API.DataPlane)

- [DynamoDB Streams](#HowItWorks.API.Streams)

- [Transactions](#HowItWorks.API.Transactions)

## Control plane

_Control plane_ operations let you create and manage DynamoDB
tables. They also let you work with indexes, streams, and other objects that are
dependent on tables.

- `CreateTable` – Creates a new table. Optionally, you can
create one or more secondary indexes, and enable DynamoDB Streams for the table.

- `DescribeTable`– Returns information about a table, such
as its primary key schema, throughput settings, and index
information.

- `ListTables` – Returns the names of all of your tables in
a list.

- `UpdateTable` – Modifies the settings of a table or its
indexes, creates or removes new indexes on a table, or modifies DynamoDB Streams
settings for a table.

- `DeleteTable` – Removes a table and all of its dependent
objects from DynamoDB.

## Data plane

_Data plane_ operations let you perform create, read, update,
and delete (also called _CRUD_) actions on data in a table. Some
of the data plane operations also let you read data from a secondary index.

You can use [PartiQL - a SQL-compatible query language for Amazon DynamoDB](ql-reference.md), to
perform these CRUD operations or you can use DynamoDB’s classic CRUD APIs that
separates each operation into a distinct API call.

### PartiQL - A SQL-compatible query language

- `ExecuteStatement` – Reads multiple items from a
table. You can also write or update a single item from a table. When
writing or updating a single item, you must specify the primary key
attributes.

- `BatchExecuteStatement` – Writes, updates or reads
multiple items from a table. This is more efficient than
`ExecuteStatement` because your application only needs a
single network round trip to write or read the items.

### Classic APIs

#### Creating data

- `PutItem` – Writes a single item to a table. You
must specify the primary key attributes, but you don't have to
specify other attributes.

- `BatchWriteItem` – Writes up to
25 items to a table. This is more
efficient than calling `PutItem` multiple times because
your application only needs a single network round trip to write the
items.

#### Reading data

- `GetItem` – Retrieves a single item from a table.
You must specify the primary key for the item that you want. You can
retrieve the entire item, or just a subset of its attributes.

- `BatchGetItem` – Retrieves up to
100 items from one or more tables.
This is more efficient than calling `GetItem` multiple
times because your application only needs a single network round
trip to read the items.

- `Query` – Retrieves all items that have a
specific partition key. You must specify the partition key value.
You can retrieve entire items, or just a subset of their attributes.
Optionally, you can apply a condition to the sort key values so that
you only retrieve a subset of the data that has the same partition
key. You can use this operation on a table, provided that the table
has both a partition key and a sort key. You can also use this
operation on an index, provided that the index has both a partition
key and a sort key.

- `Scan` – Retrieves all items in the specified
table or index. You can retrieve entire items, or just a subset of
their attributes. Optionally, you can apply a filtering condition to
return only the values that you are interested in and discard the
rest.

#### Updating data

- `UpdateItem` – Modifies one or more attributes in
an item. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want
to modify. You can add new attributes and modify or remove existing
attributes. You can also perform conditional updates, so that the
update is only successful when a user-defined condition is met.
Optionally, you can implement an atomic counter, which increments or
decrements a numeric attribute without interfering with other write
requests.

#### Deleting data

- `DeleteItem` – Deletes a single item from a
table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want
to delete.

- `BatchWriteItem` – Deletes up to
25 items from one or more tables. This
is more efficient than calling `DeleteItem` multiple
times because your application only needs a single network round
trip to delete the items.

###### Note

You can use `BatchWriteItem` to both create data
and delete data.

## DynamoDB Streams

_DynamoDB Streams_ operations let you enable or disable a stream on a
table, and allow access to the data modification records contained in a
stream.

- `ListStreams` – Returns a list of all your streams, or
just the stream for a specific table.

- `DescribeStream` – Returns information about a stream,
such as its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and where your application can begin
reading the first few stream records.

- `GetShardIterator` – Returns a _shard_
_iterator_, which is a data structure that your application
uses to retrieve the records from the stream.

- `GetRecords` – Retrieves one or more stream records,
using a given shard iterator.

## Transactions

_Transactions_ provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and
durability (ACID) enabling you to maintain data correctness in your applications
more easily.

You can use [PartiQL - a SQL-compatible query language for Amazon DynamoDB](ql-reference.md), to
perform transactional operations or you can use DynamoDB’s classic CRUD APIs that
separates each operation into a distinct API call.

### PartiQL - A SQL-compatible query language

- `ExecuteTransaction` – A batch operation that allows
CRUD operations to multiple items both within and across tables with a
guaranteed all-or-nothing result.

### Classic APIs

- `TransactWriteItems` – A batch operation that allows
`Put`, `Update`, and `Delete`
operations to multiple items both within and across tables with a
guaranteed all-or-nothing result.

- `TransactGetItems` – A batch operation that allows
`Get` operations to retrieve multiple items from one or
more tables.
