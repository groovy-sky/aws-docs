# Routing strategies in DynamoDB

Perhaps the most complex piece of a global table deployment is managing request routing.
Requests must first go from an end user to a Region that’s chosen and routed in some manner.
The request encounters some stack of services in that Region, including a compute layer that
perhaps consists of a load balancer backed by an AWS Lambdafunction, container, or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) node, and possibly other services including another database. That compute layer
communicates with DynamoDB It should do that by using the local endpoint for that Region. The
data in the global table replicates to all other participating Regions, and each Region has a
similar stack of services around its DynamoDB table.

The global table provides each stack in the various Regions with a local copy of the
same data. You might consider designing for a single stack in a single Region and anticipate
making remote calls to a secondary Region’s DynamoDB endpoint if there’s an issue with the local
DynamoDB table. This is not best practice. If there’s an issue in one Region that’s caused by
DynamoDB (or, more likely, caused by something else in the stack or by another service that
depends on DynamoDB), it’s best to route the end user to another Region for processing and use
that other Region’s compute layer, which will talk to its local DynamoDB endpoint. This approach
routes around the problematic Region entirely. To ensure resiliency, you need replication
across multiple Regions: replication of the compute layer as well as the data layer.

There are numerous alternative techniques to route an end user request to a Region for processing. The
optimum choice depends on your write mode and your failover considerations. This section discusses four
options: client-driven, compute-layer, Route 53, and Global Accelerator.

## Client-driven request routing

With client-driven request routing, illustrated in the following diagram, the end user
client (an application, a web page with JavaScript, or another client) keeps track of the
valid application endpoints (for example, an Amazon API Gateway endpoint rather than a
literal DynamoDB endpoint) and uses its own embedded logic to choose the Region to communicate
with. It might choose based on random selection, lowest observed latencies, highest observed
bandwidth measurements, or locally performed health checks.

As an advantage, client-driven request routing can adapt to things such as real-world
public internet traffic conditions to switch Regions if it notices any degraded performance.
The client must be aware of all potential endpoints, but launching a new Regional endpoint
is not a frequent occurrence.

With _write to any Region_ mode, a client can
unilaterally select its preferred endpoint. If its access to one Region becomes impaired,
the client can route to another endpoint.

With the _write to one Region_ mode, the client will
need a mechanism to route its writes to the currently active region. This could be as basic
as empirically testing which region is presently accepting writes (noting any write
rejections and falling back to an alternate) or as complex as calling a global coordinator
to query for the current application state (perhaps built on the Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) (ARC) routing
control which provides a 5-region quorum-driven system to maintain global state for needs
such as this). The client can decide if reads can go to any Region for eventual consistency
or must be routed to the active region for strong consistency. For further information see
[How\
Route 53 works](../../../r53recovery/latest/dg/introduction-how-it-works.md).

With the _write to your Region_ mode, the client needs to determine the home region for the data set it’s
working against. For example, if the client corresponds to a user account and each user account is
homed to a Region, the client can request the appropriate endpoint from a global login system.

For example, a financial services company that helps users manage their business finances via the
web could use global tables with a _write to your Region_ mode.
Each user must login to a central service. That service returns credentials and the endpoint for the Region where those
credentials will work. The credentials are valid
for a short time. After that the webpage auto-negotiates a new login, which provides an opportunity to
potentially redirect the user’s activity to a new Region.

## Compute-layer request routing

With compute-layer request routing, illustrated in the following diagram, the code that
runs in the compute layer determines whether to process the request locally or pass it to a
copy of itself that’s running in another Region. When you use the _write to one Region_ mode, the compute layer might detect that it’s not the
active Region and allow local read operations while forwarding all write operations to
another Region. This compute layer code must be aware of data topology and routing rules,
and enforce them reliably, based on the latest settings that specify which Regions are
active for which data. The outer software stack within the Region doesn’t have to be aware
of how read and write requests are routed by the micro service. In a robust design, the
receiving Region validates whether it is the current primary for the write operation. If it
isn’t, it generates an error that indicates that the global state needs to be corrected. The
receiving Region might also buffer the write operation for a while if the primary Region is
in the process of changing. In all cases, the compute stack in a Region writes only to its
local DynamoDB endpoint, but the compute stacks might communicate with one another.

![Diagram of compute layer request routing.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/gt-compute-layer-routing2.png)

The Vanguard Group uses a system called Global Orchestration and Status Tool (GOaST) and
a library called Global Multi-Region library (GMRlib) for this routing process, as presented
at [re:Invent\
2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1882s&v=ilgpzlE7Hds). They use a follow-the-sun single primary model. GOaST maintains the global
state, similar to the ARC routing control discussed in the previous section. It uses a
global table to track which Region is the primary Region and when the next primary switch is
scheduled. All read and write operations go through GMRlib, which coordinates with GOaST.
GMRlib allows read operations to be performed locally, at low latency. For write operations,
GMRlib checks if the local Region is the current primary Region. If so, the write operation
completes directly. If not, GMRlib forwards the write task to the GMRlib in the primary
Region. That receiving library confirms that it also considers itself the primary Region and
raises an error if it isn’t, which indicates a propagation delay with the global state. This
approach provides a validation benefit by not writing directly to a remote DynamoDB
endpoint.

## Route 53 request routing

Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) is a Domain Name Service (DNS) technology. With Route 53, the client requests
its endpoint by looking up a well-known DNS domain name, and Route 53 returns the IP address
corresponding to the regional endpoint(s) it thinks most appropriate. This is illustrated in
the following diagram. Route 53 has a long list of routing policies it uses to determine the
appropriate Region. It also can do failover routing to route traffic away from Regions that
fail health checks.

![Diagram of compute layer request routing.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/gt-rt-53-anycast2_v2.png)

With _write to any Region_ mode,
or if combined with the compute-layer request routing on the backend, Route 53 can be given full access to
return the Region based on any complex internal rules such
as the Region in closest network proximity, or closest geographic proximity, or any other choice.

With _write to one Region_ mode, you can configure Route 53 to
return the currently active Region (using Route 53 ARC). If the client wants to connect to
a passive Region (for example, for read operations), it could look up a different DNS
name.

###### Note

Clients cache the IP addresses in the response from Route 53 for a time indicated by the time to
live (TTL) setting on the domain name. A longer TTL extends the recovery time
objective (RTO) for all clients to recognize the new endpoint. A value of 60 seconds
is typical for failover use. Not all software perfectly adheres to DNS TTL expiration,
and there might be multiple levels of DNS caching, such as at the operating system,
virtual machine, and application.

With _write to your Region_ mode, it’s best to avoid Route 53
unless you're also using compute-layer request routing.

## Global Accelerator request routing

With [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator),
illustrated in the following diagram, a client looks up the well-known domain name in Route 53.
However, instead of getting back an IP address that corresponds to a Regional endpoint, the
client receives an anycast static IP address which routes to the nearest AWS edge
location. Starting from that edge location, all traffic gets routed on the private AWS
network and to some endpoint (such as a load balancer or API Gateway) in a Region chosen by
routing rules that are maintained within Global Accelerator. Compared with routing based on Route 53 rules,
Global Accelerator request routing has lower latencies because it reduces the amount of traffic on the
public internet. In addition, because Global Accelerator doesn’t depend on DNS TTL expiration to change
routing rules, it can adjust routing more quickly.

![Diagram of how client writing with Global Accelerator can work.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/gt-routing-gax-excerpt2_v2.png)

With _write to any Region_ mode, or if combined with the
compute-layer request routing on the back- end, Global Accelerator works seamlessly. The client
connects to the nearest edge location and need not be concerned with which Region
receives the request.

With _write to one Region_ Global Accelerator routing rules must send
requests to the currently active Region. You can use health checks that artificially
report a failure on any Region that’s not considered by your global system to be the
active Region. As with DNS, it’s possible to use an alternative DNS domain name for
routing read requests if the requests can be from any Region.

With _write to your Region_ mode, it’s best to avoid Global Accelerator
unless you're also using compute-layer request routing.
