# QueryFilter (legacy)

###### Note

We recommend that you use the new expression parameters instead of these legacy parameters whenever possible.
For more information, see [Using expressions in DynamoDB](expressions.md).
For specific information on the new parameter replacing this one,
[use FilterExpression instead.](#FilterExpression.instead).

In a `Query` operation, the legacy conditional parameter `QueryFilter` is a
condition that evaluates the query results after the items are read and returns only
the desired values.

This parameter does not support attributes of type List or Map.

###### Note

A `QueryFilter` is applied after the items have already
been read; the process of filtering does not consume any additional read
capacity units.

If you provide more than one condition in the `QueryFilter`
map, then by default all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other words,
the conditions are combined using the `AND` operator. (You can use the
[ConditionalOperator (legacy)](legacyconditionalparameters-conditionaloperator.md) parameter to OR the conditions instead.
If you do this, then at least one of the conditions must evaluate to true, rather
than all of them.)

Note that `QueryFilter` does not allow key attributes. You
cannot define a filter condition on a partition key or a sort key.

Each `QueryFilter` element consists of an attribute name to
compare, along with the following:

- `AttributeValueList` \- One or more values to evaluate
against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on
the operator specified in `ComparisonOperator`.

For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based
on UTF-8 binary encoding. For example, `a` is greater than
`A`, and `a` is greater than
`B`.

For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned
when it compares binary values.

For information on specifying data types in JSON, see [DynamoDB low-level API](programming-lowlevelapi.md).

- `ComparisonOperator` \- A comparator for evaluating attributes. For
example: equals, greater than, and less than.

The following comparison operators are available:

`EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS |
                              NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN`

## Use _FilterExpression_ instead – Example

Suppose you wanted to query the _Music_ table and apply a
condition to the matching items. You could use a
`Query` request with a `QueryFilter` parameter, as in this
AWS CLI example:

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb query \
    --table-name Music \
    --key-conditions '{
        "Artist": {
            "ComparisonOperator": "EQ",
            "AttributeValueList": [ {"S": "No One You Know"} ]
        }
    }' \
    --query-filter '{
        "Price": {
            "ComparisonOperator": "GT",
            "AttributeValueList": [ {"N": "1.00"} ]
        }
    }'

```

You can use a `FilterExpression` instead:

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb query \
    --table-name Music \
    --key-condition-expression 'Artist = :a' \
    --filter-expression 'Price > :p' \
    --expression-attribute-values '{
        ":p": {"N":"1.00"},
        ":a": {"S":"No One You Know"}
    }'

```
