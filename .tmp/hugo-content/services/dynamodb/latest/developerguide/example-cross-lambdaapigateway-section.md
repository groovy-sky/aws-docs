# Use API Gateway to invoke a Lambda function

The following code examples show how to create an AWS Lambda function invoked by Amazon API Gateway.

Java

**SDK for Java 2.x**

Shows how to create an AWS Lambda function by using the Lambda Java runtime API.
This example invokes different AWS services to perform a specific use case. This example demonstrates how to
create a Lambda function invoked by Amazon API Gateway that scans an Amazon DynamoDB table for work anniversaries
and uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send a text message to your employees that congratulates
them at their one year anniversary date.

For complete source code and instructions on how to set up and run, see the full example on
[GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javav2/usecases/creating_lambda_apigateway).

###### Services used in this example

- API Gateway

- DynamoDB

- Lambda

- Amazon SNS

JavaScript

**SDK for JavaScript (v3)**

Shows how to create an AWS Lambda function by using the Lambda JavaScript runtime API.
This example invokes different AWS services to perform a specific use case. This example demonstrates how to
create a Lambda function invoked by Amazon API Gateway that scans an Amazon DynamoDB table for work anniversaries
and uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send a text message to your employees that congratulates
them at their one year anniversary date.

For complete source code and instructions on how to set up and run, see the full example on
[GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/lambda-api-gateway).

This example is also available in the
[AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 developer guide](../../../../reference/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/api-gateway-invoking-lambda-example.md).

###### Services used in this example

- API Gateway

- DynamoDB

- Lambda

- Amazon SNS

Python

**SDK for Python (Boto3)**

This example shows how to create and use an Amazon API Gateway REST API that targets an
AWS Lambda function. The Lambda handler demonstrates how to route based on HTTP
methods; how to get data from the query string, header, and body; and how to
return a JSON response.

- Deploy a Lambda function.

- Create an API Gateway REST API.

- Create a REST resource that targets the Lambda function.

- Grant permission to let API Gateway invoke the Lambda function.

- Use the Requests package to send requests to the REST API.

- Clean up all resources created during the demo.
