# Remove a resource-based policy from a DynamoDB table

You can delete a resource-based policy from an existing table by using the DynamoDB console,
[DeleteResourcePolicy](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-deleteresourcepolicy.md) API, the AWS CLI, AWS SDK, or an CloudFormation template.

The following example uses the `delete-resource-policy` AWS CLI command to
remove a resource-based policy from a table named
`MusicCollection`.

Remember to replace the `italicized` text with your resource-specific information.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb delete-resource-policy \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection
```

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

2. On the DynamoDB console dashboard, choose **Tables** and then select
    an existing table.

4. From the **Manage policy** dropdown, choose **Delete**
**policy**.

    type `confirm` to confirm the delete action.
