# Troubleshooting throttling in Amazon DynamoDB

DynamoDB implements throttling for two primary purposes: maintaining overall service
performance and cost control. Throttling either serves as an intentional safeguard that
prevents performance degradation when consumption rates exceed capacity or as a cost control
mechanism when you reach maximum throughput or service quota limits. When throttling occurs,
DynamoDB returns specific exceptions with detailed information about why the request was
throttled and which resource was impacted. Each reason for throttling corresponds to
specific CloudWatch metrics that provide additional insights into the frequency and patterns of
throttling events.

The following diagram illustrates the four primary scenarios where DynamoDB implements
protective throttling:

1. **Key range throughput exceeded (in both**
**modes)**:

Consumption directed at specific partitions exceeds the [internal partition-level throughput\
    limits](bp-partition-key-design.md).

2. **Provisioned throughput exceeded (in provisioned**
**mode)**:

Consumption exceeds the [provisioned\
    capacity units](provisioned-capacity-mode.md) (read or write) configured for a table or a global
    secondary index (GSI).

3. **Account-level service quotas exceeded (in on-demand**
**mode)**:

Consumption causes a table or GSI to exceed the [per-table account-level service quotas](servicequotas.md#default-limits-throughput) for read/write throughput in
    the current AWS Region. These quotas serve as backstop safeguards and can be
    increased.

4. **On-demand maximum throughput exceeded (in on-demand**
**mode)**:

Consumption exceeds the configured [maximum throughput\
    limits](on-demand-capacity-mode-max-throughput.md) set for a table or GSI. These are limits you configure
    specifically for cost control purposes.

This guide is organized to help you understand and work with throttling in DynamoDB. First,
we help you identify the specific type of throttling affecting your workload through a [diagnostic framework](throttling-diagnosing-workflow.md).

Then, the [resolution guide](troubleshooting-throttling-diagnostics.md)
section offers specific guidance for each throttling scenario, including CloudWatch metrics to
monitor for detection and analysis, and recommended steps for optimization. By following
this structured approach, you can better diagnose the root cause of throttling and implement
the appropriate solution to ensure your DynamoDB tables operate efficiently.

To get started, follow [Diagnosing throttling](throttling-diagnosing-workflow.md) to learn how to
identify which type of throttling is affecting your workload and implement the recommended
resolution strategy.
