# Amazon S3 import formats for DynamoDB

DynamoDB can import data in three formats: CSV, DynamoDB JSON, and Amazon Ion.

###### Topics

- [CSV](#S3DataImport.Requesting.Formats.CSV)

- [DynamoDB Json](#S3DataImport.Requesting.Formats.DDBJson)

- [Amazon Ion](#S3DataImport.Requesting.Formats.Ion)

## CSV

A file in CSV format consists of multiple items delimited by newlines. By default,
DynamoDB interprets the first line of an import file as the header and expects columns
to be delimited by commas. You can also define headers that will be applied, as long as
they match the number of columns in the file. If you define headers explicitly, the
first line of the file will be imported as values.

###### Note

When importing from CSV files, all columns other than the hash range and keys of your
base table and secondary indexes are imported as DynamoDB strings.

**Escaping double quotes**

Any double quotes characters that exist in the CSV file must be escaped.
If they are not escaped, such as in this following example, the import will fail:

```

id,value
"123",Women's Full "Length" Dress
```

This same import will succeed if the quotes are escaped with two sets of double quotes:

```

id,value
"""123""","Women's Full ""Length"" Dress"
```

Once the text has been properly escaped and imported, it will appear as it did in the original CSV file:

```

id,value
"123",Women's Full "Length" Dress
```

**Importing heterogeneous item types**

You can use a single CSV file to import different item types into one table. Define
a header row that includes all attributes across your item types, and leave columns
empty for attributes that don't apply to a given item. Empty columns are omitted from
the imported item rather than stored as empty strings.

```

PK,SK,EntityType,Name,Email,OrderDate,Amount,ProductName,Quantity
USER#1,PROFILE,User,Alice,alice@example.com,,,,
USER#1,ORDER#2024-01-15,Order,,,2024-01-15,99.99,,
USER#1,ORDER#2024-02-10,Order,,,2024-02-10,149.50,,
PRODUCT#101,METADATA,Product,,,,,Laptop,50
PRODUCT#102,METADATA,Product,,,,,Mouse,200
USER#2,PROFILE,User,Bob,bob@example.com,,,,
USER#2,ORDER#2024-01-20,Order,,,2024-01-20,75.00,,
PRODUCT#103,METADATA,Product,,,,,Keyboard,150
USER#3,PROFILE,User,Charlie,charlie@example.com,,,,
PRODUCT#104,METADATA,Product,,,,,Monitor,30
```

In this example, user profiles, orders, and products share the same table. Each
item type uses only the columns relevant to it.

## DynamoDB Json

A file in DynamoDB JSON format can consist of multiple Item objects. Each individual object
is in DynamoDB’s standard marshalled JSON format, and newlines are used as item delimiters. As an added
feature, exports from point in time are supported as an import source by default.

###### Note

New lines are used as item delimiters for a file in DynamoDB JSON format and
shouldn't be used within an item object.

```json

{"Item": {"Authors": {"SS": ["Author1", "Author2"]}, "Dimensions": {"S": "8.5 x 11.0 x 1.5"}, "ISBN": {"S": "333-3333333333"}, "Id": {"N": "103"}, "InPublication": {"BOOL": false}, "PageCount": {"N": "600"}, "Price": {"N": "2000"}, "ProductCategory": {"S": "Book"}, "Title": {"S": "Book 103 Title"}}}
{"Item": {"Authors": {"SS": ["Author1", "Author2"]}, "Dimensions": {"S": "8.5 x 11.0 x 1.5"}, "ISBN": {"S": "444-444444444"}, "Id": {"N": "104"}, "InPublication": {"BOOL": false}, "PageCount": {"N": "600"}, "Price": {"N": "2000"}, "ProductCategory": {"S": "Book"}, "Title": {"S": "Book 104 Title"}}}
{"Item": {"Authors": {"SS": ["Author1", "Author2"]}, "Dimensions": {"S": "8.5 x 11.0 x 1.5"}, "ISBN": {"S": "555-5555555555"}, "Id": {"N": "105"}, "InPublication": {"BOOL": false}, "PageCount": {"N": "600"}, "Price": {"N": "2000"}, "ProductCategory": {"S": "Book"}, "Title": {"S": "Book 105 Title"}}}
```

## Amazon Ion

[Amazon Ion](https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs) is a richly-typed,
self-describing, hierarchical data serialization format built to address
rapid development, decoupling, and efficiency challenges faced every day
while engineering large-scale, service-oriented architectures.

When you import data in Ion format, the Ion datatypes are mapped to
DynamoDB datatypes in the new DynamoDB table.

Items in an Ion file are delimited by newlines. Each line begins with an Ion version marker,
followed by an item in Ion format.

###### Note

In the following example, we've formatted items from an Ion-formatted file on multiple lines to improve readability.

```ion

$ion_1_0
[
  {
    Item:{
      Authors:$dynamodb_SS::["Author1","Author2"],
      Dimensions:"8.5 x 11.0 x 1.5",
      ISBN:"333-3333333333",
      Id:103.,
      InPublication:false,
      PageCount:6d2,
      Price:2d3,
      ProductCategory:"Book",
      Title:"Book 103 Title"
    }
  },
  {

      Price:2d3,
      ProductCategory:"Book",
      Title:"Book 105 Title"
    }
  }
]
```
