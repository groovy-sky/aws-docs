# Adjusting the mappers

When Hive launches a Hadoop job, the job is processed by one or more mapper tasks.
Assuming that your DynamoDB table has sufficient throughput capacity, you can modify
the number of mappers in the cluster, potentially improving performance.

###### Note

The number of mapper tasks used in a Hadoop job are influenced by
_input splits_, where Hadoop subdivides the data into
logical blocks. If Hadoop does not perform enough input splits, then your write
operations might not be able to consume all the write throughput available in
the DynamoDB table.

## Increasing the number of mappers

Each mapper in an Amazon EMR has a maximum read rate of 1 MiB per second. The
number of mappers in a cluster depends on the size of the nodes in your cluster.
(For information about node sizes and the number of mappers per node, see [Task\
Configuration](../../../emr/latest/releaseguide/emr-hadoop-task-config.md) in the _Amazon EMR Developer_
_Guide_.)

If your DynamoDB table has ample throughput capacity for reads, you can try
increasing the number of mappers by doing one of the following:

- Increase the size of the nodes in your cluster. For example, if your
cluster is using _m1.large_ nodes (three mappers per
node), you can try upgrading to _m1.xlarge_ nodes
(eight mappers per node).

- Increase the number of nodes in your cluster. For example, if you have
three-node cluster of _m1.xlarge_ nodes, you have a
total of 24 mappers available. If you were to double the size of the
cluster, with the same type of node, you would have 48 mappers.

You can use the AWS Management Console to manage the size or the number of nodes in your
cluster. (You might need to restart the cluster for these changes to take
effect.)

Another way to increase the number of mappers is to modify the
`mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum` Hadoop configuration
parameter. (This is a Hadoop parameter, not a Hive parameter. You cannot modify
it interactively from the command prompt.). If you increase the value of
`mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum`, you can increase the
number of mappers without increasing the size or number of nodes. However, it is
possible for the cluster nodes to run out of memory if you set the value too
high.

You set the value for `mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum` as a
bootstrap action when you first launch your Amazon EMR cluster. For more information,
see [(Optional) Create Bootstrap Actions to Install Additional Software](../../../elasticmapreduce/latest/managementguide/emr-plan-bootstrap.md)
in the _Amazon EMR Management Guide_.

## Decreasing the number of mappers

If you use the `SELECT` statement to select data from an external
Hive table that maps to DynamoDB, the Hadoop job can use as many tasks as
necessary, up to the maximum number of mappers in the cluster. In this scenario,
it is possible that a long-running Hive query can consume all of the provisioned
read capacity of the DynamoDB table, negatively impacting other users.

You can use the `dynamodb.max.map.tasks` parameter to set an upper
limit for map tasks:

```nohighlight

SET dynamodb.max.map.tasks=1
```

This value must be equal to or greater than 1. When Hive processes your query,
the resulting Hadoop job will use no more than
`dynamodb.max.map.tasks` when reading from the DynamoDB
table.
