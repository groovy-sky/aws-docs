# Cross-account access with resource-based policies in DynamoDB

Using a resource-based policy, you can provide cross-account access to resources available
in different AWS accounts. All cross-account access allowed by the resource-based policies
will be reported through IAM Access Analyzer external access findings if you have an analyzer in the
same AWS Region as the resource. IAM Access Analyzer runs policy checks to validate your policy
against IAM [policy\
grammar](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-grammar.md) and [best practices](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md).
These checks generate findings and provide actionable recommendations to help you author
policies that are functional and conform to security best practices. You can view the active
findings from IAM Access Analyzer in the **Permissions** tab of the
[DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

For information about validating policies by using IAM Access Analyzer, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy\
validation](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-policy-validation.md) in the _IAM User Guide_. To view a
list of the warnings, errors, and suggestions that are returned by IAM Access Analyzer, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy check\
reference](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-reference-policy-checks.md).

To grant [GetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-getitem.md) permission to a
user A in account A for accessing a table B in account B, perform the following steps:

1. Attach a resource-based policy to table B that grants permission to user A for
    performing the `GetItem` action.

2. Attach an identity-based policy to user A that grants it permission to perform the
    `GetItem` action on table B.

Using the **Preview external access** option available in [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb),
you can preview how your new policy affects public and cross-account access to your resource.
Before you save your policy, you can check whether it introduces new IAM Access Analyzer findings or
resolves existing findings. If you don’t see an active analyzer, choose **Go to Access**
**Analyzer** to [create an account analyzer](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-getting-started.md#access-analyzer-enabling) in IAM Access Analyzer. For more information, see [Preview\
access](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-analyzer-access-preview.md).

The table name parameter in the DynamoDB data plane and control plane APIs accept complete
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table to support cross-account operations. If you only
provide the table name parameter instead of a complete ARN, the API operation will be
performed on the table in the account to which the requestor belongs. For an example of a
policy that uses cross-account access, see [Resource-based policy for cross-account access](rbac-examples.md#rbac-examples-cross-account).

The resource owner’s account will be charged even when a principal from another account is
reading from or writing to the DynamoDB table in the owner’s account. If the table has
provisioned throughput, the sum of all the requests from the owner accounts and the requestors
in other accounts will determine if the request will be throttled (if autoscaling is disabled)
or scaled up/down if autoscaling is enabled.

The requests will be logged in the CloudTrail logs of both the owner and the requestor accounts
so that each of the two accounts can track which account accessed what data.

## Share access with cross-account AWS Lambda functions

**Lambda functions in account A**

1. Go to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)
    to create an IAM role that will be used as the
    [Lambda execution role](../../../lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.md) for your AWS Lambda function in account A. Add the managed
    IAM policy `AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole` which has the required DynamoDB
    Streams and Lambda invocation permissions. This policy also grants access to all potential
    DynamoDB Streams resources you may have access to in account A.

2. In the [Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda),
    create an AWS Lambda function to process records in a DynamoDB stream and during the setup for
    the execution role, choose the role you created in the previous step.

3. Provide the Lambda function execution role to the DynamoDB Streams' owner of
    account B to configure the resource-based policy for cross-account read access.

4. Finish setting up the Lambda function.

**DynamoDB Stream in Account B**

1. Get the cross-account Lambda execution role from account A that will invoke the Lambda function.

2. On the Amazon DynamoDB console in account B, choose the table for Lambda cross-account trigger. Under the
    **Exports and streams** tab, locate your DynamoDB stream ARN. Ensure that DynamoDB Stream status
    is On and note the full stream ARN as you will need it for the resource policy.

3. Under the **Permissions** tab, click the **create stream policy** button
    to start the visual policy editor. Click the **Add new statement** button or edit the policy if one
    already exists.

4. Create a policy that specifies the Lambda execution role in account A as the principal and grant the required
    DynamoDB Stream actions. Make sure to include the actions `dynamodb:DescribeStream`, `dynamodb:GetRecords`,
    `dynamodb:GetShardIterator`, and `dynamodb:ListShards`. For more information on example resource policies for
    DynamoDB Streams, see [DynamoDB resource-based policy examples](rbac-examples.md).

###### Note

The cross-account access of [control plane\
APIs](howitworks-api.md#HowItWorks.API.ControlPlane) has a lower transactions per second (TPS) limit of 500 requests.
