## `AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic`

This configuration type specifies settings that enforce membership requirements on
the resource group, rather than configuring the behavior of a specific resource type
for an AWS service. This configuration type is automatically added by those
service-linked groups that need it, such as the
`AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool` and
`AWS::EC2::HostManagment` types.

The following `Parameters` are valid for the
`AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic` service-linked group
`Type`.

- **`allowed-resource-types`**

This parameter specifies that the resource group can consist of resources
of only the specified type or types.

**Data type of values:** String

**Permitted values:**

- `AWS::EC2::Host` – A `Configuration`
with this parameter and value is required when the service
configuration also contains a `Configuration` of type
`AWS::EC2::HostManagement`. This ensures that the
`HostManagement` group can contain only Amazon EC2
dedicated hosts.

- `AWS::EC2::CapacityReservation` – A
`Configuration` with this parameter and value is
required when the service configuration also contains a
`Configuration` item of type
`AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool`. This ensures
that a `CapacityReservation` group can contain only Amazon EC2
capacity reservation capacity.

**Required:** Conditional, based on other
`Configuration` elements that are attached to the resource
group. See the previous entry for **Permitted**
**values**.

The following example restricts group members to only Amazon EC2 host
instances.

```

[
  {
    "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
    "Parameters": [
      {
        "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
        "Values": [
          "AWS::EC2::Host"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

- **`deletion-protection`**

This parameter specifies that the resource group can't be deleted unless
it contains no members. For more information, see [Delete a host resource group](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.md#host-resource-group-delete) in the
_License Manager User Guide_

**Data type of values:** Array of
string

**Permitted values:** The only permitted
value is `[ "UNLESS_EMPTY" ]` (the value must be upper
case).

**Required:** Conditional, based on other
`Configuration` elements that are attached to the resource
group. This parameter is required only when the resource group also has
another `Configuration` element with the `Type` of
`AWS::EC2::HostManagement`.

The following example enables delete protection for the group unless the
group has no members.

```

[
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "deletion-protection",
          "Values": [
            "UNLESS_EMPTY"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

## `AWS::AppRegistry::Application`

This `Configuration` type specifies that the resource group represents
an application created by AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry.

Resource groups of this type are fully managed by the AppRegistry service, and can't be
created, updated, or deleted by users other than by using the tools provided by
AppRegistry.

###### Note

Because resource groups of this type are automatically created and maintained
by AWS and not managed by the user, these resource groups do not count against
your quota limit for the [maximum number of\
resource groups that you can create in your AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/resource-groups/quotas).

For more information, see [Using AppRegistry](../../../servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.md) in the _Service Catalog User Guide_.

When AppRegistry creates a service-linked resource group of this type, it also
automatically creates a separate, additional [CloudFormation service-linked group](#about-slg-types-cloudformation) for
each AWS CloudFormation stack associated with the application.

AppRegistry automatically names the service-linked groups of this type that its creates
with the prefix `AWS_AppRegistry_Application-` followed by the name of
the application:
`AWS_AppRegistry_Application-MyAppName`

The following parameters are supported for the
`AWS::AppRegistry::Application` service-linked group type.

- **`Name`**

This parameter specifies the friendly name of the application that was
assigned by the user when it was created in AppRegistry.

**Data type of values:** String

**Permitted values:** any text string
permitted by the AppRegistry service for an application name.

**Required:** Yes

- **`Arn`**

This parameter specifies the [Amazon Resource Name\
(ARN)](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.md) path of the application assigned by AppRegistry.

**Data type of values:** String

**Permitted values:** a valid ARN.

**Required:** Yes

###### Note

To change any of these elements, you must modify the application using the
AppRegistry console or that service's AWS SDK and AWS CLI operations.

This application resource group automatically includes as group members the [resource groups created for the CloudFormation\
stacks](#about-slg-types-cloudformation) that are associated with the AppRegistry application. You can use the
[ListGroupResources](../../../../reference/arg/latest/apireference/api-listgroupresources.md) operation to see those child groups.

The following example shows what the configuration section of a
`AWS::AppRegistry::Application` service-linked group looks
like.

```json

[
  {
    "Type": "AWS::AppRegistry::Application",
    "Parameters": [
      {
        "Name": "Name",
        "Values": [
          "MyApplication"
        ]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Arn",
        "Values": [
          "arn:aws:servicecatalog:us-east-1:123456789012:/applications/<application-id>"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`

This `Configuration` type specifies that the group represents an
AWS CloudFormation stack and its members are the AWS resources created by that
stack.

Resource groups of this type are automatically created for you when you associate
a CloudFormation stack with the AppRegistry service. You can't create, update, or delete these
groups except by using the tools provided by AppRegistry.

AppRegistry automatically names the service-linked groups of this type that its creates
with the prefix `AWS_CloudFormation_Stack-` followed by the name of the
stack:
`AWS_CloudFormation_Stack-MyStackName`

###### Note

Because resource groups of this type are automatically created and maintained
by AWS and not managed by the user, these resource groups do not count against
your quota limit for the [maximum number of\
resource groups that you can create in your AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/resource-groups/quotas).

For more information, see [Using AppRegistry](../../../servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.md) in the _Service Catalog User Guide_.

AppRegistry automatically creates a service-linked resource group of this type for
every CloudFormation stack that you associate with the AppRegistry application. These resource
groups become child members of the parent [resource group for the AppRegistry\
application](#about-slg-types-appregistry).

The members of this CloudFormation resource group are the AWS resources created as part
of the stack.

The following parameters are supported for the
`AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` service-linked group type.

- **`Name`**

This parameter specifies the friendly name of the CloudFormation stack assigned by
the user when the stack was created.

**Data type of values:** String

**Permitted values:** any text string
permitted by the CloudFormation service for a stack name.

**Required:** Yes

- **`Arn`**

This parameter specifies the [Amazon Resource Name\
(ARN)](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.md) path of the CloudFormation stack attached to the application in
AppRegistry.

**Data type of values:** String

**Permitted values:** a valid ARN.

**Required:** Yes

###### Note

To change any of these elements, you must modify the application using the
AppRegistry console or equivalent AWS SDK and AWS CLI operations.

The following example shows what the configuration section of an
`AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` service-linked group looks like.

```json

[
  {
    "Type": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
    "Parameters": [
      {
        "Name": "Name",
        "Values": [
          "MyStack"
        ]
      },
      {
        "Name": "Arn",
        "Values": [
          "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/MyStack/<stack-id>"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## `AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool`

This `Configuration` type specifies that the resource group represents
a common pool of capacity provided by the group's members. The members of this
resource group are required to be Amazon EC2 capacity reservations. A resource group can
include both capacity reservations that you own in your account and capacity
reservations that are shared with you from other accounts by using AWS Resource Access Manager. This
lets you launch an Amazon EC2 instance using this resource group as the value for the
capacity reservation parameter. When you do this, the instance uses the available
reserved capacity in the group.

If the resource group has no available capacity, the
instance launches as a stand alone on-demand instance outside of the pool unless you configure the
resource group to use Amazon EC2 UltraServer Capacity Blocks. For more
information, see [Working\
with Capacity Reservation groups](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/create-cr-group.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

If you configure a service-linked resource group with a `Configuration`
item of this type, then you must also specify separate `Configuration`
items with the following values:

- An `AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic` type with one
parameter:

- The parameter `allowed-resource-types` and a single
value of `AWS::EC2::CapacityReservation`. This ensures
that only Amazon EC2 capacity reservations can be members of the resource
group.

- A `AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool` type with two parameters:

- `reservation-type`— Only required when you configure a Capacity Reservation Group
for Amazon EC2 UltraServer Capacity Blocks. The only allowed value in this field is `capacity-block`.

- `instance-type`— Only required when you configure a Capacity Reservation Group for Amazon EC2
UltraServer Capacity Blocks. The allowed values in this field are `trn2u.48xlarge` and `p6e-gb200.36xlarge`.

The following example shows the `Configuration` section of an On-Demand Capacity Reservation:

```json

{
  "Configuration": [
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool",
      "Parameters": []
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
          "Values": [
            "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservation"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The following example shows the `Configuration` section supporting Amazon EC2 UltraServer Capacity Blocks:

```json

{
  "Configuration": [
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "instance-type",
          "Values": [
            "trn2u.48xlarge"
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "reservation-type",
          "Values": [
            "capacity-block"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
          "Values": [
            "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservation"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

After adding `instance-type` and `reservation-type` to a
resource group configuration when you use Amazon EC2 UltraServer Capacity Blocks, the following behaviors apply to that resource group:

- You can add additional capacity reservations into this resource group configuration but additional
reservations must also have the `reservation-type` set to `capacity-block` and the
`instance-type` set to `trn2u.48xlarge` or `p6e-gb200.48xlarge`.

- Currently, the only allowable value for `reservation-type` is `capacity-block`, and the only allowable values
for `instance-type` are `trn2u.48xlarge` and `p6e-gb200.48xlarge`.

- You can't add Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML into a resource group that does not include the `reservation-type`
and `instance-type` configurations.

- Adding the `reservation-type`
and `capacity-block` configuration parameters does not change
the process of adding or removing group reservations.

- If you remove the capacity reservation from the group, or delete the group, the reservations inside the group
remain in use until the instances are terminated.

- Currently, resource groups with the `reservation-type`
and `instance-type` configuration parameters can't be updated after initial setup. To change or remove the
configuration, you must delete the group and then create a new group with new configurations.

- You can't launch an instance into an empty group or modify an instance to target an empty group.

## `AWS::EC2::HostManagement`

This identifier specifies settings for Amazon EC2 host management and AWS License Manager that
are enforced for the group's members. For more information, see [Host\
resource groups in AWS License Manager](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.md).

If you configure a service-linked resource group with a `Configuration`
item of this type, then you must also specify separate `Configuration`
items with the following values:

- An `AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic` type, with a parameter of
`allowed-resource-types` and a single value of
`AWS::EC2::Host`. This ensures that only Amazon EC2 dedicated
hosts can be members of the group.

- An `AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic` type, with a parameter of
`deletion-protection` and a single value of
`UNLESS_EMPTY`. This ensures that the group can't be deleted
unless the group is empty.

The following parameters are supported for the
`AWS::EC2::HostManagement` service-linked group type.

- **`auto-allocate-host`**

This parameter specifies whether instances are launched onto a specific
dedicated host, or onto any available host that has a matching
configuration. For more information, see [Understanding auto-placement and affinity](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/how-dedicated-hosts-work.md#dedicated-hosts-understanding) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**Data type of values:** Boolean

**Permitted values:** "true" or "false" (must
be lower case).

**Required:** No

```

          "Values": [
            "true"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",

            "AWS::EC2::Host"
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "deletion-protection",
          "Values": [
            "UNLESS_EMPTY"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

- **`auto-release-host`**

This parameter specifies whether a dedicated host in the group is
automatically released after its last running instance is terminated. For
more information, see [Releasing Dedicated Hosts](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/how-dedicated-hosts-work.md#dedicated-hosts-releasing) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**Data type of values:** Boolean

**Permitted values:** "true" or "false" (must
be lower case).

**Required:** No

```

[
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::HostManagement",

          "Name": "auto-release-host",
          "Values": [
            "false"
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "any-host-based-license-configuration",
          "Values": [
            "true"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
          "Values": [
            "AWS::EC2::Host"
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "deletion-protection",
          "Values": [
            "UNLESS_EMPTY"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

- **`allowed-host-families`**

This parameter specifies which instance type families can be used by
instances that are members of this group.

**Data type of values:** An array of String.

**Permitted values:** Each must be a valid
[Amazon EC2 instance type family identifier](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/instance-types.md#AvailableInstanceTypes), such
as `C4`, `M5`, `P3dn`, or
`R5d`.

**Required:** No

The following example configuration item specifies that launched instances
can be only members of the C5 or M5 instance type families.

```

[
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::HostManagement",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-host-families",
          "Values": [
            "c5",
            "m5"
          ]
        },

          "Values": [
            "true"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [

          "Values": [
            "UNLESS_EMPTY"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

- **`allowed-host-based-license-configurations`**

This parameter specifies the [Amazon Resource Name\
(ARN)](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.md) paths of one or more core/socket based license
configurations that you want applied to members of the group.

**Data type of values:** An array of ARNs.

**Permitted values:** Each must be a valid
[License Manager configuration ARN](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/about-service-linked-groups-xmllist-awslicensemanager.md#awslicensemanager-resources-for-iam-policies).

**Required:** Conditional. You must specify
either this parameter or `any-host-based-license-configuration`,
but not both. They are mutually exclusive.

The following example configuration item specifies that group members can
use the two specified License Manager configurations.

```json

[
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::HostManagement",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-host-based-license-configurations",
          "Values": [

          "Values": [
            "UNLESS_EMPTY"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

- **`any-host-based-license-configuration`**

This parameter specifies that you do not want to associate a specific
license configuration to your group. In this case, all core/socket based
license configurations are available to your members of your host resource
group. Use this setting if you have an unlimited number of licenses and want
to optimize for host utilization.

**Data type of values:** Boolean

**Permitted values:** "true" or "false" (must
be lower case).

**Required:** Conditional. You must specify
either this parameter or
`allowed-host-based-license-configurations`, but not both.
They are mutually exclusive.

The following example configuration item specifies that group members can
use any core/socket based license configuration.

```

[
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::HostManagement",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "any-host-based-license-configuration",
          "Values": [
            "true"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
          "Values": [
            "AWS::EC2::Host"
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "deletion-protection",
          "Values": [
            "UNLESS_EMPTY"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

The following example illustrates how to include all of the host management
settings together in a single configuration.

```json

## `AWS::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroup`

This identifier specifies settings for AWS Network Firewall rule groups that are enforced
for the group's members. Firewall administrators can specify the ARN of a resource
group of this type to automatically resolve the IP addresses of the group's members
for a firewall rule instead of having to list each address manually. For more
information, see [Using tag-based resource groups in\
AWS Network Firewall](../../../network-firewall/latest/developerguide/resource-groups.md).

You can create resource groups of this configuration type by using the Network Firewall
console or by running a AWS CLI command or AWS SDK operation.

Resource groups of this configuration type have the following restrictions:

- The group's members consist of only resources of types supported by
Network Firewall.

- The group must contain a tag-based query to manage the group's membership;
any resources of supported types with tags that match the query are
automatically members of the group.

- There are no `Parameters` supported for this configuration
type.

- To delete a resource group of this configuration type, it can't be
referenced by any Network Firewall rule group.

The following example illustrates the `Configuration` and
`ResourceQuery` sections for a group of this type.

```json

{
  "Configuration": [
    {
      "Type": "AWS::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroup",
      "Parameters": []
    }
  ],
  "ResourceQuery": {
    "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"environment\",\"Values\":[\"production\"]}]}",
    "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"
  }
}
```

The following example AWS CLI command creates a resource group with the previous
configuration and query.

```nohighlight

$ aws resource-groups create-group \
    --name test-group \
    --resource-query '{"Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0", "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\": [\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"], \"TagFilters\": [{\"Key\": \"environment\", \"Values\": [\"production\"]}]}"}' \
    --configuration '[{"Type": "AWS::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroup", "Parameters": []}]'
{
    "Group":{
        "GroupArn":"arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/test-group",
        "Name":"test-group",
        "OwnerId":"123456789012"
    },
    "Configuration": [
        {
            "Type": "AWS::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroup",
            "Parameters": []
        }
    ],
    "ResourceQuery": {
        "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"environment\",\"Values\":[\"production\"]}]}",
        "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"
    }
}
```
