###### Security enhancements

- Fixed critical issues in Babelfish due to incorrect handling of user input for some application features.
This is tracked in [https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish\_extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-m399-rrc8-j6fj](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-m399-rrc8-j6fj).

###### High priority stability enhancements

- Fixed error handling in sp\_prepare calls which can cause a server crash when a large number of parameters are sent by the application. Babelfish currently supports a maximum of 100 parameters for a procedure or function.

- Fixed error handling in SSL/TLS handshake for some client drivers.

- Fixed an issue where a login can access the database without creating DB user after the DROP/CREATE of login.

- Fixed an issue where a login isn't dropped if it is logged in on any session.

###### New features

- Support for data migration using the BCP client and the bcp utility now supports -E flag (for identity columns) and -b flag (for batching inserts).

- Support for cross-database stored procedure execution.

- Support for CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY (lateral join).

- Support for built-in functions SYSTEM\_USER, HOST\_NAME; the Hostname is visible in the sys.sysprocesses T-SQL view; the SID\_BINARY
function is supported but always returns NULL in Babelfish.

- Support for CAST function of numeric expressions to DATETIME.

- Support for @@LANGUAGE variable with constant value as 'us\_english’.

- Support for the old-style function calls with '::' preceding the function name.

- Support for the sp\_helpsrvrolemember stored procedure.

- Support for the msdb.dbo.fn\_syspolicy\_is\_automation\_enabled system
function.

- Support for more catalogs: assembly\_types, numbered\_procedures, triggers,
spatial\_index\_tessellations, plan\_guides, synonyms, events, trigger\_events,
fulltext\_indexes, dm\_hadr\_cluster, xml\_indexes, change\_tracking\_tables,
key\_constraints, database\_filestream\_options,
filetable\_system\_defined\_objects, hash\_indexes, filegroups, master\_files,
assembly\_modules, change\_tracking\_databases, database\_recovery\_status,
fulltext\_catalogs, fulltext\_stoplists, fulltext\_indexes,
fulltext\_index\_columns, fulltext\_languages, selective\_xml\_index\_paths,
spatial\_indexes, filetables, registered\_search\_property\_lists,
syspolicy\_configuration, syspolicy\_system\_health\_state.

- Support for new INFORMATION\_SCHEMA catalogs: COLUMN\_DOMAIN\_USAGE,
CONSTRAINT\_COLUMN\_USAGE, CHECK\_CONSTRAINTS, ROUTINES, VIEWS.

- Support for new PG-style query plan: escape hatch 'babelfish\_pgtsql.escape\_hatch\_showplan\_all'.

- when set to 'ignore', SET SHOWPLAN\_ALL and SET STATISTICS
PROFILE behaves as SET BABELFISH\_SHOWPLAN\_ALL and SET
BABELFISH\_STATISTICS PROFILE.

- when set to 'strict', SET SHOWPLAN\_ALL and SET
STATISTICS PROFILE are silently ignored.

- Support for executing stored procedures with the sp\_ prefix in the master database without using a three-part name.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

- Fixed an issue where a value of 1900-01-01 00:00:00 was stored when a NULL was inserted or updated into a datetime column. A NULL value is inserted now. Column values in tables created in a previous Babelfish release are not affected.

- TIME datatypes that return 7 digits in SQL Server now returns 7 digits in Babelfish as well, with the 7th digit always being zero. In addition, a rounding issue that sometimes affected the 6th digit has been resolved.

- Increased parameter lengths for @tsql and @params for sp\_describe\_first\_result\_set from nvarchar(384) to nvarchar(8000). This increases the number of columns the DMS Babelfish target endpoint can support from 25 to 1000.

- Improved performance for system stored procedures: sys.sp\_tablecollations\_100, sp\_columns\_managed, and sp\_describe\_undeclared\_parameters. This fix improves the performance of the DMS Babelfish
target endpoint, SQL Server Management Studio import and export wizard, and prevents timeouts.

- Fixed an issue with Bitwise NOT ~ operator and it returns the correct result with BIT data types now.

- Fixed an issue with BCP when it is used for tables that have triggers.

- Fixed an issue of backend failure in INSERT BULK when using Import-Export wizard.

- Fixed an issue where SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) returns an error while expanding "Triggers" for a table in the Object Explorer view.

- Fixed an issue where the name column in the sys.sysobjects view was using case sensitive collation.

- Fixed an issue to refer SQL objects inside a function and is resolved to the function's schema rather than the default schema of the user.

- Fixed an issue where a backend crash can occur when using the ISNULL function with CONVERT on computed columns.

- Fixed an issue with the DATEPART function when the date argument is a string literal.

- Fixed an issue where a role can be dropped even if it has members.

- Fixed an issue so that the db user can't add to a role or drop from a role.

- Fixed an issue to allow BCP to work correctly with collations other than English collations.

- Fixed an issue to make sp\_helpuser procedure show login name for dbo user.

- Fixed an issue to handle NULL and mix-cased inputs correctly for the functions SUSER\_SNAME and SUSER\_SID.

- Fixed an issue with Babelfish returning an invalid TDS protocol stream when there is a numeric overflow error.

- Fixed an issue where is\_fixed\_role column returns incorrect value in the sys.server\_principals view for the 'sysadmin' role.

- Fixed the transaction error handling in a batch if the string passed to execute contains a USE `dbname` and fails because the database `dbname` was not found.

- Fixed the issue with procedures created in master database context with prefix sp\_ that are not accessible from other database context.

- Fixed the failure to resolve object name inside a procedure when used with schema name.

- Fixed case-sensitivity issue with arguments to the functions USER\_ID and SUSER\_ID.

- Fixed an issue where triggers were allowed to be created on Babelfish temporary tables.

- Fixed several performance issues with Import-Export wizard.

- Support for multi-byte client encodings other than UTF-16 for VARCHAR(n).

- Fixed the system compatibility view sys.sysprocesses to show the correct value for hostname provided by the client connection.

- Fixed case sensitivity issue with Polish\_CI\_AS collation.

- Fixed the @@DBTS function so that value of @@DBTS correctly returns the current transaction id after each DML statement even when used within a transaction.

-
Improved performance for queries that refer to the functions SCOPE\_IDENTITY and @@IDENTITY.

- Support added for collations Japanese\_CS\_AS, Japanese\_CI\_AI and Japanese\_CI\_AS for fn\_helpcollations.

- @@SERVERNAME and SERVERPROPERTY('ServerName') now return the name of the
Babelfish instance as specified by the user when the instance is created.
This value is also returned by the newly supported properties
SERVERPROPERTY('MachineName') and SERVERPROPERTY('InstanceName').

- Function fn\_mapped\_system\_error\_list lists the PG error code mapped to
@@ERROR codes, as well as the corresponding error message text. This
function also exists in previous Babelfish releases but did not include mapping
details.

- Fixed DATEADD function to now support milliseconds(ms) time units.

- SET NO\_BROWSETABLE {ON\|OFF} is now subject to escape hatch escape\_hatch\_session\_settings, so no error is raised when set to ignored.

- SET PARSEONLY {ON\|OFF} is now supported. Previously this would raise an error unless escape hatch escape\_hatch\_session\_settings is set to ignored.

- The DATABASE\_DEFAULT AND CATALOG\_DEFAULT collation is now supported; this refers to the server/instance-level collation that was specified when the Babelfish
instance was created, as Babelfish doesn't currently support collations on database level.

- For the functions OBJECTPROPERTY and OBJECTPROPERTYEX, the following properties are
now supported: ExecIsAnsiNullsOn, ExecIsQuotedIdentOn, IsDefault,
IsDefaultCnst, IsDeterministic, IsIndexed, IsInlineFunction, IsMSShipped,
IsPrimaryKey, IsProcedure, IsRule, IsScalarFunction, IsSchemaBound, IsTable,
IsTableFunction, IsTrigger, IsUserTable, IsView, OwnerId,
TableFulltextPopulateStatus, TableHasVarDecimalStorageFormat.

- OBJECTPROPERTYEX function supports the BaseType property.

- INDEXPROPERTY function supports the following properties: IndexFillFactor,
IndexID, IsClustered, IsDisabled, IsHypothetical, IsPadIndex,
IsPageLockDisallowed, IsRowLockDisallowed, IsUnique.

#### Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL release 1.2.0, March 29, 2022

In addition to the new features and improvements in the following list, Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL 1.2.0 adds several features that currently have limited implementations. These
features are available for use but don't yet have complete parity with T-SQL syntax or Microsoft SQL Server.
For more information, see [Features\
with limited implementation](../aurorauserguide/babelfish-compatibility.md#babelfish-compatibility.tsql.limited-implementation).

- Casing (upper-case, lower-case) of column names as created with T-SQL is now retained. That
is, `SELECT * FROM table` returns the
column names using the same casing as used when the table was created at the TDS
endpoint.

- INSTEAD-OF triggers are now supported on tables (tables only, not views).

- Support for system-defined global variables @@DBTS, @@LOCK\_TIMEOUT, @@SERVICENAME.

- Support for syntax SET LOCK\_TIMEOUT.

- Support for datatypes TIMESTAMP and ROWVERSION.

- Support for built-in functions COLUMNS\_UPDATED, UPDATE, FULLTEXTSERVICEPROPERTY,
ISJSON, JSON\_QUERY, JSON\_VALUE, HAS\_DBACCESS, SUSER\_SID, SUSER\_SNAME, IS\_SRVROLEMEMBER.

- Full support for the CHECKSUM function. This function now
supports \* and multiple columns ( `CHECKSUM ( * | expression [ ,...n ] )`).

- Full support for the SCHEMA\_ID function. This function
can now be used without any arguments ( `SCHEMA_ID ( [ schema_name ] )`).

- Support for DROP IF EXISTS with SCHEMA,
DATABASE, and USER objects.

- Support for these additional values for CONNECTIONPROPERTY:
physical\_net\_transport and client\_net\_address.

- Support for the these SERVERPROPERTY values:
EditionID, EngineEdition, LicenseType, ProductVersion, ProductMajorVersion,
ProductMinorVersion, IsIntegratedSecurityOnly, IsLocalDB,
IsAdvancedAnalyticsInstalled, IsBigDataCluster, IsPolyBaseInstalled,
IsFullTextInstalled, and IsXTPSupported.

- Support for these catalogs:
sys.dm\_os\_host\_info, sys.dm\_exec\_sessions, sys.dm\_exec\_connections,
sys.endpoints, sys.table\_types, sys.database\_principals,
sys.sysprocesses, sys.sysconfigures, sys.syscurconfigs, and
sys.configurations.

- Support for these INFORMATION\_SCHEMA catalogs: TABLES,
COLUMNS, DOMAINS, and TABLE\_CONSTRAINTS.

- Support for these system stored procedures:
sp\_table\_privileges, sp\_column\_privileges, sp\_special\_columns,
sp\_fkeys, sp\_pkeys, sp\_stored\_procedures, xp\_qv,
sp\_describe\_undeclared\_parameters, and sp\_helpuser.

- Limited support for creating, altering, and
dropping database principals (USER objects). Limitations for
CREATE/ALTER/DROP syntax with USER objects are as follows:

- For CREATE USER, you can specify the
FOR/FROM LOGIN and DEFAULT\_SCHEMA options only.

- For ALTER USER, you can specify DEFAULT\_SCHEMA
option only.

- Limited support for the SET FMTONLY ON command. Setting this command ON suppresses the execution of SELECT statements only. It doesn't suppress the execution of other statements.

- Support for granting and revoking (GRANT/REVOKE) permisions for
database principals only (not database roles). Support
includes GRANT OPTION and REVOKE..CASCADE options for SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE, REFERENCES, EXECUTE, and ALL \[PRIVILEGES\].

- Support for WITH AUTHORIZATION on CREATE SCHEMA.

- Support for the following new escape hatches and escape hatch functionality:

- Restore all default settings for escape hatches for your
Babelfish DB instance by passing
`default` as the second argument to the `sp_babelfish_configure`
stored procedure.

- A new escape hatch, `escape_hatch_ignore_dup_key` (default=strict)
controls the IGNORE\_DUP\_KEY option in CREATE/ALTER TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements.
When IGNORE\_DUP\_KEY=ON, an error is raised unless escape\_hatch\_ignore\_dup\_key is set to `'ignore'`.

- Added support for the `ignore` option on the `escape_hatch_storage_options`
escape hatch. When set to `ignore`, Babelfish ignores
errors raised in the following cases:

- Ignores errors raised in the ON clause in a
CREATE DATABASE statement.

- Ignores errors raised by CREATE INDEX when used
with SORT\_IN\_TEMPDB, DROP\_EXISTING, or ONLINE options.

For details, see
[Managing Babelfish error handling](../aurorauserguide/babelfish-strict.md#babelfish-escape_hatches).

- The msdb system database is always present, and has dbid=4. For more information,
see [Babelfish architecture](../aurorauserguide/babelfish.md#babelfish-architecture).

- For a list of features supported in each Babelfish release, see
[Supported\
functionality in Babelfish by version](../aurorauserguide/babelfish-compatibility-supported-functionality-table.md).
