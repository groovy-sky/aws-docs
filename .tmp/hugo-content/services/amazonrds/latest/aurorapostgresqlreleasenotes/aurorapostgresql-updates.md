## PostgreSQL 18.1

The PostgreSQL community releases new Major versions of PostgreSQL annually. The Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment allows you to test beta, release candidate, and early production versions of Amazon Aurora releases. This allows customers to create DB Clusters on an early release of Aurora PostgreSQL 18 in the Preview environment and test its features.

The following limitations apply to Aurora PostgreSQL Clusters in the Preview environment:

1. All DB instances/clusters are deleted 60 days after you create them, along with any backups and snapshots.

2. You can't copy a snapshot of a DB instance from Preview to a production environment.

3. The following options are supported by the Preview.

1. You can create DB instances using r6g, r6i, r7g, r7i, r8g, x2g, t3 and t4g instance types only. For more information about RDS Aurora instance classes, see DB instance classes.

2. You can use both single-AZ and multi-AZ deployments.

3. You can use standard PostgreSQL dump and load functions to export databases from or import databases to the Database Preview Environment.

Some of the Features that are not supported for APG18.1 Preview:

01. Serverless v1/v2

02. Major Version Upgrades i.e. MVU

03. No new minors will be released in preview region i.e. APG17.1 will not be released in preview region

04. RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL Inbound replication

05. Amazon RDS Blue/Green deployment

06. Cross-Region snapshot copy

07. Global DB

08. Database Activity Streams (DAS), RDS Proxy and Data Migration Service (DMS)

09. Auto Scaling Read Replicas

11. RDS Export

12. Performance Insights

13. Custom Endpoints

14. Snapshot Copy

15. zero-ETL

16. Babelfish

17. PostGis Topology module is not supported because of a community regression: [https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/5983](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/5983)

or Zstandard (zstd) using `pg_basebackup`, online backups using `pg_backup_start()` and `pg_backup_stop()`,
and prefetching during WAL recovery. In addition, sequences can be specified as unlogged, but this has no performance improvements over normal sequences.

**filenode "base/16395/228486645" to relation OID`**.

- Fixed a bug that could cause a brief
period of unavailability when canceling a transaction.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 3.3.1

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Critical stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug that appears when the `NOT EXISTS` operator
    incorrectly returns TRUE, which can only happen when the following unusual
    set of circumstances occurs:

- A query is using the `NOT EXISTS` operator.

- The column or columns being evaluated against the outer
query in the `NOT EXISTS` subquery contain a NULL value.

- There isn't a another predicate in the subquery that removes the need
for the evaluation of the NULL values.

- The filter used in the subquery does not use an index seek for its execution.

- The operator isn't converted to a join by the query optimizer.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 3.3.0

###### New features

- Added support for the RDKit extension version 3.8.

The RDKit extension provides modeling functions for cheminformatics.
Cheminformatics is storing, indexing, searching, retrieving, and
applying information about chemical compounds. For example, with the
RDKit extension you can construct models of molecules, search for
molecular structures, and read or create molecules in various notations.
You can also perform research on data loaded from the [ChEMBL website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl) or a
SMILES file. The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES)
is a typographical notation for representing molecules and reactions.
For more information, see [The RDKit database\
cartridge](https://rdkit.org/docs/Cartridge.html) in the RDKit documentation.

- Added support for a minimum TLS version

Support for a minimum Transport Layer Security (TLS) version is back
ported from PostgreSQL 12. It allows the Aurora PostgreSQL server to
constrain the TLS protocols with which a client is allowed to connect
via two new PostgreSQL parameters. These parameters include [ssl\_min\_protocol\_version](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-connection.html) and [ssl\_max\_protocol\_version](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-connection.html). For example, to limit client
connections to the Aurora PostgreSQL server to at least TLS 1.2 protocol
version, set the `ssl_min_protocol_version` to
`TLSv1.2`.

- Added support for the `pglogical` extension version
2.2.2.

The `pglogical` extension is a logical streaming
replication system that provides additional features beyond what's
available in PostgreSQL native logical replication. Features include
conflict handling, row filtering, DDL/sequence replication and delayed
apply. You can use the `pglogical` extension to set up
replication between Aurora PostgreSQL clusters, between RDS for PostgreSQL and
Aurora PostgreSQL, and with PostgreSQL databases running outside of
RDS.

- Aurora dynamically resizes your cluster storage space. With dynamic
resizing, the storage space for your Aurora DB cluster automatically
decreases when you remove data from the DB cluster. For more
information, see [Storage scaling](../aurorauserguide/aurora-managing-performance.md#Aurora.Managing.Performance.StorageScaling) in the _Amazon Aurora User_
_Guide_.

###### Note

The dynamic resizing feature is being deployed in phases to the
AWS Regions where Aurora is available. Depending on the Region
where your cluster is, this feature might not be available yet. For
more information, see [the What's New announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-aurora-enables-dynamic-resizing-database-storage-space).

                                  EXTENSION` command with PostGIS when Database Activity Streams
is enabled.

- Fixed a bug where a `SELECT` query might incorrectly return
the error **`Attempting to read past EOF of relation rrrr.**
**blockno=bbb nblocks=nnn`**.

error handling in database storage growth.

- Fixed a bug in Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless where queries that executed on
previously idle connections got delayed until the scale operation
completed.

- Fixed a bug where an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster with Database Activity
Streams enabled might report the beginning of a potential loss window
for activity records, but does not report the restoration of
connectivity.

- Fixed a bug with the `aws_s3.table_import_from_s3` function
where a `COPY` from S3 failed with the error **`HTTP**
**error code: 248`**. For more information, see [aws\_s3.table\_import\_from\_s3](../aurorauserguide/user-postgresql-s3import.md#aws_s3.table_import_from_s3) in the _Amazon Aurora_

following a scale event.

- Fixed a bug where an Aurora serverless DB cluster can experience
prolonged or failed scale attempts.

- Fixed a bug that resulted in the message **`ERROR: could not**
**create file "base/xxxxxx/yyyyyyy" as a previous version still exists**
**on disk: Success. Please contact AWS customer support`**.
This can occur during object creation after PostgreSQL's 32-bit
object identifier has wrapped around.

- Fixed a bug where the write-ahead-log (WAL) segment files for
PostgreSQL logical replication were not deleted when changing the
`wal_level` value from `logical` to
`replica`.

- Fixed a bug in the `pg_hint_plan` extension where a
multi-statement query could lead to a crash when
`enable_hint_table` is enabled. This is tracked in the
PostgreSQL community as [https://github.com/ossc-db/pg\_hint\_plan/issues/25](https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_hint_plan/issues/25).

- Fixed a bug where JDBC clients might report the message
**`java.io.IOException: Unexpected packet type:**
**75`** following a scale event in an Aurora serverless DB
cluster.

- Fixed a bug in PostgreSQL logical replication that resulted in the
message **`ERROR: snapshot reference is not owned by resource**
**owner TopTransaction`**.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 3.1.3

###### New features

- Aurora PostgreSQL now supports the PostgreSQL [vacuum\_truncate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) storage parameter to manage vacuum
truncation for specific tables. Set this [storage parameter](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) to false for a table to prevent the
[VACUUM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) SQL command from truncating the table's
trailing empty pages.

###### Critical stability enhancements

- None

###### High priority stability enhancements

- Fixed a bug where reads from storage might stop responding due to
incorrect error handling.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

- None

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 3.1.2

This release contains a critical stability enhancement. Amazon highly
recommends updating your older Aurora PostgreSQL 11-compatible clusters to this
release.

###### Critical stability enhancements

- Fixed a bug in which a reader DB instance might temporarily use stale
data. This could lead to wrong results such as too few or too many rows.
This error is not persisted on storage, and will clear when the database
page containing the row has been evicted from cache. This can happen
when the primary DB instance enters a transaction snapshot overflow due
to having more than 64 subtransactions in a single transaction.
Applications susceptible to this bug include those that use SQL
savepoints or PostgreSQL exception handlers with more than 64
subtransactions in the top transaction.

###### High priority stability enhancements

- Fixed a bug that might cause a reader DB instance to crash causing
unavailability while attempting to the join the DB cluster. This can
happen in some cases when the primary DB instance has a transaction
snapshot overflow due to a high number of subtransactions. In this
situation the reader DB instance will be unable to join until the
snapshot overflow has cleared.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

- Fixed a bug that prevented Performance Insights from determining the
query ID of a running statement.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 3.1.1

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Critical stability enhancements

- Fixed a bug in which the DB instance might be briefly unavailable due
to the self-healing function of the underlying storage.

###### High priority stability enhancements

- Fixed a bug in which the database engine might crash causing
unavailability. This occurred while scanning an included, non-key column
of a B-Tree index. This only applies to PostgreSQL 11 "included column"
indexes.

- Fixed a bug that might cause the database engine to crash causing
unavailability. This occurred if a newly established database connection
encountered a resource exhaustion-related error during initialization
after successful authentication.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

- Provided a fix for the `pg_hint_plan` extension that could
lead the database engine to crash causing unavailability. The open
source issue can be tracked at [https://github.com/ossc-db/pg\_hint\_plan/pull/45](https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_hint_plan/pull/45).

- Fixed a bug where SQL of the form `ALTER FUNCTION ... OWNER TO
                                  ...` incorrectly reported `ERROR: improper qualified name
                                  (too many dotted names)`.

- Improved the performance of `GIN` index vacuum via
prefetching.

- Fixed a bug in open source PostgreSQL that could lead to a database
engine crash causing unavailability. This occurred during parallel
B-Tree index scans. This issue has been reported to the PostgreSQL
community.

- Improved the performance of in-memory B-Tree index scans.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 3.1.0

You can find the following new features and improvements in this engine
version.

###### New features

1. Support for exporting data to Amazon S3. For more information, see [Exporting data from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to Amazon S3](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-s3-export.md) in
    the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

2. Support for Amazon Aurora Machine Learning. For more information, see
    [Using\
    machine learning (ML) with Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-ml.md) in the
    _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

3. SQL processing enhancements include:

- Optimizations for `NOT IN` with the
`apg_enable_not_in_transform` parameter.

- Semi-join filter pushdown enhancements for hash joins with the
`apg_enable_semijoin_push_down` parameter.

- Optimizations for redundant inner join removal with the
`apg_enable_remove_redundant_inner_joins`
parameter.

- Improved ANSI compatibility options with the
`ansi_constraint_trigger_ordering`,
`ansi_force_foreign_key_checks` and
`ansi_qualified_update_set_target`
parameters.

For more information, see [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL parameters](../aurorauserguide/aurorapostgresql-reference-parametergroups.md) in the _Amazon Aurora_
_User Guide_.

4. New and updated PostgreSQL extensions include:

- The new `aws_ml` extension. For more information,
see [Using machine learning (ML) with Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-ml.md) in
the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- The new `aws_s3` extension. For more information,
see [Exporting data from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to\
Amazon S3](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-s3-export.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User_
_Guide_.

- Updates to the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension. For more
information, see [Managing query execution plans for Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/aurorapostgresql-optimize.md)
in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Critical stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug related to creating B-tree indexes on temporary tables
    that in rare cases might result in longer recovery time, and impact
    availability.

2. Fixed a bug related to replication when Aurora PostgreSQL is acting as a
    physical replica of an RDS for PostgreSQL instance. In rare cases, this bug
    causes a log write failure that might result in longer recovery time,
    and impact availability.

3. Fixed a bug related to handling of reads with high I/O latency that in
    rare cases might result in longer recovery time, and impact
    availability.

###### High priority stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug related to logical replication in which `wal`
    segments are not properly removed from storage. This can result in
    storage bloat. To monitor this, view the
    `TransactionLogDiskUsage` parameter.

2. Fixed multiple bugs, which cause Aurora to crash during prefetch
    operations on Btree indexes.

3. Fixed a bug in which an Aurora restart might time out when logical
    replication is used.

4. Enhanced the validation checks performed on data blocks in the buffer
    cache. This improves Aurora's detection of inconsistency.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

01. The query plan management extension `apg_plan_mgmt` has an
     improved algorithm for managing plan generation for highly partitioned
     tables.

02. Reduced startup time on instances with large caches via improvements
     in the buffer cache recovery algorithm.

03. Improved the performance of the read-node-apply process under high
     transaction rate workloads by using changes to PostgreSQL
     `LWLock` prioritization. These changes prevent starvation
     of the read-node-apply process while the PostgreSQL
     `ProcArray` is under heavy contention.

04. Improved handling of batch reads during vacuum, table scans, and index
     scans. This results in greater throughput and lower CPU
     consumption.

05. Fixed a bug in which a read node might crash during the replay of a
     PostgreSQL `SLRU`-truncate operation.

06. Fixed a bug where in rare cases, database writes might stall following
     an error returned by one of the six copies of an Aurora log record.

07. Fixed a bug related to logical replication where an individual
     transaction larger than 1 GB in size might result in an engine
     crash.

08. Fixed a memory leak on read nodes when cluster cache management is
     enabled.

09. Fixed a bug in which importing an RDS for PostgreSQL snapshot might stop
     responding if the source snapshot contains a large number of unlogged
     relations.

10. Fixed a bug in which the Aurora storage daemon might crash under heavy
     I/O load.

11. Fixed a bug related to `hot_standby_feedback` for read
     nodes in which the read node might report the wrong transaction id epoch
     to the write node. This can cause the write node to ignore the
     `hot_standby_feedback` and invalidate snapshots on the
     read node.

12. Fixed a bug in which storage errors that occur during `CREATE
                                    DATABASE` statements are not properly handled. The bug left
     the resulting database inaccessible. The correct behavior is to fail the
     database creation and return the appropriate error to the user.

13. Improved handling of PostgreSQL snapshot overflow when a read node
     attempts to connect to a write node. Prior to this change, if the write
     node was in a snapshot overflow state, the read node was unable to join.
     A message appeared in the PostgreSQL log file in the form `DEBUG:
                                    recovery snapshot waiting for non-overflowed snapshot or until
                                    oldest active xid on standby is at least
                                        xxxxxxx (now
                                        yyyyyyy)`. A snapshot overflow
     occurs when an individual transaction has created over 64
     subtransactions.

14. Fixed a bug related to common table expressions in which an error is
     incorrectly raised when a NOT IN class exists in a CTE. The error is
     `CTE with NOT IN fails with ERROR: could not find CTE
                                        CTE-Name`.

15. Fixed a bug related to an incorrect `last_error_timestamp`
     value in the `aurora_replica_status` table.

16. Fixed a bug to avoid populating shared buffers with blocks belonging
     to temporary objects. These blocks correctly reside in PostgreSQL
     backend local buffers.

17. Changed the following extensions:

- Updated `pg_hint_plan` to version 1.3.4.

- Added `plprofiler` version 4.1.

- Added `pgTAP` version 1.0.0.

### PostgreSQL 11.4, Aurora PostgreSQL 3.0 (Deprecated)

###### Note

The PostgreSQL engine version 11.4 with the Aurora PostgreSQL 3.0 is no longer
supported. To upgrade, see [Upgrading the PostgreSQL DB engine for Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-postgresql.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.ExtensionUpgrades) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

This release of Aurora PostgreSQL is compatible with PostgreSQL 11.4. For more
information about the improvements in PostgreSQL 11.4, see [PostgreSQL release\
11.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/release-11-4.html).

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Improvements

1. This release contains all fixes, features, and improvements present in
    [Aurora PostgreSQL 2.3.5](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.235).

2. Partitioning – Partitioning improvements include support for hash
    partitioning, enabling creation of a default partition, and dynamic row
    movement to another partition based on the key column update.

3. Performance – Performance improvements include parallelism while
    creating indexes, materialized views, hash joins, and sequential scans to
    make the operations perform better.

4. Stored procedures – SQL stored procedures now added support for
    embedded transactions.

5. Autovacuum improvements – To provide valuable logging, the
    parameter `rds.force_autovacuum_logging` is ON by default in
    conjunction with the `log_autovacuum_min_duration` parameter set
    to 10 seconds. To increase autovacuum effectiveness, the values for the
    `autovacuum_max_workers` and
    `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` parameters are computed based
    on host memory capacity to provide larger default values.

6. Improved transaction timeout – The parameter
    `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` is set to 24 hours. Any
    session that has been idle more than 24 hours is terminated.

7. The `tsearch2` module is no longer supported – If your
    application uses `tsearch2` functions, update it to use the
    equivalent functions provided by the core PostgreSQL engine. For more
    information about the tsearch2 module, see [PostgreSQL\
    tsearch2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/tsearch2.html).

8. The `chkpass` module is no longer supported – For more
    information about the chkpass module, see [PostgreSQL\

08. Fixed an S3 import bug that reported **`ERROR: HTTP 403.**
    **Permission denied`** when importing data from a file inside
     an S3 subfolder.

09. Improved performance of the asynchronous mode for database activity
     streams.

10. Fixed a bug in the `aws_s3` extension that could result in
     the error message **`S3 bucket names with a period (.) are not**
    **supported`**.

     fail.

12. Fixed a bug related to replication when Aurora PostgreSQL is acting as a
     physical replica of an RDS for PostgreSQL instance that uses GiST indexes. In
     rare cases, this bug caused a brief period of unavailability after
     promoting the Aurora DB cluster.

13. Fixed a bug in the `aws_s3` extension where an import may
     be blocked indefinitely if an exclusive lock was taken on the relation
     prior to beginning the operation.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 2.6.1

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Critical stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug that appears when the `NOT EXISTS` operator
    incorrectly returns TRUE, which can only happen when the following unusual
    set of circumstances occurs:

- A query is using the `NOT EXISTS` operator.

- The column or columns being evaluated against the outer
query in the `NOT EXISTS` subquery contain a NULL value.

- There isn't a another predicate in the subquery that removes the need
for the evaluation of the NULL values.

- The filter used in the subquery does not use an index seek for its execution.

- The operator isn't converted to a join by the query optimizer.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 2.6.0

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### New features

1. Added support for the RDKit extension version 3.8.

The RDKit extension provides modeling functions for cheminformatics.
    Cheminformatics is storing, indexing, searching, retrieving, and
    applying information about chemical compounds. For example, with the
    RDKit extension you can construct models of molecules, search for
    molecular structures, and read or create molecules in various notations.
    You can also perform research on data loaded from the [ChEMBL website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl) or a
    SMILES file. The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES)
    is a typographical notation for representing molecules and reactions.
    For more information, see [The RDKit database\
    cartridge](https://rdkit.org/docs/Cartridge.html) in the RDKit documentation.

2. Added support for the `pglogical` extension version
    2.2.2.

The `pglogical` extension is a logical streaming
    replication system that provides additional features beyond what's
    available in PostgreSQL native logical replication. Features include
    conflict handling, row filtering, DDL/sequence replication and delayed
    apply. You can use the `pglogical` extension to set up
    replication between Aurora PostgreSQL clusters, between RDS for PostgreSQL and
    Aurora PostgreSQL, and with PostgreSQL databases running outside of
    RDS.

3. Aurora dynamically resizes your cluster storage space. With dynamic
    resizing, the storage space for your Aurora DB cluster automatically
    decreases when you remove data from the DB cluster. For more
    information, see [Storage scaling](../aurorauserguide/aurora-managing-performance.md#Aurora.Managing.Performance.StorageScaling) in the _Amazon Aurora User_
_Guide_.

###### Note

The dynamic resizing feature is being deployed in phases to the
AWS Regions where Aurora is available. Depending on the Region
where your cluster is, this feature might not be available yet. For
more information, see [the What's New announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-aurora-enables-dynamic-resizing-database-storage-space).

    upgrading the database engine in a secondary AWS Region. For more
    information, see [Using Amazon Aurora global databases](../aurorauserguide/aurora-global-database.md) in the _Amazon Aurora_
_User Guide_.

3. Fixed a bug that in rare cases caused delays in upgrading a database
    to engine version 10.13.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

1. Fixed a bug where the Aurora replica crashed when workloads with heavy
    subtransactions are made on the writer instance.

2. Fixed a bug where the writer instance crashed due to a memory leak and
    the depletion of memory used to track active transactions.

3. Fixed a bug that lead to a crash due to improper initialization when
    there is no free memory available during PostgreSQL backend
    startup.

4. Fixed a bug where an Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless DB cluster might return
    the following error after a scaling event: **`ERROR: prepared**
**statement "S_6" already exists`**.

5. Fixed an out-of-memory problem when issuing the `CREATE
                                   EXTENSION` command with `PostGIS` when Database
    Activity Streams is enabled.

6. Fixed a bug where a `SELECT` query might incorrectly return
    the error **`Attempting to read past EOF of relation rrrr.**
**blockno=bbb nblocks=nnn`**.

7. Fixed a bug where the database might be unavailable briefly due to
    error handling in database storage growth.

8. Fixed a bug in Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless where queries that executed on
    previously idle connections got delayed until the scale operation
    completed.

9. Fixed a bug where an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster with Database Activity
    Streams enabled might report the beginning of a potential loss window
    for activity records, but does not report the restoration of
    connectivity.

- [Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.1](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.241)

- [Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.0](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.240)

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.4

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Critical stability updates

- None

###### High priority stability updates

1. Backported fixes for the following PostgreSQL community security
    issues:

- [CVE-2020-25694](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25694)

- [CVE-2020-25695](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25695)

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

- None

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.3

###### New features

1. Aurora PostgreSQL now supports the PostgreSQL [vacuum\_truncate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) storage parameter to manage vacuum
    truncation for specific tables. Set this [storage parameter](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) to false for a table to prevent the
    [VACUUM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) SQL command from truncating the table's
    trailing empty pages.

###### Critical stability updates

- None

###### High priority stability updates

1. Fixed a bug where reads from storage might stop responding due to
    incorrect error handling.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

- None

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.2

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Critical stability updates

1. Fixed a bug in which a reader DB instance might temporarily use stale
    data. This could lead to wrong results such as too few or too many rows.
    This error is not persisted on storage, and will clear when the database
    page containing the row has been evicted from cache. This can happen
    when the primary DB instance enters a transaction snapshot overflow due
    to having more than 64 subtransactions in a single transaction.
    Applications susceptible to this bug include those that use SQL
    savepoints or PostgreSQL exception handlers with more than 64
    subtransactions in the top transaction.

###### High priority stability updates

1. Fixed a bug that may cause a reader DB instance to crash causing
    unavailability while attempting to the join the DB cluster. This can
    happen in some cases when the primary DB instance has a transaction
    snapshot overflow due to a high number of subtransactions. In this
    situation the reader DB instance will be unable to join until the
    snapshot overflow has cleared.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

1. Fixed a bug that prevented Performance Insights from determining the
    query ID of a running statement.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.1

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Critical stability updates

1. Fixed a bug in which the DB instance might be briefly unavailable due
    to the self-healing function of the underlying storage.

###### High priority stability updates

1. Fixed a bug that might cause the database engine to crash causing
    unavailability. This occurred if a newly established database connection
    encountered a resource exhaustion-related error during initialization
    after successful authentication.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

1. Provided a fix for the `pg_hint_plan` extension that could
    lead the database engine to crash causing unavailability. The open
    source issue can be tracked at [https://github.com/ossc-db/pg\_hint\_plan/pull/45](https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_hint_plan/pull/45).

2. Fixed a bug where SQL of the form `ALTER FUNCTION ... OWNER TO
                                   ...` incorrectly reported `ERROR: improper qualified name
                                   (too many dotted names)`.

3. Improved the performance of `GIN` index vacuum via
    prefetching.

4. Fixed a bug in open source PostgreSQL that could lead to a database
    engine crash causing unavailability. This occurred during parallel
    B-Tree index scans. This issue has been reported to the PostgreSQL
    community.

5. Improved the performance of in-memory B-Tree index scans.

6. Additional general improvements to the stability and availability of
    Aurora PostgreSQL.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 2.4.0

You can find the following new features and improvements in this engine
version.

###### New features

1. Support for exporting data to Amazon S3. For more information, see [Exporting data from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to Amazon S3](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-s3-export.md) in
    the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

2. Support for Amazon Aurora Machine Learning. For more information, see
    [Using\
    machine learning (ML) with Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-ml.md) in the
    _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

3. SQL processing enhancements include:

- Optimizations for `NOT IN` with the
`apg_enable_not_in_transform` parameter.

- Semi-join filter pushdown enhancements for hash joins with the
`apg_enable_semijoin_push_down` parameter.

- Optimizations for redundant inner join removal with the
`apg_enable_remove_redundant_inner_joins`
parameter.

- Improved ANSI compatibility options with the
`ansi_constraint_trigger_ordering`,
`ansi_force_foreign_key_checks` and
`ansi_qualified_update_set_target`
parameters.

For more information, see [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL parameters](../aurorauserguide/aurorapostgresql-reference-parametergroups.md) in the _Amazon Aurora_
_User Guide_.

4. New and updated PostgreSQL extensions include:

- The new `aws_ml` extension. For more information,
see [Using machine learning (ML) with Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-ml.md) in
the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- The new `aws_s3` extension. For more information,
see [Exporting data from an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to\
Amazon S3](../aurorauserguide/postgresql-s3-export.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User_
_Guide_.

- Updates to the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension. For more
information, see [Managing query execution plans for Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/aurorapostgresql-optimize.md)
in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Critical stability updates

1. Fixed a bug related to creating B-tree indexes on temporary tables
    that in rare cases may result in longer recovery time, and impact
    availability.

2. Fixed a bug related to replication when Aurora PostgreSQL is acting as a
    physical replica of an RDS for PostgreSQL instance. In rare cases, this bug
    causes a log write failure that may result in longer recovery time, and
    impact availability.

3. Fixed a bug related to handling of reads with high I/O latency that in
    rare cases may result in longer recovery time, and impact
    availability.

###### High priority stability updates

1. Fixed a bug related to logical replication in which `wal`
    segments are not properly removed from storage. This can result in
    storage bloat. To monitor this, view the
    `TransactionLogDiskUsage` parameter.

2. Fixed multiple bugs, which cause Aurora to crash during prefetch
    operations on Btree indexes.

3. Fixed a bug in which an Aurora restart may timeout when logical
    replication is used.

4. Enhanced the validation checks performed on data blocks in the buffer
    cache. This improves Aurora's detection of inconsistency.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

01. The query plan management extension `apg_plan_mgmt` has an
     improved algorithm for managing plan generation for highly partitioned
     tables.

02. Reduced startup time on instances with large caches via improvements
     in the buffer cache recovery algorithm.

03. Improved the performance of the read-node-apply process under high
     transaction rate workloads by using changes to PostgreSQL
     `LWLock` prioritization. These changes prevent starvation
     of the read-node-apply process while the PostgreSQL
     `ProcArray` is under heavy contention.

04. Improved handling of batch reads during vacuum, table scans, and index
     scans. This results in greater throughput and lower CPU
     consumption.

05. Fixed a bug in which a read node may crash during the replay of a
     PostgreSQL `SLRU`-truncate operation.

06. Fixed a bug where in rare cases, database writes may stall following
     an error returned by one of the six copies of an Aurora log record.

07. Fixed a bug related to logical replication where an individual
     transaction larger than 1 GB in size may result in an engine
     crash.

08. Fixed a memory leak on read nodes when cluster cache management is
     enabled.

09. Fixed a bug in which importing an RDS for PostgreSQL snapshot might stop
     responding if the source snapshot contains a large number of unlogged
     relations.

10. Fixed a bug in which the Aurora storage daemon may crash under heavy
     I/O load.

11. Fixed a bug related to `hot_standby_feedback` for read
     nodes in which the read node may report the wrong transaction id epoch
     to the write node. This can cause the write node to ignore the
     `hot_standby_feedback` and invalidate snapshots on the
     read node.

12. Fixed a bug in which storage errors that occur during `CREATE
                                    DATABASE` statements are not properly handled. The bug left
     the resulting database inaccessible. The correct behavior is to fail the
     database creation and return the appropriate error to the user.

13. Improved handling of PostgreSQL snapshot overflow when a read node
     attempts to connect to a write node. Prior to this change, if the write
     node was in a snapshot overflow state, the read node was unable to join.
     A message appeared in the PostgreSQL log file in the form `DEBUG:
                                    recovery snapshot waiting for non-overflowed snapshot or until
                                    oldest active xid on standby is at least
                                        xxxxxxx (now
                                        yyyyyyy)`. A snapshot overflow
     occurs when an individual transaction has created over 64
     subtransactions.

14. Fixed a bug related to common table expressions in which an error is
     incorrectly raised when a NOT IN class exists in a CTE. The error is
     `CTE with NOT IN fails with ERROR: could not find CTE
                                        CTE-Name`.

15. Fixed a bug related to an incorrect `last_error_timestamp`
     value in the `aurora_replica_status` table.

16. Fixed a bug to avoid populating shared buffers with blocks belonging
     to temporary objects. These blocks correctly reside in PostgreSQL
     backend local buffers.

17. Improved the performance of vacuum cleanup on GIN indexes.

18. Fixed a bug where in rare cases Aurora may exhibit 100% CPU utilization
     while acting as a replica of an RDS for PostgreSQL instance even when the
     replication stream is idle.

19. Backported a change from PostgreSQL 11 which improves the cleanup of
     orphaned temporary tables. Without this change, it is possible that in
     rare cases orphaned temporary tables can lead to transaction ID
     wraparound. For more information, see this [PostgreSQL community commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/246a6c8f7b237cc1943efbbb8a7417da9288f5c4).

20. Fixed a bug where a Writer instance may accept replication
     registration requests from Reader instances while having an
     uninitialized startup process.

21. Changed the following extensions:

    repeatedly. For example, attempts to create 128 GiB shared buffers on a
    db.r5.large instance would fail. With this change, requests for total
    shared memory allocations larger than the instance memory allow setting
    the instance to incompatible parameters.

4. Added logic to clean up unnecessary `pg_wal` temporary
    files on a database startup.

5. Fixed a bug in Aurora PostgreSQL 9.6 that sometimes prevented read/write
    nodes from starting up when inbound replication is used.

5. Fixed a bug where a `SELECT` query might incorrectly return
    the error **`Attempting to read past EOF of relation rrrr.**
**blockno=bbb nblocks=nnn`**.

6. Fixed a bug where the database might be unavailable briefly due to
    error handling in database storage growth.

###### New features

1. Aurora PostgreSQL now supports the PostgreSQL [vacuum\_truncate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) storage parameter to manage vacuum
    truncation for specific tables. Set this [storage parameter](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) to false when creating or altering a
    table to prevent the [VACUUM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) SQL command from truncating the table's
    trailing empty pages.

###### Critical stability enhancements

- None

###### High priority stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug where reads from storage might stop responding due to
    incorrect error handling.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

- None

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 1.6.2

You can find the following improvements in this engine update.

###### Critical stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug in which a reader DB instance might temporarily use stale
    data. This could lead to wrong results such as too few or too many rows.
    This error is not persisted on storage, and will clear when the database
    page containing the row has been evicted from cache. This can happen
    when the primary DB instance enters a transaction snapshot overflow due
    to having more than 64 subtransactions in a single transaction.
    Applications susceptible to this bug include those that use SQL
    savepoints or PostgreSQL exception handlers with more than 64
    subtransactions in the top transaction.

###### High priority stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug that may cause a reader DB instance to crash causing
    unavailability while attempting to the join the DB cluster. This can
    happen in some cases when the primary DB instance has a transaction
    snapshot overflow due to a high number of subtransactions. In this
    situation the reader DB instance will be unable to join until the
    snapshot overflow has cleared.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

1. Fixed a bug that prevented Performance Insights from determining the
    query ID of a running statement.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 1.6.1

You can find the following improvements in this engine update.

###### Critical stability enhancements

1. None

###### High priority stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug that might cause the database engine to crash causing
    unavailability. This occurred if a newly established database connection
    encountered a resource exhaustion-related error during initialization
    after successful authentication.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

1. Provided general improvements to the stability and availability of
    Aurora PostgreSQL.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 1.6.0

You can find the following new features and improvements in this engine
version.

###### New features

1. Updates to the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension. For more
    information, see [Managing query execution plans for Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/aurorapostgresql-optimize.md) in the
    _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Critical stability enhancements

1. Fixed a bug related to creating B-tree indexes on temporary tables
    that in rare cases may result in longer recovery time, and impact
    availability.

2. Fixed a bug related to replication when Aurora PostgreSQL is acting as a
    physical replica of an RDS for PostgreSQL instance. In rare cases, this bug
    causes a log write failure that may result in longer recovery time, and
    impact availability.

3. Fixed a bug related to handling of reads with high I/O latency that in
    rare cases may result in longer recovery time, and impact
    availability.

###### High priority stability enhancements

1. Fixed multiple bugs, which cause Aurora to crash during prefetch
    operations on Btree indexes.

2. Enhanced the validation checks performed on data blocks in the buffer
    cache. This improves Aurora's detection of inconsistency.

###### Additional improvements and enhancements

01. The query plan management extension `apg_plan_mgmt` has an
     improved algorithm for managing plan generation for highly partitioned
     tables.

02. Reduced startup time on instances with large caches via improvements
     in the buffer cache recovery algorithm.

03. Improved the performance of the read-node-apply process under high
     transaction rate workloads by using changes to PostgreSQL
     `LWLock` prioritization. These changes prevent starvation
     of the read-node-apply process while the PostgreSQL
     `ProcArray` is under heavy contention.

04. Fixed a bug in which a read node may crash during the replay of a
     PostgreSQL `SLRU`-truncate operation.

05. Fixed a bug where in rare cases, database writes might stall following
     an error returned by one of the six copies of an Aurora log record.

06. Fixed a memory leak on read nodes when cluster cache management is
     enabled.

07. Fixed a bug in which importing an RDS for PostgreSQL snapshot might stop
     responding if the source snapshot contains a large number of unlogged
     relations.

08. Fixed a bug related to `hot_standby_feedback` for read
     nodes in which the read node may report the wrong transaction id epoch
     to the write node. This can cause the write node to ignore the
     `hot_standby_feedback` and invalidate snapshots on the
     read node.

09. Fixed a bug in which storage errors that occur during `CREATE
                                    DATABASE` statements are not properly handled. The bug left
     the resulting database inaccessible. The correct behavior is to fail the
     database creation and return the appropriate error to the user.

10. Improved handling of PostgreSQL snapshot overflow when a read node
     attempts to connect to a write node. Prior to this change, if the write
     node was in a snapshot overflow state, the read node was unable to join.
     A message appear in the PostgreSQL log file in the form `DEBUG:
                                    recovery snapshot waiting for non-overflowed snapshot or until
                                    oldest active xid on standby is at least
                                        xxxxxxx (now
                                        yyyyyyy)`. A snapshot overflow
     occurs when an individual transaction has created over 64
     subtransactions.

11. Fixed a bug related to common table expressions in which an error is
     incorrectly raised when a NOT IN class exists in a CTE. The error is
     `CTE with NOT IN fails with ERROR: could not find CTE
                                        CTE-Name`.

12. Fixed a bug related to an incorrect `last_error_timestamp`
     value in the `aurora_replica_status` table.

13. Fixed a bug to avoid populating shared buffers with blocks belonging
     to temporary objects. These blocks correctly reside in PostgreSQL
     backend local buffers.

14. Fixed a bug where in rare cases Aurora may exhibit 100% CPU
     utilization while acting as a replica of an RDS for PostgreSQL instance even
     when the replication stream is idle.

15. Backported a change from PostgreSQL 11 which improves the cleanup of
     orphaned temporary tables. Without this change, it is possible that in
     rare cases orphaned temporary tables can to lead to transaction ID
     wraparound. For more information, see this [PostgreSQL community commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/246a6c8f7b237cc1943efbbb8a7417da9288f5c4).

16. Fixed a bug where a Writer instance may accept replication
     registration requests from Reader instances while having an
     uninitialized startup process.

17. Changed the following extensions:

- Updated `pg_hint_plan` to version 1.2.5.

### PostgreSQL 9.6.12, Aurora PostgreSQL 1.5 (Deprecated)

     (GiST) index.

03. Fixed a bug in which visibility map pages may contain incorrect freeze
     bits following a failover to a read node.

04. Fixed a bug in which the error "relation `relation-name`
     does not exist" is incorrectly reported.

05. Optimized log traffic between the write node and read nodes during
     index maintenance.

06. Fixed a bug in which queries on read nodes may crash while performing
     a B-tree index scan.

07. The function `aurora_stat_memctx_usage` now reports the
     number of instances of a given context name.

08. Fixed a bug in which the function
     `aurora_stat_memctx_usage` reported incorrect
     results.

09. Fixed a bug in which the read node replay process may wait to stop
     conflicting queries beyond the configured
     `max_standby_streaming_delay`.

### PostgreSQL 9.6.11, Aurora PostgreSQL 1.4 (Deprecated)

###### Note

The PostgreSQL engine version 9.6.11 with the Aurora PostgreSQL 1.4 is no longer
supported. To upgrade, see [Upgrading the PostgreSQL DB engine for Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-postgresql.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.ExtensionUpgrades) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

This release of Aurora PostgreSQL is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.6.11. For more
information about the improvements in PostgreSQL 9.6.11, see [PostgreSQL release\

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### New features

1. Support is added for the `pg_similarity` extension version
    1.0.

2. Aurora PostgreSQL now supports the PostgreSQL [vacuum\_truncate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) storage parameter to manage vacuum truncation
    for specific tables. Set this [storage parameter](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html) to false when creating or altering a table to
    prevent the [VACUUM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) SQL command from truncating the table's trailing
    empty pages.

###### Improvements

1. This release contains all fixes, features, and improvements present in
    [PostgreSQL 9.6.9, Aurora PostgreSQL 1.3 (Deprecated)](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.13).

    reduce network utilization. This reduces the chance of read node
    unavailability due to network saturation.

3. Performance of subtransactions has improved under high concurrency
    workloads.

4. An update for the `pg_hint_plan` extension to version
    1.2.3.

5. Fixed an issue where on a busy system, a commit with millions of
    subtransactions (and sometimes with commit timestamps enabled) can cause
    Aurora to crash.

6. Fixed an issue where an `INSERT` statement with
    `VALUES` could fail with the message "Attempting to read past
    EOF of relation".

7. An upgrade of the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension to version 1.0.1.
    For details, see [Version 1.0.1 of the Aurora PostgreSQL apg\_plan\_mgmt extension](auroraqpm-updates.md#auroraqpm-version.101).

The `apg_plan_mgmt` extension is used with query plan
    management. For more about how to install, upgrade, and use the
    `apg_plan_mgmt` extension, see [Managing query execution plans for Aurora PostgreSQL](../aurorauserguide/aurorapostgresql-optimize.md) in the
    _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

2. Increased the supported size of IAM passwords to 8KB.

3. Improved consistency of performance under high throughput write
    workloads.

4. Fixed a bug which could cause a read replica to crash during a
    restart.

5. Fixed a bug which could cause an error running queries. The message
    reported was of the form "SQL ERROR: Attempting to read past EOF of
    relation".

6. Fixed a bug which could cause an increase in memory usage after a
    restart.

    PostgreSQL to fail.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 1.3.0

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### Improvements

01. This release contains all fixes, features, and improvements present in
     [PostgreSQL 9.6.8, Aurora PostgreSQL 1.2 (Deprecated)](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.12).

02. Updated the `GDAL` library, which is used by the
     `PostGIS` extension.

03. Updated the following PostgreSQL extensions:

- `ip4r` updated to version 2.1.1.

- `pgaudit` updated to version 1.1.1.

- `pg_repack` updated to version 1.4.3.

- `plv8` updated to version 2.1.2.

04. Fixed an issue in the monitoring system that could incorrectly cause a
     failover when local disk usage is high.

05. Fixed a bug in which Aurora PostgreSQL can repeatedly crash,
     reporting:

    `PANIC: new_record_total_len (8201) must be less than BLCKSZ
                                    (8192), rmid (6), info (32)`

06. Fixed a bug in which an Aurora PostgreSQL read node might be unable to
     rejoin a cluster due to recovery of a large buffer cache. This issue is
     unlikely to occur on instances other than **r4.16xlarge.**

07. Fixed a bug in which inserting into an empty GIN index leaf page
     imported from pre-9.4 engine versions can cause the Aurora storage
     volume to become unavailable.

08. Fixed a bug in which, in rare circumstances, a crash during
     transaction commit could result in the loss of `CommitTs`
     data for the committing transaction. The actual durability of the
     transaction was not impacted by this bug.

09. Fixed a bug in the `PostGIS` extension in which
     `PostGIS` can crash in the function
     `gserialized_gist_picksplit_2d()`.

10. Improved the stability of read-only nodes during heavy write traffic
     on instances smaller than **r4.8xl**. This
     specifically addresses a situation where the network bandwidth between
     the writer and the reader is constrained.

11. Fixed a bug in which an Aurora PostgreSQL instance acting as a replication
     target of an RDS for PostgreSQL instance crashed with the following
     error:

    `FATAL: could not open file "base/16411/680897_vm": No such file
                                    or directory" during "xlog redo at 782/3122D540 for
                                    Storage/TRUNCATE"`

12. Fixed a memory leak on read-only nodes in which the heap size for the
     "aurora wal replay process" will continue to grow. This is observable
     via Enhanced Monitoring.

13. Fixed a bug in which Aurora PostgreSQL can fail to start, with the
     following message reported in the PostgreSQL log:

    `FATAL: Storage initialization failed`.

14. Fixed a performance limitation on heavy write workloads that caused
     waits on the `LWLock:buffer_content` and
     `IO:ControlFileSyncUpdate` events.

15. Fixed a bug in which read nodes could crash following a specific type
     of free space change from the write node.

5. Fixed a bug which could cause an error running queries. The message
    reported was of the form "SQL ERROR: Attempting to read past EOF of
    relation".

6. Fixed a bug which could cause an increase in memory usage after a
    restart.

7. Fixed a bug which could cause a transaction with a large number of
    subtransactions to fail.

8. Merged a patch from community PostgreSQL which addresses potential
    failures when using GIN indexes. For more information, see [https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=f9e66f2fbbb49a493045c8d8086a9b15d95b8f18](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb).

9. Fixed a bug which could cause a snapshot import from RDS for
    PostgreSQL to fail.

#### Aurora PostgreSQL 1.2.0

You can find the following improvements in this release.

###### New features

1. Introduced the `aurora_stat_memctx_usage()` function. This
    function reports internal memory context usage for each PostgreSQL
    backend. You can use this function to help determine why certain
    backends are consuming large amounts of memory.

###### Improvements

01. This release contains all fixes, features, and improvements present in
     [PostgreSQL 9.6.6 Aurora PostgreSQL 1.1 (Deprecated)](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.11).

02. Updates the following PostgreSQL extensions:

- `pg_hint_plan` updated to version 1.2.2

- `plv8` updated to version 2.1.0

03. Improves efficiency of traffic between writer and reader nodes.

04. Improves connection establishment performance.

05. Improve the diagnostic data provided in the PostgreSQL error log when
     an out-of-memory error is encountered.

06. Multiple fixes to improve the reliability and performance of snapshot
     import from Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition.

07. Multiple fixes to improve the reliability and performance of
     Aurora PostgreSQL read nodes.

08. Fixes a bug in which an otherwise idle instance can generate
     unnecessary read traffic on an Aurora storage volume.

09. Fixes a bug in which duplicate sequence values can be encountered
     during insert. The problem only occurs when migrating a snapshot from
     RDS for PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL. The fix prevents the problem from
     being introduced when performing the migration. Instances migrated
     before this release can still encounter duplicate key errors.

10. Fixes a bug in which an RDS for PostgreSQL instance migrated to
     Aurora PostgreSQL using replication can run out of memory doing
     insert/update of GIST indexes, or cause other issues with GIST
     indexes.

11. Fixes a bug in which vacuum can fail to update the corresponding
     `pg_database.datfrozenxid` value for a database.

12. Fixes a bug in which a crash while creating a new MultiXact (contended
     row level lock) can cause Aurora PostgreSQL to stop responding indefinitely
     on the first access to the same relation after the engine
     restarts.

13. Fixes a bug in which a PostgreSQL backend can't be terminated or
     canceled while invoking an `fdw` call.

14. Fixes a bug in which one vCPU is fully utilized at all times by the
     Aurora storage daemon. This issue is especially noticeable on smaller
     instance classes, such as r4.large, where it can lead to 25–50
     percent CPU usage when idle.

15. Fixes a bug in which an Aurora PostgreSQL writer node can fail over
     spuriously.

16. Fixes a bug in which, in a rare scenario, an Aurora PostgreSQL read node
     can report:

    "FATAL: lock buffer\_io is not held"

17. Fixes a bug in which stale relcache entries can halt vacuuming of
     relations and push the system close to transaction ID wraparound. The
     fix is a port of a PostgreSQL community patch scheduled to be released
     in a future minor version.

18. Fixes a bug in which a failure while extending a relation can cause
     Aurora to crash while scanning the partially extended relation.
