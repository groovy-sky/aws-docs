# Importing data into an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance

You can use several different techniques to import data into an RDS for MySQL DB instance.
The best approach depends on a number of factors:

- Source of the data

- Amount of data

- One-time import or ongoing

- Amount of downtime

If you are also migrating an application with the data, the amount of downtime is
important to consider.

The following table lists techniques to importing data into an RDS for MySQL DB
instance:

SourceAmount of dataOne time or ongoingApplication downtimeTechniqueMore information

Existing MySQL database on premises or on Amazon EC2

Any

One time

Some

Create a backup of your on-premises database, store it on Amazon S3, and
then restore the backup file to a new Amazon RDS DB instance running
MySQL.

Existing MySQL database on premises or on Amazon EC2

Any

Ongoing

Minimal

Configure replication with an existing MySQL database as the
replication source.

Any existing database

Any

One time or ongoing

Minimal

Use AWS Database Migration Service to migrate the database with minimal downtime and, for
many database DB engines, continue ongoing replication.

MySQL-compatible database as a target for AWS DMS](../../../dms/latest/userguide/chap-target-mysql.md) in the
_AWS Database Migration Service User Guide_

Existing MySQL DB instance

Any

One time or ongoing

Minimal

Create a read replica for ongoing replication. Promote the read
replica for one-time creation of a new DB instance.

[Working with DB instance read replicas](user-readrepl.md)

Existing MySQL database

Small

One time

Some

Copy the data directly to your MySQL DB instance using a command-line
utility.

[Importing data from an external MySQL database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance](mysql-importing-data-external-database.md)

Data not stored in an existing database

Medium

One time

Some

Create flat files and import them using MySQL `LOAD DATA LOCAL
                            INFILE` statements.

###### Note

The `mysql` system database contains authentication and authorization
information required to log in to your DB instance and access your data. Dropping,
altering, renaming, or truncating tables, data, or other contents of the
`mysql` database in your DB instance can result in error and might render
the DB instance and your data inaccessible. If this occurs, you can restore the DB
instance from a snapshot using the AWS CLI [restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.md) command. You can
recover the DB instance using the AWS CLI [restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.md) command.
