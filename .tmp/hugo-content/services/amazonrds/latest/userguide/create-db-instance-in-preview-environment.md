Use the following procedure to create a DB instance in the preview
environment.

###### To create a DB instance in the Database Preview environment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Dashboard** from the navigation pane.

3. In the Dashboard page, locate the **Database Preview**
**Environment** section on the Dashboard page, as shown in the
    following image.

You can navigate directly to the [Database Preview environment](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/rds-preview/home?region=us-east-2). Before you can proceed, you must
    acknowledge and accept the limitations.

4. To create the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance, follow the same process as that
    for creating any Amazon RDS DB instance. For more information, see the [Console](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.CON) procedure in [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating).

To create an instance in the Database Preview Environment using the RDS API or the
AWS CLI, use the following endpoint.
