# Amazon CloudWatch dimensions for Amazon RDS

You can filter Amazon RDS metrics
data by using any dimension in the following table.

Dimension  Filters the requested data for . . . `DBInstanceIdentifier`

A specific DB instance.

`DatabaseClass`

All instances in a database class. For example, you can aggregate metrics for all instances
that belong to the database class `db.r5.large`.

`EngineName`

The identified engine name only. For example, you can aggregate metrics for all instances that have the engine name
`postgres`.

`SourceRegion`

The specified Region only. For example, you can aggregate metrics for all DB instances in
the `us-east-1` Region.

`DbInstanceIdentifier, VolumeName`

The metrics per-volume for a single instance.

RDS captures metrics for multiple storage volumes.

###### Note

If you are using additional storage volumes, you can see aggregate storage metrics under
the `DBInstanceIdentifier` dimension. To see per-volume storage metrics, use the
`DbInstanceIdentifier, VolumeName` dimensions.
