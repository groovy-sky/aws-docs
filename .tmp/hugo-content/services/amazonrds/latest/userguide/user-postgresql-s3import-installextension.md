# Installing the aws\_s3 extension

Before you can use Amazon S3 with your
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance, you need to install the
`aws_s3` extension. This extension provides functions for importing data from an Amazon S3. It also provides
functions for exporting data from an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance
to an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see
[Exporting data from an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance to Amazon S3](postgresql-s3-export.md).

The `aws_s3` extension depends on some of the helper functions in the
`aws_commons` extension, which is installed automatically when needed.

###### To install the `aws_s3` extension

1. Use psql (or pgAdmin) to connect to the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance
    as a user that has `rds_superuser` privileges. If you kept the default name during the setup
    process, you connect as `postgres`.

```nohighlight

psql --host=111122223333.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password
```

2. To install the extension, run the following command.

```nohighlight

postgres=> CREATE EXTENSION aws_s3 CASCADE;
NOTICE: installing required extension "aws_commons"
CREATE EXTENSION
```

3. To verify that the extension is installed, you can use the psql `\dx` metacommand.

```nohighlight

postgres=> \dx

    plpgsql     | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language

```

The functions for importing data from Amazon S3 and exporting data to Amazon S3 are now available to use.
