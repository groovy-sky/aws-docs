# Listing files on the RDS DB instance

To list the files available on the DB instance, use both a stored procedure and a function. First, run the following stored
procedure to gather file details from the files in `D:\S3\`.

```SQL

exec msdb.dbo.rds_gather_file_details;
```

The stored procedure returns the ID of the task. Like other tasks, this stored procedure runs asynchronously. As soon as the
status of the task is `SUCCESS`, you can use the task ID in the `rds_fn_list_file_details` function to
list the existing files and directories in D:\\S3\\, as shown following.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_list_file_details(TASK_ID);
```

The `rds_fn_list_file_details` function returns a table with the following columns.

Output parameterDescription`filepath`Absolute path of the file (for example, `D:\S3\mydata.csv`)`size_in_bytes`File size (in bytes)`last_modified_utc`Last modification date and time in UTC format`is_directory`Option that indicates whether the item is a directory ( `true`/ `false`)
