# Using PostgreSQL extensions with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

You can extend the functionality of PostgreSQL by installing a variety of extensions and
modules. For example, to work with spatial data you can install and use the PostGIS extension.
For more information, see [Managing spatial data with the PostGIS extension](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-postgis.md). As another example, if you want
to improve data entry for very large tables, you can consider partitioning your data by using
the `pg_partman` extension. To learn more, see [Managing PostgreSQL partitions with the pg\_partman extension](postgresql-partitions.md).

###### Note

RDS for PostgreSQL supports Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL through the `pg_tle` extension, which you
can add to your DB instance. By using this extension, developers can create their own
PostgreSQL extensions in a safe environment that simplifies the setup and configuration
requirements. To learn about RDS for PostgreSQL versions supporting `pg_tle` extension
and for more information, see [Working with Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL](postgresql-trusted-language-extension.md).

In some cases, rather than installing an extension, you might add a specific module to the
list of `shared_preload_libraries` in your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance's custom DB
parameter group. Typically, the default DB cluster parameter group loads only the
`pg_stat_statements`, but several other modules are available to add to the list.
For example, you can add scheduling capability by adding the `pg_cron` module, as
detailed in [Scheduling maintenance with the PostgreSQL pg\_cron extension](postgresql-pg-cron.md). As another
example, you can log query execution plans by loading the `auto_explain` module. To
learn more, see [Logging execution plans of queries](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-postgresql-tune-query-performance) in the AWS knowledge center.

Depending on your version of RDS for PostgreSQL, installing an extension might require
`rds_superuser` permissions, as follows:

- For RDS for PostgreSQL versions 12 and earlier versions, installing extensions requires
`rds_superuser` privileges.

- For RDS for PostgreSQL version 13 and higher versions, users (roles) with create permissions
on a given database instance can install and use any _trusted_
_extensions_. For a list of trusted extensions, see [PostgreSQL trusted extensions](postgresql-concepts-general-featuresupport-extensions.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.Extensions.Trusted).

You can also specify precisely which extensions can be installed on your RDS for PostgreSQL DB
instance, by listing them in the `rds.allowed_extensions` parameter. For more
information, see [Restricting installation of PostgreSQL extensions](postgresql-concepts-general-featuresupport-extensions.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.Extensions.Restriction).

To learn more about the `rds_superuser` role, see [Understanding PostgreSQL roles and permissions](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-roles.md).
