# Monitoring the status of a file transfer task

To track the status of your S3 integration task, call the `rds_fn_task_status` function. It takes two parameters.
The first parameter should always be `NULL` because it doesn't apply to S3 integration. The second parameter accepts
a task ID.

To see a list of all tasks, set the first parameter to `NULL` and the second parameter to `0`, as shown
in the following example.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_task_status(NULL,0);
```

To get a specific task, set the first parameter to `NULL` and the second parameter to the task ID, as shown in the
following example.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM msdb.dbo.rds_fn_task_status(NULL,42);
```

The `rds_fn_task_status` function returns the following information.
