# Connecting to your MariaDB DB instance on Amazon RDS with SSL/TLS from the MySQL command-line client (encrypted)

The `mysql` client program parameters are slightly different if you are
using the MySQL 5.7 version, the MySQL 8.0 version, or the MariaDB version.

To find out which version you have, run the `mysql` command with the
`--version` option. In the following example, the output shows that the
client program is from MariaDB.

```bash

$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.5.15-MariaDB, for osx10.15 (x86_64) using readline 5.1
```

Most Linux distributions, such as Amazon Linux, CentOS, SUSE, and Debian have replaced
MySQL with MariaDB, and the `mysql` version in them is from MariaDB.

To connect to your DB instance using SSL/TLS, follow these steps:

###### To connect to a DB instance with SSL/TLS using the MySQL command-line client

1. Download a root certificate that works for all AWS Regions.

For information about downloading certificates, see [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance or cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md).

2. Use a MySQL command-line client to connect to a DB instance with SSL/TLS
    encryption. For the `-h` parameter, substitute the DNS name
    (endpoint) for your DB instance. For the `--ssl-ca` parameter,
    substitute the SSL/TLS certificate file name. For the `-P` parameter,
    substitute the port for your DB instance. For the `-u` parameter,
    substitute the user name of a valid database user, such as the master user.
    Enter the master user password when prompted.

The following example shows how to launch the client using the
    `--ssl-ca` parameter using the MariaDB client:

```nohighlight

mysql -h mysql–instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --ssl-ca=global-bundle.pem --ssl -P 3306 -u myadmin -p
```

To require that the SSL/TLS connection verifies the DB instance endpoint
    against the endpoint in the SSL/TLS certificate, enter the following
    command:

```nohighlight

mysql -h mysql–instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --ssl-ca=global-bundle.pem --ssl-verify-server-cert -P 3306 -u myadmin -p
```

The following example shows how to launch the client using the
    `--ssl-ca` parameter using the MySQL 5.7 client or later:

```nohighlight

mysql -h mysql–instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --ssl-ca=global-bundle.pem --ssl-mode=REQUIRED -P 3306 -u myadmin -p
```

3. Enter the master user password when prompted.

You should see output similar to the following.

```nohighlight
