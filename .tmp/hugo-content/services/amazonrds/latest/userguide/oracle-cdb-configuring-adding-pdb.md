# Adding an RDS for Oracle tenant database to your CDB instance

In the RDS for Oracle multi-tenant configuration, a tenant database is a PDB. To add a
tenant database, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Your CDB has the multi-tenant configuration enabled. For more information, see
[Multi-tenant configuration of the CDB architecture](oracle-concepts-cdbs.md#multi-tenant-configuration).

- You have the necessary IAM permissions to create the tenant database.

You can add a tenant database using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API. You
can't add multiple tenant databases in a single operation: you must add them one at a
time. If the CDB has backup retention enabled, Amazon RDS backs up the DB instance before and after
it adds a new tenant database. If the CDB has read replicas,
you can only add a tenant database to the primary DB instance;
Amazon RDS automatically creates the tenant database on the replicas.
Replication health is also validated, ensuring all replicas are available and
replication lag is less than 5 minutes before the tenant is created.

###### To add a tenant database to your DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the
    AWS Region in which you want to create the tenant database.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

4. Choose the CDB instance to which you want to add a tenant database. Your
    DB instance must use the multi-tenant configuration of the CDB architecture.

5. Choose **Actions** and then **Add tenant**
**database**.

6. For **Tenant database settings**, do the following:

- For **Tenant database name**, enter the name of
your new PDB.

- For **Tenant database master username**, enter the
name of the master user for your PDB.

- Choose either of the following credentials management
options:

- **Managed in AWS Secrets Manager**

In **Select the encryption key**,
choose either a KMS key that Secrets Manager creates or a key
that you have created.

###### Note

We recommend AWS Secrets Manager as the most secure
technique for managing credentials. Additional charges apply.
AWS Secrets Manager is not supported for instances using read replicas.
For more information, see [Password management with Amazon RDS and AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md).

- **Self managed**

To specify a password, clear the **Auto**
**generate a password** check box if it is
selected. Enter the same password in **Master**
**password** and **Confirm master**
**password**.

- Under **Additional configuration**,
enter the name of your PDB for **Initial**
**database name**. You can't name the CDB,
which has the default name `RDSCDB`.

- For **Tenant database character set**, choose
a character set for the PDB. The default is
**AL32UTF8**. You can choose a PDB
character set that is different from the CDB character
set. If the instance has read replicas, tenants cannot be created
with a custom character set. You can create your tenants with a custom character set
before creating a read replica if needed.

- For **Tenant database national character**
**set**, choose a national character set for the PDB.
The default is **AL32UTF8**. The national
character set specifies the encoding only for columns that use
the `NCHAR` data type ( `NCHAR`,
`NVARCHAR2`, and `NCLOB`) and doesn't
affect database metadata.

For more information about the preceding settings, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

7. Choose **Add tenant**.

To add a tenant database to your CDB with the AWS CLI, use the command [create-tenant-database](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-tenant-database.md) with the following required
parameters:

- `--db-instance-identifier`

- `--tenant-db-name`

- `--master-username`

- `--master-user-password`

This following example creates a tenant database named
`mypdb2` in the RDS for Oracle CDB instance named
`my-cdb-inst`. The PDB character set is
`UTF-16`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-tenant-database --region us-east-1 \
    --db-instance-identifier my-cdb-inst \
    --tenant-db-name mypdb2 \
    --master-username mypdb2-admin \
    --master-user-password mypdb2-pwd \
    --character-set-name UTF-16
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-tenant-database --region us-east-1 \
    --db-instance-identifier my-cdb-inst ^
    --tenant-db-name mypdb2 ^
    --master-username mypdb2-admin ^
    --master-user-password mypdb2-pwd ^
    --character-set-name UTF-16
```

The output looks similar to the following.

```

...}
    "TenantDatabase" :
         {
            "DbiResourceId" : "db-abc123",
            "TenantDatabaseResourceId" : "tdb-bac567",
            "TenantDatabaseArn" : "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:my-cdb-inst:mypdb2",
            "DBInstanceIdentifier" : "my-cdb-inst",
            "TenantDBName" : "mypdb2",
            "Status" : "creating",
            "MasterUsername" : "mypdb2",
            "CharacterSetName" : "UTF-16",
            ...
        }
}...
```
