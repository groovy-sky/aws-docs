# Prerequisites for RMAN backups

Before backing up your database using the `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util`
package, make sure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- Make sure that your RDS for Oracle database is in `ARCHIVELOG` mode.
To enable this mode, set the backup retention period to a non-zero
value.

- When backing up archived redo logs or performing a full or incremental
backup that includes archived redo logs, and when backing up the database,
make sure that redo log retention is set to a nonzero value. Archived redo
logs are required to make database files consistent during recovery. For
more information, see [Retaining archived redo logs](appendix-oracle-commondbatasks-retainredologs.md).

- Make sure that your DB instance has sufficient free space to hold the backups.
When back up your database, you specify an Oracle directory object as a
parameter in the procedure call. RMAN places the files in the specified
directory. You can use default directories, such as
`DATA_PUMP_DIR`, or create a new directory. For more
information, see [Creating and dropping directories in the main data storage space](appendix-oracle-commondbatasks-misc.md#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.NewDirectories).

You can monitor the current free space in an RDS for Oracle instance using
the CloudWatch metric `FreeStorageSpace`. We recommend that your free
space exceeds the current size of the database, though RMAN backs up only
formatted blocks and supports compression.
