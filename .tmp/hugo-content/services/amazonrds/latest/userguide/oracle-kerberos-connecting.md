# Connecting to Oracle with Kerberos authentication

This section assumes that you have set up your Oracle client as described in [Step 8: Configure an Oracle client](oracle-kerberos-setting-up.md#oracle-kerberos.setting-up.configure-oracle-client). To connect to the Oracle
DB with Kerberos authentication, log in using the Kerberos authentication type. For example,
after launching Oracle SQL Developer, choose **Kerberos**
**Authentication** as the authentication type, as shown in the following example.

![Shows the New/Select Database Connection dialog box in Oracle SQL Developer. The Kerberos Authentication checkbox is selected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ora-kerberos-auth.png)

To connect to Oracle with Kerberos authentication with SQL\*Plus:

1. At a command prompt, run the following command:

```nohighlight

kinit username
```

Replace `username` with the user name and, at the prompt, enter the password stored in the
    Microsoft Active Directory for the user.

2. Open SQL\*Plus and connect using the DNS name and port number for the Oracle DB instance.

For more information about connecting to an Oracle DB instance in SQL\*Plus, see [Connecting to your DB instance using SQL\*Plus](user-connecttooracleinstance-sqlplus.md).

###### Tip

If you are using a native Windows cache, you can also set the `SQLNET.KERBEROS5_CC_NAME` parameter to `OSMSFT://` or `MSLSA` in the sqlnet.ora file
to use the credentials stored in the Microsoft Active Directory.
