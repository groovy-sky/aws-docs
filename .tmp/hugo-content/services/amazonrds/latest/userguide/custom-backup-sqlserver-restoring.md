# Restoring from an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB snapshot

When you restore an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance, you provide the name of the DB snapshot and a name for the new instance.
You can't restore from a snapshot to an existing RDS Custom DB instance. A new RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance is created when you restore.

Restoring from a snapshot will restore the storage volume to the point in time at which the snapshot was taken.
This will include all the databases and any other files that were present on the `(D:)` volume.

###### To restore an RDS Custom DB instance from a DB snapshot

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**.

3. Choose the DB snapshot that you want to restore from.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Restore snapshot**.

5. On the **Restore DB instance** page, for **DB instance**
**identifier**, enter the name for your restored RDS Custom DB instance.

6. Choose **Restore DB instance**.

You restore an RDS Custom DB snapshot by using the [restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.md) AWS CLI command.

If the snapshot you are restoring from is for a private DB instance, make sure to specify both the correct
`db-subnet-group-name` and `no-publicly-accessible`. Otherwise, the DB instance defaults to
publicly accessible. The following options are required:

- `db-snapshot-identifier` – Identifies the snapshot from which to restore

- `db-instance-identifier` – Specifies the name of the RDS Custom DB instance to create
from the DB snapshot

- `custom-iam-instance-profile` – Specifies the instance profile associated with the
underlying Amazon EC2 instance of an RDS Custom DB instance.

The following code restores the snapshot named `my-custom-snapshot` for
`my-custom-instance`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
  --db-snapshot-identifier my-custom-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance \
  --custom-iam-instance-profile AWSRDSCustomInstanceProfileForRdsCustomInstance \
  --no-publicly-accessible
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot ^
  --db-snapshot-identifier my-custom-snapshot ^
  --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance ^
  --custom-iam-instance-profile AWSRDSCustomInstanceProfileForRdsCustomInstance ^
  --no-publicly-accessible
```
