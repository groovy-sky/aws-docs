# Upgrading PostgreSQL extensions in RDS for PostgreSQL databases

A PostgreSQL engine upgrade doesn't upgrade most PostgreSQL extensions.
To update an extension after a version upgrade, use the `ALTER
                                EXTENSION UPDATE` command.

###### Note

For information about updating the PostGIS extension, see [Managing spatial data with the PostGIS extension](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-postgis.md)
( [Step 6: Upgrade the PostGIS extension](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-postgis.md#Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.PostGIS.Update)).

To update the `pg_repack` extension, drop the extension and
then create the new version in the upgraded database. For more
information, see [pg\_repack installation](https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack) in the
`pg_repack` documentation.

To upgrade an extension, use the following command.

```sql

ALTER EXTENSION extension_name UPDATE TO 'new_version';
```

For the list of supported versions of PostgreSQL extensions, see [Supported PostgreSQL extension versions](postgresql-concepts-general-featuresupport-extensions.md).

To list your currently installed extensions, use the PostgreSQL [pg\_extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-extension.html) catalog in the following command.

```sql

SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

To view a list of the specific extension versions that are available for your
installation, use the PostgreSQL [pg\_available\_extension\_versions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-available-extension-versions.html) view in the following
command.

```sql

SELECT * FROM pg_available_extension_versions;
```
