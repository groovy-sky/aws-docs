# Supported Regions and DB engines for Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments

A blue/green deployment copies a production database environment in a separate, synchronized
staging environment. By using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments, you can make changes to the database
in the staging environment without affecting the production environment. For example, you can
upgrade the major or minor DB engine version, change database parameters, or make schema changes
in the staging environment. When you are ready, you can promote the staging environment to be
the new production database environment. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments for database updates](blue-green-deployments.md).

Blue/green deployments are supported in all AWS Regions.

Blue/green deployments are _not_ supported with the following
engines:

- RDS for Db2

- RDS for SQL Server

- RDS for Oracle

information, see [PostgreSQL replication methods for blue/green deployments](blue-green-deployments-replication-type.md).
