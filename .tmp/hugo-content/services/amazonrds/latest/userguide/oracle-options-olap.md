# Oracle OLAP

Amazon RDS supports Oracle OLAP through the use of the `OLAP` option.
This option provides On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) for Oracle DB instances.
You can use Oracle OLAP to analyze large amounts of data by creating dimensional objects
and cubes in accordance with the OLAP standard. For more information, see
[the Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/olaug/index.html).

###### Important

If you use Oracle OLAP, Amazon RDS automatically updates your DB instance to the latest Oracle PSU
if there are security vulnerabilities with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9+
or other announced security vulnerabilities.

Amazon RDS supports Oracle OLAP for the Enterprise Edition of Oracle Database 19c and
higher.

## Prerequisites for Oracle OLAP

The following are prerequisites for using Oracle OLAP:

- You must have an Oracle OLAP license from Oracle. For more information, see
[Licensing Information](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dblic/Licensing-Information.html) in the Oracle documentation.

- Your DB instance must be of a sufficient instance class. Oracle OLAP
isn't supported for the db.t3.small DB instance classes. For
more information, see [RDS for Oracle DB instance classes](oracle-concepts-instanceclasses.md).

- Your DB instance must have **Auto Minor Version Upgrade** enabled.
This option enables your DB instance to receive minor DB engine version
upgrades automatically when they become available and is required for any options that install
the Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Amazon RDS uses this
option to update your DB instance to the latest Oracle Patch Set Update
(PSU) or Release Update (RU). For more information, see
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

- Your DB instance must not have a user named `OLAPSYS`. If it does,
the OLAP option installation fails.

## Best practices for Oracle OLAP

The following are best practices for using Oracle OLAP:

- For maximum security, use the `OLAP` option with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
For more information, see [Oracle Secure Sockets Layer](appendix-oracle-options-ssl.md).

- Configure your DB instance to restrict access to your DB instance.
For more information, see [Scenarios for accessing a DB instance in a VPC](user-vpc-scenarios.md)
and [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md).

## Adding the Oracle OLAP option

The following is the general process for adding the `OLAP` option to a DB instance:

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option group.

2. Add the option to the option group.

3. Associate the option group with the DB instance.

If Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is _not_ installed on the DB instance,
there is a brief outage while the `OLAP` option is added. There is no outage if
Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is already installed on the DB instance.
After you add the option, you don't need to restart your DB instance.
As soon as the option group is active, Oracle OLAP is available.

###### To add the OLAP option to a DB instance

1. Determine the option group that you want to use. You can create a new option group or use an existing option group.
    If you want to use an existing option group, skip to the next step.
    Otherwise, create a custom DB option group with the following settings:

- For **Engine**, choose the Oracle edition for your DB
instance.

- For **Major engine version**,
choose the version of your DB instance.

For more information,
see [Creating an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create).

2. Add the **OLAP** option to the option group.
    For more information about adding options,
    see [Adding an option to an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption).

3. Apply the option group to a new or existing DB instance:

- For a new DB instance, apply the option group when you launch the
instance. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

- For an existing DB instance, apply the option group by modifying the
instance and attaching the new option group. For more information, see
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

## Using Oracle OLAP

After you enable the Oracle OLAP option, you can begin using it. For a list of features that are supported for Oracle OLAP, see
[the Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/olaug/overview.html).

## Removing the Oracle OLAP option

After you drop all objects that use data types provided by the `OLAP` option, you can remove the
option from a DB instance. If Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is _not_ installed on the DB
instance, there is a brief outage while the `OLAP` option is removed. There is no outage if Oracle
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is already installed on the DB instance. After you remove the `OLAP`
option, you don't need to restart your DB instance.

###### To drop the `OLAP` option

1. Back up your data.

###### Warning

If the instance uses data types that were enabled as part of the option, and if you remove the
`OLAP` option, you can lose data. For more information, see [Backing up, restoring, and exporting data](chap-commontasks-backuprestore.md).

2. Check whether any existing objects reference data types or features of the `OLAP` option.

3. Drop any objects that reference data types or features of the `OLAP` option.

4. Do one of the following:

- Remove the `OLAP` option from the option group it belongs to. This change affects
all DB instances that use the option group. For more information, see [Removing an option from an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption).

- Modify the DB instance and specify a different option group that doesn't include the
`OLAP` option. This change affects a single DB instance. You can specify the
default (empty) option group, or a different custom option group. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).
