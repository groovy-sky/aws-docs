# Administrative permissions on SSISDB

When the instance is created or modified with the SSIS option, the result is an SSISDB
database with the ssis\_admin and ssis\_logreader roles granted to the master user. The
master user has the following privileges in SSISDB:

- alter on ssis\_admin role

- alter on ssis\_logreader role

- alter any user

Because the master user is a SQL-authenticated user, you can't use the master user for
executing SSIS packages. The master user can use these privileges to create new SSISDB
users and add them to the ssis\_admin and ssis\_logreader roles. Doing this is useful for
giving access to your domain users for using SSIS.

## Setting up a Windows-authenticated user for SSIS

The master user can use the following code example to set up a Windows-authenticated login
in SSISDB and grant the required procedure permissions. Doing this grants
permissions to the domain user to deploy and run SSIS packages, use S3 file transfer
procedures, create credentials, and work with the SQL Server Agent proxy. For more
information, see [Credentials (database engine)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/credentials-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver15) and [Create a SQL Server Agent proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/create-a-sql-server-agent-proxy?view=sql-server-ver15) in the Microsoft documentation.

###### Note

You can grant some or all of the following permissions as needed to Windows-authenticated
users.
