## Tutorials in this guide

The following tutorials in this guide show you how to perform common tasks with
Amazon RDS:

- [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB instance (IPv4 only)](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createvpc.md)

Learn how to include a DB instance in a virtual
private cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC service. In this case, the VPC
shares data with a web server that is running on an Amazon EC2 instance in the same
VPC.

- [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB instance (dual-stack mode)](chap-tutorials-createvpcdualstack.md)

Learn how to include a DB instance in a virtual
private cloud (VPC) based on the Amazon VPC service. In this case, the VPC shares
data with an Amazon EC2 instance in the same VPC. In this tutorial, you create the
VPC for this scenario that works with a database running in dual-stack mode.

- [Tutorial: Create a web server and an Amazon RDS DB instance](tut-webappwithrds.md)

Learn how to install an Apache web server with PHP and create a MySQL database. The web server runs on an Amazon EC2
instance using Amazon Linux, and the MySQL database is
a MySQL DB instance.
Both the Amazon EC2 instance and the DB instance
run in an Amazon VPC.

- [Tutorial: Restore an Amazon RDS DB instance from a DB snapshot](chap-tutorials-restoringfromsnapshot.md)

Learn how to restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot.

- [Tutorial: Using a Lambda function to access an Amazon RDS database](rds-lambda-tutorial.md)

Learn how to create a Lambda function from the RDS console to access a database through a proxy,
create a table, add a few records, and retrieve the records from the table.
You also learn how to invoke the Lambda function and verify the query results.

- [Tutorial: Specify which DB instances to stop by using tags](tagging-rds-autostop.md)

Learn how to use tags to specify which DB instances to stop.

- [Tutorial: Log DB instance state changes using Amazon EventBridge](rds-cloud-watch-events.md#log-rds-instance-state)

Learn how to log a DB instance state change using Amazon EventBridge and AWS Lambda.

- [Tutorial: Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for Multi-AZ DB cluster replica lag for Amazon RDS](multi-az-db-cluster-cloudwatch-alarm.md)

Learn how to create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when replica lag for a Multi-AZ DB cluster has
exceeded a threshold. An alarm watches the `ReplicaLag` metric over a time period that you specify.
The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy.

## Tutorials in other AWS guides

Learn how to create a secret for an AWS database and configure the secret to rotate on a schedule. You trigger one
rotation manually, and then confirm that the new version of the secret continues to provide access.

- [Tutorials and samples](../../../elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/tutorials.md) in the _AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide_

Learn how to deploy applications that use Amazon RDS databases with AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

- [Using Data from an Amazon RDS Database to Create an Amazon ML Datasource](../../../machine-learning/latest/dg/using-amazon-rds-with-amazon-ml.md) in the _Amazon Machine Learning Developer Guide_

Learn how to create an Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) datasource object from data stored in a MySQL DB instance.

- [Manually Enabling Access to an Amazon RDS Instance in a VPC](../../../quicksight/latest/user/rds-vpc-access.md) in the _Amazon Quick User Guide_
