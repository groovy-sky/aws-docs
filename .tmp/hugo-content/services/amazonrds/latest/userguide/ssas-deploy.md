# Deploying SSAS projects on Amazon RDS

On RDS, you can't deploy SSAS projects directly by using SQL Server Management Studio
(SSMS). To deploy projects, use an RDS stored procedure.

###### Note

Using .xmla files for deployment isn't supported.

Before you deploy projects, make sure of the following:

- Amazon S3 integration is turned on. For more information, see [Integrating an Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance with Amazon S3](user-sqlserver-options-s3-integration.md).

- The `Processing Option` configuration setting is set to `Do Not
  							Process`. This setting means that no processing happens after
deployment.

- You have both the `myssasproject.asdatabase` and
`myssasproject.deploymentoptions`
files. They're automatically generated when you build the SSAS
project.

###### To deploy an SSAS project on RDS

1. Download the `.asdatabase` (SSAS model) file from your S3 bucket to your DB
    instance, as shown in the following example. For more information on the
    download parameters, see [Downloading files from an Amazon S3 bucket to a SQL Server DB instance](appendix-sqlserver-options-s3-integration-using.md#Appendix.SQLServer.Options.S3-integration.using.download).

```nohighlight

exec msdb.dbo.rds_download_from_s3
@s3_arn_of_file='arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/myssasproject.asdatabase',
[@rds_file_path='D:\S3\myssasproject.asdatabase'],
[@overwrite_file=1];
```

2. Download the `.deploymentoptions` file from your S3 bucket to your DB
    instance.

```nohighlight

exec msdb.dbo.rds_download_from_s3
@s3_arn_of_file='arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/myssasproject.deploymentoptions',
[@rds_file_path='D:\S3\myssasproject.deploymentoptions'],
[@overwrite_file=1];
```

3. Deploy the project.

```nohighlight

exec msdb.dbo.rds_msbi_task
@task_type='SSAS_DEPLOY_PROJECT',
@file_path='D:\S3\myssasproject.asdatabase';
```
