# Importing data into Oracle on Amazon RDS

How you import data into an Amazon RDS for Oracle DB instance depends on the following:

- The amount of data you have

- The number of database objects in your database

- The variety of database objects in your database

For example, you can use the following tools, depending on your requirements:

- Oracle SQL Developer – Import a simple, 20 MB database.

- Oracle Data Pump – Import complex databases, or databases that are several hundred
megabytes or several terabytes in size. For example, you can transport tablespaces
from an on-premises database to your RDS for Oracle DB instance. You can use Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS to
transfer the data files and metadata. For more information, see [Migrating using Oracle transportable tablespaces](oracle-migrating-tts.md), [Amazon EFS integration](oracle-efs-integration.md), and
[Amazon S3 integration](oracle-s3-integration.md).

- AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) – Migrate databases without downtime. For more information about AWS DMS, see [What is AWS Database Migration Service](../../../dms/latest/userguide/welcome.md) and the blog post [Migrating\
Oracle databases with near-zero downtime using AWS DMS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/migrating-oracle-databases-with-near-zero-downtime-using-aws-dms).

###### Important

Before you use the preceding migration techniques, we recommend that you back up your database. After you import the data, you can back up your
RDS for Oracle DB instances by creating snapshots. Later, you can restore the snapshots. For more information, see [Backing up, restoring, and exporting data](chap-commontasks-backuprestore.md).

For many database engines, ongoing replication can continue until you are ready to switch
over to the target database. You can use AWS DMS to migrate to RDS for Oracle from either the same
database engine or a different engine. If you migrate from a different database engine, you
can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to migrate schema objects that AWS DMS doesn't migrate.
