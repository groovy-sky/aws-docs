# Using pgactive to support active-active replication

The `pgactive` extension uses active-active replication to support and coordinate
write operations on multiple RDS for PostgreSQL databases. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL supports the
`pgactive` extension on the following versions:

- RDS for PostgreSQL 17.0 and all higher versions

- RDS for PostgreSQL 16.1 and higher 16 versions

- RDS for PostgreSQL 15.4-R2 and higher 15 versions

- RDS for PostgreSQL 14.10 and higher 14 versions

- RDS for PostgreSQL 13.13 and higher 13 versions

- RDS for PostgreSQL 12.17 and higher 12 versions

- RDS for PostgreSQL 11.22

###### Note

When there are write operations on more than one database in a replication configuration,
conflicts are possible. For more information, see [Handling conflicts in active-active replication](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pgactive-handle-conflicts.md)

## Limitations for the pgactive extension

- All tables require a Primary Key, otherwise Update's and Delete's aren't allowed. The
values in the Primary Key column shouldn't be updated.

- Sequences may have gaps and sometimes might not follow an order. Sequences are not
replicated. For more information, see [Handling sequences in active-active replication](appendix-postgresql-commondbatasks-pgactive-handle-sequences.md).

- DDL and large objects are not replicated.

- Secondary unique indexes can cause data divergence.

- Collation needs to be identical on all node in the group.

- Load balancing across nodes is an anti-pattern.

- Large transactions can cause replication lag.
