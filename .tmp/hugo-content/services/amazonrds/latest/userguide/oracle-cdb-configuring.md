## Creating an RDS for Oracle CDB instance

In RDS for Oracle, creating a CDB instance is almost identical to creating a non-CDB instance.
The difference is that you choose the Oracle multitenant architecture when creating your
DB instance and also choose an architecture configuration: multi-tenant or single-tenant. If you
create tags when you create a CDB in the multi-tenant configuration, RDS propagates the tags
to the initial tenant database. To create a CDB, use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS
API.

###### To create a CDB instance

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the AWS Region in
     which you want to create the CDB instance.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

04. Choose **Create database**.

05. In **Choose a database creation method**, select
     **Standard Create**.

06. In **Engine options**, choose **Oracle**.

07. For **Database management type**, choose **Amazon**
    **RDS**.

08. For **Architecture settings**, choose **Oracle**
    **multitenant architecture**.

09. For **Architecture configuration**, do either
     of the following:

- Choose **Multi-tenant configuration** and proceed
to the next step.

- Choose **Single-tenant configuration** and skip
to Step 11.

10. (Multi-tenant configuration) For **Tenant database**
    **settings**, make the following changes:

- For **Tenant database name**, enter the name of
your initial PDB. The PDB name must be different from the CDB name,
which defaults to `RDSCDB`.

- For **Tenant database master username**, enter
the master username of your PDB. You can't use the tenant database
master username to log in to the CDB itself.

- For **Credentials management**, choose either of
the following credentials management options:

- **Managed in AWS Secrets Manager**

The managed password is for the initial tenant database
rather than for the instance. In **Select the**
**encryption key**, choose either a KMS key
that Secrets Manager creates or a key that you have created.

###### Note

We recommend AWS Secrets Manager as the most secure technique
for managing credentials. Additional charges apply. For
more information, see [Password management with Amazon RDS and AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md).

- **Self managed**

To specify a password, clear the **Auto generate a**
**password** check box if it is selected. Enter
the same password in **Master password**
and **Confirm master password**.

- For **Tenant database character set**, choose a
character set for the PDB. You can choose a tenant database
character set that is different from the CDB character set.

The default PDB character set is **AL32UTF8**. If
you choose a nondefault PDB character set, CDB creation might be
slower.

###### Note

You can't specify multiple tenant databases in the create operation.
The CDB has one PDB when it is created. You can add PDBs to an existing
CDB in a separate operation.

11. (Single-tenant configuration) Choose the settings that you want based on
     the options listed in [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md):
    1. In the **Settings** section, open
        **Credential Settings**. Then do the
        following:
       1. For **Master username**, enter the name
           for a local user in your PDB. You can't use the master
           username to log in to the CDB root.

       2. For **Credentials management**, choose
           either of the following credentials management
           options:

- **Managed in AWS Secrets Manager**

In **Select the encryption key**,
choose either a KMS key that Secrets Manager creates or a
key that you have created.

###### Note

We recommend AWS Secrets Manager as the most secure
technique for managing credentials. Additional
charges apply. For more information, see [Password management with Amazon RDS and AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md).

- **Self managed**

To specify a password, clear the **Auto**
**generate a password** check box if it is
selected. Enter the same password in
**Master password** and
**Confirm master**
**password**.
12. For the remaining sections, specify your DB instance settings. For information
     about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

13. Choose **Create database**.

To create a CDB in the multi-tenant configuration, use the [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md)
command with the following parameters:

- `--db-instance-identifier`

- `--db-instance-class`

- `--engine { oracle-ee-cdb | oracle-se2-cdb }`

- `--master-username`

- `--master-user-password` or
`--manage-master-user-password`

- `--multi-tenant` (for the single-tenant configuration, either
don't specify `multi-tenant` or specify
`--no-multi-tenant`)

- `--allocated-storage`

- `--backup-retention-period`

For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

This following example creates an RDS for Oracle DB instance named
`my-cdb-inst` in the multi-tenant configuration. If you
specify `--no-multi-tenant` or don't specify `--multi-tenant`,
the default CDB configuration is single-tenant. The engine is
`oracle-ee-cdb`: a command that specifies `oracle-ee` and
`--multi-tenant` fails with an error. The initial tenant database is
named `mypdb`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
    --engine oracle-ee-cdb \
    --db-instance-identifier my-cdb-inst \
    --multi-tenant \
    --db-name mypdb \
    --allocated-storage 250 \
    --db-instance-class db.t3.large \
    --master-username pdb_admin \
    --manage-master-user-password \
    --backup-retention-period 3
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance ^
    --engine oracle-ee-cdb ^
    --db-instance-identifier my-cdb-inst ^
    --multi-tenant ^
    --db-name mypdb ^
    --allocated-storage 250 ^
    --db-instance-class db.t3.large ^
    --master-username pdb_admin ^
    --manage-master-user-password \ ^
    --backup-retention-period 3
```

###### Note

Specify a password other than the prompt shown here as a security best practice.

This command produces output similar to the following. The database name,
character set, national character set, master user, and master user secret
aren't included in the output. You can view this information by using the CLI
command `describe-tenant-databases`.

```

{
    "DBInstance": {
        "DBInstanceIdentifier": "my-cdb-inst",
        "DBInstanceClass": "db.t3.large",
        "MultiTenant": true,
        "Engine": "oracle-ee-cdb",
        "DBResourceId": "db-ABCDEFGJIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
        "DBInstanceStatus": "creating",
        "AllocatedStorage": 250,
        "PreferredBackupWindow": "04:59-05:29",

        "DBSecurityGroups": [],
        "VpcSecurityGroups": [
            {
                "VpcSecurityGroupId": "sg-0a1bcd2e",
                "Status": "active"
            }
        ],
        "DBParameterGroups": [
            {
                "DBParameterGroupName": "default.oracle-ee-cdb-19",
                "ParameterApplyStatus": "in-sync"
            }
        ],
        "DBSubnetGroup": {
            "DBSubnetGroupName": "default",
            "DBSubnetGroupDescription": "default",
            "VpcId": "vpc-1234567a",
            "SubnetGroupStatus": "Complete",
            ...
```

To create a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call the [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md)
operation.

For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

## Connecting to a PDB in your RDS for Oracle CDB

You can use a utility like SQL\*Plus to connect to a PDB. To download Oracle Instant
Client, which includes a standalone version of SQL\*Plus, see [Oracle\
Instant Client Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html).

To connect SQL\*Plus to your PDB, you need the following information:

- PDB name

- Database user name and password

- Endpoint for your DB instance

- Port number

For information about finding the preceding information, see [Finding the endpoint of your RDS for Oracle DB instance](user-endpoint.md).

###### Example To connect to your PDB using SQL\*Plus

In the following examples, substitute your master user for
`master_user_name`. Also, substitute the endpoint for your
DB instance, and then include the port number and the Oracle SID. The SID value is the name of
the PDB that you specified when you created your DB instance, and not the DB instance
identifier.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```sql

sqlplus 'master_user_name@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=endpoint)(PORT=port))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=pdb_name)))'
```

For Windows:

```sql

sqlplus master_user_name@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=endpoint)(PORT=port))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=pdb_name)))
```

You should see output similar to the following.

```

SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 Production on Mon Aug 21 09:42:20 2021
```

After you enter the password for the user, the SQL prompt appears.

```

SQL>
```

###### Note

The shorter format connection string (Easy connect or EZCONNECT), such as
`sqlplus
                    username/password@LONGER-THAN-63-CHARS-RDS-ENDPOINT-HERE:1521/database-identifier`,
might encounter a maximum character limit and should not be used to connect.
