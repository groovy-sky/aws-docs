# Setting up Kerberos authentication for PostgreSQL DB instances

You use AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) to set up Kerberos authentication for a
PostgreSQL DB instance. To set up Kerberos authentication, take the following steps.

## Step 1: Create a directory using AWS Managed Microsoft AD

Directory Service creates a fully managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. When you create
an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, Directory Service creates two domain controllers and DNS servers for
you. The directory servers are created in different subnets in a VPC. This
redundancy helps make sure that your directory remains accessible even if a failure
occurs.

When you create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, AWS Directory Service performs the
following tasks on your behalf:

- Sets up an Active Directory within your VPC.

- Creates a directory administrator account with the user name
`Admin` and the specified password. You use this account to
manage your directory.

###### Important

Make sure to save this password. Directory Service doesn't store this
password, and it can't be retrieved or reset.

- Creates a security group for the directory controllers. The security group
must permit communication with the PostgreSQL DB instance.

When you launch AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, AWS creates an Organizational Unit (OU) that
contains all of your directory's objects. This OU, which has the NetBIOS name
that you entered when you created your directory, is located in the domain root. The
domain root is owned and managed by AWS.

The `Admin` account that was created with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory
has permissions for the most common administrative activities for your OU:

- Create, update, or delete users

- Add resources to your domain such as file or print servers, and then
assign permissions for those resources to users in your OU

- Create additional OUs and containers

- Delegate authority

- Restore deleted objects from the Active Directory Recycle Bin

- Run Active Directory and Domain Name Service (DNS) modules for Windows
PowerShell on the Active Directory Web Service

The `Admin` account also has rights to perform the following
domain-wide activities:

- Manage DNS configurations (add, remove, or update records, zones, and
forwarders)

- View DNS event logs

- View security event logs

###### To create a directory with AWS Managed Microsoft AD

1. In the [Directory Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2) navigation
    pane, choose **Directories**, and then choose
    **Set up directory**.

2. Choose **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**. AWS Managed Microsoft AD is the
    only option currently supported for use with Amazon RDS.

3. Choose **Next**.

4. On the **Enter directory information** page, provide the
    following information:

**Edition**

Choose the edition that meets your requirements.

**Directory DNS name**

The fully qualified name for the directory, such as
`corp.example.com`.

**Directory NetBIOS name**

An optional short name for the directory, such as
`CORP`.

**Directory description**

An optional description for the directory.

**Admin password**

The password for the directory administrator. The directory
creation process creates an administrator account with the user
name `Admin` and this password.

The directory administrator password can't include the
word "admin." The password is case-sensitive and must be
8–64 characters in length. It must also contain at least
one character from three of the following four categories:

- Lowercase letters (a–z)

- Uppercase letters (A–Z)

- Numbers (0–9)

- Nonalphanumeric characters
(~!@#$%^&\*\_-+=\`\|\\(){}\[\]:;"'<>,.?/)

**Confirm password**

Retype the administrator password.

###### Important

Make sure that you save this password. Directory Service doesn't
store this password, and it can't be retrieved or
reset.

5. Choose **Next**.

6. On the **Choose VPC and subnets** page, provide the
    following information:

**VPC**

Choose the VPC for the directory. You can create the
PostgreSQL DB instance in this same VPC or
in a different VPC.

**Subnets**

Choose the subnets for the directory servers. The two subnets
must be in different Availability Zones.

7. Choose **Next**.

8. Review the directory information. If changes are needed, choose
    **Previous** and make the changes. When the information
    is correct, choose **Create directory**.

![Directory details page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/WinAuth2.png)

It takes several minutes for the directory to be created. When it has been
successfully created, the **Status** value changes to
**Active**.

To see information about your directory, choose the directory ID in the directory
listing. Make a note of the **Directory ID** value. You need this
value when you create or modify your PostgreSQL DB instance.

![Image of details page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/WinAuth3.png)

## Step 2: (Optional) Create a trust relationship between your on-premises Active Directory and Directory Service

If you don't plan to use your own on-premises Microsoft Active Directory,
skip to [Step 3: Create an IAM role for Amazon RDS to access the Directory Service](#postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.CreateIAMRole).

To get Kerberos authentication using your on-premises Active Directory, you need
to create a trusting domain relationship using a forest trust between your
on-premises Microsoft Active Directory and the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory (created in
[Step 1: Create a directory using AWS Managed Microsoft AD](#postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.create-directory)). The trust
can be one-way, where the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory trusts the on-premises Microsoft
Active Directory. The trust can also be two-way, where both Active Directories trust
each other. For more information about setting up trusts using Directory Service, see [When to create\
a trust relationship](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms-ad-setup-trust.md) in the
_AWS Directory Service Administration Guide_.

###### Note

If you use an on-premises Microsoft Active Directory, Windows clients connect
using the domain name of the Directory Service in the endpoint rather than rds.amazonaws.com. To
learn more, see [Connecting to PostgreSQL with Kerberos authentication](postgresql-kerberos-connecting.md).

Make sure that your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory domain name includes a
DNS suffix routing that corresponds to the newly created trust relationship. The
following screenshot shows an example.

![DNS routing corresponds to the created trust](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/kerberos-auth-trust.png)

## Step 3: Create an IAM role for Amazon RDS to access the Directory Service

For Amazon RDS to call Directory Service for you, your AWS account needs an IAM role
that uses the managed IAM policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`.
This role allows Amazon RDS to make calls to Directory Service.

When you create a DB instance using the AWS Management Console and your console user account
has the `iam:CreateRole` permission, the console creates the needed IAM
role automatically. In this case, the role name is
`rds-directoryservice-kerberos-access-role`. Otherwise, you must
create the IAM role manually. When you create this IAM role, choose
`Directory Service`, and attach the AWS managed policy
`AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess` to it.

For more information about creating IAM roles for a service, see [Creating a role to delegate\
permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

###### Note

The IAM role used for Windows Authentication for RDS for Microsoft SQL
Server can't be used for Amazon RDS for
PostgreSQL.

As an alternative to using the `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`
managed policy, you can create policies with the required permissions. In this case,
the IAM role must have the following IAM trust policy.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "directoryservice.rds.amazonaws.com",
          "rds.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

```

The role must also have the following IAM role policy.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ds:DescribeDirectories",
        "ds:AuthorizeApplication",
        "ds:UnauthorizeApplication",
        "ds:GetAuthorizedApplicationDetails"
      ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

For opt-in AWS Regions, use Region-specific service principals in IAM role
trust policies. When you create a trust policy for services in these Regions,
specify the Region code in the service principal.

The following example shows a trust policy that includes Region-specific service
principals:

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "directoryservice.rds.REGION-CODE.amazonaws.com",
          "rds.REGION-CODE.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

```

Replace REGION-CODE with the code for your specific Region. For example, use the
following service principals for the Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region:

```json

"Service": [
  "directoryservice.rds.ap-southeast-4.amazonaws.com",
  "rds.ap-southeast-4.amazonaws.com"
]

```

## Step 4: Create and configure users

You can create users by using the Active Directory Users and Computers tool. This
is one of the Active Directory Domain Services and Active Directory Lightweight
Directory Services tools. For more information, see [Add Users and Computers to the Active Directory domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/create-an-active-directory-server) in the Microsoft
documentation. In this case, users are individuals or other entities, such as their
computers that are part of the domain and whose identities are being maintained in
the directory.

To create users in an Directory Service directory, you must be connected to a Windows-based
Amazon EC2 instance that's a member of the Directory Service directory. At the same time, you
must be logged in as a user that has privileges to create users. For more
information, see [Create a\
user](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms-ad-manage-users-groups-create-user.md) in the _AWS Directory Service Administration Guide_.

## Step 5: Enable cross-VPC traffic between the directory and the DB instance

If you plan to locate the directory and the DB
instance in the same VPC, skip this step and
move on to [Step 6: Create or modify a PostgreSQL DB instance](#postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.create-modify).

If you plan to locate the directory and the DB instance in different VPCs,
configure cross-VPC traffic using VPC peering or [AWS Transit\
Gateway](../../../vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.md).

The following procedure enables traffic between VPCs using VPC peering. Follow the
instructions in [What is VPC peering?](../../../vpc/latest/peering/welcome.md)
in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Peering_
_Guide_.

###### To enable cross-VPC traffic using VPC peering

1. Set up appropriate VPC routing rules to ensure that network traffic can
    flow both ways.

2. Ensure that the DB instance security group can receive inbound traffic
    from the directory security group.

3. Ensure that there is no network access control list (ACL) rule to block
    traffic.

If a different AWS account owns the directory, you must share the
directory.

###### To share the directory between AWS accounts

1. Start sharing the directory with the AWS account that the DB instance
    will be created in by following the instructions in [Tutorial:\
    Sharing your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory for seamless EC2\
    Domain-join](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms-ad-tutorial-directory-sharing.md) in the _Directory Service Administration_
_Guide_.

2. Sign in to the Directory Service console using the account for the DB instance, and
    ensure that the domain has the `SHARED` status before
    proceeding.

3. While signed into the Directory Service console using the account for the DB instance,
    note the **Directory ID** value. You use this directory ID
    to join the DB instance to the domain.

## Step 6: Create or modify a PostgreSQL DB instance

Create or modify a PostgreSQL DB
instance for use with your directory. You can
use the console, CLI, or RDS API to associate a DB instance with a
directory. You can do this in one of the following ways:

- Create a new PostgreSQL DB instance using the console,
the [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) CLI command, or the [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md)
RDS API operation. For instructions, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

- Modify an existing PostgreSQL DB instance using the
console, the [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) CLI command, or the [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md)
RDS API operation. For instructions, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

- Restore a PostgreSQL DB instance from a DB snapshot using
the console, the [restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.md) CLI command, or the [RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancefromdbsnapshot.md) RDS API operation. For
instructions, see [Restoring to a DB instance](user-restorefromsnapshot.md).

- Restore a PostgreSQL DB instance to a point-in-time using
the console, the [restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.md) CLI command, or the [RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancetopointintime.md) RDS API operation. For
instructions, see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time for Amazon RDS](user-pit.md).

Kerberos authentication is only supported for PostgreSQL DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance can be in the
same VPC as the directory, or in a different VPC. The DB instance must use a
security group that allows ingress and egress within the directory's VPC so the DB
instance can communicate with the directory.

When you use the console to create, modify, or
restore a DB instance, choose **Password and Kerberos**
**authentication** in the **Database**
**authentication** section. Then choose **Browse**
**Directory**. Select the directory or choose **Create a**
**new directory** to use the Directory Service.

![Choosing Kerberos for authentication and identifying the directory to use.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/rpg-authentication-use-kerberos.png)

When you use the AWS CLI, the following parameters are required for the DB
instance to be able to use the directory that you
created:

- For the `--domain` parameter, use the domain identifier
("d-\*" identifier) generated when you created the directory.

- For the `--domain-iam-role-name` parameter, use the
role you created that uses the managed IAM policy
`AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`.

For example, the following CLI command modifies a DB instance to use a directory.

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance --domain d-Directory-ID --domain-iam-role-name role-name
```

###### Important

If you modify a DB
instance to enable Kerberos
authentication, reboot the DB
instance after making the change.

## Step 7: Create PostgreSQL users for your Kerberos principals

At this point, your
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance is joined to the
AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain. The users that you created in the directory in [Step 4: Create and configure users](#postgresql-kerberos-setting-up.create-users) need to be set up
as PostgreSQL database users and granted privileges to login to the database. You do
that by signing in as the database user with `rds_superuser` privileges.
For example, if you accepted the defaults when you created your
RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance, you use
`postgres`, as shown in the following steps.

###### To create PostgreSQL database users for Kerberos principals

1. Use `psql` to connect to your
    RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance endpoint
    using `psql`. The following example uses the default
    `postgres` account for the `rds_superuser`
    role.

```nohighlight

psql --host=cluster-instance-1.111122223333.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password
```

2. Create a database user name for each Kerberos principal (Active Directory
    username) that you want to have access to the database. Use the canonical
    username (identity) as defined in the Active Directory instance, that is, a
    lower-case `alias` (username in Active Directory) and the
    upper-case name of the Active Directory domain for that user name. The
    Active Directory user name is an externally authenticated user, so use
    quotes around the name as shown following.

```nohighlight

postgres=> CREATE USER "username@CORP.EXAMPLE.COM" WITH LOGIN;
CREATE ROLE
```

3. Grant the `rds_ad` role to the database user.

```nohighlight

postgres=> GRANT rds_ad TO "username@CORP.EXAMPLE.COM";
GRANT ROLE
```

After you finish creating all the PostgreSQL users for your Active Directory user
identities, users can access the RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance
by using their Kerberos credentials.

It's required that the database users who authenticate using Kerberos are
doing so from client machines that are members of the Active Directory
domain.

Database users that have been granted the `rds_ad` role can't also
have the `rds_iam` role. This also applies to nested memberships. For
more information, see [IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md).

## Step 8: Configure a PostgreSQL client

To configure a PostgreSQL client, take the following steps:

- Create a krb5.conf file (or equivalent) to point to the domain.

- Verify that traffic can flow between the client host and Directory Service. Use a
network utility such as Netcat for the following:

- Verify traffic over DNS for port 53.

- Verify traffic over TCP/UDP for port 53 and for Kerberos, which
includes ports 88 and 464 for Directory Service.

- Verify that traffic can flow between the client host and the DB instance
over the database port. For example, use psql to connect and access the
database.

The following is sample krb5.conf content for AWS Managed Microsoft AD.

```nohighlight

[libdefaults]
 default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
[realms]
 EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = example.com
  admin_server = example.com
 }
[domain_realm]
 .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
```

The following is sample krb5.conf content for an on-premises Microsoft Active
Directory.

```nohighlight

[libdefaults]
 default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
[realms]
 EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = example.com
  admin_server = example.com
 }
 ONPREM.COM = {
  kdc = onprem.com
  admin_server = onprem.com
 }
[domain_realm]
 .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 .onprem.com = ONPREM.COM
 onprem.com = ONPREM.COM
 .rds.amazonaws.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 .amazonaws.com.cn = EXAMPLE.COM
 .amazon.com = EXAMPLE.COM
```
