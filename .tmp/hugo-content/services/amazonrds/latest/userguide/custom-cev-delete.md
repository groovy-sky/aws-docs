# Deleting a CEV

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

You can delete a CEV using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. Typically, deletion takes a few minutes.

To delete a CEV, it can't be in use by any of the following:

- An RDS Custom DB instance

- A snapshot of an RDS Custom DB instance

- An automated backup of your RDS Custom DB instance

###### To delete a CEV

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Custom engine versions**.

3. Choose a CEV whose description or status you want to delete.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Delete**.

The **Delete `cev_name`?** dialog box appears.

5. Enter `delete me`, and then choose **Delete**.

In the **Custom engine versions** page, the banner shows that your CEV is being deleted.

To delete a CEV by using the AWS CLI, run the [delete-custom-db-engine-version](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-custom-db-engine-version.md) command.

The following options are required:

- `--engine engine-type`, where
`engine-type` is `custom-oracle-ee`,
`custom-oracle-se2`, `custom-oracle-ee-cdb`, or
`custom-oracle-se2-cdb`

- `--engine-version cev`, where `cev` is the name of the custom
engine version to be deleted

The following example deletes a CEV named `19.my_cev1`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-custom-db-engine-version \
    --engine custom-oracle-ee \
    --engine-version 19.my_cev1
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-custom-db-engine-version ^
    --engine custom-oracle-ee ^
    --engine-version 19.my_cev1
```
