# Supported Regions and DB engines for cross-Region read replicas in Amazon RDS

By using cross-Region read replicas in Amazon RDS, you can create a MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle,
PostgreSQL, or SQL Server read replica in a different Region from the source DB instance. For
more information about cross-Region read replicas, including source and destination Region
considerations, see [Creating a read replica in a different AWS Region](user-readrepl-xrgn.md).

Cross-Region read replicas are not available for the following engines:

- RDS for Db2
