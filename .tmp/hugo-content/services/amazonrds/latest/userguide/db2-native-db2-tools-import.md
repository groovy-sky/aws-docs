# Importing data from a client machine to Amazon RDS for Db2 with the IMPORT command

You can use the `IMPORT` command from a client machine to import your data into
the Amazon RDS for Db2 server.

###### Important

The `IMPORT` command method is useful for migrating small tables and tables
that include large objects (LOBs). The `IMPORT` command is slower than the
`LOAD` utility because of the `INSERT` and `DELETE`
logging operations. If your network bandwidth between the client machine and RDS for Db2 is
limited, we recommend that you use a different migration approach. For more information,
see [Using native Db2 tools to migrate data from Db2 to Amazon RDS for Db2](db2-native-db2-tools.md).

###### To import data into the RDS for Db2 server

1. Log in to your client machine with IBM Db2 Data Management Console. For more information, see [Connecting to your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance with IBM Db2 Data Management Console](db2-connecting-with-ibm-data-management-console.md).

2. Catalog the RDS for Db2 database on the client machine.
1. Catalog the node. In the following example, replace
       `dns_ip_address` and
       `port` with the DNS name or the IP address and
       the port number of the self-managed Db2 database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog tcpip node srcnode REMOTE dns_ip_address server port
      ```

2. Catalog the database. In the following example, replace
       `source_database_name` and
       `source_database_alias` with the name of the
       self-managed Db2 database and the alias that you want to use for this
       database.

      ```nohighlight

      db2 catalog database source_database_name as source_database_alias at node srcnode \
          authentication server_encrypt
      ```
3. Attach to the source database. In the following example, replace
    `source_database_alias`,
    `user_id`, and `user_password`
    with the alias you created in the previous step and the user ID and password for the
    self-managed Db2 database.

```nohighlight

db2look -d source_database_alias -i user_id -w user_password -e -l -a -f -wlm \
       -cor -createdb -printdbcfg -o db2look.sql
```

4. Generate the data file by using the ` EXPORT` command on your
    self-managed Db2 system. In the following example, replace
    `directory` with the directory on your client machine
    where your data file exists. Replace `file_name` and
    `table_name` with the name of the data file and the
    name of the table.

```nohighlight

db2 "export to /directory/file_name.txt of del lobs to /directory/lobs/ \
       modified by coldel\| select * from table_name"
```

5. Connect to your RDS for Db2 database using the master username and master password
    for your RDS for Db2 DB instance. In the following example, replace
    `rds_database_alias`,
    `master_username,` and
    `master_password` with your own information.

```nohighlight

db2 connect to rds_database_alias user master_username using master_password
```

6. Use the `IMPORT` command to import data from a file on the client
    machine into the remote RDS for Db2 database. For more information, see [IMPORT command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=commands-import) in the IBM Db2 documentation. In the
    following example, replace `directory` and
    `file_name` with the directory on your client machine
    where your data file exists and the name of the data file. Replace
    `SCHEMA_NAME` and `TABLE_NAME`
    with the name of your schema and table.

```nohighlight

db2 "IMPORT from /directory/file_name.tbl OF DEL LOBS FROM /directory/lobs/ \
       modified by coldel\| replace into SCHEMA_NAME.TABLE_NAME"
```

7. Terminate your connection.

```nohighlight

db2 terminate
```
