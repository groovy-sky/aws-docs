# Enabling GTID-based replication for new read replicas for RDS for MySQL

When GTID-based replication is enabled for an RDS for MySQL DB instance, GTID-based
replication is configured automatically for read replicas of the DB instance.

###### To enable GTID-based replication for new read replicas

1. Make sure that the parameter group associated with the DB instance has the
    following parameter settings:

- `gtid_mode` – `ON` or `ON_PERMISSIVE`

- `enforce_gtid_consistency` – `ON`

For more information about setting configuration parameters using parameter groups, see
[Parameter groups for Amazon RDS](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

2. If you changed the parameter group of the DB instance, reboot the DB
    instance. For more information on how to do so, see [Rebooting a DB instance](user-rebootinstance.md).

3. Create one or more read replicas of the DB instance. For more information on
    how to do so, see [Creating a read replica](user-readrepl-create.md).

Amazon RDS attempts to establish GTID-based replication between the MySQL DB instance and
the read replicas using the `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION`. If the attempt fails,
Amazon RDS uses log file positions for replication with the read replicas. For more
information about the `MASTER_AUTO_POSITION`, see [GTID auto-positioning](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-gtids-auto-positioning.html) in the MySQL documentation.
