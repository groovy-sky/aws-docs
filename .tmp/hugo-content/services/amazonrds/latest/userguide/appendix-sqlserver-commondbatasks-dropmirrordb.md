# Dropping a database in an Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server DB instance

You can drop a database on an Amazon RDS DB instance running Microsoft SQL Server in a Single-AZ
or Multi-AZ deployment. To drop the database, use the following command:

```sql

--replace your-database-name with the name of the database you want to drop
EXECUTE msdb.dbo.rds_drop_database  N'your-database-name'
```

###### Note

Use straight single quotes in the command. Smart quotes will cause an error.

After you use this procedure to drop the database, Amazon RDS drops all existing
connections to the database and removes the database's backup history.

To grant backup and restore allowance to other users, follow this procedure:

```sql

USE master
GO
CREATE LOGIN user1 WITH PASSWORD=N'changeThis', DEFAULT_DATABASE=master, CHECK_EXPIRATION=OFF, CHECK_POLICY=OFF
GO
USE msdb
GO
CREATE USER user1 FOR LOGIN user1
GO
use msdb
GO
GRANT EXECUTE ON msdb.dbo.rds_backup_database TO user1
GO
GRANT EXECUTE ON msdb.dbo.rds_restore_database TO user1
GO
```
