# PostgreSQL replication methods for blue/green deployments

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL primarily uses physical replication for blue/green deployments. However,
if you request a major version upgrade when you create the blue/green deployment, and your
source DB instance runs one of the PostgreSQL versions listed in the table below, Amazon RDS uses logical
replication instead.

The following table outlines when Amazon RDS uses physical versus logical replication for
PostgreSQL blue/green deployments.

Source PostgreSQL DB instance versionUpgrade action in blue/green deploymentReplication method

- 16.1 and all higher major and minor versions

- 15.4 and higher 15 versions

- 14.9 and higher 14 versions

- 13.12 and higher 13 versions

- 12.16 and higher 12 versions

- 11.21 and higher 11 versions

Major version upgrade

(green instance on higher major engine version than
blue)

Logical replicationAll supported versionsMinor version upgrade, or no upgrade

(green instance on same major engine
version as blue)

Physical replication

###### Note

Major version upgrades are not supported for blue/green deployments with source
RDS for PostgreSQL versions 15.3 and lower, 14.8 and lower, 13.11 and lower, 12.15 and lower, or
11.20 and lower.

For information about the limitations of blue/green deployments that use physical and
logical replication, see the following sections:

- [RDS for PostgreSQL limitations for blue/green deployments with logical replication](blue-green-deployments-considerations.md#blue-green-deployments-limitations-postgres-logical)
