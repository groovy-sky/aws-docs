# Connecting from the MySQL command-line client (unencrypted)

###### Important

Only use an unencrypted MySQL connection when the client and server are in the same
VPC and the network is trusted. For information about using encrypted connections, see
[Connecting to your MySQL DB instance on Amazon RDS with SSL/TLS from the MySQL command-line client (encrypted)](user-connecttoinstancessl-cli.md).

To connect to a DB instance using the MySQL command-line client, enter the following command at the
command prompt. For the -h parameter,
substitute the DNS name (endpoint) for your DB instance. For the -P parameter,
substitute the port for your DB instance. For the -u parameter, substitute the user name
of a valid database user, such as the master user. Enter the master user password when
prompted.

```nohighlight

mysql -h mysql–instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u mymasteruser -p
```

After you enter the password for the user, you should see output similar to the
following.

```

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 9738
Server version: 8.0.28 Source distribution
