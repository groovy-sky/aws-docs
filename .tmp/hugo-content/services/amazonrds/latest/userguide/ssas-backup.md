# Backing up an SSAS database

You can create SSAS database backup files only in the `D:\S3` folder on the DB
instance. To move the backup files to your S3 bucket, use Amazon S3.

You can back up an SSAS database as follows:

- A domain user with the `admin` role for a particular database can use SSMS to
back up the database to the `D:\S3` folder.

For more information, see [Adding a domain user as a database administrator](ssas-use.md#SSAS.Admin).

- You can use the following stored procedure. This stored procedure doesn't support
encryption.

```nohighlight

exec msdb.dbo.rds_msbi_task
@task_type='SSAS_BACKUP_DB',
@database_name='myssasdb',
@file_path='D:\S3\ssas_db_backup.abf',
[@ssas_apply_compression=1],
[@ssas_overwrite_file=1];
```

The following parameters are required:

- `@task_type` – The type of the MSBI task, in this case `SSAS_BACKUP_DB`.

- `@database_name` – The name of the SSAS database that you're backing up.

- `@file_path` – The path for the SSAS backup file. The `.abf` extension is required.

The following parameters are optional:

- `@ssas_apply_compression` – Whether to apply SSAS backup compression. Valid values are 1 (Yes) and 0 (No).

- `@ssas_overwrite_file` – Whether to overwrite the SSAS backup file. Valid values are 1 (Yes) and 0 (No).
