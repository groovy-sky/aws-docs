# Monitoring events, logs, and streams in an Amazon RDS DB instance

When you monitor your Amazon RDS
databases and your other AWS solutions, your goal is to maintain the following:

- Reliability

- Availability

- Performance

- Security

[Monitoring metrics in an Amazon RDS instance](chap-monitoring.md) explains how to
monitor your instance  using
metrics. A complete solution must also monitor database events, log files, and activity streams. AWS provides you
with the following monitoring tools:

- _Amazon EventBridge_ is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy
to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. EventBridge delivers a
stream of real-time data from your own applications, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
applications, and AWS services. EventBridge routes that data to targets such as
AWS Lambda. This way, you can monitor events that happen in services and build
event-driven architectures. For more information, see the [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide.md).

- _Amazon CloudWatch Logs_ provides a way to monitor, store, and access your
log files from Amazon RDS instances, AWS CloudTrail, and other sources.
Amazon CloudWatch Logs can monitor information in the log files and notify you when certain
thresholds are met. You can also archive your log data in highly durable storage.
For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs.md).

- _AWS CloudTrail_ captures API calls and related events made by or on
behalf of your AWS account. CloudTrail delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket
that you specify. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source
IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred. For more
information, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md).

- _Database Activity Streams_ is an Amazon RDS  feature that
provides a near real-time stream of the activity in your DB instance. Amazon RDS pushes activities to an Amazon Kinesis data stream. The Kinesis stream is
created automatically. From Kinesis, you can configure AWS services such as Amazon Data Firehose
and AWS Lambda to consume the stream and store the data.
