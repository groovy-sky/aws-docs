# databaseActivityEventList JSON array for database activity streams

The audit log payload is an encrypted `databaseActivityEventList` JSON array. The following table lists alphabetically the
fields for each activity event in the decrypted `DatabaseActivityEventList` array of an audit log.

When unified auditing is enabled in Oracle Database, the audit records are populated in
this new audit trail. The `UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` view displays audit records in tabular form by
retrieving the audit records from the audit trail. When you start a database activity stream, a column in
`UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL` maps to a field in the `databaseActivityEventList` array.

###### Important

The event structure is subject to change. Amazon RDS might add new fields to activity events in the future. In applications
that parse the JSON data, make sure that your code can ignore or take appropriate actions for unknown field
names.
