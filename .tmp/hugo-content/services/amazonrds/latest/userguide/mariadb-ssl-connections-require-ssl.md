# Requiring SSL/TLS for all connections to a MariaDB DB instance on Amazon RDS

Use the `require_secure_transport` parameter to require that all user
connections to your MariaDB DB instance use SSL/TLS. For versions 11.4 and earlier, the
`require_secure_transport` parameter is set to `OFF` by default. For 11.8 and later versions,
the default value is set to `ON`, enforcing SSL/TLS for connections to your DB instance. You can
change the `require_secure_transport` parameter to `OFF` if non-secure connections are needed.

###### Note

The `require_secure_transport` parameter is only supported for MariaDB
version 10.5 and higher.

You can set the `require_secure_transport` parameter value by updating the
DB parameter group for your DB instance. You don't need to reboot your DB instance for
the change to take effect.

When the `require_secure_transport` parameter is set to `ON` for
a DB instance, a database client can connect to it if it can establish an encrypted
connection. Otherwise, an error message similar to the following is returned to the
client:

```bash

ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'USER'@'localhost' (using password: YES | NO)
```
