# Deleting a CEV for RDS Custom for SQL Server

You can delete a CEV using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. Typically, this task takes a few
minutes.

Before deleting a CEV, make sure it isn't being used by any of the following:

- An RDS Custom DB instance

- A snapshot of an RDS Custom DB instance

- An automated backup of your RDS Custom DB instance

###### To delete a CEV

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Custom engine versions**.

3. Choose a CEV whose description or status you want to delete.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Delete**.

The **Delete `cev_name`?** dialog box appears.

5. Enter `delete me`, and then choose **Delete**.

In the **Custom engine versions** page, the banner shows that your CEV is being deleted.

To delete a CEV by using the AWS CLI, run the [delete-custom-db-engine-version](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-custom-db-engine-version.md) command.

The following options are required:

- `--engine custom-sqlserver-ee`

- `--engine-version cev`, where `cev` is the name of the custom
engine version to be deleted

The following example deletes a CEV named `15.00.4249.2.my_cevtest`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-custom-db-engine-version \
    --engine custom-sqlserver-ee \
    --engine-version 15.00.4249.2.my_cevtest
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds delete-custom-db-engine-version ^
    --engine custom-sqlserver-ee ^
    --engine-version 15.00.4249.2.my_cevtest
```
