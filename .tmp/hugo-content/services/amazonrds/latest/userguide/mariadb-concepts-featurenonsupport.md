To deliver a managed service experience, Amazon RDS doesn't provide shell access to DB
instances, and it restricts access to certain system procedures and tables that
require advanced privileges. Amazon RDS supports access to databases on a DB instance
using any standard SQL client application. Amazon RDS doesn't allow direct host access to
a DB instance by using Telnet, Secure Shell (SSH), or Windows Remote Desktop
Connection.
