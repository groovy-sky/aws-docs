# Downtime during the time zone file update

When RDS updates your time zone file, existing data that uses `TIMESTAMP WITH
                TIME ZONE` might change. In this case, your primary consideration is
downtime.

###### Warning

If you add the `TIMEZONE_FILE_AUTOUPGRADE` option, your engine upgrade
might have prolonged downtime. Updating time zone data for a large database might
take hours or even days.

The length of the time zone file update depends on factors such as the
following:

- The amount of `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` data in your
database

- The DB instance configuration

- The DB instance class

- The storage configuration

- The database configuration

- The database parameter settings

Additional downtime can occur when you do the following:

- Add the option to the option group when the DB instance uses an outdated time zone
file

- Upgrade the Oracle database engine when the new engine version contains a new
version of the time zone file

###### Note

During the time zone file update, RDS for Oracle calls `PURGE
                    DBA_RECYCLEBIN`.
