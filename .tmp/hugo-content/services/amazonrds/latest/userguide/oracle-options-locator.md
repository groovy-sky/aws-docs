# Oracle Locator

Amazon RDS supports Oracle Locator through the use of the `LOCATOR` option. Oracle
Locator provides capabilities that are typically required to support internet and wireless
service-based applications and partner-based GIS solutions. Oracle Locator is a limited
subset of Oracle Spatial. For more information, see [Oracle\
Locator](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SPATL/sdo_locator.htm) in the Oracle documentation.

###### Important

If you use Oracle Locator, Amazon RDS automatically updates your DB instance to the latest Oracle PSU
if there are security vulnerabilities with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9+
or other announced security vulnerabilities.

## Supported database releases for Oracle Locator

RDS for Oracle supports Oracle Locator for Oracle Database 19c. Oracle Locator isn't
supported for Oracle Database 21c, but its functionality is available in the Oracle
Spatial option. Formerly, the Spatial option required additional licenses. Oracle
Locator represented a subset of Oracle Spatial features and didn't require additional
licenses. In 2019, Oracle announced that all Oracle Spatial features were included in
the Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition 2 licenses without additional cost.
Consequently, the Oracle Spatial option no longer required additional licensing. For
more information, see [Machine Learning, Spatial and Graph - No License Required!](https://blogs.oracle.com/database/post/machine-learning-spatial-and-graph-no-license-required) in the Oracle
Database Insider blog.

## Prerequisites for Oracle Locator

The following are prerequisites for using Oracle Locator:

- Your DB instance must be of sufficient class. Oracle Locator is not supported for the db.t3.small
DB instance classes. For more information, see
[RDS for Oracle DB instance classes](oracle-concepts-instanceclasses.md).

- Your DB instance must have **Auto Minor Version Upgrade** enabled.
This option enables your DB instance to receive minor DB engine version upgrades automatically when they become
available and is required for any options that install the Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Amazon RDS uses this
option to update your DB instance to the latest Oracle Patch Set Update (PSU) or Release Update (RU). For more information, see
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

## Best practices for Oracle Locator

The following are best practices for using Oracle Locator:

- For maximum security, use the `LOCATOR` option with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
For more information, see [Oracle Secure Sockets Layer](appendix-oracle-options-ssl.md).

- Configure your DB instance
to restrict access to your DB instance.
For more information, see
[Scenarios for accessing a DB instance in a VPC](user-vpc-scenarios.md)
and
[Working with a DB instance in a VPC](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md).

## Adding the Oracle Locator option

The following is the general process for adding the `LOCATOR` option to a DB instance:

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option group.

2. Add the option to the option group.

3. Associate the option group with the DB instance.

If Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is _not_ installed on the DB instance, there is a brief
outage while the `LOCATOR` option is added. There is no outage if Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is
already installed on the DB instance. After you add the option, you don't need to restart your DB instance.
As soon as the option group is active, Oracle Locator is available.

###### Note

During this outage, password verification functions are disabled briefly. You can also expect to see events related
to password verification functions during the outage. Password verification functions are enabled again before the
Oracle DB instance is available.

###### To add the `LOCATOR` option to a DB instance

1. Determine the option group that you want to use. You can create a new option group or use an existing option group.
    If you want to use an existing option group, skip to the next step.
    Otherwise, create a custom DB option group with the following settings:

1. For **Engine**,
       choose the oracle edition for your DB instance.

2. For **Major engine version**,
       choose the version of your DB instance.

For more information,
see [Creating an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create).

2. Add the **LOCATOR** option to the option group.
    For more information about adding options,
    see [Adding an option to an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption).

3. Apply the option group to a new or existing DB instance:

- For a new DB instance, you apply the option group when you launch the instance.
For more information, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md).

- For an existing DB instance, you apply the option group by modifying the instance and attaching the new option group.
For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

## Using Oracle Locator

After you enable the Oracle Locator option,
you can begin using it.
You should only use Oracle Locator features.
Don't use any Oracle Spatial features unless you have a license for Oracle Spatial.

For a list of features that are supported for Oracle Locator,
see
[Features Included with Locator](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SPATL/sdo_locator.htm)
in the Oracle documentation.

For a list of features that are not supported for Oracle Locator,
see
[Features Not Included with Locator](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SPATL/sdo_locator.htm)
in the Oracle documentation.

## Removing the Oracle Locator option

After you drop all objects that use data types provided by the `LOCATOR` option, you can remove the
option from a DB instance. If Oracle Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is _not_ installed on the DB
instance, there is a brief outage while the `LOCATOR` option is removed. There is no outage if Oracle
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is already installed on the DB instance. After you remove the `LOCATOR`
option, you don't need to restart your DB instance.

###### To drop the `LOCATOR` option

1. Back up your data.

###### Warning

If the instance uses data types that were enabled as part of the option, and if you remove the
`LOCATOR` option, you can lose data. For more information, see [Backing up, restoring, and exporting data](chap-commontasks-backuprestore.md).

2. Check whether any existing objects reference data types or features of the `LOCATOR` option.

If `LOCATOR` options exist, the instance can get stuck when applying the new option group
    that doesn't have the `LOCATOR` option. You can identify the objects by using the following
    queries:

```

SELECT OWNER, SEGMENT_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME, BYTES/1024/1024 mbytes
FROM   DBA_SEGMENTS
WHERE  SEGMENT_TYPE LIKE '%TABLE%'
AND    (OWNER, SEGMENT_NAME) IN
          (SELECT DISTINCT OWNER, TABLE_NAME
           FROM   DBA_TAB_COLUMNS
           WHERE  DATA_TYPE='SDO_GEOMETRY'
           AND    OWNER <> 'MDSYS')
ORDER BY 1,2,3,4;

SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME
FROM   DBA_TAB_COLUMNS
WHERE  DATA_TYPE = 'SDO_GEOMETRY'
AND    OWNER <> 'MDSYS'
ORDER BY 1,2,3;
```

3. Drop any objects that reference data types or features of the `LOCATOR` option.

4. Do one of the following:

- Remove the `LOCATOR` option from the option group it belongs to. This change affects
all DB instances that use the option group. For more information, see [Removing an option from an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption).

- Modify the DB instance and specify a different option group that doesn't include the
`LOCATOR` option. This change affects a single DB instance. You can specify the
default (empty) option group, or a different custom option group. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).
