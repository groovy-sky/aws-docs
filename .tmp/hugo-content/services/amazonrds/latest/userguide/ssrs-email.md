# Using SSRS Email to send reports

SSRS includes the SSRS Email extension, which you can use to send reports to
users.

To configure SSRS Email, use the `SSRS` option settings. For more
information, see [Adding the SSRS option to your option group](ssrs-enabling.md#SSRS.Add).

After configuring SSRS Email, you can subscribe to reports on the report server. For more information, see [Email\
delivery in Reporting Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/subscriptions/e-mail-delivery-in-reporting-services) in the Microsoft documentation.

Integration with AWS Secrets Manager is required for SSRS Email to function on RDS. To integrate with Secrets Manager, you create a secret.

###### Note

If you change the secret later, you also have to update the `SSRS` option in the option group.

###### To create a secret for SSRS Email

1. Follow the steps in [Create a\
    secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create-secret.md) in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.
1. For **Select secret type**, choose **Other type of secrets**.

2. For **Key/value pairs**, enter the following:

- `SMTP_USERNAME` – Enter a user with permission to send mail from the SMTP
server.

- `SMTP_PASSWORD` – Enter a password for the SMTP user.

3. For **Encryption key**, don't use the default AWS KMS key. Use your own existing key,
       or create a new one.

      The KMS key policy must allow the `kms:Decrypt` action, for example:

      ```

      {
          "Sid": "Allow use of the key",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
              "Service": [
                  "rds.amazonaws.com"
              ]
          },
          "Action": [
              "kms:Decrypt"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      }
      ```
2. Follow the steps in [Attach a permissions policy to a\
    secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-resource-policies.md) in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_. The permissions policy gives the
    `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` action to the `rds.amazonaws.com` service principal.

We recommend that you use the `aws:sourceAccount` and `aws:sourceArn` conditions in the policy
    to avoid the _confused deputy_ problem. Use your AWS account for `aws:sourceAccount` and
    the option group ARN for `aws:sourceArn`. For more information, see [Preventing cross-service confused deputy problems](cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention.md).

The following example shows a permissions policy.

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement" : [ {
       "Effect" : "Allow",
       "Principal" : {
         "Service" : "rds.amazonaws.com"
       },
       "Action" : "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
       "Resource" : "*",
       "Condition" : {
         "StringEquals" : {
           "aws:sourceAccount" : "123456789012"
         },
         "ArnLike" : {
           "aws:sourceArn" : "arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:og:ssrs-se-2017"
         }
       }
     } ]
}

```

_Guide_.
