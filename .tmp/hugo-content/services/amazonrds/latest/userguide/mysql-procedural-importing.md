# Restoring a backup into an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance

Amazon RDS supports importing MySQL databases with backup files. You can create a backup of
your database, store the backup file on Amazon S3, and then restore the backup file to a new
Amazon RDS DB instance running MySQL. Amazon RDS supports importing backup files from Amazon S3 in all
AWS Regions.

The scenario described in this section restores a backup of an on-premises database. As
long as the database is accessible, you can use this technique for databases in other
locations, such as Amazon EC2 or other cloud services.

The following diagram shows the supported scenario.

![MySQL importing backup files from S3.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/MySQL-bak-file.png)

If your on-premises database can be offline while you create, copy, and restore backup
files, then we recommend that you use backup files to import your database to Amazon RDS. If your
database can't be offline, then you can use one of the following methods:

- **Binary logs** – First, import backup files
from Amazon S3 and to Amazon RDS, as explained in this topic. Then use binary log (binlog)
replication to update your database. For more information, see [Configuring binary log file position replication with an external source instance](mysql-procedural-importing-external-repl.md).

- **AWS Database Migration Service** – Use AWS Database Migration Service to migrate your
database to Amazon RDS. For more information, see [What is AWS Database Migration Service?](../../../dms/latest/userguide/welcome.md)

## Overview of setup to import backup files from Amazon S3 to Amazon RDS

To import backup files from Amazon S3 to Amazon RDS, you need the following components:

- An Amazon S3 bucket to store your backup files.

If you already have an Amazon S3 bucket, you can use that bucket. If you don't have
an Amazon S3 bucket, create a new one. For more information, see [Creating a bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/creatingabucket.md).

- A backup of your on-premises database created by Percona XtraBackup.

For more information, see [Creating your database backup](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.Backup).

- An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to allow Amazon RDS to access the S3 bucket.

If you already have an IAM role, you can use that role and attach trust and
permissions policies to it. For more information, see [Creating an IAM role manually](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.Enabling.IAM).

If you don't have an IAM role, you have two options:

- You can manually create a new IAM role. For more information, see
[Creating an IAM role manually](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.Enabling.IAM).

- You can choose for Amazon RDS to create a new IAM role for you. If you
want Amazon RDS to create a new IAM role for you, follow the procedure that
uses the AWS Management Console in [Importing data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.PerformingImport)
section.

## Creating your database backup

Use the Percona XtraBackup software to create your backup. We recommend that you use
the latest version of Percona XtraBackup. You can install Percona XtraBackup from [Software Downloads](https://www.percona.com/downloads) on the Percona
website.

###### Warning

When creating a database backup, XtraBackup might save credentials in the
xtrabackup\_info file. Make sure to confirm that the `tool_command`
setting in the xtrabackup\_info file doesn't contain any sensitive
information.

The Percona XtraBackup version that you use depends on the MySQL version that you are
backing up.

- **MySQL 8.4** – Use Percona XtraBackup
version 8.4.

- **MySQL 8.0** – Use Percona XtraBackup
version 8.0.

###### Note

Percona XtraBackup 8.0.12 and higher versions support migration of all
versions of MySQL 8.0. If you are migrating to RDS for MySQL 8.0.32 or higher,
you must use Percona XtraBackup 8.0.12 or higher.

- **MySQL 5.7** – Use Percona XtraBackup
version 2.4.

You can use Percona XtraBackup to create a full backup of your MySQL database files.
Alternatively, if you already use Percona XtraBackup to back up your MySQL database
files, you can upload your existing full and incremental backup directories and files.

For more information about backing up your database with Percona XtraBackup, see
[Percona XtraBackup - Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/LATEST/index.html) on the Percona website.

### Creating a full backup with Percona XtraBackup

To create a full backup of your MySQL database files that Amazon RDS can restore from
Amazon S3, use the Percona XtraBackup utility ( `xtrabackup`).

For example, the following command creates a backup of a MySQL database
and stores the files in the folder `/on-premises/s3-restore/backup` folder.

```nohighlight

xtrabackup --backup --user=myuser --password=password --target-dir=/on-premises/s3-restore/backup
```

If you want to compress your backup into a single file—which you can split
into multiple files later, if needed—you can save your backup in one of the
following formats based on your MySQL version:

- **Gzip (.gz)** – For MySQL 5.7 and lower versions

- **tar (.tar)** – For MySQL 5.7 and lower versions

- **Percona xbstream (.xbstream)**– For all MySQL
versions

###### Note

Percona XtraBackup 8.0 and higher only supports Percona xbstream for
compression.

**MySQL 5.7 and lower versions**

The following command creates a backup of your MySQL database split into multiple
Gzip files. Replace values with your own information.

```nohighlight

xtrabackup --backup --user=my_user --password=password --stream=tar \
   --target-dir=/on-premises/s3-restore/backup | gzip - | split -d --bytes=500MB \
   - /on-premises/s3-restore/backup/backup.tar.gz
```

**MySQL 5.7 and lower versions**

The following command creates a backup of your MySQL database split into multiple
tar files. Replace values with your own information.

```nohighlight

xtrabackup --backup --user=my_user --password=password --stream=tar \
   --target-dir=/on-premises/s3-restore/backup | split -d --bytes=500MB \
   - /on-premises/s3-restore/backup/backup.tar
```

**All MySQL versions**

The following command creates a backup of your MySQL database split into multiple
xbstream files. Replace values with your own information.

```nohighlight

xtrabackup --backup --user=myuser --password=password --stream=xbstream \
   --target-dir=/on-premises/s3-restore/backup | split -d --bytes=500MB \
   - /on-premises/s3-restore/backup/backup.xbstream
```

###### Note

If you see the following error, it might be because you mixed file formats in
your command:

```

ERROR:/bin/tar: This does not look like a tar archive
```

### Using incremental backups with Percona XtraBackup

If you already use Percona XtraBackup to perform full and incremental backups of
your MySQL database files, you don't need to create a full backup and upload the
backup files to Amazon S3. Instead, to save time, copy your existing backup directories
and files to your Amazon S3 bucket. For more information about creating incremental
backups using Percona XtraBackup, see [Create an incremental backup](https://docs.percona.com/percona-xtrabackup/LATEST/create-incremental-backup.html) on the Percona website.

When copying your existing full and incremental backup files to an Amazon S3 bucket,
you must recursively copy the contents of the base directory. Those contents include
both the full backup and all incremental backup directories and files. This copy
must preserve the directory structure in the Amazon S3 bucket. Amazon RDS iterates through all
files and directories. Amazon RDS uses the `xtrabackup-checkpoints`
file that is included with each incremental backup to identify the base directory
and to order incremental backups by log sequence number (LSN) range.

### Backup considerations for Percona XtraBackup

Amazon RDS consumes your backup files based on the file name. Name your backup files
with the appropriate file extension based on the file format. For example, use
`.xbstream` for files stored using the Percona xbstream format.

Amazon RDS consumes your backup files in alphabetical order and also in natural number
order. To ensure that your backup files are written and named in the proper order,
use the `split` option when you issue the `xtrabackup`
command.

Amazon RDS doesn't support partial backups created using Percona XtraBackup. You
can't use the following options to create a partial backup when you back up the
source files for your database:

- `--tables`

- `--tables-exclude`

- `--tables-file`

- `--databases`

- `--databases-exclude`

- `--databases-file`

## Creating an IAM role manually

If you don't have an IAM role, you can create a new one manually. However, if you
restore the database by using the AWS Management Console, we recommend that you choose to have Amazon RDS
create this new IAM role for you. For Amazon RDS to create this role for you, follow the
procedure in the [Importing data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.PerformingImport) section.

To create a new IAM role manually for importing your database from Amazon S3, create a
role to delegate permissions from Amazon RDS to your Amazon S3 bucket. When you create an IAM
role, you attach trust and permissions policies. To import your backup files from Amazon S3,
use trust and permissions policies similar to the following examples. For more
information about creating the role, see [Creating a role to delegate\
permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md).

The trust and permissions policies require that you provide
an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
For more information about ARN formatting, see
[Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS service namespaces](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.md).

###### Example trust policy for importing from Amazon S3

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AssumeRoleForBackup",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

```

###### Example permissions policy for importing from Amazon S3 — IAM user permissions

In the following example, replace `iam_user_id` with your own value.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowS3AccessRole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/S3Access"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Example permissions policy for importing from Amazon S3 — role permissions

In the following example, replace `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`
and `prefix` with your own values.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":
    [
        {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action":
            [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
        },
        {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action":
            [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix*"
        },
        {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action":
            [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/key_id*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Note

If you include a file name prefix, include the asterisk (\*) after the prefix.
If you don't want to specify a prefix, specify only an asterisk.

## Importing data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance

You can import data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API.

###### To import data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the upper-right corner of the Amazon RDS console, choose the AWS Region where
     you want to create your DB instance. Choose the same AWS Region as the
     Amazon S3 bucket that contains your database backup.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

04. Choose **Restore from S3**.

    The **Create database by restoring from S3** page appears.

    ![The Create database by restoring from S3 page where you specify the details for restoring a DB instance from S3.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/mys-s3-ingestion.png)

05. Under **S3 source**:
    1. Choose the **S3 bucket** that contains the backup.

    2. (Optional) For **S3 prefix**, enter the file
        path prefix for the files stored in your Amazon S3 bucket.

       If you don't specify a prefix, then Amazon RDS creates your DB
        instance using all of the files and folders in the root folder
        of the S3 bucket. If you do specify a prefix, then Amazon RDS creates
        your DB instance using the files and folders in the S3 bucket
        where the path for the file begins with the specified
        prefix.

       For example, you store your backup files on S3 in a subfolder
        named backups, and you have multiple sets of backup files, each
        in its own directory (gzip\_backup1, gzip\_backup2, and so on). In
        this case, to restore from the files in the gzip\_backup1 folder,
        you specify the prefix backups/gzip\_backup1.
06. Under **Engine options**:
    1. For **Engine type**, choose **MySQL**.

    2. For **Source engine version**, choose the MySQL major version of your source database.

    3. For **Engine Version**, choose the default minor
        version of your MySQL major version in your AWS Region.

       In the AWS Management Console, only the default minor version is available. After
        you complete the import, you can upgrade your DB
        instance.
07. For **IAM role**, create or choose IAM role with
     the required trust policy and permissions policy that allows Amazon RDS to
     access your Amazon S3 bucket. Perform one of the following actions:

- (Recommended) Choose **Create a new role**, and enter the **IAM role**
**name**. With this option, Amazon RDS automatically
creates the role with the trust policy and permissions policy
for you.

- Choose an existing IAM role. Make sure that this role meets
all of the criteria in [Creating an IAM role manually](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.Enabling.IAM).

08. Specify your DB instance information. For information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

    ###### Note

    Be sure to allocate enough storage for your new DB instance so that the
    restore operation can succeed.

    To allow for future growth automatically, under **Additional storage configuration**, choose
    **Enable storage autoscaling**.

09. Choose additional settings as needed.

10. Choose **Create database**.

To import data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance by using the AWS CLI, run the [restore-db-instance-from-s3](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-s3.md) command with the following options. For
information about each setting, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md).

###### Note

Be sure to allocate enough storage for your new DB instance so that the restore
operation can succeed.

To enable storage autoscaling and allow for future growth automatically,
use the `--max-allocated-storage` option.

- `--allocated-storage`

- `--db-instance-identifier`

- `--db-instance-class`

- `--engine`

- `--master-username`

- `--manage-master-user-password`

- `--s3-bucket-name`

- `--s3-ingestion-role-arn`

- `--s3-prefix`

- `--source-engine`

- `--source-engine-version`

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-from-s3 \
    --allocated-storage 250 \
    --db-instance-identifier my_identifier \
    --db-instance-class db.m5.large \
    --engine mysql \
    --master-username admin \
    --manage-master-user-password \
    --s3-bucket-name amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
    --s3-ingestion-role-arn arn:aws:iam::account-number:role/rolename \
    --s3-prefix bucket_prefix \
    --source-engine mysql \
    --source-engine-version 8.0.32 \
    --max-allocated-storage 1000
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds restore-db-instance-from-s3 ^
    --allocated-storage 250 ^
    --db-instance-identifier my_identifier ^
    --db-instance-class db.m5.large ^
    --engine mysql ^
    --master-username admin ^
    --manage-master-user-password ^
    --s3-bucket-name amzn-s3-demo-bucket ^
    --s3-ingestion-role-arn arn:aws:iam::account-number:role/rolename ^
    --s3-prefix bucket_prefix ^
    --source-engine mysql ^
    --source-engine-version 8.0.32 ^
    --max-allocated-storage 1000
```

To import data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance by using the Amazon RDS API, call the [RestoreDBInstanceFromS3](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancefroms3.md) operation.

## Limitations and considerations for importing backup files from Amazon S3 to Amazon RDS

The following limitations and considerations apply to importing backup files from Amazon S3
to an RDS for MySQL DB instance:

- You can only migrate your data to a new DB instance, not to an existing DB
instance.

- You must use Percona XtraBackup to back up your data to Amazon S3. For more
information, see [Creating your database backup](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.Backup).

- The Amazon S3 bucket and the RDS for MySQL DB instance must be in the same
AWS Region.

- You can't restore from the following sources:

- A DB instance snapshot export to Amazon S3. You also can't migrate data
from a DB instance snapshot export to your Amazon S3 bucket.

- An encrypted source database. However, you can encrypt the data being
migrated. You can also leave the data unencrypted during the migration
process.

- A MySQL 5.5 or 5.6 database.

- RDS for MySQL doesn't support Percona Server for MySQL as a source database
because it can contain `compression_dictionary*` tables in the
`mysql schema`.

- RDS for MySQL doesn't support backward migration for either major versions or
minor versions. For example, you can't migrate from MySQL version 8.0 to
RDS for MySQL 5.7, and you can't migrate from MySQL version 8.0.32 to RDS for MySQL
version 8.0.26.

- Amazon RDS doesn't support importing on the db.t2.micro DB instance class from
Amazon S3. However, you can restore to a different DB instance class, and then change
the DB instance class later. For more information about instance classes, see
[Hardware specifications for DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass-summary.md).

- Amazon S3 limits the size of a file uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket to 5 TB. If a backup
file exceeds 5 TB, then you must split the backup file into smaller
files.

- Amazon RDS limits the number of files uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket to 1 million. If
the backup data for your database, including all full and incremental backups,
exceeds 1 million files, use a Gzip (.gz), tar (.tar.gz), or Percona xbstream
(.xbstream) file to store full and incremental backup files in the Amazon S3 bucket.
Percona XtraBackup 8.0 only supports Percona xbstream for compression.

- To provide management services for each DB instance, Amazon RDS creates the
`rdsadmin` user when it creates the DB instance. Because
`rdsamin` is a reserved user in Amazon RDS, the following limitations
apply:

- Amazon RDS doesn't import functions, procedures, views, events, and
triggers with the `'rdsadmin'@'localhost'` definer. For more
information, see [Stored objects with 'rdsamin'@'localhost' as the definer](#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.StoredObjects) and [Master user account privileges](usingwithrds-masteraccounts.md).

- When creating the DB instance, Amazon RDS creates a master user with the
maximum supported privileges. When restoring from backup, Amazon RDS
automatically removes any unsupported privileges assigned to users being
imported.

To identify users that might be affected by this, see [User accounts with unsupported privileges](#MySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.Prechecks.Users). For more
information on supported privileges in RDS for MySQL, see [Role-based privilege model for RDS for MySQL](appendix-mysql-commondbatasks-privilege-model.md).

- Amazon RDS doesn't migrate user-created tables in the `mysql`
schema.

- You must configure the `innodb_data_file_path` parameter with only
one data file that uses the default data file name
`ibdata1:12M:autoextend`. You can migrate databases with two data
files, or with a data file with a different name, using this method.

The following examples are file names that Amazon RDS doesn't allow:

- `innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:50M`

- `ibdata2:50M:autoextend`

- `innodb_data_file_path=ibdata01:50M:autoextend`

- You can't migrate from a source database that has tables defined outside
of the default MySQL data directory.

- The maximum supported size for uncompressed backups using this method is
limited to 64 TiB. For compressed backups, this limit is lower to account for
uncompression space requirements. In such cases, the maximum supported backup
size is `64 TiB - compressed backup size`.

For information about the maximum supported database size that RDS for MySQL
supports, see [General Purpose SSD storage](chap-storage.md#Concepts.Storage.GeneralSSD) and [Provisioned IOPS SSD storage](chap-storage.md#USER_PIOPS).

- Amazon RDS doesn't support the importing of MySQL and other external components and
plugins.

- Amazon RDS doesn't restore everything from your database. We recommend that you
save the database schema and values for the following items from your source
MySQL system database, and then add them to your restored RDS for MySQL DB instance
after it has been created:

- User accounts

- Functions

- Stored procedures

- Time zone information. Time zone information is loaded from the local
operating system of your RDS for MySQL DB instance. For more information,
see [Local time zone for MySQL DB instances](mysql-concepts-localtimezone.md).

### Stored objects with 'rdsamin'@'localhost' as the definer

Amazon RDS doesn't import functions, procedures, views, events, and triggers with
`'rdsadmin'@'localhost'` as the definer.

You can use the following SQL script on your source MySQL database to list the
stored objects that have the unsupported definer.

```

-- This SQL query lists routines with `rdsadmin`@`localhost` as the definer.

SELECT
    ROUTINE_SCHEMA,
    ROUTINE_NAME
FROM
    information_schema.routines
WHERE
    definer = 'rdsadmin@localhost';

-- This SQL query lists triggers with `rdsadmin`@`localhost` as the definer.

SELECT
    TRIGGER_SCHEMA,
    TRIGGER_NAME,
    DEFINER
FROM
    information_schema.triggers
WHERE
    DEFINER = 'rdsadmin@localhost';

-- This SQL query lists events with `rdsadmin`@`localhost` as the definer.

SELECT
    EVENT_SCHEMA,
    EVENT_NAME
FROM
    information_schema.events
WHERE
    DEFINER = 'rdsadmin@localhost';

-- This SQL query lists views with `rdsadmin`@`localhost` as the definer.
SELECT
    TABLE_SCHEMA,
    TABLE_NAME
FROM
    information_schema.views
WHERE
    DEFINER = 'rdsadmin@localhost';
```

### User accounts with unsupported privileges

User accounts with privileges that RDS for MySQL doesn't supported are imported
without the unsupported privileges. For the list of supported privileges, see [Role-based privilege model for RDS for MySQL](appendix-mysql-commondbatasks-privilege-model.md).

You can run the following SQL query on your source database to list the user
accounts that have unsupported privileges.

```

SELECT
    user,
    host
FROM
    mysql.user
WHERE
    Shutdown_priv = 'y'
    OR File_priv = 'y'
    OR Super_priv = 'y'
    OR Create_tablespace_priv = 'y';
```
