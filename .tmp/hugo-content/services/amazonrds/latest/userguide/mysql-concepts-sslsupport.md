# SSL/TLS support for MySQL DB instances on Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS creates an SSL/TLS certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance
when Amazon RDS provisions the instance. These certificates are signed by a certificate
authority. The SSL/TLS certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as the Common Name
(CN) for the SSL/TLS certificate to guard against spoofing attacks.

An SSL/TLS certificate created by Amazon RDS is the trusted root entity
and should work in most cases, but might fail if your application doesn't accept
certificate chains. If your application doesn't accept certificate chains, try using an
intermediate certificate to connect to your AWS Region. For example, you must use an
intermediate certificate to connect to the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions with SSL/TLS.

For information about downloading certificates, see [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance or cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md). For more information about using SSL/TLS with
MySQL, see [Updating applications to connect to MySQL DB instances using new SSL/TLS certificates](ssl-certificate-rotation-mysql.md).

For MySQL version 8.0 and lower, Amazon RDS for MySQL uses OpenSSL for secure connections.
For MySQL version 8.4 and higher, Amazon RDS for MySQL uses AWS-LC. TLS support depends on
the MySQL version. The following table shows the TLS support for MySQL versions.
