# Backing up and restoring an Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

Like Amazon RDS, RDS Custom creates and saves automated backups of your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance during
the backup window of your DB instance. You can also back up your DB instance manually.

The procedure is identical to taking a snapshot of an Amazon RDS DB instance. The first
snapshot of an RDS Custom DB instance contains the data for the full DB instance. Subsequent
snapshots are incremental.

Restore DB snapshots using either the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.
