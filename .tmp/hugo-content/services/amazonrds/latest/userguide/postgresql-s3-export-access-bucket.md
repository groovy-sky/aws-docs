# Setting up access to an Amazon S3 bucket

To export data to Amazon S3, give your PostgreSQL DB
instance
permission to access the Amazon S3 bucket that the files are to go in.

To do this, use the following procedure.

###### To give a PostgreSQL DB instance access to Amazon S3 through an IAM role

1. Create an IAM policy.

This policy provides the bucket and object permissions that allow your PostgreSQL DB
    instance
    to access Amazon S3.

As part of creating this policy, take the following steps:

1. Include in the policy the following required actions to allow the
       transfer of files from your PostgreSQL DB instance to
       an Amazon S3 bucket:

- `s3:PutObject`

- `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`

2. Include the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the Amazon S3 bucket and objects in the bucket. The ARN
       format for accessing Amazon S3 is: `arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*`

For more information on creating an IAM policy for Amazon RDS for
PostgreSQL, see [Creating and using an IAM policy for IAM database access](usingwithrds-iamdbauth-iampolicy.md). See also [Tutorial: Create and\
attach your first customer managed policy](../../../iam/latest/userguide/tutorial-managed-policies.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

The following AWS CLI command creates an IAM policy named
`rds-s3-export-policy` with these options. It grants access to a
bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

###### Warning

We recommend that you set up your database within a private VPC that has
endpoint policies configured for accessing specific buckets. For more
information, see [Using endpoint policies for Amazon S3](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.md#vpc-endpoints-policies-s3) in the
Amazon VPC User Guide.

We strongly recommend that you do not create a policy with all-resource
access. This access can pose a threat for data security. If you create a
policy that gives `S3:PutObject` access to all resources using
`"Resource":"*"`, then a user with export privileges can
export data to all buckets in your account. In addition, the user can export
data to _any publicly writable bucket within your AWS_
_Region_.

After you create the policy, note the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
policy. You need the ARN for a subsequent step when you attach the policy to an
IAM role.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-policy  --policy-name rds-s3-export-policy  --policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "s3export",
         "Action": [
           "s3:PutObject*",
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:GetObject*",
           "s3:DeleteObject*",
           "s3:GetBucketLocation",
           "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }'
```

2. Create an IAM role.

You do this so Amazon RDS can assume this IAM role on your behalf
    to access your Amazon S3 buckets. For more information, see [Creating a role to\
    delegate permissions to an IAM user](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) in the
    _IAM User Guide_.

We recommend using the `aws:SourceArn` and
    `aws:SourceAccount`
    global condition context keys in resource-based policies to limit the service's permissions to a specific
    resource. This is the most effective way to protect against the [confused\
    deputy problem](../../../iam/latest/userguide/confused-deputy.md).

If you use both global condition context keys and the
    `aws:SourceArn` value contains the account ID, the `aws:SourceAccount` value and
    the account in the `aws:SourceArn` value must use the same account ID when used in the
    same policy statement.

- Use `aws:SourceArn` if you want cross-service access for a single resource.

- Use `aws:SourceAccount` if you want to allow any resource in that account to be associated with the cross-service use.

In the policy, be sure to use
the `aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource.
The following example shows how to do so using the AWS CLI command to create a role named
`rds-s3-export-role`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role  \
    --role-name rds-s3-export-role  \
    --assume-role-policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
            "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
          },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
                "aws:SourceAccount": "111122223333",
                "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:111122223333:db:dbname"
                }
             }
       }
     ]
   }'
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws iam create-role  ^
    --role-name rds-s3-export-role  ^
    --assume-role-policy-document '{
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
            "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
          },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
                "aws:SourceAccount": "111122223333",
                "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:111122223333:db:dbname"
                }
             }
       }
     ]
   }'
```

3. Attach the IAM policy that you created to the IAM role that you
    created.

The following AWS CLI command attaches the policy created earlier to the role
    named `rds-s3-export-role.` Replace
    `your-policy-arn` with the policy
    ARN that you noted in an earlier step.

```nohighlight

aws iam attach-role-policy  --policy-arn your-policy-arn  --role-name rds-s3-export-role
```

4. Add the IAM role to the DB instance. You do so by using the AWS Management Console or
    AWS CLI, as described following.

###### To add an IAM role for a PostgreSQL DB instance using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose the PostgreSQL DB
    instance name to display its
    details.

3. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, in the
    **Manage IAM roles** section, choose the role to
    add under **Add IAM roles to this instance**.

4. Under **Feature**, choose
    **s3Export**.

5. Choose **Add role**.

###### To add an IAM role for a PostgreSQL DB instance using the CLI

- Use the following command to add the role to the PostgreSQL DB
instance named `my-db-instance`. Replace
`your-role-arn` with the
role ARN that you noted in a previous step. Use `s3Export`
for the value of the `--feature-name` option.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance \
     --db-instance-identifier my-db-instance \
     --feature-name s3Export \
     --role-arn your-role-arn   \
     --region your-region
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance ^
     --db-instance-identifier my-db-instance ^
     --feature-name s3Export ^
     --role-arn your-role-arn ^
     --region your-region
```
