# RDS for PostgreSQL collations for EBCDIC and other mainframe migrations

RDS for PostgreSQL versions 10 and higher include ICU version 60.2, which is based on
Unicode 10.0 and includes collations from the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository,
CLDR 32. These software internationalization libraries ensure that character
encodings are presented in a consistent way, regardless of operating system or
platform. For more information about Unicode CLDR-32, see the [CLDR 32 Release\
Note](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-32) on the Unicode CLDR website. You can learn more about the
internationalization components for Unicode (ICU) at the [ICU Technical Committee (ICU-TC)](https://icu.unicode.org/home)
website. For information about ICU-60, see [Download ICU 60](https://icu.unicode.org/download/60).

Starting with version 14.3, RDS for PostgreSQL also includes collations that help with
data integration and conversion from EBCDIC-based systems. The extended binary coded
decimal interchange code or _EBCDIC_ encoding is commonly used by
mainframe operating systems. These Amazon RDS-provided collations are narrowly defined to
sort only those Unicode characters that directly map to EBCDIC code pages. The
characters are sorted in EBCDIC code-point order to allow for data validation after
conversion. These collations don't include denormalized forms, nor do they
include Unicode characters that don't directly map to a character on the source
EBCDIC code page.

The character mappings between EBCDIC code pages and Unicode code points are based
on tables published by IBM. The complete set is available from IBM as a [compressed file](http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/java/cdctables.zip) for download. RDS for PostgreSQL used these mappings with
tools provided by the ICU to create the collations listed in the tables in this
section. The collation names include a language and country as required by the ICU.
However, EBCDIC code pages don't specify languages, and some EBCDIC code pages
cover multiple countries. That means that the language and country portion of the
collation names in the table are arbitrary, and they don't need to match the
current locale. In other words, the code page number is the most important part of
the collation name in this table. You can use any of the collations listed in the
following tables in any RDS for PostgreSQL database.

- [Unicode to EBCDIC collations table](#ebcdic-table) – Some
mainframe data migration tools internally use LATIN1 or LATIN9 to encode and
process data. Such tools use round-trip schemes to preserve data integrity
and support reverse conversion. The collations in this table can be used by
tools that process data using LATIN1 encoding, which doesn't require
special handling.

- [Unicode to LATIN9 collations table](#latin9-table) – You can
use these collations in any RDS for PostgreSQL database.

In the following table, you find collations available in RDS for PostgreSQL that map
EBCDIC code pages to Unicode code points. We recommend that you use the collations
in this table for application development that requires sorting based on the
ordering of IBM code pages.

Amazon RDS provides a set of additional collations that sort Unicode code points that
map to LATIN9 characters using the tables published by IBM, in the order of the
original code points according to the EBCDIC code page of the source data.

In the following, you can find an example of using an RDS for PostgreSQL
collation.

```nohighlight

db1=> SELECT pg_import_system_collations('pg_catalog');
 pg_import_system_collations
-----------------------------
                          36
db1=> SELECT '¤' < 'a' col1;
 col1
------
 t
db1=> SELECT '¤' < 'a' COLLATE "da-DK-cp277-x-icu" col1;
 col1
------
 f
```

We recommend that you use the collations in the [Unicode to EBCDIC collations table](#ebcdic-table) and in the [Unicode to LATIN9 collations table](#latin9-table) for application development that requires sorting
based on the ordering of IBM code pages. The following collations (suffixed with the
letter “b”) are also visible in `pg_collation`, but are intended for use
by mainframe data integration and migration tools at AWS that map code pages with
specific code point shifts and require special handling in collation. In other
words, the following collations aren't recommended for use.

- da-DK-277b-x-icu

- da-DK-1142b-x-icu

- de-DE-cp273b-x-icu

- de-DE-cp1141b-x-icu

- en-GB-cp1146b-x-icu

- en-GB-cp285b-x-icu

- en-US-cp037b-x-icu

- en-US-cp1140b-x-icu

- es-ES-cp1145b-x-icu

- es-ES-cp284b-x-icu

- fi-FI-cp1143b-x-icu

- fr-FR-cp1147b-x-icu

- fr-FR-cp297b-x-icu
