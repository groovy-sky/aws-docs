# Modifying a database activity stream for Amazon RDS

You might want to customize your Amazon RDS audit policy when your activity stream is started. If you don't want to lose time and data by
stopping your activity stream, you can change the _audit policy state_ to either of the following settings:

**Locked (default)**

The audit policies in your database are read-only.

**Unlocked**

The audit policies in your database are read/write.

The basic steps are as follows:

1. Modify the audit policy state to unlocked.

2. Customize your audit policy.

3. Modify the audit policy state to locked.

###### To modify the audit policy state of your activity stream

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. For **Actions**, choose **Modify database activity stream**.

The **Modify database activity stream: `name`** window appears, where
    `name` is your RDS instance.

4. Choose either of the following options:

**Locked**

When you lock your audit policy, it becomes read-only. You can't edit your audit policy unless you unlock the policy or stop the
activity stream.

**Unlocked**

When you unlock your audit policy, it becomes read/write. You can edit your audit policy while the activity stream is
started.

5. Choose **Modify DB activity stream**.

The status for the Amazon RDS database shows **Configuring activity**
**stream**.

6. (Optional) Choose the DB instance link. Then choose the **Configuration** tab.

The **Audit policy status** field shows one of the following values:

- **Locked**

- **Unlocked**

- **Locking policy**

- **Unlocking policy**

To modify the activity stream state for the database instance, use the [modify-activity-stream](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-activity-stream.md) AWS CLI command.

OptionRequired?Description

`--resource-arn my-instance-ARN`

Yes

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your RDS database instance.

`--audit-policy-state`

No

The new state of the audit policy for the database activity stream on your instance: `locked` or
`unlocked`.

The following example unlocks the audit policy for the activity stream started on `my-instance-ARN`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-activity-stream \
    --resource-arn my-instance-ARN \
    --audit-policy-state unlocked
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-activity-stream ^
    --resource-arn my-instance-ARN ^
    --audit-policy-state unlocked
```

The following example describes the instance `my-instance`. The partial sample output shows that the audit policy
is unlocked.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier my-instance

{
    "DBInstances": [
        {
            ...
            "Engine": "oracle-ee",
            ...
            "ActivityStreamStatus": "started",
            "ActivityStreamKmsKeyId": "ab12345e-1111-2bc3-12a3-ab1cd12345e",
            "ActivityStreamKinesisStreamName": "aws-rds-das-db-AB1CDEFG23GHIJK4LMNOPQRST",
            "ActivityStreamMode": "async",
            "ActivityStreamEngineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded": true,
            "ActivityStreamPolicyStatus": "unlocked",
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```
