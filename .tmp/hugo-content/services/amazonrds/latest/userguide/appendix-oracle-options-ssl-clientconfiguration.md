# Configuring SQL\*Plus to use SSL with an RDS for Oracle DB instance

Before you can connect to an RDS for Oracle DB instance that uses the Oracle SSL option, you
must configure SQL\*Plus before connecting.

###### Note

To allow access to the DB instance from the appropriate clients, ensure that your security groups are configured correctly. For more information,
see [Controlling access with security groups](overview-rdssecuritygroups.md). Also, these instructions are for SQL\*Plus and other
clients that directly use an Oracle home. For JDBC connections, see [Setting up an SSL connection over JDBC](appendix-oracle-options-ssl-jdbc.md).

###### To configure SQL\*Plus to use SSL to connect to an RDS for Oracle DB instance

1. Set the `ORACLE_HOME` environment variable to the location of
    your Oracle home directory.

The path to your Oracle home directory depends on your installation. The
    following example sets the `ORACLE_HOME` environment
    variable.

```bash

prompt>export ORACLE_HOME=/home/user/app/user/product/19.0.0/dbhome_1
```

For information about setting Oracle environment variables, see [SQL\*Plus environment variables](http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQPUG/ch_two.htm) in the Oracle documentation, and
    also see the Oracle installation guide for your operating system.

2. Append `$ORACLE_HOME/lib` to the
    `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

The following is an example that sets the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment
    variable.

```bash

prompt>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib
```

3. Create a directory for the Oracle wallet at
    `$ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet`.

The following is an example that creates the Oracle wallet
    directory.

```bash

prompt>mkdir $ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet
```

4. Download the certificate bundle .pem file that works for all AWS Regions and
    put the file in the ssl\_wallet directory. For information, see [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB instance or cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md).

5. In the `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` directory, modify
    or create the `tnsnames.ora` file and include the following
    entry.

```nohighlight

net_service_name =
     (DESCRIPTION =
       (ADDRESS_LIST =
         (ADDRESS =
           (PROTOCOL = TCPS)
           (HOST = endpoint)
           (PORT = ssl_port_number)
         )
       )
       (CONNECT_DATA =
         (SID = database_name)
       )
       (SECURITY =
         (SSL_SERVER_CERT_DN = "C=US,ST=Washington,L=Seattle,O=Amazon.com,OU=RDS,CN=endpoint")
       )
     )
```

6. In the same directory, modify or create the
    sqlnet.ora file and include the following
    parameters.

###### Note

To communicate with entities over a TLS secured connection, Oracle requires a wallet with the necessary certificates for authentication.
You can use Oracle's ORAPKI utility to create and maintain Oracle wallets, as shown in step 7. For more information, see
[Setting up Oracle wallet using ORAPKI](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E92519_02/pt856pbr3/eng/pt/tsvt/task_SettingUpOracleWalletUsingORAPKI.html) in the Oracle documentation.

```nohighlight

WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY = $ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet)))
SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
SSL_VERSION = 1.0
SSL_CIPHER_SUITES = (SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA)
SSL_SERVER_DN_MATCH = ON
```

###### Note

You can set `SSL_VERSION` to a higher value if your DB instance supports it.

7. Run the following command to create the Oracle wallet.

```bash

prompt>orapki wallet create -wallet $ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet -auto_login_only
```

8. Extract each certificate in the .pem bundle file into a separate .pem file
    using an OS utility.

9. Add each certificate to your wallet using separate `orapki`
    commands, replacing `certificate-pem-file`
    with the absolute file name of the .pem file.

```bash

prompt>orapki wallet add -wallet $ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet -trusted_cert -cert
         certificate-pem-file -auto_login_only
```
