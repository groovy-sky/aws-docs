# Connecting to your DB instance using Oracle SQL developer

In this procedure, you connect to your DB instance by using Oracle SQL Developer. To download a standalone
version of this utility, see the [Oracle SQL developer downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html).

To connect to your DB instance, you need its DNS name and port number. For information about finding the DNS
name and port number for a DB instance, see [Finding the endpoint of your RDS for Oracle DB instance](user-endpoint.md).

###### To connect to a DB instance using SQL developer

1. Start Oracle SQL Developer.

2. On the **Connections** tab, choose the **add (+)** icon.

3. In the **New/Select Database Connection** dialog box, provide the information for your
    DB instance:

- For **Connection Name**, enter a name that describes the connection, such as
`Oracle-RDS`.

- For **Username**, enter the name of the database administrator for the DB
instance.

- For **Password**, enter the password for the database administrator.

- For **Hostname**, enter the DNS name of the DB instance.

- For **Port**, enter the port number.

- For **SID**, enter the DB name. You can find the DB
name on the **Configuration** tab of your database
details page.

The completed dialog box should look similar to the following.

4. Choose **Connect**.

5. You can now start creating your own databases and running queries against your DB instance and
    databases as usual. To run a test query against your DB instance, do the following:
1. In the **Worksheet** tab for your connection, enter the following SQL
       query.

      ```sql

      SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE;
      ```

2. Choose the **execute** icon to run the query.

      SQL Developer returns the database name.
