# Database authentication with Amazon RDS

Amazon RDS
supports several ways to authenticate database users.

Password, Kerberos, and IAM database authentication use different methods of
authenticating to the database. Therefore, a specific user can log in to a database
using only one authentication method.

For PostgreSQL, use only one of the following role settings for a user of a specific
database:

- To use IAM database authentication, assign the `rds_iam` role to
the user.

- To use Kerberos authentication, assign the `rds_ad` role to the
user.

- To use password authentication, don't assign either the
`rds_iam` or `rds_ad` roles to the user.

Don't assign both the `rds_iam` and `rds_ad` roles to a
user of a PostgreSQL database either directly or indirectly by nested grant access. If
the `rds_iam` role is added to the master user, IAM authentication takes
precedence over password authentication so the master user has to log in as an IAM
user.

###### Important

We strongly recommend that you do not use the master user directly in your
applications. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using a database user created
with the minimal privileges required for your application.

## Password authentication

With _password authentication,_ your database
performs all administration of user accounts. You create users with SQL statements
such as `CREATE USER`, with the appropriate clause required by the DB
engine for specifying passwords. For example, in MySQL the statement is `CREATE
                    USER` `name` `IDENTIFIED BY` `password`, while in PostgreSQL, the statement is
`CREATE USER` `name` `WITH PASSWORD` `password`.

With password authentication, your database controls and authenticates user
accounts. If a DB engine has strong password management features, they can enhance
security. Database authentication might be easier to administer using password
authentication when you have small user communities. Because clear text passwords
are generated in this case, integrating with AWS Secrets Manager can enhance security.

For information about using Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS
, see [Creating a basic\
secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage-create-basic-secret.md) and [Rotating\
secrets for supported Amazon RDS databases](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets-rds.md) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_. For information about programmatically
retrieving your secrets in your custom applications, see [Retrieving the secret\
value](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage-retrieve-secret.md) in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

## IAM database authentication

You can authenticate to your DB instance
using AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) database authentication. With this authentication method, you don't
need to use a password when you connect to a DB instance
. Instead, you use
an authentication token.

For more information about IAM database authentication, including information
about availability for specific DB engines, see [IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md)
.

## Kerberos authentication

Amazon RDS supports external authentication of database users using
Kerberos and Microsoft Active Directory. Kerberos is a network authentication
protocol that uses tickets and symmetric-key cryptography to eliminate the need to
transmit passwords over the network. Kerberos has been built into Active Directory
and is designed to authenticate users to network resources, such as
databases.

Amazon RDS support for Kerberos and Active Directory provides the benefits
of single sign-on and centralized authentication of database users. You can keep
your user credentials in Active Directory. Active Directory provides a centralized
place for storing and managing credentials for multiple DB instances
.

To use credentials from your self-managed Active Directory,
you need to setup a trust relationship to the Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory that the
DB instance
is joined to.

RDS for PostgreSQL and RDS for MySQL
support one-way and two-way
forest trust relationships with forest-wide authentication or selective authentication.

In some scenarios, you can configure Kerberos authentication over an external trust relationship.
This requires your self-managed Active Directory to have additional settings. This includes but is not limited to
[Kerberos Forest Search Order](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/kfso-not-work-in-external-trust-event-is-17).

Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL DB instances support
one-way and two-way forest trust relationships. Oracle DB instances support one-way and
two-way external and forest trust relationships. For more information, see [When to create a trust\
relationship](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/setup-trust.md) in the _Directory Service Administration_
_Guide_.

specific DB engine, see the following:

###### Note

Currently, Kerberos authentication isn't supported for MariaDB DB
instances.
