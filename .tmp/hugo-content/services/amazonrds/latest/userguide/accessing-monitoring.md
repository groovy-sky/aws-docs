## Viewing Amazon RDSDB instance status

The status of a DB instance indicates its current operational state. You can use the following procedures to view the DB instance status in the
Amazon RDS console, the AWS CLI command, or the API operation.

###### Note

Amazon RDS also uses another status called _maintenance status_, which is
shown in the **Maintenance** column of the Amazon RDS console. This value
indicates the status of any maintenance patches that need to be applied to a DB
instance. Maintenance status is independent of DB instance status. For more information
about maintenance status, see [Applying updates to a DB instance](user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.OSUpgrades).

Find the possible status values for DB instances in the following table. This table also
shows whether you will be billed for the DB instance and storage, billed only for storage,
or not billed. For all DB instance statuses, you are always billed for backup usage.

DB instance statusBilled Description

**available**

Billed

The DB instance is available for modifications.

**backing-up**

Billed

The DB instance is currently being backed up.

**configuring-enhanced-monitoring**

Billed

Enhanced Monitoring is being enabled or disabled for this
DB instance.

**configuring-iam-database-auth**

Billed

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication is being enabled or disabled
for this DB instance.

**configuring-log-exports**

Billed

Publishing log files to Amazon CloudWatch Logs is being enabled or disabled for
this DB instance.

**converting-to-vpc**

Billed

The DB instance is being converted from a DB instance that is not in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
(Amazon VPC) to a DB instance that is in an Amazon VPC.

**creating**

Not billed (non-PITR)

Billed (PITR only)

The DB instance is being created. The DB instance is inaccessible while it is
being created.

If you restore a database during point-in-time recovery (PITR), you're
billed while the database is in the **creating** state.
This is the only scenario in which the **creating**
state incurs charges.

**delete-precheck**

Not billed

Amazon RDS is validating that read replicas are safe to
delete.

**deleting**

Not billed

The DB instance is being deleted.

**failed**

Not billed

The DB instance has failed and Amazon RDS can't recover it. Perform a
point-in-time restore to the latest restorable time of the DB instance to
recover the data.

**inaccessible-encryption-credentials**

Not billed

The AWS KMS key used to encrypt or decrypt the DB instance can't be
accessed or recovered.

**inaccessible-encryption-credentials-recoverable**

Billed for storage

The KMS key used to encrypt or decrypt the DB instance can't be
accessed. However, if the KMS key is active, restarting the DB
instance can recover it.

For more information, see [Encrypting a DB instance](overview-encryption.md#Overview.Encryption.Enabling).

**incompatible-create**

Not billed

Amazon RDS is attempting to create a DB instance but can't do so because
resources are incompatible with your DB instance. This status can occur if,
for example, the instance profile for your DB instance doesn't have the
correct permissions.

**incompatible-network**

Not billed

Amazon RDS is attempting to perform a recovery action on a DB instance but
can't do so because the VPC is in a state that prevents the action
from being completed. This status can occur if, for example, all
available IP addresses in a subnet are in use and Amazon RDS can't get
an IP address for the DB instance.

**incompatible-option-group**

Billed

Amazon RDS attempted to apply an option group change but can't do so, and
Amazon RDS can't roll back to the previous option group state. For more
information, check the **Recent Events** list for the
DB instance. This status can occur if, for example, the option group contains
an option such as TDE and the DB instance doesn't contain encrypted
information.

**incompatible-parameters**

Billed

Amazon RDS can't start the DB instance because the parameters specified in
the DB instance's DB parameter group aren't compatible with the DB instance.
Revert the parameter changes or make them compatible with the DB instance to
regain access to your DB instance. For more information about the incompatible
parameters, check the **Recent Events** list for the
DB instance.

**incompatible-restore**

Not billed

Amazon RDS can't do a point-in-time restore. Common causes for this
status include using temp tables,
using MyISAM tables with
MySQL, or using Aria tables with
MariaDB.

**insufficient-capacity**

Not billed

Amazon RDS can't create your instance because sufficient capacity isn't
currently available. To create your DB instance in the same AZ with the same
instance type, delete your DB instance, wait a few hours, and try to create
again. Alternatively, create a new instance using a different instance
class or AZ.

**maintenance**

Billed

Amazon RDS is applying a maintenance update to the DB instance. This status is
used for instance-level maintenance that RDS schedules well in advance.

**modifying**

Billed

The DB instance is being modified because of a customer request to modify
the DB instance.

**moving-to-vpc**

Billed

The DB instance is being moved to a new Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

**rebooting**

Billed

The DB instance is being rebooted because of a customer request or an Amazon RDS
process that requires the rebooting of the DB instance.

**resetting-master-credentials**

Billed

The master credentials for the DB instance are being reset because of a
customer request to reset them.

**renaming**

Billed

The DB instance is being renamed because of a customer request to rename it.

**restore-error**

Billed

The DB instance encountered an error attempting to restore to a
point-in-time or from a snapshot.

**starting**

Billed for storage

The DB instance is starting.

**stopped**

Billed for storage

The DB instance is stopped.

**stopping**

Billed for storage

The DB instance is being stopped.

**storage-config-upgrade**

Billed

The storage file system configuration of the DB instance is being upgraded.
This status only applies to green databases within a blue/green
deployment, or to DB instance read replicas.

**storage-full**

Billed

The DB instance has reached its storage capacity allocation. This is a
critical status, and we recommend that you fix this issue immediately.
To do so, scale up your storage by modifying the DB instance. To avoid this
situation, set Amazon CloudWatch alarms to warn you when storage space is getting
low.

**storage-initialization**

Billed

The DB instance is loading data blocks from Amazon S3 to optimize volume
performance after being restored from a snapshot. It remains available
for operations, but performance mights not be at its fullest until
initialization completes.

**storage-optimization**

Billed

Amazon RDS is optimizing the storage of your DB instance. The storage
optimization process is usually short, but can sometimes take up to and
even beyond 24 hours.

During storage optimization, the DB instance remains available. Storage
optimization is a background process that doesn't affect the instance's
availability.

**upgrading**

Billed

The database engine or operating system version is being
upgraded.

**upgrade\_failed**

Not billed

The DB instance has failed to upgrade to a supported version. Aurora creates a final snapshot with the prefix `rds-final`.

###### To view the status of a DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

The **Databases page** appears with the list of DB instances. For each DB instance
    , the status value is displayed.

![View the status of a DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/RDS_instance_status.png)

To view DB instance and its status information by using the AWS CLI, use the [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command. For example, the
following AWS CLI command lists all the DB instances information .

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances
```

To view a specific DB instance and its status, call the [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md) command with the following option:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier` –
The name of the DB instance.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance
```

To view just the status of all the DB instances, use the following query in AWS CLI.

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,DBInstanceStatus]' --output table
```

To view the status of the DB instance using the Amazon RDS API, call the [DescribeDBInstances](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstances.md) operation.
