# Connecting to an RDS for Oracle DB instance using SSL

After you configure SQL\*Plus to use SSL as described previously, you can
connect to the RDS for Oracle DB instance with the SSL option. Optionally, you can
first export the `TNS_ADMIN` value that points to the directory that contains the
tnsnames.ora and sqlnet.ora files. Doing so ensures that SQL\*Plus can find these files consistently.
The following example exports the `TNS_ADMIN` value.

```nohighlight

export TNS_ADMIN=${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin
```

Connect to the DB instance. For example, you can connect
using SQL\*Plus and a `<net_service_name>` in a
tnsnames.ora file.

```nohighlight

sqlplus mydbuser@net_service_name
```

You can also connect to the DB instance using SQL\*Plus without using a
tnsnames.ora file by using the following command.

```nohighlight

sqlplus 'mydbuser@(DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCPS)(HOST = endpoint) (PORT = ssl_port_number))(CONNECT_DATA = (SID = database_name)))'
```

You can also connect to the RDS for Oracle DB instance without using SSL. For example, the
following command connects to the DB instance through the clear text port without
SSL encryption.

```nohighlight

sqlplus 'mydbuser@(DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = endpoint) (PORT = port_number))(CONNECT_DATA = (SID = database_name)))'
```

If you want to close Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port access, create a
security group with no IP address ingresses and add it to the instance. This
addition closes connections over the TCP port, while still allowing connections over
the SSL port that are specified from IP addresses within the range permitted by the
SSL option security group.
