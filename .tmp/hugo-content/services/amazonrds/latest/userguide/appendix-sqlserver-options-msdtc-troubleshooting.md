# Troubleshooting MSDTC for RDS for SQL Server

In some cases, you might have trouble establishing a connection between MSDTC running on a
client computer and the MSDTC service running on an RDS for SQL Server DB instance. If
so, make sure of the following:

- The inbound rules for the security group associated with the DB instance are configured correctly. For more information, see [Can't connect to Amazon RDS DB instance](chap-troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.Connecting).

- Your client computer is configured correctly.

- The MSDTC firewall rules on your client computer are enabled.

###### To configure the client computer

1. Open **Component Services**.

Or, in **Server Manager**, choose
    **Tools**, and then choose **Component**
**Services**.

2. Expand **Component Services**, expand
    **Computers**, expand **My Computer**,
    and then expand **Distributed Transaction**
**Coordinator**.

3. Open the context (right-click) menu for **Local DTC** and choose
    **Properties**.

4. Choose the **Security** tab.

5. Choose all of the following:

- **Network DTC Access**

- **Allow Inbound**

- **Allow Outbound**

6. Make sure that the correct authentication mode is chosen:

- **Mutual Authentication Required** – The
client machine is joined to the same domain as other nodes
participating in distributed transaction, or there is a trust
relationship configured between domains.

- **No Authentication Required** – All other
cases.

7. Choose **OK** to save your changes.

8. If prompted to restart the service, choose
    **Yes**.

###### To enable MSDTC firewall rules

1. Open Windows Firewall, then choose **Advanced settings**.

Or, in **Server Manager**, choose
    **Tools**, and then choose **Windows Firewall**
**with Advanced Security**.

###### Note

Depending on your operating system, Windows Firewall might be called Windows Defender
Firewall.

2. Choose **Inbound Rules** in the left pane.

3. Enable the following firewall rules, if they are not already enabled:

- **Distributed Transaction Coordinator (RPC)**

- **Distributed Transaction Coordinator (RPC)-EPMAP**

- **Distributed Transaction Coordinator (TCP-In)**

4. Close Windows Firewall.
