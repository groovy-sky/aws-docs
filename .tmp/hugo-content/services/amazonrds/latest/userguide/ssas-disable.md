# Turning off SSAS

To turn off SSAS, remove the `SSAS` option from its option group.

###### Important

Before you remove the `SSAS` option, delete your SSAS databases.

We highly recommend that you back up your SSAS databases before deleting them and removing
the `SSAS` option.

###### To remove the SSAS option from its option group

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**.

3. Choose the option group with the `SSAS` option that you want to remove ( `ssas-se-2017` in the previous
    examples).

4. Choose **Delete option**.

5. Under **Deletion options**, choose **SSAS** for
    **Options to delete**.

6. Under **Apply immediately**, choose **Yes** to delete
    the option immediately, or **No** to delete it at
    the next maintenance window.

7. Choose **Delete**.
