# Understanding Domain membership

After you create or modify your DB instance, the instance becomes a member of the
domain. The AWS console indicates the status of the domain membership for the DB
instance. The status of the DB instance can be one of the following:

- **joined** – The instance is a member of the domain.

- **joining** – The instance is in the process of becoming a member of the
domain.

- **pending-join** – The instance membership is pending.

- **pending-maintenance-join** – AWS will attempt to make the instance a member of
the domain during the next scheduled maintenance window.

- **pending-removal** – The removal of the instance from the domain is
pending.

- **pending-maintenance-removal** – AWS will attempt to remove the instance from
the domain during the next scheduled maintenance window.

- **failed** – A configuration problem has prevented the instance from joining the
domain. Check and fix your configuration before reissuing the instance modify command.

- **removing** – The instance is being removed from the domain.

A request to become a member of a domain can fail because of a network connectivity issue or an incorrect IAM role. For example,
you might create a DB instance or modify an existing instance and have the attempt fail for the DB instance to become a
member of a domain. In this case, either reissue the command to create or modify the DB instance or modify the newly created
instance to join the domain.
