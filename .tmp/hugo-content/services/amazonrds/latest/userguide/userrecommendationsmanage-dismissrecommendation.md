# Dismissing Amazon RDS recommendations

You can dismiss one or more Amazon RDS recommendations using the Amazon RDS console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS API.

###### To dismiss one or more recommendations

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, perform any of the following:

- Choose **Recommendations**.

The **Recommendations** page appears with the list of
all recommendations.

- Choose **Databases** and then choose **Recommendations**
for a resource in the databases page.

The details appear in the **Recommendations** tab for
the selected recommendation.

- Choose **Detection** for an active recommendation in the
**Recommendations** page or the
**Recommendations** tab in the
**Databases** page.

The recommendation details page displays the list of affected resources.

3. Choose one or more recommendation, or one or more affected resources
    in the recommendation details page, and then choose
    **Dismiss**.

The following example shows the **Recommendations**
    page with multiple active recommendations selected to dismiss.

###### To dismiss a RDS recommendation using the AWS CLI

1. Run the command `aws rds describe-db-recommendations --filters "Name=status,Values=active"`.

The output provides a list of recommendations in `active` status.

2. Find the `recommendationId` for the recommendation that you want to dismiss from step 1.

3. Run the command `>aws rds modify-db-recommendation --status dismissed --recommendationId <ID>` with the
    `recommendationId` from step 2 to dismiss the recommendation.

To dismiss a RDS recommendation using the Amazon RDS API, use the [ModifyDBRecommendation](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbrecommendation.md) operation.
