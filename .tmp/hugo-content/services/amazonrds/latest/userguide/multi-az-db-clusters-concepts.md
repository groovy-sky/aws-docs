# Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments for Amazon RDS

A _Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment_ is a semisynchronous, high availability deployment
mode of Amazon RDS with two readable replica DB instances. A Multi-AZ DB cluster has a writer DB instance and two reader
DB instances in three separate Availability Zones in the same AWS Region. Multi-AZ DB clusters provide high
availability, increased capacity for read workloads, and lower write latency when compared
to Multi-AZ DB instance deployments.

You can import data from an on-premises database to a Multi-AZ DB cluster by following the
instructions in [Importing data to an Amazon RDS for MySQL database with reduced downtime](mysql-importing-data-reduced-downtime.md).

You can purchase reserved DB instances for a Multi-AZ DB cluster. For more information, see [Reserved DB instances for a Multi-AZ DB cluster](user-workingwithreserveddbinstances.md#USER_WorkingWithReservedDBInstances.MultiAZDBClusters).

Feature availability and support varies across specific versions of each database engine, and
across AWS Regions. For more information on version and Region
availability of Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ DB clusters, see [Supported Regions and DB engines for Multi-AZ DB clusters in Amazon RDS](concepts-rds-fea-regions-db-eng-feature-multiazdbclusters.md).

###### Important

Multi-AZ DB clusters aren't the same as Aurora DB clusters. For information about Aurora DB clusters, see the [Amazon Aurora User Guide](../aurorauserguide/chap-auroraoverview.md).

## Instance class availability for Multi-AZ DB clusters

Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments are supported for the following DB instance classes: `db.m5d`,
`db.m6gd`, `db.m6id`, `db.m6idn`,
`db.r5d`, `db.r6gd`, `db.x2iedn`,
`db.r6id`, and `db.r6idn`, and `db.c6gd`.

###### Note

The c6gd instance classes are the only ones that support the `medium`
instance size.

For more information about DB instance classes, see [DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

## Multi-AZ DB cluster architecture

With a Multi-AZ DB cluster, Amazon RDS replicates data from the writer DB instance to both of the reader DB
instances using the DB engine's native replication capabilities. When a change is
made on the writer DB instance, it's sent to each reader DB instance.

Multi-AZ DB cluster deployments use semisynchronous replication, which requires acknowledgment from
at least one reader DB instance in order for a change to be committed. It doesn't
require acknowledgment that events have been fully executed and committed on
_all_ replicas.

Reader DB instances act as automatic failover targets and also serve read traffic to
increase application read throughput. If an outage occurs on your writer DB instance,
RDS manages failover to one of the reader DB instances. RDS does this based on which
reader DB instance has the most recent change record.

The following diagram shows a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

![Multi-AZ DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/multi-az-db-cluster.png)

Multi-AZ DB clusters typically have lower write latency when compared to Multi-AZ DB instance deployments.
They also allow read-only workloads to run on reader DB instances. The RDS console shows the
Availability Zone of the writer DB instance and the Availability Zones of the reader DB instances.
You can also use the [describe-db-clusters](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.md) CLI command or the [DescribeDBClusters](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbclusters.md) API
operation to find this information.

###### Important

To prevent replication errors in RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB clusters, we strongly recommend that all tables
have a primary key.

## Parameter groups for Multi-AZ DB clusters

In a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a _DB cluster parameter group_ acts as a container for engine
configuration values that are applied to every DB instance in the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

In a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a _DB parameter group_ is set to the default DB parameter group
for the DB engine and DB engine version. The settings in the DB cluster parameter group are used for all of the
DB instances in the cluster.

For information about parameter groups, see [Working with DB cluster parameter groups for Multi-AZ DB clusters](user-workingwithdbclusterparamgroups.md).

## RDS Proxy with Multi-AZ DB clusters

You can use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for your Multi-AZ DB clusters. By using RDS Proxy, your
applications can pool and share database connections to improve their ability to scale.
Each proxy performs connection _multiplexing_, also known as
connection reuse. With multiplexing, RDS Proxy performs all the operations for a
transaction using one underlying database connection. RDS Proxy can also reduce the
downtime for a minor version upgrade of a Multi-AZ DB cluster to one second or less. For more
information about the benefits of RDS Proxy, see [Amazon RDS Proxy](rds-proxy.md).

To set up a proxy for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, choose **Create an RDS Proxy**
when creating the cluster. For instructions to create and manage RDS Proxy endpoints, see
[Working with Amazon RDS Proxy endpoints](rds-proxy-endpoints.md).

## Replica lag and Multi-AZ DB clusters

_Replica lag_ is the difference in time between the latest transaction on
the writer DB instance and the latest applied transaction on a reader DB instance. The
Amazon CloudWatch metric `ReplicaLag` represents this time difference. For more
information about CloudWatch metrics, see [Monitoring Amazon RDS metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md).

Although Multi-AZ DB clusters allow for high write performance, replica lag can still occur due to the
nature of engine-based replication. Because any failover must first resolve the replica
lag before it promotes a new writer DB instance, monitoring and managing this replica lag is a
consideration.

For RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB clusters, failover time depends on replica lag of both remaining reader DB instances.
Both the reader DB instances must apply unapplied transactions before one of them is promoted
to the new writer DB instance.

For RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB clusters, failover time depends on the lowest replica lag of the two
remaining reader DB instances. The reader DB instance with the lowest replica lag must apply
unapplied transactions before it is promoted to the new writer DB instance.

For a tutorial that shows you how to create a CloudWatch alarm when replica lag exceeds
a set amount of time, see [Tutorial: Creating an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for Multi-AZ DB cluster replica lag for Amazon RDS](multi-az-db-cluster-cloudwatch-alarm.md).

### Common causes of replica lag

In general, replica lag occurs when the write workload is too high for the reader DB
instances to apply the transactions efficiently. Various workloads can incur
temporary or continuous replica lag. Some examples of common causes are the
following:

- High write concurrency or heavy batch updating on the writer DB instance, causing the apply process on the reader DB instances
to fall behind.

- Heavy read workload that is using resources on one or more reader DB instances. Running slow or large queries can affect
the apply process and can cause replica lag.

- Transactions that modify large amounts of data or DDL statements can sometimes cause a temporary increase in replica lag
because the database must preserve commit order.

### Mitigating replica lag

For Multi-AZ DB clusters for RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL, you can mitigate replica lag by reducing the
load on your writer DB instance. You can also use flow control to reduce replica lag.
_Flow control_ works by throttling writes on
the writer DB instance, which ensures that replica lag doesn't continue to grow unbounded.
Write throttling is accomplished by adding a delay into the end of a transaction,
which decreases the write throughput on the writer DB instance. Although flow
control doesn't guarantee lag elimination, it can help reduce overall lag in many
workloads. The following sections provide information about using flow control with
RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL.

#### Mitigating replica lag with flow control for RDS for MySQL

When you are using RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB clusters, flow control is turned on by default using the
dynamic parameter `rpl_semi_sync_master_target_apply_lag`. This
parameter specifies the upper limit that you want for replica lag. As replica
lag approaches this configured limit, flow control throttles the write
transactions on the writer DB instance to try to contain the replica lag below the
specified value. In some cases, replica lag can exceed the specified limit. By
default, this parameter is set to 120 seconds. To turn off flow control, set
this parameter to its maximum value of 86,400 seconds (one day).

To view the current delay injected by flow control, show the parameter
`Rpl_semi_sync_master_flow_control_current_delay` by running the
following query.

```sql

SHOW GLOBAL STATUS like '%flow_control%';
```

Your output should look similar to the following.

```

+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
| Variable_name                                   | Value |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
| Rpl_semi_sync_master_flow_control_current_delay | 2010  |
+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

###### Note

The delay is shown in microseconds.

When you have Performance Insights turned on for an RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB cluster, you
can monitor the wait event corresponding to a SQL statement indicating that the
queries were delayed by a flow control. When a delay was introduced by a flow
control, you can view the wait event
`/wait/synch/cond/semisync/semi_sync_flow_control_delay_cond`
corresponding to the SQL statement on the Performance Insights dashboard. To
view these metrics, make sure that the Performance Schema is turned on. For
information about Performance Insights, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon RDS](user-perfinsights.md).

#### Mitigating replica lag with flow control for RDS for PostgreSQL

When you are using RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB clusters, flow control is deployed as an extension. It
turns on a background worker for all DB instances in the DB cluster. By default, the
background workers on the reader DB instances communicate the current replica lag with
the background worker on the writer DB instance. If the lag exceeds two minutes on any
reader DB instance, the background worker on the writer DB instance adds a delay at the end
of a transaction. To control the lag threshold, use the parameter
`flow_control.target_standby_apply_lag`.

When a flow control throttles a PostgreSQL process, the `Extension` wait event in
`pg_stat_activity` and Performance Insights indicates that. The
function `get_flow_control_stats` displays details about how much delay
is currently being added.

Flow control can benefit most online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads that have
short but highly concurrent transactions. If the lag is caused by long-running
transactions, such as batch operations, flow control doesn't provide as strong a
benefit.

You can turn off flow control by removing the extension from the
`shared_preload_libraries` and rebooting your DB instance.

## Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshots

Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your Multi-AZ DB cluster during the configured backup window.
RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB cluster, backing up the entire cluster and
not just individual instances.

You can also take manual backups of your Multi-AZ DB cluster. For very long-term backups, consider
exporting the snapshot data to Amazon S3. For more information, see [Creating a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot for Amazon RDS](user-createmultiazdbclustersnapshot.md).

You can restore a Multi-AZ DB cluster to a specific point in time, creating a new Multi-AZ DB cluster. For
instructions, see [Restoring a Multi-AZ DB cluster to a specified time](user-pit-multiazdbcluster.md).

Alternately, you can restore a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot to a Single-AZ deployment or Multi-AZ DB
instance deployment. For instructions, see [Restoring from a Multi-AZ DB cluster snapshot to a DB instance](user-restorefrommultiazdbclustersnapshot.md).
