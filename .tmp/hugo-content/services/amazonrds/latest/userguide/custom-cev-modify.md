# Modifying CEV status

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

You can modify a CEV using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. You can modify the CEV description or its availability status. Your CEV
has one of the following status values:

- `available` – You can use this CEV to create a new RDS Custom DB instance or upgrade a DB instance. This
is the default status for a newly created CEV.

- `inactive` – You can't create or upgrade an RDS Custom instance with this CEV. You can't restore a DB snapshot
to create a new RDS Custom DB instance with this CEV.

You can change the CEV from any supported status to any other supported status. You
might change status to prevent the accidental use of a CEV or make a discontinued CEV
eligible for use again. For example, you might change the status of your CEV from
`available` to `inactive`, and from `inactive` back
to `available`.

###### To modify a CEV

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Custom engine versions**.

3. Choose a CEV whose description or status you want to modify.

4. For **Actions**, choose
    **Modify**.

5. Make any of the following changes:

- For **CEV status settings**, choose a new
availability status.

- For **Version description**, enter a new
description.

6. Choose **Modify CEV**.

If the CEV is in use, the console displays **You can't modify**
**the CEV status**. Fix the problems, and try again.

The **Custom engine versions** page appears.

To modify a CEV by using the AWS CLI, run the [modify-custom-db-engine-version](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-custom-db-engine-version.md) command. You can find CEVs to modify by running the [describe-db-engine-versions](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-engine-versions.md) command.

The following options are required:

- `--engine engine-type`, where
`engine-type` is `custom-oracle-ee`,
`custom-oracle-se2`, `custom-oracle-ee-cdb`, or
`custom-oracle-se2-cdb`

- `--engine-version
                          cev`, where
`cev` is the name of the
custom engine version that you want to modify

- `--status` `
                          status`, where
`status` is the
availability status that you want to assign to the CEV

The following example changes a CEV named `19.my_cev1` from its current
status to `inactive`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-custom-db-engine-version \
    --engine custom-oracle-se2 \
    --engine-version 19.my_cev1 \
    --status inactive
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-custom-db-engine-version ^
    --engine custom-oracle-se2 ^
    --engine-version 19.my_cev1 ^
    --status inactive
```
