# Using pgAdmin to connect to a RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance

You can use the open-source tool pgAdmin to connect to your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.
You can download and install pgAdmin from [http://www.pgadmin.org/](http://www.pgadmin.org/) without having a local instance of PostgreSQL on
your client computer.

###### To connect to your RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance using pgAdmin

1. Launch the pgAdmin application on your client computer.

2. On the **Dashboard** tab, choose **Add New**
**Server**.

3. In the **Create - Server** dialog box, type a name on the
    **General** tab to identify the server in pgAdmin.

4. On the **Connection** tab, type the following information
    from your DB instance:

- For **Host**, type the endpoint, for example
`mypostgresql.c6c8dntfzzhgv0.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com`.

- For **Port**, type the assigned port.

- For **Username**, type the user name that you entered
when you created the DB instance (if you changed the 'master
username' from the default, `postgres`).

- For **Password**, type the password that you entered
when you created the DB instance.

5. Choose **Save**.

If you have any problems connecting, see [Troubleshooting connections to your RDS for PostgreSQL instance](user-connecttopostgresqlinstance-troubleshooting.md).

6. To access a database in the pgAdmin browser, expand
    **Servers**, the DB instance, and
    **Databases**. Choose the DB instance's database
    name.
