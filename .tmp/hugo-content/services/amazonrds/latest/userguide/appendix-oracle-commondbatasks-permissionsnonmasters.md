# Granting privileges to non-master users

You can grant select privileges for many objects in the `SYS` schema by
using the `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` role. The
`SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` role gives users `SELECT` privileges
on data dictionary views. The following example grants the role
`SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` to a user named `user1`.

```sql

GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO user1;
```

You can grant `EXECUTE` privileges for many objects in the
`SYS` schema by using the `EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE` role. The
`EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE` role gives users `EXECUTE`
privileges for packages and procedures in the data dictionary. The following example
grants the role `EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE` to a user named
_user1_.

```sql

GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO user1;
```

The following example gets the permissions that the roles
`SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` and `EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE` allow.

```sql

  SELECT *
    FROM ROLE_TAB_PRIVS
   WHERE ROLE IN ('SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE','EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE')
ORDER BY ROLE, TABLE_NAME ASC;
```

The following example creates a non-master user named `user1`, grants
the `CREATE SESSION` privilege, and grants the `SELECT`
privilege on a database named _sh.sales_.

```sql

CREATE USER user1 IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO user1;
GRANT SELECT ON sh.sales TO user1;
```
