# Adding the time zone file autoupgrade option

When you add the option to an option group, the option group is in one of the
following states:

- An existing option group is currently attached to at least one DB instance. When you
add the option, all DB instances that use this option group automatically restart.
This causes a brief outage.

- An existing option group is not attached to any DB instance. You plan to add the
option and then associate the existing option group with existing DB instances or with
a new DB instance.

- You create a new option group and add the option. You plan to associate the
new option group with existing DB instances or with a new DB instance.

## Console

###### To add the time zone file autoupgrade option to a DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**.

3. Determine the option group you want to use. You can create a new option
    group or use an existing option group. If you want to use an existing option
    group, skip to the next step. Otherwise, create a custom DB option group
    with the following settings:

1. For **Engine** choose the Oracle Database edition
       for your DB instance.

2. For **Major engine version** choose the version
       of your DB instance.

For more information, see [Creating an option group](user-workingwithoptiongroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create).

4. Choose the option group that you want to modify, and then choose
    **Add option**.

5. In the **Add option** window, do the following:
1. Choose **TIMEZONE\_FILE\_AUTOUPGRADE**.

2. To enable the option on all associated DB instances as soon as
       you add it, for **Apply Immediately**, choose
       **Yes**. If you choose **No**
       (the default), the option is enabled for each associated DB instance
       during its next maintenance window.
6. When the settings are as you want them, choose **Add**
**option**.

## AWS CLI

The following example uses the AWS CLI [add-option-to-option-group](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/add-option-to-option-group.md) command to add the `TIMEZONE_FILE_AUTOUPGRADE` option
to an option group called `myoptiongroup`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group \
    --option-group-name "myoptiongroup" \
    --options "OptionName=TIMEZONE_FILE_AUTOUPGRADE" \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-option-to-option-group ^
    --option-group-name "myoptiongroup" ^
    --options "OptionName=TIMEZONE_FILE_AUTOUPGRADE" ^
    --apply-immediately
```
