## Limitations for Secrets Manager integration with Amazon RDS

Managing master user passwords with Secrets Manager isn't supported for the following features:

- Creating a read replica when the source DB or
DB cluster manages credentials with Secrets Manager. This applies to all DB engines except RDS for SQL Server.

- Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments

- Amazon RDS Custom

- Oracle Data Guard switchover

## Overview of managing master user passwords with AWS Secrets Manager

With AWS Secrets Manager, you can replace hard-coded credentials in your code, including database
passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically. For more
information about Secrets Manager, see the [AWS Secrets Manager User Guide](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide.md).

When you store database secrets in Secrets Manager, your AWS account incurs charges. For
information about pricing, see [AWS Secrets Manager Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/pricing).

You can specify that RDS
manages the master user password in Secrets Manager for an Amazon RDS
DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster
when you perform one of the following operations:

- Create a DB instance

- Create a Multi-AZ DB cluster

- Create a tenant database in an RDS for Oracle CDB

- Modify a DB instance

- Modify a Multi-AZ DB cluster

- Modify a tenant database (RDS for Oracle only)

- Restore a DB instance from Amazon S3

- Restore a DB instance from a snapshot or to a point in time (RDS for Oracle only)

When you specify that RDS manages the master user password in Secrets Manager, RDS
generates the password and stores it in Secrets Manager.
You can interact directly with the secret to retrieve the credentials for the master
user. You can also specify a customer managed key to encrypt the secret, or use the KMS key that
is provided by Secrets Manager.

RDS manages
the settings for the secret and rotates the secret every seven days by default. You can
modify some of the settings, such as the rotation schedule. If you delete a DB
instance
that manages a secret in Secrets Manager, the secret and its associated metadata are also deleted.

To connect to a DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster
with the credentials in a secret, you can retrieve the secret from Secrets Manager. For more
information, see [Retrieve secrets from\
AWS Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets.md) and [Connect to a SQL\
database with credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets-jdbc.md) in the
_AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

## Benefits of managing master user passwords with Secrets Manager

Managing RDS master user
passwords with Secrets Manager provides the following benefits:

- RDS automatically
generates database credentials.

- RDS
automatically stores and manages database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.

- RDS rotates database
credentials regularly, without requiring application changes.

- Secrets Manager secures database credentials from human access and plain text view.

- Secrets Manager allows retrieval of database credentials in secrets for database connections.

- Secrets Manager allows fine-grained control of access to database credentials in secrets using IAM.

- You can optionally separate database encryption from credentials encryption with different KMS keys.

- You can eliminate manual management and rotation of database credentials.

- You can monitor database credentials easily with AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch.

For more information about the benefits of Secrets Manager, see the [AWS Secrets Manager User Guide](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide.md).

## Permissions required for Secrets Manager integration

Users must have the required permissions to perform operations related to Secrets Manager integration.
You can create IAM policies that grant permissions to perform specific
API operations on the specified resources they need. You can then attach those policies
to the IAM permission sets or roles that require those permissions. For more
information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon RDS](usingwithrds-iam.md).

For create, modify, or restore operations, the user who specifies that
Amazon RDS
manages the master user password in Secrets Manager must have permissions to perform the
following operations:

- `kms:DescribeKey`

- `secretsmanager:CreateSecret`

- `secretsmanager:TagResource`

The `kms:DescribeKey` permission is required to access your customer-managed key for the
`MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId` and to describe `aws/secretsmanager`.

For create, modify, or restore operations, the user who specifies the customer managed key to encrypt
the secret in Secrets Manager must have permissions to perform the following operations:

- `kms:Decrypt`

- `kms:GenerateDataKey`

- `kms:CreateGrant`

For modify operations, the user who rotates the master user password
in Secrets Manager must have permissions to perform the following operation:

- `secretsmanager:RotateSecret`

## Enforcing RDS management of the master user password in AWS Secrets Manager

You can use IAM condition keys to enforce RDS management of the master user
password in AWS Secrets Manager. The following policy doesn't allow users to create or restore DB
instances or DB clusters or create or modify tenant databases
unless the master user password is managed by RDS
in Secrets Manager.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": ["rds:CreateDBInstance", "rds:CreateDBCluster", "rds:RestoreDBInstanceFromS3", "rds:RestoreDBClusterFromS3",
                       "rds:RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot", "rds:RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime", "rds:CreateTenantDatabase",
                       "rds:ModifyTenantDatabase"],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "rds:ManageMasterUserPassword": false
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Note

This policy enforces password management in AWS Secrets Manager at creation. However, you can still
disable Secrets Manager integration and manually set a master password by modifying the
instance.

To prevent this, include `rds:ModifyDBInstance`,
`rds:ModifyDBCluster` in the action block of the policy. Be aware,
this prevents the user from applying any further modifications to existing instances that don't have Secrets Manager integration enabled.

For more information about using condition keys in IAM policies, see [Policy condition keys for Amazon RDS](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#UsingWithRDS.IAM.Conditions) and [Example policies: Using condition keys](usingwithrds-iam-conditions-examples.md).

## Managing the master user password for a DB instance with Secrets Manager

You can configure RDS management of the master user password in Secrets Manager when you perform the following actions:

- [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md)

- [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md)

- [Restoring a backup into an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance](mysql-procedural-importing.md)

- [Restoring to a DB instance](user-restorefromsnapshot.md)
(RDS for Oracle only)

- [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time for Amazon RDS](user-pit.md) (RDS for Oracle only)

You can perform the preceding operations using the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS
API.

Follow the instructions for creating or modifying a DB instance with the RDS console:

- [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating)

- [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md)

- [Importing data from Amazon S3 to a new MySQL DB instance](mysql-procedural-importing.md#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.PerformingImport)

When you use the RDS console to perform one of these operations, you can specify that the
master user password is managed by RDS in Secrets Manager. When you're creating or
restoring a DB instance, select **Manage master credentials in**
**AWS Secrets Manager** in **Credential settings**. When
you're modifying a DB instance, select **Manage master credentials in**
**AWS Secrets Manager** in **Settings**.

The following image is an example of the **Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager**
setting when you are creating or restoring a DB instance.

![Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-credential-settings-db-instance.png)

When you select this option, RDS generates the master user password and
manages it throughout its lifecycle in Secrets Manager.

![Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager selected](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-integration-create-db-instance.png)

You can choose to encrypt the secret with a KMS key that Secrets Manager provides or with a
customer managed key that you create. After RDS is managing the database credentials for a
DB instance, you can't change the KMS key used to encrypt the secret.

You can choose other settings to meet your requirements. For more information about the
available settings when you're creating a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md). For more information about
the available settings when you're modifying a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](user-modifyinstance-settings.md).

To manage the master user password with RDS in Secrets Manager, specify the `--manage-master-user-password`
option in one of the following AWS CLI commands:

- [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md)

- [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md)

- [restore-db-instance-from-s3](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-s3.md)

- [restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.md) (RDS for Oracle only)

- [restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.md) (RDS for Oracle only)

When you specify the `--manage-master-user-password` option in these commands,
RDS generates the master user password and manages it throughout
its lifecycle in Secrets Manager.

To encrypt the secret, you can specify a customer managed key or use the default KMS key that is
provided by Secrets Manager. Use the `--master-user-secret-kms-key-id` option
to specify a customer managed key. The AWS KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key
ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a
different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. After RDS
is managing the database credentials for a DB instance, you can't change the
KMS key that is used to encrypt the secret.

You can choose other settings to meet your requirements. For more information about the available settings
when you are creating a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](user-createdbinstance-settings.md). For more information about the available settings
when you are modifying a DB instance, see [Settings for DB instances](user-modifyinstance-settings.md).

The following example creates a DB instance and specifies that RDS
manages the master user password in
Secrets Manager. The secret is encrypted using the KMS key that is provided by
Secrets Manager.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --engine mysql \
    --engine-version 8.0.39 \
    --db-instance-class db.r5b.large \
    --allocated-storage 200 \
    --master-username testUser \
    --manage-master-user-password
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --engine mysql ^
    --engine-version 8.0.39 ^
    --db-instance-class db.r5b.large ^
    --allocated-storage 200 ^
    --master-username testUser ^
    --manage-master-user-password
```

To specify that RDS manages the master user password in Secrets Manager, set the `ManageMasterUserPassword`
parameter to `true` in one of the following RDS API operations:

- [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md)

- [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md)

- [RestoreDBInstanceFromS3](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancefroms3.md)

- [RestoreDBInstanceFromSnapshot](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancefromsnapshot.md) (RDS for Oracle only)

- [RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancetopointintime.md) (RDS for Oracle only)

When you set the `ManageMasterUserPassword` parameter to `true` in
one of these operations, RDS generates the master user password and
manages it throughout its lifecycle in Secrets Manager.

To encrypt the secret, you can specify a customer managed key or use the default KMS key that is
provided by Secrets Manager. Use the `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId` parameter to
specify a customer managed key. The AWS KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. After RDS is managing the database
credentials for a DB instance, you can't change the KMS key that is used to encrypt
the secret.

## Managing the master user password for an RDS for Oracle tenant database with Secrets Manager

You can configure RDS management of the master user password in Secrets Manager when you perform the
following actions:

- [Adding an RDS for Oracle tenant database to your CDB instance](oracle-cdb-configuring-adding-pdb.md)

- [Modifying an RDS for Oracle tenant database](oracle-cdb-configuring-modifying-pdb.md)

You can use the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API to perform the preceding
actions.

Follow the instructions for creating or modifying an RDS for Oracle tenant database with the RDS
console:

- [Adding an RDS for Oracle tenant database to your CDB instance](oracle-cdb-configuring-adding-pdb.md)

- [Modifying an RDS for Oracle tenant database](oracle-cdb-configuring-modifying-pdb.md)

When you use the RDS console to perform one of the preceding operations, you can specify
that RDS manage the master password in Secrets Manager. When you create a tenant database, select
**Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager** in
**Credential settings**. When you modify a tenant database, select
**Manage master credentials in AWS Secrets Manager** in
**Settings**.

The following image is an example of the **Manage master credentials in**
**AWS Secrets Manager** setting when you are creating a tenant database.

[Settings for modifying Multi-AZ DB clusters](modify-multi-az-db-cluster.md#modify-multi-az-db-cluster-settings).

This example creates a Multi-AZ DB cluster and
specifies that RDS manages the password in Secrets Manager. The secret
is encrypted using the KMS key that is provided by Secrets Manager.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster \
   --db-cluster-identifier mysql-multi-az-db-cluster \
   --engine mysql \
   --engine-version 8.0.39  \
   --backup-retention-period 1  \
   --allocated-storage 4000 \
   --storage-type io1 \
   --iops 10000 \
   --db-cluster-instance-class db.r6gd.xlarge \
   --master-username testUser \
   --manage-master-user-password
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster ^
   --db-cluster-identifier mysql-multi-az-db-cluster ^
   --engine mysql ^
   --engine-version 8.0.39 ^
   --backup-retention-period 1 ^
   --allocated-storage 4000 ^
   --storage-type io1 ^
   --iops 10000 ^
   --db-cluster-instance-class db.r6gd.xlarge ^
   --master-username testUser ^
   --manage-master-user-password
```

To specify that RDS manages
the master user password in Secrets Manager, set the `ManageMasterUserPassword`
parameter to `true` in one of the following operations:

- [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md)

- [ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md)

When you set the `ManageMasterUserPassword` parameter to `true` in
one of these operations, RDS generates the master user password and
manages it throughout its lifecycle in Secrets Manager.

To encrypt the secret, you can specify a customer managed key or use the default KMS key that is
provided by Secrets Manager. Use the `MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId` parameter to
specify a customer managed key. The AWS KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different
AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. After RDS
is managing the database credentials
for a DB cluster, you can't change the KMS key that is used to encrypt the
secret.

## Rotating the master user password secret for a DB instance

When RDS rotates a master user password secret, Secrets Manager generates a new secret version for the existing secret.
The new version of the secret contains the new master user password. Amazon RDS changes the master user password for
the DB instance to match the password for the new secret version.

You can rotate a secret immediately instead of waiting for a scheduled rotation. To rotate a
master user password secret in Secrets Manager, modify the DB instance. For information about
modifying a DB instance, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).

You can rotate a master user password secret immediately with the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or
the RDS API. The new password is always 28 characters long and contains at least one
upper and lowercase character, one number, and one punctuation.

To rotate a master user password secret using the RDS console, modify the DB instance and
select **Rotate secret immediately** in **Settings**.

![Rotate a master user password secret immediately](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-integration-rotate.png)

Follow the instructions for modifying a DB instance with the RDS console in
[Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](overview-dbinstance-modifying.md).
You must choose **Apply immediately** on the confirmation page.

To rotate a master user password secret using the AWS CLI, use the [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md)
command and specify the `--rotate-master-user-password`
option. You must specify the `--apply-immediately` option when
you rotate the master password.

This example rotates a master user password secret.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --rotate-master-user-password \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --rotate-master-user-password ^
    --apply-immediately
```

You can rotate a master user password secret using the [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md)
operation and setting the `RotateMasterUserPassword`
parameter to `true`. You must set the `ApplyImmediately`
parameter to `true` when you rotate the master password.

## Rotating the master user password secret for a Multi-AZDB cluster

When RDS
rotates a master user password secret, Secrets Manager generates a new secret version for the
existing secret. The new version of the secret contains the new master user password.
Amazon RDS changes the master user password for the Multi-AZ DB cluster to match the password for the new
secret version.

You can rotate a secret immediately instead of waiting for a scheduled rotation. To rotate a
master user password secret in Secrets Manager, modify the Multi-AZ DB cluster. For information about
modifying a Multi-AZ DB cluster, see [Modifying a Multi-AZ DB cluster for Amazon RDS](modify-multi-az-db-cluster.md).

You can rotate a master user password secret immediately with the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or
the RDS API. The new password is always 28 characters long and contains atleast one
upper and lowercase character, one number, and one punctuation.

To rotate a master user password secret using the RDS console, modify the Multi-AZ DB cluster and select
**Rotate secret immediately** in
**Settings**.

![Rotate a master user password secret immediately](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-integration-rotate-taz-cluster.png)

Follow the instructions for modifying a Multi-AZ DB
cluster with the RDS console in [Modifying a Multi-AZ DB cluster for Amazon RDS](modify-multi-az-db-cluster.md).
You must choose
**Apply immediately** on the confirmation page.

To rotate a master user password secret using the AWS CLI, use the [modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md)
command and specify the `--rotate-master-user-password`
option. You must specify the `--apply-immediately` option when
you rotate the master password.

This example rotates a master user password secret.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
    --rotate-master-user-password \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster ^
    --rotate-master-user-password ^
    --apply-immediately
```

You can rotate a master user password secret using the [ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md)
operation and setting the `RotateMasterUserPassword`
parameter to `true`. You must set the `ApplyImmediately`
parameter to `true` when you rotate the master password.

## Viewing the details about a secret for a DB instance

You can retrieve your secrets using the console ( [https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager)) or the AWS CLI ( [get-secret-value](../../../cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/get-secret-value.md) Secrets Manager command).

You can find the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a secret managed by
RDS in Secrets Manager with the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### To view the details about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose the name of the DB instance to show its details.

4. Choose the **Configuration** tab.

In **Master Credentials ARN**, you can view the secret ARN.

![View the details about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/secrets-manager-integration-view-instance.png)

You can follow the **Manage in Secrets Manager** link to view and manage the secret
    in the Secrets Manager console.

You can use the [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md)
RDS CLI command to find the following information about a secret managed by RDS in Secrets Manager:

- `SecretArn` – The ARN of the secret

- `SecretStatus` – The status of the secret

The possible status values include the following:

- `creating` – The secret is being created.

- `active` – The secret is available for normal use and rotation.

- `rotating` – The secret is being rotated.

- `impaired` – The secret can be used to access database credentials, but
it can't be rotated. A secret might have this status if, for example, permissions are changed
so that RDS can no longer access the secret or the KMS key for the secret.

When a secret has this status, you can correct the condition that caused the status.
If you correct the condition that caused status, the status remains `impaired`
until the next rotation. Alternatively, you can modify the DB instance to turn off automatic
management of database credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to turn on automatic
management of database credentials. To modify the DB instance, use the
`--manage-master-user-password` option in the [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) command.

- `KmsKeyId` – The ARN of the KMS key that is used to encrypt the
secret

Specify the `--db-instance-identifier` option to show output for a specific DB
instance. This example shows the output for a secret that is used by a DB
instance.
