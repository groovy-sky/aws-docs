# Connecting to your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance with IBM Db2 Data Management Console

You can connect to your Amazon RDS for Db2 DB instance with IBM Db2 Data Management Console. IBM Db2 Data Management Console can administer and
monitor several RDS for Db2 DB instances.

###### Note

You must have an Amazon EC2 Linux or Windows machine that is on the same VPC and security
group as your RDS for Db2 DB instance. The VPC and security group controls the connection
to your DB instance through the internal network.

IBM Db2 Data Management Console requires a repository Db2 database to store metadata and performance metrics but
can't automatically create a repository database for RDS for Db2. Instead, you must first
create a repository database to monitor one or more RDS for Db2 DB instances. Then you can
install IBM Db2 Data Management Console and connect to your RDS for Db2 DB instance with IBM Db2 Data Management Console.

## Step 1: Creating a repository database to monitor DB instances

You can use an existing properly sized RDS for Db2 DB instance as a repository for IBM Db2 Data Management Console
to monitor other RDS for Db2 DB instances. However, because the admin user doesn't have
`SYSCTRL` authority to create buffer pools and tablespaces, using IBM Db2 Data Management Console
repository creation to create a repository database fails. Instead, you must create a
repository database. This repository database monitors your RDS for Db2 DB instances.

You can create a repository database in two different ways. You can create an RDS for Db2
database and then manually create a buffer pool, a user tablespace, and a system
temporary tablespace. Or, you can create a separate Amazon EC2 instance to host an IBM Db2 Data Management Console
repository database.

- [Creating an Amazon EC2 instance to host an IBM Db2 Data Management Console repository](#db2-creating-ec2-dmc)

### Manually creating a buffer pool, a user tablespace, and a system temporary tablespace

###### To create a buffer pool, a user tablespace, and a system temporary tablespace

1. Connect to the `rdsadmin` database. In the following example,
    replace `master_username` and
    `master_password` with your own
    information.

```nohighlight

db2 connect to rdsadmin user master_username using master_password
```

2. Create a buffer pool for IBM Db2 Data Management Console. In the following example, replace
    `database_name` with the name of the repository
    you created for IBM Db2 Data Management Console to monitor your RDS for Db2 DB instances.

```nohighlight

db2 "call rdsadmin.create_bufferpool('database_name',
        'BP4CONSOLE', 1000, 'Y', 'Y', 32768)"
```

3. Create a user tablespace for IBM Db2 Data Management Console. In the following example, replace
    `database_name` with the name of the repository
    you created for IBM Db2 Data Management Console to monitor your RDS for Db2 DB instances.

```nohighlight

db2 "call rdsadmin.create_tablespace('database_name',
        'TS4CONSOLE', 'BP4CONSOLE', 32768)"
```

4. Create a system temporary tablespace for IBM Db2 Data Management Console. In the following example,
    replace `database_name` with the name of the
    repository you created for IBM Db2 Data Management Console to monitor your RDS for Db2 DB instances.

```nohighlight

db2 "call rdsadmin.create_tablespace('database_name',
       'TS4CONSOLE_TEMP', 'BP4CONSOLE', 32768, 0, 0, 'S')"
```

You are now ready to install IBM Db2 Data Management Console. For more information about installation and
setup, see [Step 2: Installing and setting up IBM Db2 Data Management Console](#db2-install-setup-dmc).

### Creating an Amazon EC2 instance to host an IBM Db2 Data Management Console repository

You can create a separate Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance to host an IBM Db2 Data Management Console repository.
For information about creating an Amazon EC2 instance, see [Tutorial: Get started with Amazon EC2 Linux instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-getstarted.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Step 2: Installing and setting up IBM Db2 Data Management Console

After you create a buffer pool, a user tablespace, and a system temporary tablespace,
you are ready to install and set up IBM Db2 Data Management Console.

###### Important

You must have an Amazon EC2 Linux or Windows machine that is on the same VPC and
security group as your RDS for Db2 DB instance. The VPC and security group controls the
connection to your DB instance through the internal network. Also, you must have
already [created a repository\
database](#db2-creating-repo-db-monitoring-dmc) for IBM Db2 Data Management Console.

###### To install and set up IBM Db2 Data Management Console

1. Download IBM Db2 Data Management Console from [IBM Db2 Data Management Console Version 3.1x releases](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-db2-data-management-console-version-31x-releases-new-features-and-enhancements) on the IBM Support website.

2. Install IBM Db2 Data Management Console.

3. Open IBM Db2 Data Management Console and use the IP address of your Amazon EC2 machine and the port number
    you used for the HTTP or HTTPS connection to your Amazon EC2 instance. For example,
    use `http://xx.xx.xx.xx:11080` or
    `https://xx.xx.xx.xx.11081`.
    Replace `xx.xx.xx.xx` with the IP address
    of your Amazon EC2 machine. `11080` and `11081` are the default
    ports for HTTP and HTTPS connections.

4. (Optional) If you want to use port 80 or 443 on your Amazon EC2 instance, you can
    use either Apache httpd or a Nginx HTTP server to proxy the IBM Db2 Data Management Console port to either
    port 80 or 443. For more information, see [Apache HTTP Server Project](https://httpd.apache.org/) and [the nginx website](https://nginx.org/en).

To allow connection to IBM Db2 Data Management Console, you must edit the inbound rules in your security
    group. If you use a proxy, change the TCP/IP port 80 or 443 to redirect to the
    IBM Db2 Data Management Console ports. If you aren't using a proxy, change the TCP/IP port 80 or 443 to
    the default ports 11080 (HTTP) or 11081 (HTTPS).

You are now ready to log in to IBM Db2 Data Management Console to configure the repository database and to
connect to your RDS for Db2 DB instances. For more information, see [Configuring the\
repository database and connecting to DB instances](#db2-connecting-db-instances-with-dmc).

## Step 3: Configuring the repository database and connecting to RDS for Db2 DB instances

When you connect to the repository database for the first time, IBM Db2 Data Management Console automatically
configures the repository. After the repository database is configured, you can add
database connections to IBM Db2 Data Management Console.

To connect to your RDS for Db2 DB instance, you need its DNS name and port number. For
information about finding them, see [Finding the endpoint](db2-finding-instance-endpoint.md). You also need to know the
database name, master username, and master password that you defined when you created
your RDS for Db2 DB instance. For more information about finding them, see [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating). If you are connecting over the
internet, allow traffic to the database port. For more information, see [Creating a DB instance](user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Creating).

###### To connect to RDS for Db2 DB instances with IBM Db2 Data Management Console

1. Log in to IBM Db2 Data Management Console with the credentials you set during installation.

2. Configure the repository.

      is open through the inbound rules in your security group. For more
      information, see [Considerations for security groups with Amazon RDS for Db2](db2-security-groups-considerations.md).

      If you didn't [manually\
       create a buffer pool, a user tablespace, and a system temporary\
       tablespace](#db2-manually-creating-dmc) in RDS for Db2, you might see the following error
       message:

      ![Error message about not having permissions to perform operations.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ibm-dmc-error-message.png)

      Make sure that you created a buffer table, a tablespace, and objects
       for an IBM Db2 Data Management Console repository to monitor your RDS for Db2 DB instance. Or, you
       can use an Amazon EC2 Db2 DB instance to host an IBM Db2 Data Management Console repository to monitor
       your RDS for Db2 DB instance. For more information, see [Step 1: Creating a repository database to monitor DB instances](#db2-creating-repo-db-monitoring-dmc).

4. After you successfully test your connection, choose
       **Next**.

      ![The Security and credential section in IBM Db2 Data Management Console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/ibm-dmc-security-credential.png)

If IBM Db2 Data Management Console finds the buffer pool, the user tablespace, and the system temporary
tablespace in the RDS for Db2 DB instance, then IBM Db2 Data Management Console automatically configures the
repository database. If you use your Db2 instance on your Amazon EC2 instance as the
repository database, then IBM Db2 Data Management Console automatically creates the buffer pool and other
objects.

3. In the **Set statistics event monitor opt-in** window, choose
    **Next**.

4. (Optional) Add new connection. If you want to use a different RDS for Db2 DB
    instance for administration and monitoring, then add a connection to a
    non-repository RDS for Db2 DB instance.

1. In the **Connection and database** section, enter the
       following information for the RDS for Db2 DB instance to use for
       administration and monitoring:

- For **Connection name**, enter the Db2
database identifier.

- For **Host**, enter the DNS name of the DB
instance.

- For **Port**, enter the port number for the
DB instance.

- For **Database**, enter the name of the
database.
