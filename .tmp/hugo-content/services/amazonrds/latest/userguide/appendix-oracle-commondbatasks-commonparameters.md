# Common parameters for RMAN procedures

You can use procedures in the Amazon RDS package `rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util` to perform tasks with
RMAN. Several parameters are common to the procedures in the package. The package has the following common
parameters.

Parameter nameData typeValid valuesDefaultRequiredDescription

`p_directory_name`

varchar2

A valid database directory name.

—

Yes

The name of the directory to contain the backup files.

`p_label`

varchar2

`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`,
`'_'`, `'-'`, `'.'`

—

No

A unique string that is included in the backup file
names.

###### Note

The limit is 30 characters.

`p_owner`

varchar2

A valid owner of the directory specified in
`p_directory_name`.

—

Yes

The owner of the directory to contain the backup files.

`p_tag`

varchar2

`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `'_'`,
`'-'`, `'.'`

NULL

No

A string that can be used to distinguish between backups to indicate the purpose or
usage of backups, such as daily, weekly, or incremental-level backups.

The limit is 30 characters. The tag is not case-sensitive. Tags are always stored in
uppercase, regardless of the case used when entering them.

Tags don't need to be unique, so multiple backups can have the same tag.

If you don't specify a tag, then RMAN assigns a default tag automatically using the
format `TAGYYYYMMDDTHHMMSS`, where
`YYYY` is the year, `MM` is the
month, `DD` is the day, `HH` is the
hour (in 24-hour format), `MM` is the minutes, and
`SS` is the seconds. The date and time refer to when RMAN
started the backup.

For example, a backup might receive a tag `TAG20190927T214517` for a backup
that started on 2019-09-27 at 21:45:17.

The `p_tag` parameter is supported for the following Amazon RDS for Oracle
DB engine versions:

- Oracle Database 21c (21.0.0)

- Oracle Database 19c (19.0.0), using 19.0.0.0.ru-2021-10.rur-2021-10.r1 or
higher

`p_compress`

boolean

`TRUE`, `FALSE`

`FALSE`

No

Specify `TRUE` to enable BASIC backup
compression.

Specify `FALSE` to disable BASIC backup
compression.

`p_include_archive_logs`

boolean

`TRUE`, `FALSE`

`FALSE`

No

Specify `TRUE` to include archived redo logs in the
backup.

Specify `FALSE` to exclude archived redo logs from
the backup.

If you include archived redo logs in the backup, set retention
to one hour or greater using the
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.set_configuration`
procedure. Also, call the
`rdsadmin.rdsadmin_rman_util.crosscheck_archivelog`
procedure immediately before running the backup. Otherwise, the
backup might fail due to missing archived redo log files that
have been deleted by Amazon RDS management procedures.

`p_include_controlfile`

boolean

`TRUE`, `FALSE`

`FALSE`

No

Specify `TRUE` to include the control file in the
backup.

Specify `FALSE` to exclude the control file from
the backup.

`p_optimize`

boolean

`TRUE`, `FALSE`

`TRUE`

No

Specify `TRUE` to enable backup optimization, if
archived redo logs are included, to reduce backup size.

Specify `FALSE` to disable backup
optimization.

`p_parallel`

number

A valid integer between `1` and `254`
for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE)

`1` for other Oracle Database editions

`1`

No

Number of channels.

`p_rman_to_dbms_output`

boolean

`TRUE`, `FALSE`

`FALSE`

No

When `TRUE`, the RMAN output is sent to the
`DBMS_OUTPUT` package in addition to a file in
the `BDUMP` directory. In SQL\*Plus, use `SET
                                        SERVEROUTPUT ON` to see the output.

When `FALSE`, the RMAN output is only sent to a
file in the `BDUMP` directory.

`p_section_size_mb`

number

A valid integer

`NULL`

No

The section size in megabytes (MB).

Validates in parallel by dividing each file into the specified
section size.

When `NULL`, the parameter is ignored.

`p_validation_type`

varchar2

`'PHYSICAL'`,
`'PHYSICAL+LOGICAL'`

`'PHYSICAL'`

No

The level of corruption detection.

Specify `'PHYSICAL'` to check for physical
corruption. An example of physical corruption is a block with a
mismatch in the header and footer.

Specify `'PHYSICAL+LOGICAL'` to check for logical
inconsistencies in addition to physical corruption. An example
of logical corruption is a corrupt block.
