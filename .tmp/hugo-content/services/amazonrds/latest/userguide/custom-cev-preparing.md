# Preparing to create a CEV

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

To create a CEV, access the installation files and patches that are stored in your
Amazon S3 bucket for any of the following releases:

- Oracle Database 19c

- Oracle Database 18c

- Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2)

- Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1)

For example, you can use the April 2021 RU/RUR for Oracle Database 19c, or any valid combination of installation files and
patches. For more information on the versions and Regions supported by RDS Custom for Oracle, see
[RDS Custom with RDS for Oracle](concepts-rds-fea-regions-db-eng-feature-rdscustom.md#Concepts.RDS_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.RDSCustom.ora).

## Step 1 (Optional): Download the manifest templates

A _CEV manifest_ is a JSON document that includes the list of
database installation .zip files for your CEV. To create a CEV, do the following:

1. Identify the Oracle database installation files that you want to include in your
    CEV.

2. Download the installation files.

3. Create a JSON manifest that lists the installation files.

RDS Custom for Oracle provides JSON manifest templates with our recommended .zip files for each
supported Oracle Database release. For example, the following template is for the
19.17.0.0.0 RU.

```

{
    "mediaImportTemplateVersion": "2020-08-14",
    "databaseInstallationFileNames": [
        "V982063-01.zip"
    ],
    "opatchFileNames": [
        "p6880880_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
    ],
    "psuRuPatchFileNames": [
        "p34419443_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p34411846_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
    ],
    "otherPatchFileNames": [
        "p28852325_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p29997937_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p31335037_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p32327201_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p33613829_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p34006614_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p34533061_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p34533150_190000_Generic.zip",
        "p28730253_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p29213893_1917000DBRU_Generic.zip",
        "p33125873_1917000DBRU_Linux-x86-64.zip",
        "p34446152_1917000DBRU_Linux-x86-64.zip"
    ]
}
```

Each template has an associated readme that includes instructions for downloading the
patches, URLs for the .zip files, and file checksums. You can use these templates as they
are or modify them with your own patches. To review the templates, download [custom-oracle-manifest.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/samples/custom-oracle-manifest.zip) to your
local disk and then open it with a file archiving application. For more information, see
[Step 5: Prepare the CEV manifest](#custom-cev.preparing.manifest).

## Step 2: Download your database installation files and patches from Oracle Software Delivery Cloud

When you have identified the installation files that you want for your CEV,
download them to your local system. The Oracle Database installation files and patches are
hosted on Oracle Software Delivery Cloud. Each CEV requires a base release, such as Oracle
Database 19c or Oracle Database 12c Release 2 (12.2), and an optional list of
patches.

10. Download your desired Oracle patches from `updates.oracle.com` or
     `support.oracle.com` to your local system. You can find the URLs for
     the patches in the following locations:

- The readme files in the .zip file that you downloaded in [Step 1 (Optional): Download the manifest templates](#custom-cev.preparing.templates)

- The patches listed in each Release Update (RU) in [Release\
notes for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Oracle](../oraclereleasenotes.md)

## Step 3: Upload your installation files to Amazon S3

Upload your Oracle installation and patch files to Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI. The S3 bucket
that contains your installation files must be in the same AWS Region as your CEV.

Examples in this section use the following placeholders:

- `install-or-patch-file.zip` –
Oracle installation media file. For example,
p32126828\_190000\_Linux-x86-64.zip is a patch.

- `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket`
– Your Amazon S3 bucket designated for your uploaded installation
files.

- `123456789012/cev1` – An optional prefix in your Amazon S3 bucket.

- `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` – An Amazon S3 bucket where you can optionally stage
files.

###### Topics

- [Step 3a: Verify that your S3 bucket is in the correct AWS Region](#custom-cev.preparing.s3.verify-region)

- [Step 3b: Make sure that your S3 bucket policy has the correct permissions](#custom-cev.preparing.s3.verify-policy)

- [Step 3c: Upload your files using the cp or sync commands](#custom-cev.preparing.s3.upload)

- [Step 3d: List the files in your S3 bucket](#custom-cev.preparing.s3.list)

### Step 3a: Verify that your S3 bucket is in the correct AWS Region

Verify that your S3 bucket is in the AWS Region where you plan to run the
`create-custom-db-engine-version` command.

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket
```

### Step 3b: Make sure that your S3 bucket policy has the correct permissions

You can create a CEV from scratch or from a source CEV. If you plan to create new CEV
from source CEVs, make sure that your S3 bucket policy has the correct
permissions:

1. Identify the S3 bucket reserved by RDS Custom. The bucket name has the format
    `do-not-delete-rds-custom-account-region-string`.
    For example, the bucket might be named
    `do-not-delete-rds-custom-123456789012-us-east-1-abc123EXAMPLE`.

2. Make sure that the following permission is appended to your S3 bucket policy.
    Replace
    `do-not-delete-rds-custom-123456789012-us-east-1-abc123EXAMPLE`
    with the name of your bucket.

```nohighlight

{
       "Sid": "AWSRDSCustomForOracleCustomEngineVersionGetObject",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {
           "Service": "custom.rds.amazonaws.com"
       },
       "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:GetObjectTagging"
       ],
       "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::do-not-delete-rds-custom-123456789012-us-east-1-abc123EXAMPLE/CustomEngineVersions/*"
}, ...
```

### Step 3c: Upload your files using the cp or sync commands

Choose either of the following options:

- Use `aws s3 cp` to upload a single .zip file.

Upload each installation .zip file separately. Don't combine the .zip
files into a single .zip file.

- Use `aws s3 sync` to upload a directory.

###### Example

The following example uploads
`install-or-patch-file.zip` to the
`123456789012/cev1` folder in the
RDS Custom Amazon S3 bucket. Run a separate `aws s3` command for each .zip that
you want to upload.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws s3 cp install-or-patch-file.zip \
    s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/123456789012/cev1/
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws s3 cp install-or-patch-file.zip ^
    s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/123456789012/cev1/
```

###### Example

The following example uploads the files in your local
`cev1` folder to the
`123456789012/cev1` folder in your Amazon S3 bucket.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws s3 sync cev1 \
    s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/123456789012/cev1/
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws s3 sync cev1 ^
    s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/123456789012/cev1/
```

###### Example

The following example uploads all files in
`amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` to the
`123456789012/cev1`
folder in your Amazon S3 bucket.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws s3 sync s3://amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/ \
    s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/123456789012/cev1/
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws s3 sync s3://amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/ ^
    s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/123456789012/cev1/
```

### Step 3d: List the files in your S3 bucket

The following example uses the `s3 ls` command to list the files in your
RDS Custom Amazon S3 bucket.

```nohighlight

aws s3 ls \
    s3://amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/123456789012/cev1/
```

## Step 4 (Optional): Share your installation media in S3 across AWS accounts

For the purposes of this section, the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your uploaded Oracle installation files is your _media_
_bucket_. Your organization might use multiple AWS accounts in an AWS Region. If so, you might want to use one AWS account
to populate your media bucket and a different AWS account to create CEVs. If you don't intend to share your media bucket, skip to the next
section.

This section assumes the following:

- You can access the account that created your media bucket and a different account in which you intend to create CEVs.

- You intend to create CEVs in only one AWS Region. If you intend to use multiple Regions, create a media bucket in each
Region.

- You're using the CLI. If you're using the Amazon S3 console, adapt the following steps.

###### To configure your media bucket for sharing across AWS accounts

1. Log in to the AWS account that contains the S3 bucket into which you uploaded your installation media.

2. Start with either a blank JSON policy template or an existing policy that you can adapt.

The following command retrieves an existing policy and saves it as `my-policy.json`. In this example, the
    S3 bucket containing your installation files is named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-policy \
       --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
       --query Policy \
       --output text > my-policy.json
```

3. Edit the media bucket permissions as follows:

- In the `Resource` element of your template, specify the S3 bucket into which you uploaded your Oracle Database
installation files.

- In the `Principal` element, specify the ARNs for all AWS accounts that you intend to use to create CEVs. You
can add the root, a user, or a role to the S3 bucket allow list. For more information, see [IAM identifiers](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-identifiers.md) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User_
_Guide_.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "GrantAccountsAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root",
                    "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:user/user-name-with-path",
                    "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/role-name-with-path"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:GetObjectTagging",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

4. Attach the policy to your media bucket.

In the following example, `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` is the name of the S3 bucket that contains your
    installation files, and `my-policy.json` is the name of your JSON file.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-policy \
       --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
       --policy file://my-policy.json
```

5. Log in to an AWS account in which you intend to create CEVs.

6. Verify that this account can access the media bucket in the AWS account that created it.

```

aws s3 ls --query "Buckets[].Name"
```

For more information, see [aws s3 ls](../../../cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.md) in the _AWS CLI_
_Command Reference_.

7. Create a CEV by following the steps in [Creating a CEV](custom-cev-create.md).

## Step 5: Prepare the CEV manifest

A CEV manifest is a JSON document that includes the following:

- (Required) The list of installation .zip files that you uploaded to Amazon S3. RDS Custom
applies the patches in the order in which they're listed in the
manifest.

- (Optional) Installation parameters that set nondefault values for the Oracle base, Oracle home, and the ID and name of the UNIX/Linux user and group. Be aware that you can’t modify the
installation parameters for an existing CEV or an existing DB instance. You also
can’t upgrade from one CEV to another CEV when the installation parameters have
different settings.

For sample CEV manifests, see the JSON templates that you downloaded in [Step 1 (Optional): Download the manifest templates](#custom-cev.preparing.templates). You can also review the samples in [CEV manifest examples](#custom-cev.preparing.manifest.examples).

- [JSON fields in the CEV manifest](#custom-cev.preparing.manifest.fields)

- [Creating the CEV manifest](#custom-cev.preparing.manifest.creating)

- [CEV manifest examples](#custom-cev.preparing.manifest.examples)

### JSON fields in the CEV manifest

The following table describes the JSON fields in the manifest.

JSON fieldDescription

`MediaImportTemplateVersion`

Version of the CEV manifest. The date is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

`databaseInstallationFileNames`

Ordered list of installation files for the database.

`opatchFileNames`

Ordered list of OPatch installers used for the Oracle DB engine. Only one value is valid. Values for
`opatchFileNames` must start with `p6880880_`.

`psuRuPatchFileNames`

The PSU and RU patches for this database.

###### Important

If you include `psuRuPatchFileNames`, `opatchFileNames` is required. Values for
`opatchFileNames` must start with `p6880880_`.

`OtherPatchFileNames`

The patches that aren't in the list of PSU and RU patches. RDS Custom applies these patches after applying the
PSU and RU patches.

###### Important

If you include `OtherPatchFileNames`, `opatchFileNames` is required. Values for
`opatchFileNames` must start with `p6880880_`.

`installationParameters`

Nondefault settings for the Oracle base, Oracle home, and the ID and name of the UNIX/Linux user and group. You can set the
following parameters:

**oracleBase**

The directory under which your Oracle binaries are
installed. It is the mount point of the binary volume
that stores your files. The Oracle base directory can
include multiple Oracle homes. For example, if
`/home/oracle/oracle.19.0.0.0.ru-2020-04.rur-2020-04.r1.EE.1`
is one of your Oracle home directories, then
`/home/oracle` is the Oracle base
directory. A user-specified Oracle base directory is not
a symbolic link.

If you don't specify the Oracle base, the default
directory is `/rdsdbbin`.

**oracleHome**

The directory in which your Oracle database binaries
are installed. For example, if you specify
`/home/oracle/` as your Oracle base, then
you might specify
`/home/oracle/oracle.19.0.0.0.ru-2020-04.rur-2020-04.r1.EE.1/`
as your Oracle home. A user-specified Oracle home
directory is not a symbolic link. The Oracle home value
is referenced by the `$ORACLE_HOME`
environment variable.

If you don't specify the Oracle home, the default
naming format is
`/rdsdbbin/oracle.major-engine-version.custom.r1.engine-edition.1`.

**unixUname**

The name of the UNIX user that owns the Oracle
software. RDS Custom assumes this user when running local
database commands. If you specify both
`unixUid` and `unixUname`,
RDS Custom creates the user if it doesn't exist, and then
assigns the UID to the user if it's not the same as the
initial UID.

The default user name is `rdsdb`.

**unixUid**

The ID (UID) of the UNIX user that owns the Oracle
software. If you specify both `unixUid` and
`unixUname`, RDS Custom creates the user if
it doesn't exist, and then assigns the UID to the user
if it's not the same as the initial UID.

The default UID is `61001`. This is the UID
of the user `rdsdb`.

**unixGroupName**

The name of the UNIX group. The UNIX user that owns
the Oracle software belongs to this group.

The default group name is `rdsdb`.

**unixGroupId**

The ID of the UNIX group to which the UNIX user
belongs.

The default group ID is `1000`. This is the
ID of the group `rdsdb`.

Each Oracle Database release has a different list of supported installation
files. When you create your CEV manifest, make sure to specify only files that are
supported by RDS Custom for Oracle. Otherwise, CEV creation fails with an error. All patches listed
in [Release notes\
for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Oracle](../oraclereleasenotes.md) are supported.

### Creating the CEV manifest

###### To create a CEV manifest

1. List all installation files that you plan to apply, in the order that you want to apply them.

2. Correlate the installation files with the JSON fields described in [JSON fields in the CEV manifest](#custom-cev.preparing.manifest.fields).

3. Do either of the following:

- Create the CEV manifest as a JSON text file.

- Edit the CEV manifest template when you create the CEV in the console. For more information, see [Creating a CEV](custom-cev-create.md).

### CEV manifest examples

The following examples show CEV manifest files for different Oracle Database releases. If you include a JSON field in your
manifest, make sure that it isn't empty. For example, the following CEV manifest isn't valid because
`otherPatchFileNames` is empty.

```

{
    "mediaImportTemplateVersion": "2020-08-14",
    "databaseInstallationFileNames": [
        "V982063-01.zip"
    ],
    "opatchFileNames": [
        "p6880880_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
    ],
    "psuRuPatchFileNames": [
        "p32126828_190000_Linux-x86-64.zip"
    ],
    "otherPatchFileNames": [
    ]
}

In the following example for the July 2021 PSU for Oracle Database 12c
Release 1 (12.1), RDS Custom applies the patches in the order specified. Thus, RDS Custom
applies p32768233, then p32876425, then p18759211, and so on. The example sets new
values for the UNIX user and group, and the Oracle home and Oracle base.

    }
}
```

## Step 6 (Optional): Validate the CEV manifest

Optionally, verify that manifest is a valid JSON file by running the
`json.tool` Python script. For example, if you change into the directory
containing a CEV manifest named `manifest.json`, run the following
command.

```

python -m json.tool < manifest.json
```

## Step 7: Add necessary IAM permissions

Make sure that the IAM principal that creates the CEV has the necessary policies described in [Step 5: Grant required permissions to your IAM user or role](custom-setup-orcl.md#custom-setup-orcl.iam-user).
