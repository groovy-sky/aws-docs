# Importing data into an Amazon RDS for MariaDB DB instance

You can use several different techniques to import data into an RDS for MariaDB DB instance.
The best approach depends on a number of factors:

- Source of the data

- Amount of data

- One-time import or ongoing

- Amount of downtime

If you are also migrating an application with the data, the amount of downtime is
important to consider.

The following table lists techniques to importing data into an RDS for MariaDB DB
instance:

###### Note

Amazon RDS doesn't support `mariadb-backup` or importing from Amazon S3 for
MariaDB.

SourceAmount of dataOne time or ongoingApplication downtimeTechniqueMore information

Existing MariaDB database on premises or on Amazon EC2

Any

Ongoing

Minimal

Configure replication with an existing MariaDB database as the
replication source.

You can configure replication into a MariaDB DB instance using MariaDB
global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) when the external instance is
MariaDB version 10.0.24 or higher, or using binary log coordinates for
MariaDB instances on earlier versions than 10.0.24. MariaDB GTIDs are
implemented differently than MySQL GTIDs, which aren't supported by
Amazon RDS.

Any existing database

Any

One time or ongoing

Minimal

Use AWS Database Migration Service to migrate the database with minimal downtime and, for
many database DB engines, continue ongoing replication.

MySQL-compatible database as a target for AWS DMS](../../../dms/latest/userguide/chap-target-mysql.md) in the
_AWS Database Migration Service User Guide_

Existing MariaDB DB instance

Any

One time or ongoing

Minimal

Create a read replica for ongoing replication. Promote the read
replica for one-time creation of a new DB instance.

Existing MariaDB database

Small

One time

Some

Copy the data directly to your MariaDB DB instance using a
command-line utility.

Data not stored in an existing database

Medium

One time

Some

Create flat files and import them using MariaDB `LOAD DATA LOCAL
                                INFILE` statements.

###### Note

The `mysql` system database contains authentication and authorization
information required to log in to your DB instance and access your data. Dropping,
altering, renaming, or truncating tables, data, or other contents of the
`mysql` database in your DB instance can result in errors and might
render the DB instance and your data inaccessible. If this occurs, you can restore the
DB instance from a snapshot using the AWS CLI [restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.md) command. You can
recover the DB instance using [restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.md) command.
