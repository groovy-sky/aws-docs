# Enabling RDS for SQL Server integration with S3

In the following section, you can find how to enable Amazon S3 integration with Amazon RDS for SQL
Server. To work with S3 integration, your DB instance must be associated with the IAM
role that you previously created before you use the `S3_INTEGRATION`
feature-name parameter.

###### Note

To add an IAM role to a DB instance, the status of the DB instance must be
**available**.

###### To associate your IAM role with your DB instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose the RDS for SQL Server DB instance name to display its details.

3. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, in the **Manage IAM**
**roles** section, choose the IAM role to add for
    **Add IAM roles to this instance**.

4. For **Feature**, choose
    **S3\_INTEGRATION**.

5. Choose **Add role**.

###### To add the IAM role to the RDS for SQL Server DB instance

- The following AWS CLI command adds your IAM role to an RDS for SQL Server DB instance named
`mydbinstance`.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance \
  	   --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
  	   --feature-name S3_INTEGRATION \
  	   --role-arn your-role-arn
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds add-role-to-db-instance ^
  	   --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
  	   --feature-name S3_INTEGRATION ^
  	   --role-arn your-role-arn
```

Replace `your-role-arn` with the role
ARN that you noted in a previous step. `S3_INTEGRATION` must be
specified for the `--feature-name` option.
