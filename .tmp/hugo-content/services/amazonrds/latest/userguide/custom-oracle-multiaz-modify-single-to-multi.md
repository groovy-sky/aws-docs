# Converting a Single-AZ deployment to a Multi-AZ deployment in RDS Custom for Oracle

###### Note

End of support notice: On March 31, 2027, AWS will end support for Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. After March 31, 2027, you will no longer be able to access the RDS Custom for Oracle console or RDS Custom for Oracle resources. For more information, see [RDS Custom for Oracle end of support](rds-custom-for-oracle-end-of-support.md).

You can convert an existing multi-AZ compatible RDS Custom for Oracle instance from a Single-AZ
deployment to a Multi-AZ deployment. When you modify the DB instance, Amazon RDS performs several
actions:

- Takes a snapshot of the primary DB instance.

- Creates new volumes for the standby replica from the snapshot. These volumes
initialize in the background, and maximum volume performance is achieved after
the data is fully initialized.

- Turns on synchronous block-level replication between the primary and standby
DB instances.

###### Important

We recommend that you avoid modifying your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance from a Single-AZ
to a Multi-AZ deployment on a production DB instance during periods of peak
activity.

AWS uses a snapshot to create the standby instance to avoid downtime when you
convert from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ, but performance might be impacted during and after
converting to Multi-AZ. This impact can be significant for workloads that are sensitive
to write latency. While this capability allows large volumes to quickly be restored from
snapshots, it can cause increase in the latency of I/O operations because of the
synchronous replication. This latency can impact your database performance.

## Configuring prerequisites to modify a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ deployment using CloudFormation

Follow [Step 3: Extract the CloudFormation templates for RDS Custom for Oracle](custom-setup-orcl.md#custom-setup-orcl.cf.downloading) to setup your VPC and
IAM profile again to add SQS VPC endpoint and SQS permission in IAM profile.

## Configuring prerequisites to modify a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ deployment manually

If you choose to configure the prerequisites manually, perform the following
tasks.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc)

2. Choose **Endpoint**. The **Create**
**Endpoint** page appears.

3. For **Service Category**, choose **AWS**
**services**.

4. In **Services**, search for `SQS`.

5. In **VPC**, choose the VPC where your RDS Custom for Oracle DB
    instance is deployed.

6. In **Subnets**, choose the subnets where your RDS Custom for Oracle
    DB instance is deployed.

7. In **Security Groups**, choose the security group where
    your RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance is deployed.

8. For **Policy**, choose
    **Custom**.

9. In your custom policy, replace the `AWS partition`,
    `Region`, `accountId`, and
    `IAM-Instance-role` with your own values.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/AWSRDSCustom": "custom-oracle"
                }
            },
            "Action": [
                "SQS:SendMessage",
                "SQS:ReceiveMessage",
                "SQS:DeleteMessage",
                "SQS:GetQueueUrl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:111122223333:do-not-delete-rds-custom-*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/{IAM-Instance-role}"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

Update the **Instance profile** with permission to
access Amazon SQS. Replace the `AWS partition`, `Region`, and
`accountId` with your own values.

```json

{
    "Sid": "13",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "SQS:SendMessage",
        "SQS:ReceiveMessage",
        "SQS:DeleteMessage",
        "SQS:GetQueueUrl"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        {
            "Fn::Sub": "arn:${AWS::Partition}:sqs:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:do-not-delete-rds-custom-*"
        }
    ],
    "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
            "aws:ResourceTag/AWSRDSCustom": "custom-oracle"
        }
    }
}
```

Update the Amazon RDS security group inbound and outbound rules to allow port
1120.

- In **Security Groups**, choose the group where your
RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance is deployed.

- For **Inbound Rules**, create a **Custom**
**TCP** rule to allow port `1120` from the source
group.

- For **Outbound Rules**, create a **Custom**
**TCP** rule to allow port `1120` to the destination
group.

## Modify using the RDS console, AWS CLI, or RDS API

After you've completed the prerequisites, you can modify an RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance
from a Single-AZ to Multi-AZ deployment using the Amazon RDS console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS
API.

### Console

###### To modify an existing RDS Custom for Oracle Single-AZ to Multi-AZ deployment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the Amazon RDS console, choose **Databases**. The
    **Databases** pane appears.

3. Choose the RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance that you want to modify.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Convert to Multi-AZ**
**deployment**.

5. On the **Confirmation** page, choose **Apply**
**immediately** to apply the changes immediately. Choosing this
    option doesn't cause downtime, but there is a possible performance
    impact. Alternatively, you can choose to apply the update during the
    next maintenance window. For more information, see [Using the schedule modifications setting](user-modifyinstance-applyimmediately.md).

6. On the **Confirmation** page, choose
    **Convert to Multi-AZ**.

### AWS CLI

To convert to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment by using the AWS CLI, call the
[modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) command and set the `--multi-az` option.
Specify the DB instance identifier and the values for other options that you
want to modify. For information about each option, see [Settings for DB instances](user-modifyinstance-settings.md).

###### Example

The following code modifies `mycustomdbinstance` by including
the `--multi-az` option. The changes are applied during the next
maintenance window by using `--no-apply-immediately`. Use
`--apply-immediately` to apply the changes immediately. For more
information, see [Using the schedule modifications setting](user-modifyinstance-applyimmediately.md).

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mycustomdbinstance \
    --multi-az \
    [--no-apply-immediately | --apply-immediately]
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mycustomdbinstance ^
    --multi-az ^
    [--no-apply-immediately | --apply-immediately]
```

### RDS API

To convert to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment with the Amazon RDS API, call the
[ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md)
operation and set the `MultiAZ` parameter to true.
