# Publishing database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs

In an on-premises database, the database logs reside on the file system. Amazon RDS doesn't
provide host access to the database logs on the file system of your DB instance. For
this reason, Amazon RDS lets you export database logs to [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/whatiscloudwatchlogs.md). With CloudWatch Logs, you can perform real-time analysis of the
log data. You can also store the data in highly durable storage and manage the data with the
CloudWatch Logs Agent.

## Overview of RDS integration with CloudWatch Logs

In CloudWatch Logs, a _log stream_ is a sequence of log events that share the same source. Each separate source of logs in
CloudWatch Logs makes up a separate log stream. A _log group_ is a group of log streams that share the same retention,
monitoring, and access control settings.

Amazon RDS continuously streams your DB instance log records to a log group. For example, you have a
log group `/aws/rds/instance/instance_name/log_type`
for each type of log that you publish. This log group is in the same AWS Region as the database instance that generates the log.

AWS retains log data published to CloudWatch Logs for an indefinite time period unless you specify a retention period. For more
information, see [Change log data retention in\
CloudWatch Logs](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/working-with-log-groups-and-streams.md#SettingLogRetention).

## Deciding which logs to publish to CloudWatch Logs

Each RDS database engine supports its own set of logs. To learn about the options for your database engine, review the following
topics:

- [Publishing Db2 logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-concepts-db2.md#USER_LogAccess.Db2.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)

- [Publishing MariaDB logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-mariadb-publishtocloudwatchlogs.md)

- [Publishing MySQL logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-mysqldb-publishtocloudwatchlogs.md)

- [Publishing Oracle logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-concepts-oracle.md#USER_LogAccess.Oracle.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)

- [Publishing PostgreSQL logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-concepts-postgresql.md#USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)

- [Publishing SQL Server logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](user-logaccess-concepts-sqlserver.md#USER_LogAccess.SQLServer.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)

## Specifying the logs to publish to CloudWatch Logs

You specify which logs to publish in the console. Make sure that you have a service-linked role in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information
about service-linked roles, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon RDS](usingwithrds-iam-servicelinkedroles.md).

###### To specify the logs to publish

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Do either of the following:

- Choose **Create database**.

- Choose a database from the list, and then choose **Modify**.

4. In **Logs exports**, choose which logs to publish.

The following example specifies the audit log, error logs, general log, and slow query log for an RDS for MySQL DB instance.

## Searching and filtering your logs in CloudWatch Logs

You can search for log entries that meet a specified criteria using the CloudWatch Logs console. You can access the logs either through the RDS console,
which leads you to the CloudWatch Logs console, or from the CloudWatch Logs console directly.

###### To search your RDS logs using the RDS console

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose a DB instance.

4. Choose **Configuration**.

5. Under **Published logs**, choose the database log that you want to view.

###### To search your RDS logs using the CloudWatch Logs console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Log groups**.

3. In the filter box, enter `/aws/rds`.

4. For **Log Groups**, choose the name of the log group
    containing the log stream to search.

5. For **Log Streams**, choose the name of the log stream
    to search.

6. Under **Log events**, enter the filter syntax to use.

data](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/monitoringlogdata.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.
