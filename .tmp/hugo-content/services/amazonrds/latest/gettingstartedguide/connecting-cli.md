# Using the AWS CLI to retrieve and validate connection information for Amazon RDS

While the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) doesn't directly connect to a database for querying or
interactive use, it provides tools to manage and test the connectivity of your Amazon RDS DB
instance. You can retrieve connection details, validate network configurations, and generate
authentication tokens if you're using IAM authentication. This section explains how to use the
AWS CLI to prepare to connect to your database using a client tool.

## Testing connectivity using the AWS CLI

Test connectivity with the AWS CLI to make sure you can reach your DB instance from your
local environment. The following steps guide you through retrieving and verifying connection
details.

###### To test connectivity using the CLI

1. Retrieve the endpoint and port. Use the following [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md)
    command to retrieve connection information for your DB instance:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
     --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-id \
     --query "DBInstances[0].[Endpoint.Address, Endpoint.Port]"
```

Replace `your-db-instance-id` with the identifier of your DB
    instance.

The output should include the endpoint (hostname) and port, which you need in order
    to configure your database client.

2. Verify the output. Make sure that the endpoint and port match the values in the
    AWS Management Console. If there are any discrepancies, check the DB instance
    configuration.

## Resolving network and authentication issues using the AWS CLI

Misconfigured network settings or incorrect authentication credentials are common causes
of connectivity issues. The AWS CLI provides commands to check and resolve these
problems.

1. Check network settings. Network issues often stem from incorrect security group or
    VPC configurations.

- **Verify security group rules**. Make sure that the
security group associated with your DB instance allows inbound traffic on the
database port (for example, 3306 for MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL) from your IP
address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
    --group-ids security-group-id
```

Replace `security-group-id` with the ID of your security
group.

- **Check subnet configurations**. Confirm that your
DB instance resides in a subnet that allows connectivity.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-subnets \
    --subnet-ids subnet-id
```

Replace `subnet-id` with the ID of the subnet for your DB
instance.

2. Validate configuration details. Authentication errors can occur due to incorrect
    credentials or improper IAM configuration.

- **Reset the master password**. If the master
password is incorrect or you forgot it, reset it using the following [moidfy-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md)
command:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier db-instance-id \
    --master-user-password new-password
```

Replace `db-instance-id` with your instance ID and
`new-password` with the new password.

- **Verify the master username**. Confirm the master
username for your DB instance with the following [describe-db-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.md)
command:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-instances \
    --db-instance-identifier db-instance-id \
    --query "DBInstances[0].MasterUsername"
```

Make sure that the username matches what you’re using in your database
client.

- **Check IAM authentication**. If your DB instance
uses IAM authentication, generate a temporary token for login with the following
[generate-db-auth-token](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/generate-db-auth-token.md) command:

```nohighlight

aws rds generate-db-auth-token \
    --hostname endpoint \
    --port port \
    --username iam-user
```

Replace `endpoint`, `port`, and `iam-user` with
your DB instance endpoint, port, and IAM username. For more information, see [IAM database authentication for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL](../userguide/usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

By combining these CLI commands, you can verify that your DB instance is accessible and
correctly configured. If connection issues persist, see [Troubleshooting for Amazon\
RDS](../userguide/chap-troubleshooting.md) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

## Next steps

Once you have the required connection details, including the instance endpoint and port,
you can use them to connect to the DB instance.
