# Aurora MySQL database engine updates: 2016-01-11 (version 1.5) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 1.5

This update includes the following improvements:

## Improvements

- Fixed a 10 second pause of write operations for idle instances during
Aurora storage deployments.

- Logical read-ahead now works when `innodb_file_per_table` is
set to `No`. For more information on logical read-ahead, see
[Aurora MySQL database engine updates: 2015-12-03 (version 1.4) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20151203.md).

- Fixed issues with Aurora Replicas reconnecting with the primary instance.
This improvement also fixes an issue when you specify a large value for the
`quantity` parameter when testing Aurora Replica failures
using fault-injection queries. For more information, see [Testing an Aurora replica failure](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-managing-faultinjectionqueries.md#AuroraMySQL.Managing.FaultInjectionQueries.ReplicaFailure) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Improved monitoring of Aurora Replicas falling behind and
restarting.

- Fixed an issue that caused an Aurora Replica to lag, become deregistered,
and then restart.

- Fixed an issue when you run the `show innodb status` command
during a deadlock.

- Fixed an issue with failovers for larger instances during high write
throughput.

## Integration of MySQL bug fixes

- Addressed incomplete fix in MySQL full text search affecting tables where
the database name begins with a digit. (Port Bug #17607956)
