## Improvements

**High priority fixes:**

- Fixed an issue of intermittent connection failures after certificate rotation.

- Fixed an issue that caused cloning to take longer on some database
clusters with high write loads.

- Fixed an issue that broke logical replication when the
`binlog_checksum` parameter is set to different
values on the master and the replica.

- Fixed an issue where slow log and general log may not properly
rotate on read replicas.

- Fixed an issue with ANSI Read Committed Isolation Level behavior.
