# Aurora MySQL database engine updates: 2017-09-22 (version 1.14.1) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 1.14.1

Aurora MySQL 1.14.1 is generally available. All new database clusters, including those
restored from snapshots, will be created in Aurora MySQL 1.14.1. Aurora MySQL 1.14.1 is also a
mandatory upgrade for existing Aurora MySQL DB clusters. For more information, see [Announcement: Extension to\
mandatory upgrade schedule for Amazon Aurora](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=4983) on the AWS Developer Forums
website.

With version 1.14.1 of Aurora MySQL, we are using a cluster patching model where all nodes in
an Aurora MySQL DB cluster are patched at the same time. Updates require a database restart, so
you will experience 20 to 30 seconds of downtime, after which you can resume using your
DB cluster or clusters. If your DB clusters are
currently running version 1.13 or greater, the zero-downtime patching feature in Aurora MySQL might allow
client connections to your Aurora MySQL primary instance to persist through the upgrade, depending on your
workload.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the
community forums and through [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support).

## Improvements

- Fixed race conditions associated with inserts and purge to improve the
stability of the Fast DDL feature, which remains in Aurora MySQL lab mode.
