## Improvements

Aurora MySQL version 3.02.0 is generally available and generally compatible with community MySQL 8.0.23.

**Fixed security issues and CVEs listed below:**

Fixes and other enhancements to fine-tune handling in a managed environment. Additional CVE fixes below:

- [CVE-2021-22946](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22946)

**New features:**

- Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 is generally available. For more information, see the [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless) overview,
[blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-serverless-v2-is-generally-available-instant-scaling-for-demanding-workloads), and
[Using Aurora Serverless v2](../aurorauserguide/aurora-serverless-v2.md) documentation.
Get started today by creating an Aurora Serverless v2 database using only a few steps in the AWS Management Console.

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause the server to potentially go into a restart loop and cause unavailability while deleting a
record or dropping a table containing two or more variable-length columns (VARCHAR, VARBINARY, BLOB, and TEXT types).
For more details about column types, see [innodb-row-format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-row-format.html).

- Fixed an issue where existing connections timeout and new connections could not be established on a cluster with Binary Log
turned on and has at least one Binary Log consumer attached that results in resource contention between the application
and the consumer(s).

- Freeable memory is indicated by the `FreeableMemory` CloudWatch metric. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon Aurora](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-monitoring-metrics.md).

- Fixed an issue that can cause a DB instance restart or a failover due to a decrease in freeable memory when binary log
replication is enabled.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a DB instance restart or a failover due to a decrease in freeable memory when setting session
variables.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a DB instance restart or a failover due to a decrease in freeable memory when the database
process opens an existing file.

- Fixed an issue which, in rare conditions, can cause a duplicate entry error when inserting new rows into a table containing an
`AUTO_INCREMENT` column on a cluster restored from snapshot.

- Fast insert isn't enabled in this Aurora MySQL version, due to an issue that can cause inconsistencies when running
queries such as `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, and `FROM`. For more information on the fast
insert optimization, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL performance enhancements](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-overview.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Performance).

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where the volume status was not shown when using the `SHOW VOLUME STATUS` command. For more
information, see [AuroraMySQL.Managing.VolumeStatus](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-managing-volumestatus.md).

- Fixed an issue that caused calls to [mysql\_rds\_import\_binlog\_ssl\_material](../userguide/mysql-rds-import-binlog-ssl-material.md) to fail with [MySQL server\
ERROR 3512](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.0/en/server-error-reference.html).

- Fixed an issue where Aurora replica lag is incorrectly reported for deleted Aurora reader instances.

**Upgrades/Migration:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause migration failures of MySQL 8.0.x databases to Aurora MySQL version 3 due to an issue in copying
ibdata files and tablespaces to Aurora storage.

- Fixed an issue which can cause upgrades of clusters from Aurora MySQL version 2 to Aurora MySQL version 3 to fail when database
tables contained a large amount of data.

- Fixed an issue that can cause failures when restoring clusters from Aurora MySQL version 2 to Aurora MySQL version 3 due to a
failure in creating [serialized data\
dictionary information](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/glossary.html) (SDI) for a table.

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQL version 2 to Aurora MySQL version 3 due to schema inconsistency
errors reported by upgrade prechecks for RDS system tables.

- Fixed an issue that can cause failures when migrating or restoring from RDS for MySQL 8.0 or Aurora MySQL version 2 to Aurora MySQL
version 3 databases due to invalid syntax in an RDS managed stored procedure.

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQL 2 to Aurora MySQL 3 due to schema inconsistency errors reported
by upgrade prechecks for the [general log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/query-log.html) and
[slow log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html) tables.

## Integration of MySQL community edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 8.0.23, in addition to the below. For more information, see
[MySQL\
bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 3.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v3).

- Fixed the improper handling of temporary tables used for cursors within stored procedures that could result in unexpected
server behavior, [mysqld-8-0-24-bug](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-24.html). (Bug #32416811)
