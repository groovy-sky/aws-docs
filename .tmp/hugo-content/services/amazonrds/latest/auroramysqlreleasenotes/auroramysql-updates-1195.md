## Improvements

- Fixed an issue on Aurora reader instances that reduced free memory during long-running transactions while there is a heavy transaction commit traffic on the writer instance.

- Fixed a parallel query abort error on Aurora reader instances while a heavy write workload is running on the Aurora writer instance.

- The value of the parameter `aurora_disable_hash_join` is now persisted after database restart or host replacement.

- Fixed an issue related to the Full Text Search cache that caused the Aurora instance to run out of memory.

- Improved stability of the database when the volume size is close to the 64 tebibyte (TiB) volume
limit by reserving 160 GB of space for the recovery workflow to complete without a failover.

- Improved stability of the database when the hash join feature is enabled and the instance is low on memory.

- Fixed the free memory calculation to include swap memory space on T2 instances that caused them to reboot prematurely.

- Fixed an issue in the query cache where the "Too many connections" error could cause a reboot.

## Integration of MySQL community edition bug fixes

- [CVE-2018-2696](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-2696)

- [CVE-2015-4737](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-4737)

- Bug #19929406: HANDLE\_FATAL\_SIGNAL (SIG=11) IN \_\_MEMMOVE\_SSSE3\_BACK FROM STRING::COPY

- Bug #17059925: For [UNION](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/union.html) statements,
the rows-examined value was calculated incorrectly. This was manifested as too-large values for the
`ROWS_EXAMINED` column of Performance Schema statement tables (such as
[events\_statements\_current](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-events-statements-current-table.html)).

- Bug #11827369: Some queries with `SELECT ... FROM DUAL` nested subqueries raised an assertion.

- Bug #16311231: Incorrect results were returned if a query contained a subquery in an
`IN` clause that contained an
[XOR](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/logical-operators.html)
operation in the `WHERE` clause.
