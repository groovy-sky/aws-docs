# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2024-03-15 (version 3.04.2, compatible with MySQL 8.0.28)

**Version:** 3.04.2

Aurora MySQL 3.04.2 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 3.04 versions are compatible with MySQL 8.0.28. For more information on
community changes that have occurred, see [MySQL 8.0 Release\
Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en).

For details of the new features in Aurora MySQL version 3, see [Aurora MySQL version 3 compatible with MySQL 8.0](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-mysql80.md). For
differences between Aurora MySQL version 3 and Aurora MySQL version 2, see [Comparing Aurora MySQL version 2 and Aurora MySQL\
version 3](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-compare-v2-v3.md). For a comparison of Aurora MySQL version 3 and MySQL 8.0 Community Edition, see [Comparing Aurora MySQL version 3 and MySQL 8.0\
Community Edition](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-compare-80-v3.md).

###### Note

This version is designated as a long-term support (LTS) release. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL long-term support (LTS)\
releases](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-update-specialversions.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.LTS) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

We recommend that you don't set the `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade` parameter to
`true` (or enable **Auto minor version upgrade** in the AWS Management Console) for LTS versions. Doing so could lead
to your DB cluster being upgraded to the next target version for Automatic Minor Version Upgrade campaign, which may not be an LTS version.

Currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 2.07.9, 2.7.10, 2.11.\*, 2.12.\*, 3.03.\*, 3.04.\*, 3.05.\*, and 3.06.\*.

You can perform an in-place upgrade, restore a snapshot, or initiate a managed blue/green upgrade using [Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments](../aurorauserguide/blue-green-deployments-overview.md) from any
currently available Aurora MySQL version 2 cluster into an Aurora MySQL version 3.04.2 cluster.

For information on planning an upgrade to Aurora MySQL version 3, see [Upgrade planning\
for Aurora MySQL version 3](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-mysql80-upgrade-procedure.md#AuroraMySQL.mysql80-planning) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_. For general information about Aurora MySQL
upgrades, see [Upgrading\
Amazon Aurora MySQL DB clusters](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-upgrading.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting upgrade issues with Aurora MySQL version 3](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-mysql80-upgrade-procedure.md#AuroraMySQL.mysql80-upgrade-troubleshooting).

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md)
in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs:**

The following CVE fixes are included in this release:

- [CVE-2020-11104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11104)

- [CVE-2020-11105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11105)

- [CVE-2023-38545](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545)

- [CVE-2023-38546](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38546)

- [CVE-2023-39975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39975)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where a read replica DB instance can't be launched successfully when there's high workload in the
writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora MySQL writer DB instance can fail over due to a defect in the component that communicates with
Aurora storage. The defect occurs as a result of a breakdown in the communication between the DB instance and underlying
storage following a software update.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database instance restart when running [SHOW STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-status.html) and [PURGE BINARY LOGS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/purge-binary-logs.html) statements
concurrently. `PURGE BINARY LOGS` is a managed statement that is run to honor the user-configured binlog
retention period.

- Fixed an issue that, during the restart of a database instance, can cause an additional restart.

- Fixed an issue with lock contention caused by an audit logging thread that can lead to high CPU utilization and client
application timeouts.

- Fixed an issue where an Aurora MySQL database instance can experience multiple restarts during instance startup while
large rollback segments are initialized.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a DB instance to restart while running a query that references an aggregate
function.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause a parallel query to fail due to transient network issues while reading data from the Aurora DB
cluster volume

- Fixed an issue where the user is unable to interrupt any query or set session timeouts for
`performance_schema` queries.

- Fixed an issue where binary log (binlog) replication configured to use custom SSL certificates ( [mysql.rds\_import\_binlog\_ssl\_material](../aurorauserguide/mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_import_binlog_ssl_material)) could fail when the replication instance is undergoing a host
replacement.

- Fixed an issue related to audit log file management that can cause log files to be inaccessible for download or
rotation, and in some cases increase CPU usage.

- Optimized `AUTO_INCREMENT` key recovery to reduce the completion time for restoring snapshots, performing
point-in-time recovery, and cloning DB clusters with large numbers of tables in the database.

- Fixed an issue where SQL statements referring to some `performance_schema` tables can return an error due
to these tables being missing after migrating from Community MySQL to Aurora MySQL versions 3.04.0 and 3.04.1.

- Fixed an issue where small read replica instances can experience increased replication lag after upgrading from
Aurora MySQL versions lower than 2.11.\*.

- Fixed an issue that can cause duplicate key errors for `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns using descending indices
after a snapshot restore, backtrack, or database cloning operation.

- Fixed an issue that can cause modifications of the `table_open_cache` database parameter not to take effect
until the DB instance is restarted.

- Fixed an issue where the reader DB instance is unable to open a table, with **`ERROR 1146`**. This
issue occurs when running certain types of online Data Definition Language (DDL) statements while the
`INPLACE` algorithm is being used on the writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue to avoid an instance restart during Aurora Serverless v2 scaling when the internal monitoring process
erroneously submits duplicate scaling requests.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database restart when connected binary log (binlog) consumers are using duplicate
binlog replication server IDs.

**Upgrades and migrations:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause major version upgrades to Aurora MySQL version 3 to fail due to the presence of orphaned
entries for already deleted tablespaces in InnoDB system tables in Aurora MySQL version 2.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 8.0.28, in addition to the following. For more information,
see [MySQL\
bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 3.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v3).

- Fixed an issue where cache line value can be calculated incorrectly, causing a failure during database restart on
Graviton-based instances. (Community Bug Fix #35479763)

- Repeated running of a stored routine, having as a subquery a SELECT statement containing multiple `AND`,
`OR`, or `XOR` conditions, led to excessive consumption and possibly eventual exhaustion of
virtual memory. (Community Bug Fix #33852530)
