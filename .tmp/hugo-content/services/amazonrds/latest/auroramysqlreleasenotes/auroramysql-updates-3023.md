## Improvements

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue which can cause the database instance to restart due to incorrectly accessing invalid memory when a connection
is closed immediately after committing a transaction.

- Fast insert isn't enabled in this Aurora MySQL version, due to an issue that can cause inconsistencies when running
queries such as `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, and `FROM`. For more information on the fast
insert optimization, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL performance enhancements](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-overview.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Performance).

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where unsupported index scan access methods were considered for common table expressions (CTE) while
materializing intermediate temporary tables, which can lead to undesired behavior including database restarts or
incorrect query results. This issue was fixed by avoiding the use of such unsupported index scan access methods on
tables using the TempTable storage engine.

- Fixed an issue which, in rare cases, can cause an Aurora MySQL reader instance to restart when accessing a table which has large
update or Data Definition Language (DDL) operations running concurrently on the Aurora MySQL writer instance.

- Fixed an issue which, in certain situations, can cause Aurora MySQL reader instances to restart when attempting to read a page
which is no longer accessible during a range estimation.

- Fixed an issue where database instances using binary log replication may experience an increase in CPU utilization and
connection failures when multiple binary log replication consumers are attached.

- Fixed an issue which can cause an Aurora MySQL reader instance to restart while executing a query which utilizes an Aurora
parallel query execution plan.
