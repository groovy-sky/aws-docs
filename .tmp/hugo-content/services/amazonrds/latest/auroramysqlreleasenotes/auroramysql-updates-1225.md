## Improvements

**Availability improvements:**

- Resolved an issue that could cause the database to stall, and subsequently restart or fail over due to a
concurrency conflict between internal cleanup threads.

- Resolved an issue that could cause the cluster to become unavailable if the database restarted while
holding XA transactions in prepared state, and then restarted again before those transactions were
committed or rolled back. Prior to this fix, you can address the issue by restoring the cluster to a point
in time before the first restart.

- Resolved an issue that could cause the InnoDB purge to become blocked if the database restarts while
processing a DDL statement. As a result, the InnoDB history list length would grow and the cluster storage
volume would keep growing until it fills up, making the database unavailable. Prior to this fix, you can
mitigate the issue by restarting the database again to unblock purge.
