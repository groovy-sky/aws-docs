**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that causes an Aurora MySQL DB instance to restart when running a
parallel query.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database server to restart due to the concurrent
access of connection resources during seamless scaling, zero downtime restart (ZDR), and
zero downtime patching (ZDP).

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance to restart when freeing memory used
for log application.

- Fixed an issue in a background process that caused prolonged or failed running of
queries while the background operation drops temporary indexes.

- Fixed an issue with startup routines that can cause writer DB instances to restart due
to metadata inconsistency.

- Added an indicator for transaction recovery progress. This avoids potential
unavailability, in rare situations, when transaction recovery takes a long time to
complete.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance to restart when reading a table
that is being altered or dropped on the writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue where a low `thread_stack` parameter value caused the
database to restart repeatedly. The minimum allowed `thread_stack` value has
been increased from 131,072 to 136,192 to ensure successful booting and prevent startup
issues.

- Fixed an issue that causes a reader DB instance to restart when running a parallel
query.

- Fixed an issue that can cause Aurora read replicas to restart in the event of certain
rare transaction commit orders on the writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue that, in rare cases, can cause a DB instance to restart when a
read-only transaction obtains shared locks.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance that uses write forwarding to
restart when a forwarded [implicit commit\
statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html) encounters an error.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause SQL statements to experience unexpected primary key
violation errors or warnings on some rows when performing concurrent `INSERT`
statements on a table that has an `AUTO_INCREMENT` primary key column and a
unique key column, and when an `INSERT` statement has unique key violations on
different rows.

- Fixed an issue that can lead to incorrect query results when ZDR incorrectly restores
session variables set as hints in queries.

- Fixed an issue in parallel query that causes an incomplete result set to be returned
when using the built-in `LPAD` and `RPAD` string functions.

- Fixed an issue that causes missing foreign key indexes on reader DB instances when an
`ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN` statement is run on the writer DB instance
against a table with a foreign key.

- Fixed an issue that can cause failure in completing the process of disabling write
forwarding.

- Fixed an issue during Aurora Serverless v1 scaling that causes the DB instance to
restart due to incorrect access to an internal data structure while finding a scaling
point.

- Fixed an issue where the Performance Schema wasn't enabled when Performance Insights automated
management was turned on for db.t4g.medium and db.t4g.large DB instances.

- The request timeout for [Aurora machine learning](../aurorauserguide/mysql-ml.md) operations to Amazon SageMaker AI has been
increased from 3 to 30 seconds. This helps resolve an issue where customers might see an
increased number of retries or failures for requests to Amazon SageMaker AI from Aurora machine
learning when using larger batch sizes.

- Fixed an issue where slow `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and
`UPDATE` queries run by the MySQL [Event\
Scheduler](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/event-scheduler.html) weren't recorded in the slow query log unless preceded by a slow
`SELECT` query.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 5.7.44. For more
information, see [MySQL bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 2.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v2).

- Fixed an issue where temporary tables bound to triggers while running statements could
cause an unexpected DB engine restart.

- Fixed a defect that can cause the server to exit when single-table `UPDATE`
and `DELETE` statements using indexed expressions are run as prepared
statements. ( [Bug #29257254](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-17.html))

## Features not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2

The following features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible with MySQL 5.7).

- Scan batching

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

This Aurora MySQL version is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

This Aurora MySQL version does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- X Protocol
