# Aurora MySQL database engine updates: 2016-09-20 (version 1.7.1) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 1.7.1

## Improvements

- Fixes an issue where an Aurora Replica crashes if the InnoDB full-text
search cache is full.

- Fixes an issue where the database engine crashes if a worker thread in the
thread pool waits for itself.

- Fixes an issue where an Aurora Replica crashes if a metadata lock on a
table causes a deadlock.

- Fixes an issue where the database engine crashes due to a race condition
between two worker threads in the thread pool.

- Fixes an issue where an unnecessary failover occurs under heavy load if
the monitoring agent doesn't detect the advancement of write operations to
the distributed storage subsystem.
