# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2021-02-26 (version 2.09.2) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.09.2

Aurora MySQL 2.09.2 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7 and Aurora MySQL
1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

Currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 1.19.5, 1.19.6, 1.22.\*, 1.23.\*, 2.04.\*, 2.07.\*, 2.08.\*, 2.09.\*, 2.10.\*, 3.01.\* and 3.02.\*.

You can upgrade an existing Aurora MySQL 2.\* database cluster to Aurora MySQL 2.09.2. For clusters running
Aurora MySQL version 1, you can upgrade an existing Aurora MySQL 1.23 or higher cluster directly to 2.09.2. You can
also restore a snapshot from any currently supported Aurora MySQL release into Aurora MySQL 2.09.2.

To create a cluster with an older version of Aurora MySQL, specify the engine version through the AWS Management Console, the
AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Note

For information on how to upgrade your Aurora MySQL database cluster, see [Upgrading the minor version or patch level of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-patching.md) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue introduced in 2.09.0 that can cause elevated write latency during the scaling of the
cluster storage volume.

- Fixed an issue in the dynamic resizing feature that could cause Aurora Read Replicas to restart.

- Fixed an issue that could cause longer downtime during upgrade from 1.23.\* to 2.09.\*.

- Fixed an issue where a DDL or DML could cause engine restart during a page prefetch request.

- Fixed an issue that caused a binlog replica to stop with an error if the replicated transaction contains a
DDL statement and a large number of row changes.

- Fixed an issue where a database acting as a binlog replica could restart while replicating a DDL event on
the mysql `time_zone` table.

- Fixed an issue that could cause large transactions to generate incorrect binlog events if the
`binlog_checksum` parameter was set to `NONE`.

- Fixed an issue that caused a binlog replica to stop with an `HA_ERR_KEY_NOT_FOUND` error.

- Improved overall stability.

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL Version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL Version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

This Aurora MySQL version is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

This Aurora MySQL version does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement
