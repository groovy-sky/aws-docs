# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2023-02-14 (version 2.11.1, compatible with MySQL 5.7.12) - RDS Extended Support version

**Version:** 2.11.1

Aurora MySQL 2.11.1 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.11 versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7.12.
For more information on community changes, see [Changes in MySQL 5.7.12 (2016-04-11, General Availability)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-12.html).

Currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 1.19.5, 1.19.6, 1.22.\*, 1.23.\*, 2.07.\*, 2.09.\*, 2.10.\*, 2.11.\*, 3.01.\* and 3.02.\*.

You can upgrade an existing Aurora MySQL 2.\* database cluster to Aurora MySQL 2.11.1. For clusters running
Aurora MySQL version 1, you can upgrade an existing Aurora MySQL 1.23 or higher cluster directly to 2.11.1. You can
also restore a snapshot from any currently supported Aurora MySQL release into Aurora MySQL 2.11.1.

If you upgrade an Aurora MySQL global database to version 2.11.\* and you have write forwarding turned on, you must upgrade your primary and secondary DB clusters to the exact same version, including the patch level, to continue using write forwarding.
For more information on upgrading the minor version of an Aurora global database, see [Minor version upgrades](../aurorauserguide/aurora-global-database-upgrade.md#aurora-global-database-upgrade.minor).

Immediately after an in-place engine version upgrade to Aurora MySQL 2.11.\* is performed, an operating system upgrade is applied
automatically to all affected instances on the db.r4, db.r5, db.t2, and db.t3 DB instance classes, if the instances are running an
old operating system version. In a Multi-AZ DB cluster, all of the reader instances apply the operating system upgrade first. When
the operating system upgrade on the first reader instance is finished, a failover occurs and the previous writer instance is
upgraded.

###### Note

The operating system upgrade isn't applied automatically to Aurora global databases during major version upgrades.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs listed below:**

Fixes and other enhancements to fine-tune handling in a managed environment. Additional CVE fixes below:

- [CVE-2022-32221](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32221)

- [CVE-2021-36222](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36222)

- [CVE-2021-22926](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22926)

- [CVE-2021-2169](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-2169)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where connection surges can cause increased query latency or a database instance restart.

- Fixed an issue which, in rare cases, can cause an Aurora replica to restart during simultaneous execution of large update operations or
Data Definition Language (DDL) workloads on the writer instance and read operations on the same set of tables on the Aurora replica.

- Fixed an issue where connection surges could cause the connection establishment process to take longer to complete or to fail with timeout errors.

- Fixed an issue where the Advanced Audit log rotation may reduce the freeable memory, which could lead to the database instance restarting.

- Fast insert isn't enabled in this Aurora MySQL version, due to an issue that can cause inconsistencies when running
queries such as `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, and `FROM`. For more information on the fast
insert optimization, see [Amazon Aurora MySQL performance enhancements](../aurorauserguide/aurora-auroramysql-overview.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Performance).

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue where the [SSL server status variables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html)) weren't being populated.

- Fixed an issue where the Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements executing duplicate writes could lead to excessive error logging and increased query latencies.

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

This Aurora MySQL version is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

This Aurora MySQL version does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement
