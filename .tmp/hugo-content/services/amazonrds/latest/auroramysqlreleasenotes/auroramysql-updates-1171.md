# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2018-03-23 (version 1.17.1) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 1.17.1

Aurora MySQL 1.17.1 is generally available. All new database clusters, including those restored
from snapshots, will be created in Aurora MySQL 1.17.1. You have the option, but are not required, to
upgrade existing database clusters to Aurora MySQL 1.17.1. You can create new DB clusters in Aurora MySQL
1.15.1, Aurora MySQL 1.16, or Aurora MySQL 1.17. You can do so using the AWS CLI or the Amazon RDS API and specifying
the engine version.

With version 1.17.1 of Aurora MySQL, we are using a cluster patching model where all nodes in an Aurora DB
cluster are patched at the same time. This release fixes some known engine issues as well as regressions.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Note

There is an issue in the latest version of the Aurora MySQL engine. After upgrading to 1.17.1,
the engine version is reported incorrectly as `1.17`. If you upgraded to 1.17.1, you can
confirm the upgrade by checking the **Maintenance** column for the DB cluster in the AWS Management Console.
If it displays `none`, then the engine is upgraded to 1.17.1.

## Improvements

- Fixed an issue in binary log recovery that resulted in longer recovery times for situations
with large binary log index files which can happen if binary logs rotate very often.

- Fixed an issue in the query optimizer that generated an inefficient query plan for partitioned tables.

- Fixed an issue in the query optimizer due to which a range query resulted in a restart of the database engine.
