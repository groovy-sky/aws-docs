## Improvements

**Fixed security issues and CVEs:**

- Enabled support for FIPS-validated cryptography, a fully owned AWS implementation. For more information, see
[AWS-LC is now FIPS 140-3 certified](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-lc-is-now-fips-140-3-certified) on
[AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security).

This release includes all community CVE fixes up to and including MySQL 8.0.36. The
following CVE fixes are included:

- [CVE-2020-11104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11104)

- [CVE-2020-11105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11105)

- [CVE-2023-38545](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545)

- [CVE-2023-38546](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38546)

- [CVE-2023-39975](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39975)

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance to restart when reading a
table that is being altered or dropped on the writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue that can cause an Aurora MySQL writer DB instance to restart when
a write forwarding session is closed while running a forwarded query.

- Fixed an issue that causes a DB instance to restart when handling large GTID
sets on a binary log–enabled instance.

- Fixed an issue when processing `INSERT` queries on InnoDB partitioned tables that can cause a gradual
decline of free memory in the instance.

- Fixed an issue that, in rare conditions, can cause the reader DB instances to restart.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database instance to restart when running
[SHOW\
STATUS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-status.html) and [PURGE\
BINARY LOGS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/purge-binary-logs.html) statements concurrently. `PURGE BINARY LOGS`
is a managed statement that is run to honor the user-configured binlog retention
period.

- Fixed an issue that can cause the server to unexpectedly close after running Data Manipulation Language (DML)
statements on a table whose nonvirtual columns were reordered with a `MODIFY COLUMN` or `CHANGE
                          COLUMN` statement.

- Fixed an issue that, during the restart of a database instance, can cause an additional restart.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance that uses write forwarding to restart when a forwarded [implicit commit statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html) encounters an
error.

- Fixed an issue that, in rare conditions, can cause a reader instance to restart when performing `SELECT`
queries on tables with a foreign key constraint.

- Fixed an issue where DB instances using multi-TB Aurora cluster volumes can
experience increased downtime during restart due to InnoDB buffer pool
validation failures.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database to restart when a cascading
`UPDATE` or `DELETE` foreign key constraint is defined
on a table where a virtual column is involved either as a column in the foreign
key constraint, or as a member of the referenced table.

- Fixed an issue that can interrupt database recovery during startup if the restart occurred while running heavy insert
operations involving `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns.

- Fixed an issue in Aurora Serverless v2 that can lead to a database restart while scaling up.

**General improvements:**

- Reduced I/O usage and improved performance for a subset of primary key range
scan queries that employ parallel query.

- [Aurora MySQL version 3.06.0](auroramysql-updates-3060.md)
added support for Amazon Bedrock integration. As part of this, new reserved keywords
( `accept`, `aws_bedrock_invoke_model`,
`aws_sagemaker_invoke_endpoint`, `content_type`, and
`timeout_ms`) were added. In Aurora MySQL version 3.07.0, these
keywords have been changed to nonreserved keywords, which are permitted as
identifiers without quoting. For more information on how MySQL handles reserved
and nonreserved keywords, see [Keywords and\
reserved words](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keywords.html) in the MySQL documentation.

- Fixed an issue that didn't clearly return an error message to the client when
invoking the Amazon Bedrock service from an Aurora MySQL DB cluster in an AWS Region where
Amazon Bedrock isn't yet available.

- Fixed an issue that can cause excessive memory consumption when querying
`BLOB` columns using Aurora parallel query.

- Added support for the `connection_memory_limit` and
`connection_memory_chunk_size` parameters to be set at the
session level to behave the same as in MySQL Community Edition. The
`connection_memory_limit` is used to set the maximum amount of
memory that can be used by a single user connection. The
`connection_memory_chunk_size` parameter can be used to set the
chunking size for updates to the [global memory usage counter](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html).

- Fixed an issue where the user is unable to interrupt any query or set session timeouts for
`performance_schema` queries.

- Fixed an issue where binary log (binlog) replication configured to use custom SSL certificates ( [mysql.rds\_import\_binlog\_ssl\_material](../aurorauserguide/mysql-stored-proc-replicating.md#mysql_rds_import_binlog_ssl_material)) could fail when the replication instance is undergoing a host
replacement.

- Added the `Aurora_fts_cache_memory_used` global status variable to
track memory usage for the full-text search system across all tables. For more
information, see [Aurora MySQL global status variables](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-reference-parametergroups.md#AuroraMySQL.Reference.GlobalStatusVars) in the _Amazon Aurora User_
_Guide_.

- Fixed an issue where an Amazon Redshift cluster configured as a zero-ETL destination
might experience a temporary increase in [IntegrationLag](../../../redshift/latest/mgmt/zero-etl-using-monitoring.md) when an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster is configured as a
binary log replica, with Enhanced Binlog and zero-ETL integration
enabled.

- Fixed an issue related to audit log file management that can cause log files to be inaccessible for download or
rotation, and in some cases increase CPU usage.

- Optimized `AUTO_INCREMENT` key recovery to reduce the completion time for restoring snapshots, performing
point-in-time recovery, and cloning DB clusters with large numbers of tables in the database.

- Fixed an issue where the [wait/io/redo\_log\_flush](../aurorauserguide/ams-waits-io-auredologflush.md) event wasn't
shown in the Performance Schema [wait event summary\
tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.html).

- Fixed an issue that can cause duplicate key errors for `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns using descending indices
after a snapshot restore, backtrack, or database cloning operation.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a writer DB instance to restart when a reader DB
instance using write forwarding runs a Data Manipulation Language (DML)
statement that contains a timestamp value and the ` time_zone`
database parameter is set to `UTC`.

- Fixed an issue where a `SELECT` query on an Aurora reader instance might fail with the error
**`table doesn't exist`** when the table has at least one full-text search (FTS) index and a
`TRUNCATE` statement is being run on the Aurora writer DB instance.

- Fixed an issue that, in rare cases, causes zero-downtime patching (ZDP) to fail.

- Fixed an issue that can cause an incomplete result set when running queries involving `LEFT JOIN` or
`RIGHT JOIN` operations using the hash join algorithm with parallel query.

**Upgrades and migrations:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQL version 2 to
Aurora MySQL version 3 when there is a user-defined `FTS_DOC_ID` column
present in the table schema.

- Fixed an issue that can cause upgrade failures from Aurora MySQL version 2 to
Aurora MySQL version 3 due to a synchronization issue while processing InnoDB
tablespaces.

- Fixed an issue that can cause major version upgrades to Aurora MySQL version 3 to fail due to the presence of orphaned
entries for already deleted tablespaces in InnoDB system tables in Aurora MySQL version 2.

- Fixed an issue where the [SERVER\_ID](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-reference-istables.md#AuroraMySQL.Reference.ISTables.replica_host_status) value wasn't updated after an Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployment
switchover. This led to issues where smart drivers such as the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) JDBC Driver](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper) were unable to discover the DB cluster topology
after a blue/green switchover. With this fix, Aurora DB clusters renamed as part
of an RDS Blue/Green Deployment, that are running on Aurora MySQL version 3.07 and
higher, will have the `SERVER_ID` value updated as part of the
switchover. For earlier versions, the DB instances in the blue and green
clusters can be rebooted to update the `SERVER_ID` value.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 8.0.36, in addition to the following. For more information,
see [MySQL\
bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 3.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v3).

- Fixed an issue where cache line value can be calculated incorrectly, causing a failure during database restart on
Graviton-based instances. (Community Bug Fix #35479763)

- Fixed an issue where some instances of subqueries within stored routines were
not handled correctly. (Community Bug Fix #35377192)

- Fixed an issue that can cause higher CPU usage due to background TLS certificate rotation (Community Bug Fix
#34284186).

- Fixed an issue where InnoDB allowed the addition of `INSTANT` columns to tables in the MySQL system schema
in Aurora MySQL versions lower than 3.05, which could lead to the server unexpectedly closing (database instance
restarting) after upgrading to Aurora MySQL version 3.05.0. (Community Bug Fix #35625510).
