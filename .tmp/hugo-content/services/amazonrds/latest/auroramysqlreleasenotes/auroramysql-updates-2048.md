# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2019-11-20 (version 2.04.8) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.04.8

Aurora MySQL 2.04.8 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

Currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 1.19.5, 1.19.6, 1.22.\*, 1.23.\*, 2.04.\*, 2.07.\*, 2.08.\*, 2.09.\*, 2.10.\*, 3.01.\* and 3.02.\*.

You can restore a snapshot of any 2.\* Aurora MySQL release into Aurora MySQL 2.04.8.
You also have the option to upgrade existing Aurora MySQL 2.\* database clusters to Aurora MySQL 2.04.8.

To create a cluster with an older version of Aurora MySQL, please specify the engine version through the AWS Management Console,
the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

If you have any questions or concerns, AWS Support is available on the community forums and through
[AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support). For more information, see
[Maintaining an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/user-upgradedbinstance-maintenance.md) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

###### Note

For information on how to upgrade your Aurora MySQL database cluster, see [Upgrading the minor version or patch level of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-updates-patching.md) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Improvements

**New features:**

- **Read replica improvements:**

- Reduced network traffic from the writer instance by efficiently
transmitting data to reader instances within the Aurora DB
cluster. This improvement is enabled by default, because it helps
prevent replicas from falling behind and restarting. The
parameter for this feature is `aurora_enable_repl_bin_log_filtering`.

- Reduced network traffic from the writer to reader instances within
the Aurora DB cluster using compression. This
improvement is enabled by default for 8xlarge and 16xlarge
instance classes only, because these instances can tolerate
additional CPU overhead for compression. The parameter for this
feature is `aurora_enable_replica_log_compression`.

**High-priority fixes:**

- Improved memory management in the Aurora writer instance that prevents
restart of writer due to out of memory conditions during heavy
workload in presence of reader instances within the Aurora DB cluster.

- Fix for a non-deterministic condition in the scheduler that results in engine restart
while accessing the performance schema object concurrently.

## Comparison with Aurora MySQL version 1

The following Amazon Aurora MySQL features are supported in Aurora MySQL Version 1 (compatible with
MySQL 5.6), but these features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL Version 2 (compatible
with MySQL 5.7).

- Asynchronous key prefetch (AKP). For more
information, see [Optimizing Aurora indexed join queries with asynchronous key prefetch](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.AKP) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Hash joins. For more information, see [Optimizing large Aurora MySQL join queries with hash joins](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-bestpractices.md#Aurora.BestPractices.HashJoin) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Native functions for synchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Invoking a Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-integrating-lambda.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.NativeLambda) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

- Migrating data from MySQL using an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Migrating data from MySQL by using an Amazon S3 bucket](../aurorauserguide/auroramysql-migrating-extmysql.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.04.8 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.04.8 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement
