# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2019-05-09 (version 2.04.3) (Deprecated)

**Version:** 2.04.3

Aurora MySQL 2.04.3 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7
and Aurora MySQL 1.x versions are compatible with MySQL 5.6.

Currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 1.19.5, 1.19.6, 1.22.\*, 1.23.\*, 2.04.\*, 2.07.\*, 2.08.\*, 2.09.\*, 2.10.\*, 3.01.\* and 3.02.\*.

When creating a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster (including restoring a snapshot), you have the
option of choosing compatibility with either MySQL 5.7 or MySQL 5.6. We do not allow in-place
upgrade of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters or restore of Aurora MySQL 1.\* clusters from an Amazon S3 backup into Aurora MySQL 2.04.3.
We plan to remove these restrictions in a later Aurora MySQL 2.\* release.

You can restore snapshots of Aurora MySQL 1.14.\*, 1.15.\*, 1.16.\*, 1.17.\*, 1.18.\*, 1.19.\*,
2.01.\*, 2.02.\*, 2.03.\*, and 2.04.\* into Aurora MySQL 2.04.3.

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

Aurora MySQL 2.04.3 is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

Aurora MySQL 2.04.3 does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins
