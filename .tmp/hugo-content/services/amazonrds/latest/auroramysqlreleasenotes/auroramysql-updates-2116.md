# Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2024-07-19 (version 2.11.6, compatible with MySQL 5.7.12) - RDS Extended Support version

**Version:** 2.11.6

Aurora MySQL 2.11.6 is generally available. Aurora MySQL 2.11 versions are compatible with MySQL 5.7.12. For more information on community changes, see
[Changes in MySQL 5.7.12 (2016-04-11, General Availability)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-12.html).

The currently supported Aurora MySQL releases are 2.07.9, 2.07.10, 2.11.\*, 2.12.\*, 3.01.\*, 3.02.\*, 3.03.\*, 3.04.\*, 3.05.\*, 3.06.\*, and 3.07.\*.

You can upgrade an existing Aurora MySQL 2.\* database cluster to Aurora MySQL 2.11.6. You can also restore a snapshot from any currently supported lower
Aurora MySQL version 2 release into Aurora MySQL 2.11.6.

If you upgrade an Aurora MySQL global database to version 2.11.\*, you must upgrade your primary and secondary DB clusters to the exact same version, including the
patch level. For more information on upgrading the minor version of an Aurora global database, see
[Minor version upgrades](../aurorauserguide/aurora-global-database-upgrade.md#aurora-global-database-upgrade.minor).

Immediately after an in-place engine version upgrade to Aurora MySQL 2.11.\* is performed, an operating system upgrade is applied
automatically to all affected instances on the db.r4, db.r5, db.t2, and db.t3 DB instance classes, if the instances are running an
old operating system version. In a Multi-AZ DB cluster, all of the reader instances apply the operating system upgrade first. When
the operating system upgrade on the first reader instance is finished, a failover occurs and the previous writer instance is
upgraded.

###### Note

The operating system upgrade isn't applied automatically to Aurora global databases during major version upgrades.

**Availability improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause a database server to restart due to the concurrent access of connection resources during seamless scaling,
zero-downtime restart (ZDR), and zero-downtime patching (ZDP).

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance to restart when freeing memory used
for log application.

- Fixed an issue that causes a reader DB instance to restart when running a parallel
query.

- Fixed an issue that can cause a reader DB instance that uses write forwarding to
restart when a forwarded [implicit commit\
statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html) encounters an error.

**General improvements:**

- Fixed an issue that can cause SQL statements to experience unexpected primary key
violation errors or warnings on some rows when performing concurrent `INSERT`
statements on a table that has an `AUTO_INCREMENT` primary key column and a
unique key column, and when an `INSERT` statement has unique key violations on
different rows.

- Fixed an issue that can lead to incorrect query results when ZDR incorrectly restores session variables set as hints in queries.

- Fixed an issue during Aurora Serverless v1 scaling that causes the DB instance to
restart due to incorrect access to an internal data structure while finding a scaling
point.

- Fixed an issue where slow `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and
`UPDATE` queries run by the MySQL [Event\
Scheduler](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/event-scheduler.html) weren't recorded in the slow query log unless preceded by a slow
`SELECT` query.

## Integration of MySQL Community Edition bug fixes

This release includes all community bug fixes up to and including 5.7.12. For more
information, see [MySQL bugs fixed by Aurora MySQL 2.x database engine updates](auroramysql-updates-mysqlbugs.md#AuroraMySQL.Updates.MySQLBugs.v2).

## Features not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2

The following features are currently not supported in Aurora MySQL version 2 (compatible with MySQL 5.7).

- Scan batching. For more information, see [Aurora MySQL database engine updates 2017-12-11 (version 1.16) (Deprecated)](auroramysql-updates-20171211.md).

## MySQL 5.7 compatibility

This Aurora MySQL version is wire-compatible with MySQL 5.7 and includes features such as JSON support, spatial indexes,
and generated columns. Aurora MySQL uses a native implementation of spatial indexing using z-order curves to deliver
>20x better write performance and >10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.

This Aurora MySQL version does not currently support the following MySQL 5.7 features:

- Group replication plugin

- Increased page size

- InnoDB buffer pool loading at startup

- InnoDB full-text parser plugin

- Multisource replication

- Online buffer pool resizing

- Password validation plugin

- Query rewrite plugins

- Replication filtering

- The `CREATE TABLESPACE` SQL statement
