# Troubleshooting for Aurora MySQL in-place upgrade

Use the following tips to help troubleshoot problems with Aurora MySQL in-place upgrades. These tips don't apply to Aurora Serverless DB
clusters.

Reason for in-place upgrade being canceled or slowEffectSolution to allow in-place upgrade to complete within maintenance windowAssociated Aurora cross-Region replica isn't patched yetAurora cancels the upgrade.Upgrade the Aurora cross-Region replica and try again.Cluster has XA transactions in the prepared stateAurora cancels the upgrade.Commit or roll back all prepared XA transactions.Cluster is processing any data definition language (DDL) statementsAurora cancels the upgrade.Consider waiting and performing the upgrade after all DDL statements are finished.Cluster has uncommitted changes for many rowsUpgrade might take a long time.

The upgrade process rolls back the uncommitted changes. The indicator for this condition is the value of `TRX_ROWS_MODIFIED` in
the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TRX` table.

Consider performing the upgrade only after all large transactions are committed or rolled back.

Cluster has high number of undo recordsUpgrade might take a long time.

Even if the uncommitted transactions don't affect a large number of rows, they might involve a large volume of data. For example, you
might be inserting large BLOBs. Aurora doesn't automatically detect or generate an event for this kind of transaction activity. The
indicator for this condition is the history list length (HLL). The upgrade process rolls back the uncommitted changes.

You can check the HLL in the output from the `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` SQL command, or directly by using the following SQL
query:

```nohighlight

SELECT count FROM information_schema.innodb_metrics WHERE name = 'trx_rseg_history_len';
```

You can also monitor the `RollbackSegmentHistoryListLength` metric in Amazon CloudWatch.

Consider performing the upgrade only after the HLL is smaller.

Cluster is in the process of committing a large binary log transactionUpgrade might take a long time.

The upgrade process waits until the binary log changes are applied. More transactions or DDL statements could start during this period,
further slowing down the upgrade process.

Schedule the upgrade process when the cluster isn't busy with generating binary log replication changes. Aurora doesn't
automatically detect or generate an event for this condition.

Schema inconsistencies resulting from file removal or corruptionAurora cancels the upgrade.

Change the default storage engine for temporary tables from MyISAM to InnoDB. Perform the following steps:

1. Modify the `default_tmp_storage_engine` DB parameter to `InnoDB`.

2. Reboot the DB cluster.

3. After rebooting, confirm that the `default_tmp_storage_engine` DB parameter is set to `InnoDB`. Use the following
    command:

```nohighlight

show global variables like 'default_tmp_storage_engine';
```

4. Make sure not to create any temporary tables that use the MyISAM storage engine. We recommend that you pause any database workload and
    not create any new database connections, because you're upgrading soon.

5. Try the in-place upgrade again.

Master user was deletedAurora cancels the upgrade.

###### Important

Don't delete the master user.

However, if for some reason you should happen to delete the master user, restore it using the following SQL commands:

```nohighlight

CREATE USER 'master_username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'master_user_password' REQUIRE NONE PASSWORD EXPIRE DEFAULT ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, PROCESS, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES,
LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE USER, EVENT,
TRIGGER, LOAD FROM S3, SELECT INTO S3, INVOKE LAMBDA, INVOKE SAGEMAKER, INVOKE COMPREHEND ON *.* TO 'master_username'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

You can use the following steps to perform your own checks for some of the conditions in the preceding table. That way, you can schedule the upgrade
at a time when you know the database is in a state where the upgrade can complete successfully and quickly.

- You can check for open XA transactions by executing the `XA RECOVER` statement. You can then commit or roll back the XA transactions
before starting the upgrade.

- You can check for DDL statements by executing a `SHOW PROCESSLIST` statement and looking for `CREATE`, `DROP`,
`ALTER`, `RENAME`, and `TRUNCATE` statements in the output. Allow all DDL statements to finish before starting the
upgrade.

- You can check the total number of uncommitted rows by querying the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TRX` table. The table contains one row
for each transaction. The `TRX_ROWS_MODIFIED` column contains the number of rows modified or inserted by the transaction.

- You can check the length of the InnoDB history list by executing the `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS SQL` statement and looking for the
`History list length` in the output. You can also check the value directly by running the following query:

```nohighlight

SELECT count FROM information_schema.innodb_metrics WHERE name = 'trx_rseg_history_len';

```

The length of the history list corresponds to the amount of undo information stored by the database to implement multi-version concurrency
control (MVCC).
