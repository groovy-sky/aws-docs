# Creating a custom endpoint

Create a custom endpoint using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API.

To create a custom endpoint with the AWS Management Console, go to the cluster detail page and
choose the `Create custom endpoint` action in the
**Endpoints** section. Choose a name for the custom endpoint,
unique for your user ID and region. To choose a list of DB instances that remains the
same even as the cluster expands, keep the check box **Attach future instances**
**added to this cluster** clear. When you choose that check box, the custom
endpoint dynamically adds any new instances as you add them to the cluster.

![Create custom endpoint page with fields for endpoint identifier, instance type selection, and static/exclusion options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/AuroraCreateCustomEndpoint.png)

You can't select the custom endpoint type in the AWS Management Console. All custom
endpoints you create through the AWS Management Console have a type of `ANY`.

To create a custom endpoint with the AWS CLI, run the [create-db-cluster-endpoint](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster-endpoint.md) command.

The following command creates a custom endpoint attached to a specific cluster.
Initially, the endpoint is associated with all the Aurora Replica instances in the
cluster. A subsequent command associates it with a specific set of DB instances in the
cluster.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster-endpoint --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier custom-endpoint-doc-sample \
  --endpoint-type reader \
  --db-cluster-identifier cluster_id

aws rds modify-db-cluster-endpoint --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier custom-endpoint-doc-sample \
  --static-members instance_name_1 instance_name_2

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster-endpoint --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier custom-endpoint-doc-sample ^
  --endpoint-type reader ^
  --db-cluster-identifier cluster_id

aws rds modify-db-cluster-endpoint --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier custom-endpoint-doc-sample ^
  --static-members instance_name_1 instance_name_2

```

To create a custom endpoint with the RDS API, run the [CreateDBClusterEndpoint](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbclusterendpoint.md)
operation.
