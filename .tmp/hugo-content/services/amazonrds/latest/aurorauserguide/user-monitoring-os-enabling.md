# Setting up and enabling Enhanced Monitoring

To use Enhanced Monitoring, you must create an IAM role, and then enable Enhanced Monitoring.

###### Topics

- [Creating an IAM role for Enhanced Monitoring](#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling.Prerequisites)

- [Turning Enhanced Monitoring on and off](#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling.Procedure)

- [Protecting against the confused deputy problem](#USER_Monitoring.OS.confused-deputy)

## Creating an IAM role for Enhanced Monitoring

Enhanced Monitoring requires permission to act on your behalf to send OS metric information to CloudWatch Logs. You grant
Enhanced Monitoring permissions using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. You can either create this role when you enable Enhanced
Monitoring or create it beforehand.

###### Topics

- [Creating the IAM role when you enable Enhanced Monitoring](#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling.Prerequisites.creating-role-automatically)

- [Creating the IAM role before you enable Enhanced Monitoring](#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling.Prerequisites.creating-role-manually)

### Creating the IAM role when you enable Enhanced Monitoring

When you enable Enhanced Monitoring in the RDS console, Amazon RDS can create the required IAM role for you. The
role is named `rds-monitoring-role`. RDS uses this role for the specified DB instance, read
replica, or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

###### To create the IAM role when enabling Enhanced Monitoring

1. Follow the steps in [Turning Enhanced Monitoring on and off](#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling.Procedure).

2. Set **Monitoring Role** to **Default** in the step where you choose a
    role.

### Creating the IAM role before you enable Enhanced Monitoring

You can create the required role before you enable Enhanced Monitoring. When you enable Enhanced Monitoring,
specify your new role's name. You must create this required role if you enable Enhanced Monitoring using the AWS CLI
or the RDS API.

The user that enables Enhanced Monitoring must be granted the `PassRole` permission. For more
information, see Example 2 in [Granting a user permissions to\
pass a role to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-use-passrole.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS enhanced monitoring

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) at [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

3. Choose **Create role**.

4. Choose the **AWS service** tab, and then choose **RDS** from the list
    of services.

5. Choose **RDS - Enhanced Monitoring**, and then choose **Next**.

6. Ensure that the **Permissions policies** shows
    **AmazonRDSEnhancedMonitoringRole**, and then choose **Next**.

7. For **Role name**, enter a name for your role. For example, enter
    `emaccess`.

The trusted entity for your role is the AWS service
    **monitoring.rds.amazonaws.com**.

8. Choose **Create role**.

## Turning Enhanced Monitoring on and off

You can manage Enhanced Monitoring using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API.
You can set different granularities for metric collection on each DB cluster.
You can also toggle Enhanced Monitoring for an existing DB cluster from the console.

You can turn on Enhanced Monitoring when you create a DB cluster or
read replica, or when you modify a DB cluster. If you modify a DB instance
or cluster to turn on Enhanced Monitoring, you don't need to reboot your DB instance for the
change to take effect.

You can turn on Enhanced Monitoring in the RDS console when you do one of the following
actions in the **Databases** page:

- **Create a DB cluster** – Choose **Create database**.

- **Create a read replica** – Choose **Actions**, then
**Create read replica**.

- **Modify a DB instance or DB cluster**
– Choose **Modify**.

###### Note

When you enable Enhanced Monitoring for a DB cluster, you can't manage Enhanced Monitoring
for individual DB instances within the cluster.

If you are managing Enhanced Monitoring for individual DB instances in a DB cluster and the
granularity is set to different values for different instances, your DB cluster is heterogeneous
with respect to Enhanced Monitoring. In such cases, you can't modify the DB cluster to manage Enhanced Monitoring at the
cluster level.

###### To turn Enhanced Monitoring on or off in the RDS console

1. Scroll to **Additional configuration**.

2. In **Monitoring**, choose **Enable Enhanced**
**Monitoring** for your DB , cluster, or read replica.
    Enabling Enhanced Monitoring at the cluster level allows you manage Enhanced Monitoring
    settings and options at the cluster level. Cluster level settings apply to all DB instances
    the cluster. Deselect the option to disable Enhanced Monitoring
    at the cluster level. You can later modify Enhanced Monitoring settings for individual DB instances in the
    cluster.

In the **Create database** page, you can select to turn on Enhanced Monitoring
    at the cluster level.

If you don't enable Enhanced Monitoring while creating a cluster, you can modify the cluster In the
    **Modify DB cluster** page.

![Turn on Performance Insights during DB cluster creation with console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/em_cluster_modifying.png)

###### Note

You can't manage Enhanced Monitoring for an individual DB instance in a DB cluster that already has Enhanced Monitoring managed at the cluster level.

3. You can't choose to manage Enhanced Monitoring at the cluster level if the cluster is heterogeneous with respect to Enhanced Monitoring.
    To manage Enhanced Monitoring at the cluster level, change the Enhanced Monitoring settings for each instance so they match.
    You can now choose to manage Enhanced Monitoring at the cluster level when you modify your cluster.

4. Set the **Monitoring Role** property to the IAM role that you created to permit Amazon RDS to
    communicate with Amazon CloudWatch Logs for you, or choose **Default** to have RDS create a role for you
    named `rds-monitoring-role`.

5. Set the **Granularity** property to the interval, in seconds, between points when
    metrics are collected for your DB instance, DB cluster, or
    read replica. The **Granularity** property can
    be set to one of the following values: `1`, `5`, `10`, `15`,
    `30`, or `60`.

The fastest that the RDS console refreshes is every 5 seconds. If you set the granularity to 1 second in
    the RDS console, you still see updated metrics only every 5 seconds. You can retrieve 1-second metric updates
    by using CloudWatch Logs.

To turn on Enhanced Monitoring using the AWS CLI, in the following commands, set the
`--monitoring-interval` option to a value other than `0` and set the
`--monitoring-role-arn` option to the role you created in [Creating an IAM role for Enhanced Monitoring](#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling.Prerequisites).

- [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md)

- [modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md)

- [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md)

- [create-db-instance-read-replica](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance-read-replica.md)

- [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md)

The `--monitoring-interval` option specifies the interval, in seconds, between points when
Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected. Valid values for the option are `0`, `1`,
`5`, `10`, `15`, `30`, and `60`.

To turn off Enhanced Monitoring using the AWS CLI, set the `--monitoring-interval` option to
`0` in these commands.

###### Example

The following example turns on Enhanced Monitoring for a DB instance:

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --monitoring-interval 30 \
    --monitoring-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/emaccess
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --monitoring-interval 30 ^
    --monitoring-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/emaccess
```

###### Example

The following example turns on Enhanced Monitoring for a DB cluster:

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbinstance \
    --monitoring-interval 30 \
    --monitoring-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/emaccess
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --monitoring-interval 30 ^
    --monitoring-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/emaccess
```

###### Example

The following example turns on Enhanced Monitoring for a Multi-AZ DB cluster:

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
    --monitoring-interval 30 \
    --monitoring-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/emaccess
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster ^
    --monitoring-interval 30 ^
    --monitoring-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/emaccess
```

To turn on Enhanced Monitoring using the RDS API, set the `MonitoringInterval` parameter to a value
other than `0` and set the `MonitoringRoleArn` parameter to the role you created in [Creating an IAM role for Enhanced Monitoring](#USER_Monitoring.OS.Enabling.Prerequisites).
Set these parameters in the following actions:

- [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md)

- [ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md)

- [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md)

- [CreateDBInstanceReadReplica](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstancereadreplica.md)

- [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md)

The `MonitoringInterval` parameter specifies the interval, in seconds, between points when
Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected. Valid values are `0`, `1`, `5`,
`10`, `15`, `30`, and `60`.

To turn off Enhanced Monitoring using the RDS API, set `MonitoringInterval` to `0`.

## Protecting against the confused deputy problem

The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that
doesn't have permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged
entity to perform the action. In AWS, cross-service impersonation can
result in the confused deputy problem. Cross-service impersonation can occur
when one service (the _calling service_) calls another
service (the _called service_). The calling service can
be manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customer's resources
in a way it should not otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this,
AWS provides tools that help you protect your data for all services with
service principals that have been given access to resources in your account.
For more information, see [The confused deputy\
problem](../../../iam/latest/userguide/confused-deputy.md).

To limit the permissions to the resource that Amazon RDS can give another
service, we recommend using the `aws:SourceArn` and
`aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in a trust
policy for your Enhanced Monitoring role. If you use both global condition
context keys, they must use the same account ID.

The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is
to use the `aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the
full ARN of the resource. For Amazon RDS, set `aws:SourceArn` to
`arn:aws:rds:Region:my-account-id:db:dbname`.

The following example uses the `aws:SourceArn` and
`aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in a trust
policy to prevent the confused deputy problem.
