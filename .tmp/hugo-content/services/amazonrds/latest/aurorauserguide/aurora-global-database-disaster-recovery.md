# Using switchover or failover in Amazon Aurora Global Database

The Aurora Global Database feature provides more business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) protection than
the standard [high availability](concepts-aurorahighavailability.md) provided by an Aurora DB
cluster in a single AWS Region. By using Aurora Global Database, you can plan for faster recovery from rare,
unplanned Regional disasters or complete service-level outages quickly.

You can consult the following guidance and procedures to plan, test, and implement your BCDR strategy using the
Aurora Global Database feature.

## Planning for business continuity and disaster recovery

To plan your business continuity and disaster recovery strategy, it's helpful to understand the following
industry terminology and how those terms relate to Aurora Global Database features.

Recovery from disaster is typically driven by the following two business objectives:

- **Recovery time objective (RTO)** – The time it takes a system to return
to a working state after a disaster or service outage. In other words, RTO measures downtime. For Aurora
Global Database, RTO can be in the order of minutes.

- **Recovery point objective (RPO)** – The amount of data that can be lost
(measured in time) after a disaster or service outage. This data loss is usually due to asynchronous
replication lag. For an Aurora global database, RPO is typically measured in seconds. With an
Aurora PostgreSQL–based global database, you can use the `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter to set
and track the upper bound on RPO, but doing so might affect transaction processing on the primary
cluster's writer node. For more information, see
[Managing RPOs for Aurora PostgreSQL–based global databases](#aurora-global-database-manage-recovery).

Performing a switchover or failover with Aurora Global Database involves promoting a secondary DB cluster to be
the primary DB cluster. The term "regional outage" is often used to describe a variety of failure
scenarios. A worst case scenario could be a wide-spread outage from a catastrophic event that affects hundreds
of square miles. However, most outages are much more localized, affecting only a small subset of cloud services
or customer systems. Consider the full scope of the outage to make sure cross-Region failover is
the proper solution and to choose the appropriate failover method for the situation. Whether you should use the
failover or switchover approach depends on the specific outage scenario:

- **Failover** – Use this approach to recover from an unplanned outage.
With this approach, you perform a cross-Region failover to one of the secondary DB clusters
in your Aurora global database. The RPO for this approach is typically a non-zero value measured in seconds.
The amount of data loss depends on the Aurora global database replication lag across the AWS Regions at the
time of the failure. To learn more, see
[Recovering an Amazon Aurora global database from an unplanned outage](#aurora-global-database-failover).

- **Switchover** – This operation was previously called "managed
planned failover". Use this approach for controlled scenarios, such as operational maintenance and
other planned operational procedures where all the Aurora clusters and other services they interact with are
in a healthy state. Because this feature synchronizes secondary DB clusters with the primary before making
any other changes, RPO is 0 (no data loss). To learn more, see
[Performing switchovers for Amazon Aurora global databases](#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover).

###### Note

Before you can perform a switchover or failover to a headless secondary Aurora DB cluster, you must add a DB
instance to it. For more information about headless DB clusters, see
[Creating a headless Aurora DB cluster in a secondary Region](aurora-global-database-attach-console-headless.md).

## Performing switchovers for Amazon Aurora global databases

###### Note

Switchovers were previously called **managed planned failovers**.

By using switchovers, you can change the Region of your primary cluster on a routine basis. This
approach is intended for controlled scenarios, such as operational maintenance and other planned operational
procedures.

There are three common use cases for using switchovers.

- For "regional rotation" requirements imposed on specific industries. For example, financial
service regulations might want tier-0 systems to switch to a different Region for several
months to ensure that disaster recovery procedures are regularly exercised.

- For multi-Region "follow-the-sun" applications. For example, a business might want
to provide lower latency writes in different Regions based on business hours across
different time zones.

- As a zero-data-loss method to fail back to the original primary Region after a failover.

###### Note

Switchovers are designed to be used on a an Aurora global database where all the Aurora clusters and other
services they interact with are in a healthy state. To recover from an unplanned outage, follow the
appropriate procedure in
[Recovering an Amazon Aurora global database from an unplanned outage](#aurora-global-database-failover).

You can perform managed cross-Region switchovers with Aurora Global Database only if the
primary and secondary DB clusters have the same major and minor engine versions. Depending on the engine and
engine versions, the patch levels might need to be identical or the patch levels can be different. For a list
of engines and engine versions that allow these operations between primary and secondary clusters with
different patch levels, see
[Patch level compatibility for managed cross-Region switchovers and failovers](aurora-global-database-upgrade.md#aurora-global-database-upgrade.minor.incompatibility).
Before you begin the switchover, check the engine versions in your global cluster to make sure that they
support managed cross-Region switchover, and upgrade them if needed.

During a switchover, Aurora makes the cluster in your chosen secondary Region be your primary
cluster. The switchover mechanism maintains your global database's existing replication topology: it still
has the same number of Aurora clusters in the same Regions. Before Aurora starts the switchover
process, it waits for the target secondary Region clusters to be fully synchronized with the primary
Region cluster. Then, the DB cluster in the primary Region becomes read-only.
The chosen secondary cluster promotes one of its read-only nodes to full writer status, which allows that
secondary cluster to assume the role of primary cluster. Because the target secondary cluster was synchronized with
the primary at the beginning of the process, the new primary continues operations for the Aurora global database
without losing any data. Your database is unavailable for a short time while the primary and selected secondary
clusters are assuming their new roles.

###### Note

To manage replication slots for Aurora PostgreSQL after performing a switchover, see
[Managing logical slots for Aurora PostgreSQL](aurorapostgresql-replication-logical-monitoring.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.Configure.managing-logical-slots).

To optimize application availability, we recommend that you do the following before using this feature:

- Perform this operation during nonpeak hours or at another time when writes to the primary DB cluster are
minimal.

- Check lag times for all secondary Aurora DB clusters in the Aurora global database. For all
Aurora PostgreSQL-based global databases and for Aurora MySQL-based global databases starting with engine versions
3.04.0 and higher or 2.12.0 and higher, use Amazon CloudWatch to view the `AuroraGlobalDBRPOLag` metric
for all secondary DB clusters. For lower minor versions of Aurora MySQL-based global databases, view the
`AuroraGlobalDBReplicationLag` metric instead. These metrics show you how far behind (in
milliseconds) replication to a secondary cluster is to the primary DB cluster. This value is directly
proportional to the time it takes for Aurora to complete the switchover. Therefore, the larger the lag value,
the longer the switchover will take. When you examine these metrics, do so from the current primary cluster.

For more information about CloudWatch metrics for Aurora, see
[Cluster-level metrics for Amazon Aurora](aurora-auroramonitoring-metrics.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.clusters).

- The secondary DB cluster that's promoted during a switchover might have different configuration
settings than the old primary DB cluster. We recommend that you keep the following types of configuration
settings consistent across all the clusters in your Aurora global database clusters. Doing so helps to
minimize performance issues, workload incompatibilities, and other anomalous behavior after a switchover.

- **Configure Aurora DB cluster parameter group for the new primary, if**
**necessary** – When you promote a secondary DB cluster to take over the primary role, the
parameter group from the secondary might be configured differently than for the primary. If so, modify
the promoted secondary DB cluster's parameter group to conform to your primary cluster's
settings. To learn how, see
[Modifying parameters for an Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-modifying-parameters.md).

- **Configure monitoring tools and options, such as Amazon CloudWatch Events and alarms**
– Configure the promoted DB cluster with the same logging ability, alarms, and so on as needed
for the global database. As with parameter groups, configuration for these features isn't inherited
from the primary during the switchover process. Some CloudWatch metrics, such as replication lag, are only
available for secondary Regions. Thus, a switchover changes how to view those metrics
and set alarms on them, and could require changes to any predefined dashboards. For more information
about Aurora DB clusters and monitoring, see
[Monitoring Amazon Aurora metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md).

- **Configure integrations with other AWS services** – If your Aurora
global database integrates with AWS services, such as AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management, Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda, make
sure to configure your integrations with these services as needed. For more information about
integrating Aurora global databases with IAM, Amazon S3 and Lambda, see
[Using Amazon Aurora global databases with other AWS services](aurora-global-database-interop.md). To
learn more about Secrets Manager, see
[How\
to automate replication of secrets in AWS Secrets Manager across AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-automate-replication-of-secrets-in-aws-secrets-manager-across-aws-regions).

If you are using the Aurora Global Database writer endpoint, you don't need to change the connection
settings in your application. Verify that the DNS changes have propagated and that you can connect and perform
write operations on the new primary cluster. Then you can resume full operation of your application.

Suppose that your application connections use the cluster endpoint of the old primary cluster, instead of the
global writer endpoint. In that case, make sure to change the your application connection settings to use the
cluster endpoint of the new primary cluster. If you accepted the provided names when you created the Aurora
global database, you can change the endpoint by removing the `-ro` from the promoted cluster's
endpoint string in your application. For example, the secondary cluster's endpoint
`my-global.cluster-ro-aaaaaabbbbbb.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
becomes `my-global.cluster-aaaaaabbbbbb.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com` when that cluster is promoted to
primary.

If you're using RDS Proxy, make sure to redirect your application's write operations to the appropriate
read/write endpoint of the proxy that's associated with the new primary cluster. This proxy endpoint might
be the default endpoint or a custom read/write endpoint. For more information see
[How RDS Proxy endpoints work with global databases](rds-proxy-gdb.md#rds-proxy-gdb.endpoints).

You can perform an Aurora Global Database switchover using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### To perform the switchover on your Aurora global database

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases** and find the Aurora global database where you intend to perform the
    switchover.

3. Choose **Switch over or fail over global database** from the
    **Actions** menu.

![The Databases list with the Actions menu open showing the Switch over or fail over global database option.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-db-switchover-1.png)

4. Choose **Switchover**.

![The Switch over or fail over global database dialog, with Failover (allow data loss) selected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-db-switchover-2.png)

5. For **New primary cluster**, choose an active cluster in one of your secondary
    AWS Regions to be the new primary cluster.

6. Choose **Confirm**.

When the switchover completes, you can see the Aurora DB clusters and their current roles in the
**Databases** list, as shown in the following image.

![Showing the Databases list with the global database selected. The selected secondary cluster now shows as having the primary cluster role and the old primary has the role of a secondary cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-db-switchover-3.png)

**To perform the switchover on an Aurora global database**

Use the
`switchover-global-cluster`
CLI command to perform a switchover for Aurora Global Database. With the command, pass values for the
following parameters.

- `--region` – Specify the AWS Region where the primary DB cluster of the Aurora global
database is running.

- `--global-cluster-identifier` – Specify the name of your Aurora global database.

- `--target-db-cluster-identifier` – Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora
DB cluster that you want to promote to be the primary for the Aurora global database.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds --region region_of_primary \
   switchover-global-cluster --global-cluster-identifier global_database_id \
  --target-db-cluster-identifier arn_of_secondary_to_promote

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds --region region_of_primary ^
   switchover-global-cluster --global-cluster-identifier global_database_id ^
  --target-db-cluster-identifier arn_of_secondary_to_promote
```

To perform a switchover for Aurora Global Database, run the
[SwitchoverGlobalCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-switchoverglobalcluster.md) API operation.

## Recovering an Amazon Aurora global database from an unplanned outage

On rare occasions, your Aurora global database might experience an unexpected outage in its primary AWS Region.
If this happens, your primary Aurora DB cluster and its writer node aren't available, and the replication
between the primary and secondary DB clusters stops. To minimize both downtime (RTO) and data loss (RPO), you
can work quickly to perform a cross-Region failover.

Aurora Global Database has two failover methods that you can use in a disaster recovery situation:

- Managed failover – This method is recommended for disaster recovery. When you use this method, Aurora
automatically adds back the old primary Region to the global database as a secondary
Region when it becomes available again. Thus, the original topology of your global cluster
is maintained. To learn how to use this method, see
[Performing managed failovers for Aurora global databases](#aurora-global-database-failover.managed-unplanned).

- Manual failover – This alternative method can be used when managed failover isn't an option, for
example, when your primary and secondary Regions are running incompatible engine versions.
To learn how to use this method, see
[Performing manual failovers for Aurora global databases](#aurora-global-database-failover.manual-unplanned).

###### Important

Both failover methods can result in a loss of write transaction data that wasn't replicated to the chosen
secondary before the failover event occurred. However, the recovery process that promotes a DB instance on the
chosen secondary DB cluster to be the primary writer DB instance guarantees that the data is in a
transactionally consistent state.

Failovers are also susceptible to _split-brain_ issues.

### Performing managed failovers for Aurora global databases

This approach is intended for business continuity in the event of a true Regional disaster or complete
service-level outage.

During a managed failover, the secondary cluster in your chosen secondary Region becomes the
new primary cluster. The chosen secondary cluster promotes one of its read-only nodes to full writer status.
This step allows the cluster to assume the role of primary cluster. Your database is unavailable for a short
time while this cluster is assuming its new role. As soon as that old primary Region is healthy and available
again, Aurora automatically adds it back to the global cluster as a secondary Region. Thus, your Aurora global
database's existing replication topology is maintained.

###### Note

To manage replication slots for Aurora PostgreSQL after performing a failover, see
[Managing logical slots for Aurora PostgreSQL](aurorapostgresql-replication-logical-monitoring.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.Configure.managing-logical-slots).

###### Note

You can perform managed cross-Region failovers with Aurora Global Database only if the
primary and secondary DB clusters have the same major and minor engine versions. Depending on the engine and
engine versions, the patch levels might need to be identical or the patch levels can be different. For a
list of engines and engine versions that allow these operations between primary and secondary clusters with
different patch levels, see
[Patch level compatibility for managed cross-Region switchovers and failovers](aurora-global-database-upgrade.md#aurora-global-database-upgrade.minor.incompatibility).
Before you begin the failover, check the engine versions in your global cluster to make sure that they
support managed cross-Region switchover, and upgrade them if needed. If your engine versions
require identical patch levels but are running different patch levels, you can perform the failover manually
by following the steps in
[Performing manual failovers for Aurora global databases](#aurora-global-database-failover.manual-unplanned).

Managed failover doesn't wait for data to synchronize between the chosen secondary Region and the current
primary Region. Because Aurora Global Database replicates data asynchronously, it's possible that not all
transactions replicated to the chosen secondary AWS Region before it's promoted to accept full
read/write capabilities.

To ensure the data is in a consistent state, Aurora creates a new storage volume for the old primary Region
after it recovers. Before creating the new storage volume in the AWS Region, Aurora attempts to take a
snapshot of the old storage volume at the point of failure. That way, you can restore the snapshot and recover
any of the missing data from it. If this operation is successful, Aurora places this snapshot named
`rds:unplanned-global-failover-name-of-old-primary-DB-cluster-timestamp`
in the snapshot section of the AWS Management Console. You can also use the `describe-db-cluster-snapshots`
AWS CLI command or the `DescribeDBClusterSnapshots` API operation to see details for the snapshot.

When you initiate a managed failover, Aurora also attempts to halt write traffic through the highly-available
Aurora storage layer. We refer to this mechanism as "write fencing". If the process succeeds, Aurora
emits an RDS Event letting you know that writes were stopped. In the unlikely event of multiple AZ failures in
a Region, it's possible that the write fencing process doesn't succeed in a timely manner. In that
case, Aurora emits an RDS event informing you that the process to stop writes timed out. If the old primary
cluster is reachable on the network, Aurora records these events there. If not, Aurora records the events on the
new primary cluster. To learn more about these events, see
[DB cluster events](user-events-messages.md#USER_Events.Messages.cluster). Because fencing
writes is a best-effort attempt, it's possible that writes might be momentarily accepted in the old
primary Region, causing split-brain issues.

We recommend that you complete the following tasks before you perform a failover with Aurora Global Database.
Doing so minimizes the possibility of split-brain issues, or recovering unreplicated data from the snapshot of
the old primary cluster.

- To prevent writes from being sent to the primary cluster of Aurora Global Database, take applications
offline.

- Make sure that any applications that connect to the primary DB cluster are using the global writer
endpoint. This endpoint has a value that remains the same even when a new Region becomes
the primary cluster because of switchover or failover. Aurora implements additional safeguards to minimize
the possibility of data loss for write operations submitted through the global endpoint. For more
information about global writer endpoints, see
[Connecting to Amazon Aurora Global Database](aurora-global-database-connecting.md).

- If you are using the global writer endpoint and your application or networking layers cache DNS values,
reduce the time-to-live (TTL) of your DNS cache to a low value such as 5 seconds. That way, your
application quickly registers DNS changes with the global writer endpoint. Although Aurora attempts to
block writes in the old primary Region, the action is not guaranteed to succeed. Reducing the DNS cache
duration further reduces the likelihood of split-brain issues. As an alternative, you can check for the
RDS event that informs you when Aurora observed the DNS changes for the global writer endpoint. That way,
you can validate that your application also registered the DNS change before restarting your application
write traffic.

- Check lag times for all secondary Aurora DB clusters in the Aurora Global Database. Choosing the secondary
Region with the least replication lag can minimize data loss with the current failed
primary Region.

For all versions of Aurora PostgreSQL-based global databases, and for Aurora MySQL-based global databases
starting with engine versions 3.04.0 and higher or 2.12.0 and higher, use Amazon CloudWatch to view the
`AuroraGlobalDBRPOLag` metric for all secondary DB clusters. For lower minor versions of
Aurora MySQL-based global databases, view the `AuroraGlobalDBReplicationLag` metric instead.
These metrics show you how far behind (in milliseconds) replication to a secondary cluster is to the
primary DB cluster.

For more information about CloudWatch metrics for Aurora, see
[Cluster-level metrics for Amazon Aurora](aurora-auroramonitoring-metrics.md#Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.clusters).

During a managed failover, the chosen secondary DB cluster is promoted to its new role as primary. However, it
doesn't inherit the various configuration options of the primary DB cluster. A mismatch in configuration
can lead to performance issues, workload incompatibilities, and other anomalous behavior. To avoid such
issues, we recommend that you resolve differences between your Aurora global database clusters for the
following:

- **Configure Aurora DB cluster parameter group for the new primary, if**
**necessary** – You can configure your Aurora DB cluster parameter groups independently for
each Aurora cluster in your Aurora Global Database. Therefore, when you promote a secondary DB cluster to
take over the primary role, the parameter group from the secondary might be configured differently than
for the primary. If so, modify the promoted secondary DB cluster's parameter group to conform to your
primary cluster's settings. To learn how, see
[Modifying parameters for an Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-modifying-parameters.md).

- **Configure monitoring tools and options, such as Amazon CloudWatch Events and alarms**
– Configure the promoted DB cluster with the same logging ability, alarms, and so on as needed for
the global database. As with parameter groups, configuration for these features isn't inherited from
the primary during the failover process. Some CloudWatch metrics, such as replication lag, are only available
for secondary Regions. Thus, a failover changes how to view those metrics and set alarms
on them, and could require changes to any predefined dashboards. For more information about monitoring
Aurora DB clusters, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md).

- **Configure integrations with other AWS services** – If your Aurora
Global Database integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Identity and Access Management, Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda,
you need to make sure these are configured as required for access from any secondary Regions. For more
information about integrating Aurora global databases with IAM, Amazon S3 and Lambda, see
[Using Amazon Aurora global databases with other AWS services](aurora-global-database-interop.md). To learn
more about Secrets Manager, see
[How\
to automate replication of secrets in AWS Secrets Manager across AWS Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-automate-replication-of-secrets-in-aws-secrets-manager-across-aws-regions).

Typically, the chosen secondary cluster assumes the primary role within a few minutes. As soon as the new
primary Region's writer DB instance is available, you can connect your applications to it
and resume your workloads. After Aurora promotes the new primary cluster, it automatically rebuilds all
additional secondary Region clusters.

Because Aurora global databases use asynchronous replication, the replication lag in each secondary
Region can vary. Aurora rebuilds these secondary Regions to have the exact same
point-in-time data as the new primary Region cluster. The duration of the complete rebuilding
task can take a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of the storage volume and the distance
between the Regions. When the secondary Region clusters finish rebuilding from
the new primary Region, they become available for read access.

As soon as the new primary writer is promoted and available, the new primary Region's
cluster can handle read and write operations for the Aurora global database.

If you are using the global endpoint, you don't need to change the connection settings in your
application. Verify that the DNS changes have propagated and that you can connect and perform write operations
on the new primary cluster. Then you can resume full operation of your application.

If you aren't using the global endpoint, make sure to change the endpoint for your application to use the
cluster endpoint for the newly promoted primary DB cluster. If you accepted the provided names when you
created the Aurora global database, you can change the endpoint by removing the `-ro` from the
promoted cluster's endpoint string in your application.

For example, the secondary cluster's endpoint
`my-global.cluster-ro-aaaaaabbbbbb.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
becomes `my-global.cluster-aaaaaabbbbbb.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com` when that cluster is promoted
to primary.

If you are using RDS Proxy, make sure to redirect your application's write operations to the appropriate
read/write endpoint of the proxy that's associated with the new primary cluster. This proxy endpoint
might be the default endpoint or a custom read/write endpoint. For more information see
[How RDS Proxy endpoints work with global databases](rds-proxy-gdb.md#rds-proxy-gdb.endpoints).

To restore the global database cluster's original topology, Aurora monitors the availability of the old
primary Region. As soon as that Region is healthy and available again, Aurora
automatically adds it back to the global cluster as a secondary Region. Before creating the
new storage volume in the old primary Region, Aurora tries to take a snapshot of the old
storage volume at the point of failure. It does this so that you can use it to recover any of the missing
data. If this operation is successful, Aurora creates a snapshot named
`rds:unplanned-global-failover-name-of-old-primary-DB-cluster-timestamp`.
You can find this snapshot in the **Snapshots** section of the AWS Management Console. You can also see
this snapshot listed in the information returned by the
[DescribeDBClusterSnapshots](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbclustersnapshots.md) API
operation.

###### Note

The snapshot of the old storage volume is a system snapshot that's subject to the backup retention
period configured on the old primary cluster. To preserve this snapshot outside of the retention period, you
can copy it to save it as a manual snapshot. To learn more about copying snapshots, including pricing, see
[DB cluster snapshot copying](aurora-copy-snapshot.md).

After the original topology is restored, you can fail back your global database to the original primary
Region by performing a switchover operation when it makes the most sense for your business and
workload. To do so, follow the steps in
[Performing switchovers for Amazon Aurora global databases](#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover).

You can perform a failover with Aurora Global Database using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### To perform the managed failover on your Aurora global database

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases** and find the Aurora global database where you want to perform the
    failover.

3. Choose **Switch over or fail over global database** from the
    **Actions** menu.

![The Databases list with the Actions menu open, showing the Switch over or fail over global database option.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-db-managed-failover-1.png)

4. Choose **Failover (allow data loss)**.

![The Switch over or fail over global database dialog, with Failover (allow data loss) selected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-db-managed-failover-2.png)

5. For **New primary cluster**, choose an active cluster in one of your secondary
    AWS Regions to be the new primary cluster.

6. Enter `confirm`, and then choose **Confirm**.

When the failover completes, you can view the Aurora DB clusters and their current state in the
**Databases** list, as shown in the following image.

![Showing the Databases list with the global database selected. The selected secondary cluster now shows as having the primary cluster role and the old primary has the role of a secondary cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-db-managed-failover-5.png)

**To perform the managed failover on an Aurora global database**

Use the
`failover-global-cluster`
CLI command to perform a failover with Aurora Global Database. With the command, pass values for the
following parameters.

- `--region` – Specify the AWS Region where the secondary DB cluster that you want
to be the new primary for the Aurora global database is running.

- `--global-cluster-identifier` – Specify the name of your Aurora global database.

- `--target-db-cluster-identifier` – Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
Aurora DB cluster that you want to promote to be the new primary for the Aurora global database.

- `--allow-data-loss` – Explicitly make this a failover operation instead of a
switchover operation. A failover operation can result in some data loss if the asynchronous
replication components haven't completed sending all replicated data to the secondary
Region.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds --region region_of_selected_secondary \
   failover-global-cluster --global-cluster-identifier global_database_id \
   --target-db-cluster-identifier arn_of_secondary_to_promote \
   --allow-data-loss

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds --region region_of_selected_secondary ^
   failover-global-cluster --global-cluster-identifier global_database_id ^
   --target-db-cluster-identifier arn_of_secondary_to_promote ^
   --allow-data-loss

```

To perform a failover with Aurora Global Database, run the
[FailoverGlobalCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-failoverglobalcluster.md) API operation.

### Performing manual failovers for Aurora global databases

In some scenarios, you might not be able to use the managed failover process. One example is if your primary
and secondary DB clusters aren't running compatible engine versions. In this case, you can follow this
manual process to perform a failover to your target secondary Region.

###### Tip

We recommend that you understand this process before using it. Have a plan ready to quickly proceed at the
first sign of a Region-wide issue. You can be ready to identify the secondary
Region with the least replication lag by using Amazon CloudWatch regularly to track lag times for the
secondary clusters. Make sure to test your plan to check that your procedures are complete and accurate, and
that staff are trained to perform a disaster recovery failover before it really happens.

###### To perform a manual failover to a secondary cluster after an unplanned outage in the primary Region

1. Stop issuing DML statements and other write operations to the primary Aurora DB cluster in the AWS Region
    with the outage.

2. Identify an Aurora DB cluster from a secondary AWS Region to use as a new primary DB cluster. If you have
    two or more secondary AWS Regions in your Aurora global database, choose the secondary cluster that has
    the least replication lag.

3. Detach your chosen secondary DB cluster from the Aurora global database.

    Removing a secondary DB cluster from an Aurora global database immediately stops the replication from the
    primary to this secondary and promotes it to a standalone provisioned Aurora DB cluster with full
    read/write capabilities. Any other secondary Aurora DB clusters associated with the primary cluster in the
    Region with the outage are still available and can accept calls from your application.
    They also consume resources. Because you're recreating the Aurora global database, remove the other
    secondary DB clusters before creating the new Aurora global database in the following steps. Doing this
    avoids data inconsistencies among the DB clusters in the Aurora global database
    ( _split-brain_ issues).

    For detailed steps for detaching, see
    [Removing a cluster from an Amazon Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-detaching.md).

4. Reconfigure your application to send all write operations to this now standalone Aurora DB cluster using
    its new endpoint. If you accepted the provided names when you created the Aurora global database, you can
    change the endpoint by removing the `-ro` from the cluster's endpoint string in your
    application.

    For example, the secondary cluster's endpoint
    `my-global.cluster-ro-aaaaaabbbbbb.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
    becomes `my-global.cluster-aaaaaabbbbbb.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com` when that cluster is
    detached from the Aurora global database.

    This Aurora DB cluster becomes the primary cluster of a new Aurora global database when you start adding
    Regions to it in the next step.

    If you are using RDS Proxy, make sure to redirect your application's write operations to the
    appropriate read/write endpoint of the proxy that's associated with the new primary cluster. This
    proxy endpoint might be the default endpoint or a custom read/write endpoint. For more information see
    [How RDS Proxy endpoints work with global databases](rds-proxy-gdb.md#rds-proxy-gdb.endpoints).

5. Add an AWS Region to the DB cluster. When you do this, the replication process from primary to secondary
    begins. For detailed steps to add a Region, see
    [Adding an AWS Region to an Amazon Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-attaching.md).

6. Add more AWS Regions as needed to recreate the topology needed to support your application.

Make sure that application writes are sent to the correct Aurora DB cluster before, during, and after making
these changes. Doing this avoids data inconsistencies among the DB clusters in the Aurora global database
( _split-brain_ issues).

If you reconfigured in response to an outage in an AWS Region, you can make that AWS Region the primary
again after the outage is resolved. To do so, you add the old AWS Region to your new global database, and
then use the switchover process to switch its role. Your Aurora global database must use a version of
Aurora PostgreSQL or Aurora MySQL that supports switchovers. For more information, see
[Performing switchovers for Amazon Aurora global databases](#aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.managed-failover).

## Managing RPOs for Aurora PostgreSQL–based global databases

With an Aurora PostgreSQL–based global database, you can manage the recovery point objective (RPO) for your
Aurora global database by using the `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter. RPO represents the maximum amount
of data that can be lost in the event of an outage.

When you set an RPO for your Aurora PostgreSQL–based global database, Aurora monitors the _RPO lag_
_time_ of all secondary clusters to make sure that at least one secondary cluster stays within the
target RPO window. RPO lag time is another time-based metric.

The RPO is used when your database resumes operations in a new AWS Region after a failover. Aurora evaluates
RPO and RPO lag times to commit (or block) transactions on the primary as follows:

- Commits the transaction if at least one secondary DB cluster has an RPO lag time less than the RPO.

- Blocks the transaction if all secondary DB clusters have RPO lag times that are larger than the RPO. It
also logs the event to the PostgreSQL log file and emits "wait" events that show the blocked sessions.

In other words, if all secondary clusters are behind the target RPO, Aurora pauses transactions on the primary
cluster until at least one of the secondary clusters catches up. Paused transactions are resumed and committed
as soon as the lag time of at least one secondary DB cluster becomes less than the RPO. The result is that no
transactions can commit until the RPO is met.

The `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter is dynamic. If you decide that you don't want all write
transactions to stall until the lag decreases sufficiently, you can reset it quickly. In this case, Aurora
recognizes and implements the change after a short delay.

###### Important

In a global database with only two AWS Regions, we recommend keeping the `rds.global_db_rpo`
parameter's default value in the secondary Region's parameter group. Otherwise, performing a failover
due to a loss of the primary AWS Region could cause Aurora to pause transactions. Instead, wait until Aurora
completes rebuilding the cluster in the old failed AWS Region before changing this parameter to enforce a
maximum RPO.

If you set this parameter as outlined in the following, you can also monitor the metrics that it
generates. You can do so by using `psql` or another tool to query the Aurora global database's
primary DB cluster and obtain detailed information about your Aurora PostgreSQL–based global
database's operations. To learn how, see
[Monitoring Aurora PostgreSQL-based global databases](aurora-global-database-monitoring.md#aurora-global-database-monitoring.postgres).

- [Viewing the recovery point objective](#aurora-global-database-view-rpo)

- [Disabling the recovery point objective](#aurora-global-database-disable-rpo)

### Setting the recovery point objective

The `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter controls the RPO setting for a PostgreSQL database. This
parameter is supported by Aurora PostgreSQL. Valid values for `rds.global_db_rpo` range from 20
seconds to 2,147,483,647 seconds (68 years). Choose a realistic value to meet your business need and use
case. For example, you might want to allow up to 10 minutes for your RPO, in which case you set the value to
600.

You can set this value for your Aurora PostgreSQL–based global database by using the AWS Management Console, the
AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### To set the RPO

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose the primary cluster of your Aurora global database and open the
    **Configuration** tab to find its DB cluster parameter group. For example, the
    default parameter group for a primary DB cluster running Aurora PostgreSQL 11.7 is
    `default.aurora-postgresql11`.

    Parameter groups can't be edited directly. Instead, you do the following:

- Create a custom DB cluster parameter group using the appropriate default parameter group as the
starting point. For example, create a custom DB cluster parameter group based on the
`default.aurora-postgresql11`.

- On your custom DB parameter group, set the value of the **rds.global\_db\_rpo**
parameter to meet your use case. Valid values range from 20 seconds up to the maximum integer
value of 2,147,483,647 (68 years).

- Apply the modified DB cluster parameter group to your Aurora DB cluster.

For more information, see
[Modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifyingcluster.md).

To set the `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter, use the
[modify-db-cluster-parameter-group](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster-parameter-group.md)
CLI command. In the command, specify the name of your primary cluster's parameter group and values
for RPO parameter.

The following example sets the RPO to 600 seconds (10 minutes) for the primary DB cluster's
parameter group named `my_custom_global_parameter_group`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster-parameter-group \
    --db-cluster-parameter-group-name my_custom_global_parameter_group \
    --parameters "ParameterName=rds.global_db_rpo,ParameterValue=600,ApplyMethod=immediate"

```

For Windows:

```json

aws rds modify-db-cluster-parameter-group ^
    --db-cluster-parameter-group-name my_custom_global_parameter_group ^
    --parameters "ParameterName=rds.global_db_rpo,ParameterValue=600,ApplyMethod=immediate"

```

To modify the `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter, use the Amazon RDS
[ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbclusterparametergroup.md)
API operation.

### Viewing the recovery point objective

The recovery point objective (RPO) of a global database is stored in the `rds.global_db_rpo`
parameter for each DB cluster. You can connect to the endpoint for the secondary cluster you want to view
and use `psql` to query the instance for this value.

```sql

db-name=>show rds.global_db_rpo;
```

If this parameter isn't set, the query returns the following:

```sql

rds.global_db_rpo
-------------------
 -1
(1 row)
```

This next response is from a secondary DB cluster that has 1 minute RPO setting.

```sql

rds.global_db_rpo
-------------------
 60
(1 row)
```

You can also use the CLI to get values for find out if `rds.global_db_rpo` is active on any of
the Aurora DB clusters by using the CLI to get values of all `user` parameters for the cluster.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-cluster-parameters \
 --db-cluster-parameter-group-name lab-test-apg-global \
 --source user

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-cluster-parameters ^
 --db-cluster-parameter-group-name lab-test-apg-global *
 --source user

```

The command returns output similar to the following for all `user` parameters. that aren't
`default-engine` or `system` DB cluster parameters.

```json

{
    "Parameters": [
        {
            "ParameterName": "rds.global_db_rpo",
            "ParameterValue": "60",
            "Description": "(s) Recovery point objective threshold, in seconds, that blocks user commits when it is violated.",
            "Source": "user",
            "ApplyType": "dynamic",
            "DataType": "integer",
            "AllowedValues": "20-2147483647",
            "IsModifiable": true,
            "ApplyMethod": "immediate",
            "SupportedEngineModes": [
                "provisioned"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

[Viewing parameter values for a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-viewingcluster.md).

### Disabling the recovery point objective

To disable the RPO, reset the `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter. You can reset parameters using the
AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### To disable the RPO

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Parameter groups**.

3. In the list, choose your primary DB cluster parameter group.

4. Choose **Edit parameters**.

5. Choose the box next to the **rds.global\_db\_rpo** parameter.

6. Choose **Reset**.

7. When the screen shows **Reset parameters in DB parameter group**, choose
    **Reset parameters**.

For more information on how to reset a parameter with the console, see
[Modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifyingcluster.md).

To reset the `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter, use the
[reset-db-cluster-parameter-group](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/reset-db-cluster-parameter-group.md)
command.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds reset-db-cluster-parameter-group \
    --db-cluster-parameter-group-name global_db_cluster_parameter_group \
    --parameters "ParameterName=rds.global_db_rpo,ApplyMethod=immediate"
```

For Windows:

```json

aws rds reset-db-cluster-parameter-group ^
    --db-cluster-parameter-group-name global_db_cluster_parameter_group ^
    --parameters "ParameterName=rds.global_db_rpo,ApplyMethod=immediate"
```

To reset the `rds.global_db_rpo` parameter, use the Amazon RDS API
[ResetDBClusterParameterGroup](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-resetdbclusterparametergroup.md) operation.
