# Adding an AWS Region to an Amazon Aurora global database

You can use the following procedure to add an additional secondary cluster to an existing global database.
You can also create a global database from a standalone Aurora DB cluster by using this procedure to
add the first secondary AWS Region.

An Aurora global database needs at least one secondary Aurora DB cluster in a different AWS Region than the primary Aurora DB cluster. You can attach
up to 10 secondary DB clusters to your Aurora global database. Repeat the following procedure for each new
secondary DB cluster. For each secondary DB cluster that you add to your Aurora global database, reduce the
number of Aurora Replicas allowed to the primary DB cluster by one.

For example, if your Aurora global database has 10 secondary Regions, your primary DB cluster can have only 5 (rather than 15) Aurora Replicas.
For more information, see [Configuration requirements of an Amazon Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-configuration-requirements.md).

The number of Aurora Replicas (reader instances) in the primary DB cluster determines the number of secondary DB clusters you can add. The total number of
reader instances in the primary DB cluster plus the number of secondary clusters can't exceed 15. For example, if you have 14 reader instances in the primary
DB cluster and 1 secondary cluster, you can't add another secondary cluster to the global database.

###### Note

For Aurora MySQL version 3, when you create a secondary cluster, make sure that the value of
`lower_case_table_names` matches the value in the primary cluster. This
setting is a database parameter that affects how the server handles identifier case
sensitivity. For more information about database parameters, see [Parameter groups for Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

We recommend that when you create a secondary cluster, you use the same DB engine version for the primary and
secondary. If necessary, upgrade the primary to be the same version as the secondary. For more information, see [Patch level compatibility for managed cross-Region switchovers and failovers](aurora-global-database-upgrade.md#aurora-global-database-upgrade.minor.incompatibility).

###### To add an AWS Region to an Aurora global database

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane of the AWS Management Console, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose the Aurora global database that needs a secondary Aurora DB cluster. Ensure that
    the primary Aurora DB cluster is `Available`.

4. For **Actions**, choose **Add AWS Region**.

5. On the **Add a region** page, choose the secondary AWS Region.

You can't choose an AWS Region that already has a secondary Aurora DB
    cluster for the same Aurora global database. Also, it can't be the same Region
    as the primary Aurora DB cluster.

###### Note

Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL global databases works in secondary regions only if the parameters that control Babelfish preferences are turned on in those regions. For more information, see [DB cluster parameter group settings for Babelfish](babelfish-configuration.md)

![The Add a region page for an Aurora global database.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-db-create-apg-6-add-region.png)

6. Complete the remaining fields for the secondary Aurora cluster in the new AWS
    Region. These are the same configuration options as for any Aurora DB cluster instance, except for the
    following option for Aurora MySQL–based Aurora global databases only:

- Enable read replica write forwarding – This optional setting let's your Aurora global database's secondary
DB clusters forward write operations to the primary cluster. For more information, see
[Using write forwarding in an Amazon Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-write-forwarding.md).

![Screenshot showing the secondary cluster is now part of the Aurora global database.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-global-database-enable-write-forwarding.png)

7. Choose **Add AWS Region**.

After you finish adding the Region to your Aurora global database, you can see it in the list of **Databases**
in the AWS Management Console as shown in the screenshot.

###### To add a secondary AWS Region to an Aurora global database

To add a secondary cluster to your global database using the CLI, you must already have
the global cluster container object. If you haven't already run the
`create-global-cluster` command, see the CLI procedure in
[Creating an Amazon Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-creating.md).

1. Use the `create-db-cluster` CLI command
    with the name ( `--global-cluster-identifier`) of
    your Aurora global database. For other parameters, do the following:

2. For `--region`, choose a different AWS Region than that of your Aurora primary Region.

3. Choose specific values for the `--engine` and `--engine-version`
    parameters. These values are the same as those for the primary Aurora DB cluster
    in your Aurora global database.

4. For an encrypted cluster, specify your primary AWS Region as the `--source-region` for encryption.

The following example creates a new Aurora DB cluster and attaches it to an Aurora global database as a read-only secondary Aurora DB cluster.
In the last step, an Aurora DB instance is added to the new Aurora DB cluster.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds --region secondary_region \
  create-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier secondary_cluster_id \
    --global-cluster-identifier global_database_id \
    --engine aurora-mysql | aurora-postgresql \
    --engine-version version

aws rds --region secondary_region \
  create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-class instance_class \
    --db-cluster-identifier secondary_cluster_id \
    --db-instance-identifier db_instance_id \
    --engine aurora-mysql | aurora-postgresql
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds --region secondary_region ^
  create-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier secondary_cluster_id ^
    --global-cluster-identifier global_database_id_id ^
    --engine aurora-mysql | aurora-postgresql ^
    --engine-version version

aws rds --region secondary_region ^
  create-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-class instance_class ^
    --db-cluster-identifier secondary_cluster_id ^
    --db-instance-identifier db_instance_id ^
    --engine aurora-mysql | aurora-postgresql
```

To add a new AWS Region to an Aurora global database with the RDS API, run the
[CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) operation.
Specify the identifier of the existing global database using the
`GlobalClusterIdentifier` parameter.
