# Overview of Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management

Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management is designed to ensure plan stability regardless of
changes to the database that might cause query plan regression. _Query plan_
_regression_ occurs when the optimizer chooses a sub-optimal plan for a
given SQL statement after system or database changes. Changes to statistics,
constraints, environment settings, query parameter bindings, and upgrades to the
PostgreSQL database engine can all cause plan regression.

With Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management, you can control how and when query execution
plans change. The benefits of Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management include the following.

- Improve plan stability by forcing the optimizer to choose from a small number
of known, good plans.

- Optimize plans centrally and then distribute the best plans globally.

- Identify indexes that aren't used and assess the impact of creating or
dropping an index.

- Automatically detect a new minimum-cost plan discovered by the
optimizer.

- Try new optimizer features with less risk, because you can choose to approve
only the plan changes that improve performance.

You can use the tools provided by query plan management proactively, to specify the
best plan for certain queries. Or you can use query plan management to react to changing
circumstances and avoid plan regressions. For more information, see [Best practices for Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management](aurorapostgresql-optimize-bestpractice.md).

## Supported SQL statements

Query plan management supports the following types of SQL statements.

- Any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, regardless of complexity.

- Prepared statements. For more information, see [PREPARE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-prepare.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

- Dynamic statements, including those run in immediate-mode. For more
information, see [Dynamic\
SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ecpg-dynamic.html) and [EXECUTE IMMEDIATE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ecpg-sql-execute-immediate.html) in PostgreSQL documentation.

- Embedded SQL commands and statements. For more information, see [Embedded SQL Commands](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ecpg-sql-commands.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

- Statements inside named functions. For more information, see [CREATE FUNCTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

- Statements containing temp tables.

- Statements inside procedures and DO-blocks.

You can use query plan management with `EXPLAIN` in manual mode to
capture a plan without actually running it. For more information, see [Analyzing the optimizer's chosen plan](aurorapostgresql-optimize-useplans.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Optimize.UsePlans.AnalyzePlans). To learn more
about query plan management's modes (manual, automatic), see [Capturing Aurora PostgreSQL execution plans](aurorapostgresql-optimize-captureplans.md).

Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management supports all PostgreSQL language features,
including partitioned tables, inheritance, row-level security, and recursive common
table expressions (CTEs). To learn more about these PostgreSQL language features,
see [Table\
Partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html), [Row Security\
Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html), and [WITH Queries\
(Common Table Expressions)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html) and other topics in the PostgreSQL
documentation.

For information about different versions of the Aurora PostgreSQL query plan
management feature, see [Aurora PostgreSQL apg\_plan\_mgmt extension versions](../aurorapostgresqlreleasenotes/aurorapostgresql-extensions.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Extensions.apg_plan_mgmt) in the
_Release Notes for Aurora PostgreSQL_.

## Query plan management limitations

The current release of Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management has the following
limitations.

- Plans aren't captured for statements that
reference system relations – Statements that reference
system relations, such as `pg_class`, aren't captured. This
is by design, to prevent a large number of system-generated plans that are
used internally from being captured. This also applies to system tables
inside views.

- Larger DB instance class might be needed for your
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster – Depending on the workload,
query plan management might need a DB instance class that has more than 2
vCPUs. The number of `max_worker_processes` is limited by the DB
instance class size. The number of `max_worker_processes`
provided by a 2-vCPU DB instance class (db.t3.medium, for example) might not
be sufficient for a given workload. We recommend that you choose a DB
instance class with more than 2 vCPUs for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster if
you use query plan managment.

When the DB instance class can't support the workload, query plan
management raises an error message such as the following.

```nohighlight

WARNING: could not register plan insert background process
HINT: You may need to increase max_worker_processes.
```

In this case, you should scale up your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to a DB
instance class size with more memory. For more information, see [Supported DB engines for DB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass-supportaurora.md).

- Plans already stored in sessions aren't
affected – Query plan management provides a way to
influence query plans without changing the application code. However, when a
generic plan is already stored in an existing session and if you want to
change its query plan, then you must first set `plan_cache_mode`
to `force_custom_plan` in the DB cluster parameter group.

- `queryid` in `apg_plan_mgmt.dba_plans` and
`pg_stat_statements` can diverge when:

- Objects are dropped and recreated after storing in
apg\_plan\_mgmt.dba\_plans.

- `apg_plan_mgmt.plans` table is imported from another
cluster.

For information about different versions of the Aurora PostgreSQL query plan
management feature, see [Aurora PostgreSQL apg\_plan\_mgmt extension versions](../aurorapostgresqlreleasenotes/aurorapostgresql-extensions.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Extensions.apg_plan_mgmt) in the
_Release Notes for Aurora PostgreSQL_.

## Query plan management terminology

The following terms are used throughout this topic.

**managed statement**

A SQL statement captured by the optimizer under query plan management.
A managed statement has one or more query execution plans stored in the
`apg_plan_mgmt.dba_plans` view.

**plan baseline**

The set of approved plans for a given managed statement. That is, all
the plans for the managed statement that have "Approved" for their
`status` column in the `dba_plan` view.

**plan history**

The set of all captured plans for a given managed statement. The plan
history contains all plans captured for the statement, regardless of
status.

**query plan regression**

The case when the optimizer chooses a less optimal plan than it did
before a given change to the database environment, such as a new
PostgreSQL version or changes to statistics.

## Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management versions

Query plan management is supported by all currently available Aurora PostgreSQL
releases. For more information, see the list of [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL updates](../aurorapostgresqlreleasenotes/aurorapostgresql-updates.md) in the
_Release Notes for Aurora PostgreSQL_.

Query plan management functionality is added to your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster when
you install the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension. Different versions of
Aurora PostgreSQL support different versions of the `apg_plan_mgmt`
extension. We recommend that you upgrade the query plan management extension to the
latest release for your version of Aurora PostgreSQL.

###### Note

For release notes for each `apg_plan_mgmt` extension versions, see
[Aurora PostgreSQL apg\_plan\_mgmt extension versions](../aurorapostgresqlreleasenotes/aurorapostgresql-extensions.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Extensions.apg_plan_mgmt) in the
_Release Notes for Aurora PostgreSQL_.

You can identify the version running on your cluster by connecting to an instance
using `psql` and using the metacommand \\dx to list extensions as shown
following.

```nohighlight

labdb=> \dx
                       List of installed extensions
     Name      | Version |    Schema     |                            Description
---------------+---------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
 apg_plan_mgmt | 1.0     | apg_plan_mgmt | Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility Query Plan Management
 plpgsql       | 1.0     | pg_catalog    | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(2 rows)
```

The output shows that this cluster is using 1.0 version of the extension. Only
certain `apg_plan_mgmt` versions are available for a given Aurora PostgreSQL
version. In some cases, you might need to upgrade the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to a
new minor release or apply a patch so that you can upgrade to the most recent
version of query plan management. The `apg_plan_mgmt` version 1.0 shown
in the output is from an Aurora PostgreSQL version 10.17 DB cluster, which doesn't
have a newer version of `apg_plan_mgmt` available. In this case, the
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster should be upgraded to a more recent version of
PostgreSQL.

For more information about upgrading your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to a new
version of PostgreSQL, see [Database engine updates for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](aurorapostgresql-updates.md).

To learn how to upgrade the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension, see [Upgrading Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management](#AuroraPostgreSQL.Optimize.Upgrade).

## Turning on Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management

Setting up query plan management for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster involves
installing an extension and changing several DB cluster parameter settings. You need
`rds_superuser` permissions to install the `apg_plan_mgmt`
extension and to turn on the feature for the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

Installing the extension creates a new role, `apg_plan_mgmt`. This role
allows database users to view, manage, and maintain query plans. As an administrator
with `rds_superuser` privileges, be sure to grant the
`apg_plan_mgmt` role to database users as needed.

Only users with the `rds_superuser` role can complete the following
procedure. The `rds_superuser` is required for creating the
`apg_plan_mgmt` extension and its `apg_plan_mgmt` role.
Users must be granted the `apg_plan_mgmt` role to administer the
`apg_plan_mgmt` extension.

###### To turn on query plan management for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster

The following steps turn on query plan management for all SQL statements that
get submitted to the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. This is known as
_automatic_ mode. To learn more about the difference
between modes, see [Capturing Aurora PostgreSQL execution plans](aurorapostgresql-optimize-captureplans.md).

01. Open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. Create a custom DB cluster parameter group for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB
     cluster. You need to change certain parameters to activate query plan
     management and to set its behavior. For more information, see [Creating a DB parameter group in Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-creating.md).

03. Open the custom DB cluster parameter group and set the
     `rds.enable_plan_management` parameter to `1`, as
     shown in the following image.

    ![Image of the DB cluster parameter group.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-qpm-custom-db-cluster-param-change-1.png)

    For more information, see [Modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifyingcluster.md).

04. Create a custom DB parameter group that you can use to set query plan
     parameters at the instance level. For more information, see [Creating a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-creatingcluster.md).

05. Modify the writer instance of the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to use the
     custom DB parameter group. For more information, see [Modifying a DB instance in a DB cluster](aurora-modifying.md#Aurora.Modifying.Instance).

06. Modify the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to use the custom DB cluster parameter
     group. For more information, see [Modifying the DB cluster by using the console, CLI, and API](aurora-modifying.md#Aurora.Modifying.Cluster).

07. Reboot your DB instance to enable the custom parameter group
     settings.

08. Connect to your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster's DB instance endpoint using
     `psql` or `pgAdmin`. The following example uses
     the default `postgres` account for the `rds_superuser`
     role.

    ```nohighlight

    psql --host=cluster-instance-1.111122223333.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password --dbname=my-db
    ```

09. Create the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension for your DB instance, as
     shown following.

    ```nohighlight

    labdb=> CREATE EXTENSION apg_plan_mgmt;
    CREATE EXTENSION
    ```

    ###### Tip

    Install the `apg_plan_mgmt` extension in the template
    database for your application. The default template database is named
    `template1`. To learn more, see [Template Databases](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/manage-ag-templatedbs.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

10. Change the `apg_plan_mgmt.capture_plan_baselines` parameter to
     `automatic`. This setting causes the optimizer to generate
     plans for every SQL statement that is either planned or executed two or more
     times.

    ###### Note

    Query plan management also has a _manual_ mode that
    you can use for specific SQL statements. To learn more, see [Capturing Aurora PostgreSQL execution plans](aurorapostgresql-optimize-captureplans.md).

11. Change the value of `apg_plan_mgmt.use_plan_baselines`
     parameter to "on." This parameter causes the optimizer to choose a plan for
     the statement from its plan baseline. To learn more, see [Using Aurora PostgreSQL managed plans](aurorapostgresql-optimize-useplans.md).

    ###### Note

    You can modify the value of either of these dynamic parameters for the
    session without needing to reboot the instance.

When your query plan management set up is complete, be sure to grant the
`apg_plan_mgmt` role to any database users that need to view, manage,
or maintain query plans.

## Upgrading Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management

We recommend that you upgrade the query plan management extension to the latest
release for your version of Aurora PostgreSQL.

1. Connect to the writer instance of your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster as a user
    that has `rds_superuser` privileges. If you kept the default name
    when you set up your instance, you connect as `postgres` This
    example shows how to use `psql`, but you can also use pgAdmin if
    you prefer.

```nohighlight

psql --host=111122223333.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --username=postgres --password
```

2. Run the following query to upgrade the extension.

```nohighlight

ALTER EXTENSION apg_plan_mgmt UPDATE TO '2.1';
```

3. Use the [apg\_plan\_mgmt.validate\_plans](aurorapostgresql-optimize-functions.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Optimize.Functions.validate_plans)
    function to update the hashes of all plans. The optimizer validates all
    Approved, Unapproved, and Rejected plans to ensure that they's still
    viable plans for new version of the extension.

```nohighlight

SELECT apg_plan_mgmt.validate_plans('update_plan_hash');
```

To learn more about using this function, see [Validating plans](aurorapostgresql-optimize-deleting.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Optimize.Maintenance.ValidatingPlans).

4. Use the [apg\_plan\_mgmt.reload](aurorapostgresql-optimize-functions.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Optimize.Functions.reload) function to
    refresh any plans in the shared memory with the validated plans from the
    dba\_plans view.

```nohighlight

SELECT apg_plan_mgmt.reload();
```

To learn more about all functions available for query plan management, see [Function reference for Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management](aurorapostgresql-optimize-functions.md).

## Turning off Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management

You can disable query plan management at any time by turning off the
`apg_plan_mgmt.use_plan_baselines` and
`apg_plan_mgmt.capture_plan_baselines`.

```nohighlight

labdb=> SET apg_plan_mgmt.use_plan_baselines = off;

labdb=> SET apg_plan_mgmt.capture_plan_baselines = off;

```
