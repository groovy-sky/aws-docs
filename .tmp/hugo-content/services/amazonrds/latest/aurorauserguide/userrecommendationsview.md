# Viewing Amazon Aurora recommendations

Using the Amazon RDS console, you can view Amazon Aurora recommendations for your database
resources. For a DB cluster, the recommendations appear for the DB cluster and its instances.

###### To view the Amazon Aurora recommendations

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, do any of the following:

- Choose **Recommendations**. The number of active recommendations for your
resources and the number of recommendations with the highest
severity generated in the last month are available next to **Recommendations**.
To find the number of active recommendations for each severity,
choose the number that shows the highest severity.

![Select Recommendations in the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/recommendations-select.png)

By default, the **Recommendations** page displays a list of
new recommendations in the last month. Amazon Aurora gives recommendations for all the resources in your account and sorts the recommendations by their severity.

You can choose a recommendation to view a section at the bottom of the page which contains the affected resources and details of how the recommendation will be applied.

- In the **Databases** page, choose **Recommendations** for a resource.
