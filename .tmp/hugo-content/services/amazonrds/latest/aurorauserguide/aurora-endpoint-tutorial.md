# AWS CLI examples for custom endpoints for Amazon Aurora

The following tutorial uses AWS CLI examples with Unix shell syntax to show how you
might define a cluster with several "small" DB instances and a few
"big" DB instances, and create custom endpoints to connect to each set of
DB instances. To run similar commands on your own system, you should be familiar enough
with the basics of working with Aurora clusters and AWS CLI usage to supply your own values
for parameters such as region, subnet group, and VPC security group.

This example demonstrates the initial setup steps: creating an Aurora cluster and
adding DB instances to it. This is a heterogeneous cluster, meaning not all the DB
instances have the same capacity. Most instances use the AWS instance class
`db.r4.4xlarge`, but the last two DB instances use
`db.r4.16xlarge`. Each of these sample `create-db-instance`
commands prints its output to the screen and saves a copy of the JSON in a file for later
inspection.

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier custom-endpoint-demo --engine aurora-mysql \
     --engine-version 8.0.mysql_aurora.3.04.0 --master-username $MASTER_USER --manage-master-user-password \
     --db-subnet-group-name $SUBNET_GROUP  --vpc-security-group-ids $VPC_SECURITY_GROUP \
     --region $REGION

for i in 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
do
  aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier custom-endpoint-demo-${i} \
     --engine aurora --db-cluster-identifier custom-endpoint-demo --db-instance-class db.r4.4xlarge \
     --region $REGION \
     | tee custom-endpoint-demo-${i}.json
done

for i in 09 10
do
  aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier custom-endpoint-demo-${i} \
     --engine aurora --db-cluster-identifier custom-endpoint-demo --db-instance-class db.r4.16xlarge \
     --region $REGION \
     | tee custom-endpoint-demo-${i}.json
done

```

The larger instances are reserved for specialized kinds of reporting queries. To make
it unlikely for them to be promoted to the primary instance, the following example changes
their promotion tier to the lowest priority. This example specifies the
`--manage-master-user-password` option to generate the master user password
and manage it in Secrets Manager. For more information, see [Password management with Amazon Aurora and AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md). Alternatively, you can use the
`--master-password` option to specify and manage the password
yourself.

```bash

for i in 09 10
do
  aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier custom-endpoint-demo-${i} \
    --region $REGION --promotion-tier 15
done

```

Suppose that you want to use the two "bigger" instances only for the most
resource-intensive queries. To do this, you can first create a custom read-only endpoint.
Then you can add a static list of members so that the endpoint connects only to those DB
instances. Those instances are already in the lowest promotion tier, making it unlikely
either of them will be promoted to the primary instance. If one of them is promoted to the
primary instance, it becomes unreachable through this endpoint because we specified the
`READER` type instead of the `ANY` type.

The following example demonstrates the create and modify endpoint commands, and sample
JSON output showing the initial and modified state of the custom endpoint.

```bash

$ aws rds create-db-cluster-endpoint --region $REGION \
    --db-cluster-identifier custom-endpoint-demo \
    --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier big-instances --endpoint-type reader
{
    "EndpointType": "CUSTOM",
    "Endpoint": "big-instances.cluster-custom-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "DBClusterEndpointIdentifier": "big-instances",
    "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo",
    "StaticMembers": [],
    "DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier": "cluster-endpoint-W7PE3TLLFNSHXQKFU6J6NV5FHU",
    "ExcludedMembers": [],
    "CustomEndpointType": "READER",
    "Status": "creating",
    "DBClusterEndpointArn": "arn:aws:rds:ca-central-1:111122223333:cluster-endpoint:big-instances"
}

$ aws rds modify-db-cluster-endpoint --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier big-instances \
    --static-members custom-endpoint-demo-09 custom-endpoint-demo-10 --region $REGION
{
    "EndpointType": "CUSTOM",
    "ExcludedMembers": [],
    "DBClusterEndpointIdentifier": "big-instances",
    "DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier": "cluster-endpoint-W7PE3TLLFNSHXQKFU6J6NV5FHU",
    "CustomEndpointType": "READER",
    "DBClusterEndpointArn": "arn:aws:rds:ca-central-1:111122223333:cluster-endpoint:big-instances",
    "StaticMembers": [
        "custom-endpoint-demo-10",
        "custom-endpoint-demo-09"
    ],
    "Status": "modifying",
    "Endpoint": "big-instances.cluster-custom-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo"
}

```

The default `READER` endpoint for the cluster can connect to either the
"small" or "big" DB instances, making it impractical to
predict query performance and scalability when the cluster becomes busy. To divide the
workload cleanly between the sets of DB instances, you can ignore the default
`READER` endpoint and create a second custom endpoint that connects to all
other DB instances. The following example does so by creating a custom endpoint and then
adding an exclusion list. Any other DB instances you add to the cluster later will be
added to this endpoint automatically. The `ANY` type means that this endpoint
is associated with eight instances in total: the primary instance and another seven Aurora
Replicas. If the example used the `READER` type, the custom endpoint would only
be associated with the seven Aurora Replicas.

```bash

$ aws rds create-db-cluster-endpoint --region $REGION --db-cluster-identifier custom-endpoint-demo \
    --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier small-instances --endpoint-type any
{
    "Status": "creating",
    "DBClusterEndpointIdentifier": "small-instances",
    "CustomEndpointType": "ANY",
    "EndpointType": "CUSTOM",
    "Endpoint": "small-instances.cluster-custom-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "StaticMembers": [],
    "ExcludedMembers": [],
    "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo",
    "DBClusterEndpointArn": "arn:aws:rds:ca-central-1:111122223333:cluster-endpoint:small-instances",
    "DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier": "cluster-endpoint-6RDDXQOC3AKKZT2PRD7ST37BMY"
}

$ aws rds modify-db-cluster-endpoint --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier small-instances \
    --excluded-members custom-endpoint-demo-09 custom-endpoint-demo-10 --region $REGION
{
    "DBClusterEndpointIdentifier": "small-instances",
    "DBClusterEndpointArn": "arn:aws:rds:ca-central-1:c7tj4example:cluster-endpoint:small-instances",
    "DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier": "cluster-endpoint-6RDDXQOC3AKKZT2PRD7ST37BMY",
    "CustomEndpointType": "ANY",
    "Endpoint": "small-instances.cluster-custom-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "EndpointType": "CUSTOM",
    "ExcludedMembers": [
        "custom-endpoint-demo-09",
        "custom-endpoint-demo-10"
    ],
    "StaticMembers": [],
    "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo",
    "Status": "modifying"
}

```

The following example checks the state of the endpoints for this cluster. The cluster
still has its original cluster endpoint, with `EndPointType` of
`WRITER`, which you would still use for administration, ETL, and other write
operations. It still has its original `READER` endpoint, which you wouldn't use
because each connection to it might be directed to a "small" or
"big" DB instance. The custom endpoints make this behavior predictable,
with connections guaranteed to use one of the "small" or "big"
DB instances based on the endpoint you specify.

```bash

$ aws rds describe-db-cluster-endpoints --region $REGION
{
    "DBClusterEndpoints": [
        {
            "EndpointType": "WRITER",
            "Endpoint": "custom-endpoint-demo.cluster-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Status": "available",
            "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo"
        },
        {
            "EndpointType": "READER",
            "Endpoint": "custom-endpoint-demo.cluster-ro-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Status": "available",
            "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "small-instances.cluster-custom-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "CustomEndpointType": "ANY",
            "DBClusterEndpointArn": "arn:aws:rds:ca-central-1:111122223333:cluster-endpoint:small-instances",
            "ExcludedMembers": [
                "custom-endpoint-demo-09",
                "custom-endpoint-demo-10"
            ],
            "DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier": "cluster-endpoint-6RDDXQOC3AKKZT2PRD7ST37BMY",
            "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo",
            "StaticMembers": [],
            "EndpointType": "CUSTOM",
            "DBClusterEndpointIdentifier": "small-instances",
            "Status": "modifying"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "big-instances.cluster-custom-c7tj4example.ca-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "CustomEndpointType": "READER",
            "DBClusterEndpointArn": "arn:aws:rds:ca-central-1:111122223333:cluster-endpoint:big-instances",
            "ExcludedMembers": [],
            "DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier": "cluster-endpoint-W7PE3TLLFNSHXQKFU6J6NV5FHU",
            "DBClusterIdentifier": "custom-endpoint-demo",
            "StaticMembers": [
                "custom-endpoint-demo-10",
                "custom-endpoint-demo-09"
            ],
            "EndpointType": "CUSTOM",
            "DBClusterEndpointIdentifier": "big-instances",
            "Status": "available"
        }
    ]
}

```

The final examples demonstrate how successive database connections to the custom
endpoints connect to the various DB instances in the Aurora cluster. The
`small-instances` endpoint always connects to the `db.r4.4xlarge`
DB instances, which are the lower-numbered hosts in this cluster.

The `big-instances` endpoint always connects to the
`db.r4.16xlarge` DB instances, which are the two highest-numbered hosts in
this cluster.
