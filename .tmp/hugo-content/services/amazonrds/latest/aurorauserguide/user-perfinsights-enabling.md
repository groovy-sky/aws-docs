# Turning Performance Insights on and off for Aurora

###### Important

AWS has announced the end-of-life date for Performance Insights: June 30, 2026. After this date, Amazon RDS will no longer support the Performance Insights console experience,
flexible retention periods (1-24 months), and their associated pricing. The Performance Insights API will continue to exist with no pricing changes. Costs for the
Performance Insights API will appear in your AWS bill with the cost of CloudWatch Database Insights.

We recommend that you upgrade any DB clusters
using the paid tier of Performance Insights to the Advanced mode of Database Insights before June 30, 2026.
For information about upgrading to the Advanced mode of Database Insights, see
[Turning on the Advanced mode of Database Insights for Amazon Aurora](user-databaseinsights-turningonadvanced.md).

If you take no action, DB clusters using Performance Insights
will default to using the Standard mode of Database Insights. With Standard mode of Database Insights, you might lose access to performance data history beyond 7 days and might not be able to use execution plans
and on-demand analysis features in the Amazon RDS console. After June 30, 2026 only the Advanced mode of Database Insights will support execution plans and on-demand analysis.

With CloudWatch Database Insights, you can monitor database load for your fleet of databases and analyze and troubleshoot performance at scale.
For more information about Database Insights, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora databases with CloudWatch Database Insights](user-databaseinsights.md).
For pricing information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

You can turn on Performance Insights for your DB cluster
when you create it. If needed, you can turn it off later by modifying your  DB cluster

from the console. Turning Performance Insights on and off
doesn't cause downtime, a reboot, or a failover.

###### Note

Performance Schema is an optional performance tool used by Aurora MySQL. If you turn Performance Schema on or off, you need
to reboot. If you turn Performance Insights on or off, however, you don't need to reboot. For more information,
see [Overview of the Performance Schema for Performance Insights on Aurora MySQL](user-perfinsights-enablemysql.md).

If you use Performance Insights with Aurora global databases, turn
on Performance Insights individually for the databases in each AWS Region. For details,
see [Monitoring an Amazon Aurora global database with Amazon RDS Performance Insights](aurora-global-database-monitoring.md#aurora-global-database-pi).

The Performance Insights agent consumes limited CPU and memory on the DB host. When
the DB load is high, the agent limits the performance impact by collecting data less
frequently.

Console

In the console, you can turn Performance Insights on or off when you
create a DB cluster. Enabling Performance Insights allows you to
manage Performance Insights settings and options for your DB cluster.
Cluster level settings apply to all DB instances in the cluster.

Turning Performance Insights on or off when creating a DB cluster

After creating a new DB cluster,
Amazon RDS enables Performance Insights by default. To turn off Performance Insights for your DB cluster, choose the option
**Database Insights – Standard** and deselect the option **Enable Performance Insights**.

To create a DB cluster, follow the instructions for your DB engine in [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

The following screenshot shows the **Performance Insights** section.

![Turn on Performance Insights during DB cluster creation with console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/perf_insights_cluster_enabling.png)

If you choose **Enable Performance Insights**, you have the following options:

- **Retention** (for the Standard mode of Database Insights only) – The amount of time to retain Performance Insights data. The retention setting is **Default (7 days)**. To retain your performance
data for longer, specify 1–24 months. For more information about retention periods, see
[Pricing and data retention for Performance Insights](user-perfinsights-overview-cost.md).

- **AWS KMS key** – Specify your AWS KMS key.
Performance Insights encrypts all potentially sensitive
data using your KMS key. Data is encrypted in flight and at rest.
For more information, see [Changing an AWS KMS policy for Performance Insights](user-perfinsights-access-control-cmk-policy.md).

Turning Performance Insights on or off when modifying a DB cluster

In the console, you can modify a DB cluster
to manage Performance Insights.

###### To manage Performance Insights for a DB cluster using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases**.

3. Choose a DB cluster,
    and choose **Modify**.

4. To turn on Performance Insights, select **Enable Performance Insights**. To turn off Performance Insights for your DB cluster, choose the option
    **Database Insights – Standard** and deselect the option **Enable Performance Insights**.

If you choose **Enable Performance Insights**, you have the following options:

- **Retention** (for the Standard mode of Database Insights only) – The amount of time to retain Performance Insights data. The retention setting is **Default (7 days)**. To retain your performance
data for longer, specify 1–24 months. For more information about retention periods, see
[Pricing and data retention for Performance Insights](user-perfinsights-overview-cost.md).

- **AWS KMS key** – Specify your
KMS key. Performance Insights encrypts all
potentially sensitive data using your KMS key. Data is
encrypted in flight and at rest. For more information, see
[Encrypting Amazon Aurora resources](overview-encryption.md).

![Modify Performance Insights during DB cluster modifying with console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/perf_insights_cluster_modifying.png)

5. Choose **Continue**.

6. For **Scheduling of Modifications**, choose Apply immediately. If you
    choose Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window, your instance
    ignores this setting and turns on Performance Insights
    immediately.

7. Choose **Modify instance**.

AWS CLI

When you use the [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) AWS CLI command, turn on Performance Insights by
specifying `--enable-performance-insights` and set `--database-insights-mode` to either `advanced` or `standard`.
To turn off Performance Insights, specify `--no-enable-performance-insights` and set `database-insights-mode` to `standard`.

You can also specify these values using the following AWS CLI commands:

- [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md)

- [modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md)

- [create-db-instance-read-replica](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance-read-replica.md)

- [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md)

- [restore-db-instance-from-s3](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-s3.md)

###### To manage Performance Insights for a DB cluster using the AWS CLI

- Call the [modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md) AWS CLI command and supply the following
values:

- `--db-cluster-identifier` – The name of the DB instance in your DB cluster.

- `--enable-performance-insights` to turn on or
`--no-enable-performance-insights` to turn off

- `database-insights-mode` – The mode of Database Insights for the DB cluster. To turn off Performance Insights, set this value to `standard`.

The following example turns on Performance Insights for
`sample-db-cluster`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
	--database-insights-mode standard \
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-db-instance \
    --enable-performance-insights
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
	--database-insights-mode standard ^
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-db-instance ^
    --enable-performance-insights
```

When you turn on Performance Insights in the CLI, you can optionally specify the number of days to retain Performance Insights data with the
`--performance-insights-retention-period` option. You can specify `7`, `month` \\* 31 (where `month` is a number from 1–23),
or `731`. For example, if you want to retain your performance data for 3 months, specify `93`, which is 3 \* 31. The default
is `7` days. For more information about retention periods, see [Pricing and data retention for Performance Insights](user-perfinsights-overview-cost.md).

The following example turns on Performance Insights for `sample-db-cluster` and specifies that Performance Insights data is
retained for 93 days (3 months).

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
	--database-insights-mode standard \
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-db-instance \
    --enable-performance-insights \
    --performance-insights-retention-period 93
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
	--database-insights-mode standard ^
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-db-instance ^
    --enable-performance-insights ^
    --performance-insights-retention-period 93
```

If you specify a retention period such as 94 days, which isn't a valid value, RDS issues an error.

```nohighlight

An error occurred (InvalidParameterValue) when calling the CreateDBInstance operation:
Invalid Performance Insights retention period. Valid values are: [7, 31, 62, 93, 124, 155, 186, 217,
248, 279, 310, 341, 372, 403, 434, 465, 496, 527, 558, 589, 620, 651, 682, 713, 731]
```

###### Note

You can only toggle Performance Insights for an instance in a DB cluster where Performance Insights is not managed at the cluster level.

RDS API

When you create a new DB instance in your DB cluster using the [CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md) operation Amazon RDS API operation, turn on Performance Insights
by setting `EnablePerformanceInsights` to `True`. To turn off Performance Insights, set
`EnablePerformanceInsights` to `False` and set `DatabaseInsightsMode` to `standard`.

You can also specify the `EnablePerformanceInsights` value using
the following API operations:

- [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md)

- [ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md)

- [ModifyDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbinstance.md)

- [CreateDBInstanceReadReplica](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstancereadreplica.md)

- [RestoreDBInstanceFromS3](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbinstancefroms3.md)

When you turn on Performance Insights, you can optionally specify the amount of time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data with the
`PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod` parameter. You can specify `7`, `month` \\* 31 (where `month` is a number from 1–23),
or `731`. For example, if you want to retain your performance data for 3 months, specify `93`, which is 3 \* 31. The default
is `7` days. For more information about retention periods, see [Pricing and data retention for Performance Insights](user-perfinsights-overview-cost.md).
