# Performing a manual vacuum freeze

You might want to perform a manual vacuum on a table that has a vacuum process already
running. This is useful if you have identified a table with an age approaching 2 billion
transactions (or above any threshold you are monitoring).

The following steps are guidelines, with several variations to the process. For example,
during testing, suppose that you find that the [`maintenance_work_mem`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html) parameter value is set too small and that you
need to take immediate action on a table. However, perhaps you don't want to bounce the
instance at the moment. Using the queries in previous sections, you determine which table is
the problem and notice a long running autovacuum session. You know that you need to change the
`maintenance_work_mem` parameter setting, but you also need to take immediate
action and vacuum the table in question. The following procedure shows what to do in this
situation.

###### To manually perform a vacuum freeze

1. Open two sessions to the database containing the table you want to vacuum. For the
    second session, use "screen" or another utility that maintains the session if your
    connection is dropped.

2. In session one, get the process ID (PID) of the autovacuum session running on the
    table.

Run the following query to get the PID of the autovacuum session.

```sql

SELECT datname, usename, pid, current_timestamp - xact_start
AS xact_runtime, query
FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE upper(query) LIKE '%VACUUM%' ORDER BY
xact_start;
```

3. In session two, calculate the amount of memory that you need for this operation. In
    this example, we determine that we can afford to use up to 2 GB of memory for this
    operation, so we set [`maintenance_work_mem`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html) for the current session to 2 GB.

```sql

SET maintenance_work_mem='2 GB';
SET
```

4. In session two, issue a `vacuum freeze verbose` command for the table. The
    verbose setting is useful because, although there is no progress report for this in
    PostgreSQL currently, you can see activity.

```nohighlight

\timing on
Timing is on.
vacuum freeze verbose pgbench_branches;
```

```nohighlight

0 pages are entirely empty.
CPU 0.00s/0.00u sec elapsed 0.00 sec.
VACUUM
Time: 2.765 ms

```

5. In session one, if autovacuum was blocking the vacuum session,
    `pg_stat_activity` shows that waiting is `T` for your vacuum
    session. In this case, end the autovacuum process as follows.

```sql

SELECT pg_terminate_backend('the_pid');
```

###### Note

Some lower versions of Amazon Aurora can't terminate an autovacuum process using the
preceding command and fail with the following error: `ERROR: 42501: must be a
                 superuser to terminate superuser process LOCATION: pg_terminate_backend,
                 signalfuncs.c:227`. To find the PostgreSQL versions
that have been patched, search for the following bullet in [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL updates](../../../index/index.md):

```nohighlight

Allow rds_superuser to terminate backends which are not explicitly associated with a role
```

At this point, your session begins. Autovacuum restarts immediately because this table
    is probably the highest on its list of work.

6. Initiate your `vacuum freeze verbose` command in session two, and then end
    the autovacuum process in session one.
