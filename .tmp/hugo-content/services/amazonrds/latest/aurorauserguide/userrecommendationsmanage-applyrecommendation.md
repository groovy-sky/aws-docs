# Applying Amazon Aurora recommendations

To apply Amazon Aurora recommendations using the Amazon RDS console, select a configuration based recommendation or an affected resource in the details page.
Then, choose to apply the recommendation immediately or schedule it for the next maintenance window. The resource
might need to restart for the change to take effect. For a few DB
parameter group recommendations, you might need to restart the resources.

The threshold based proactive or anomaly based reactive recommendations won't have the apply option and might
need additional review.

###### To apply a configuration based recommendation

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, perform any of the following:

- Choose **Recommendations**.

The **Recommendations** page appears with the list of
all recommendations.

- Choose **Databases** and then choose **Recommendations**
for a resource in the databases page.

The details appear in the **Recommendations** tab for
the selected recommendation.

- Choose **Detection** for an active recommendation in the **Recommendations** page
or the **Recommendations** tab in the **Databases** page.

The recommendation details page appears.

3. Choose a recommendation, or one or more affected resources in the
    recommendation details page, and do any of the following:

- Choose **Apply** and then choose **Apply immediately** to
apply the recommendation immediately.

- Choose **Apply** and then choose **Apply in next maintenance window** to schedule in the next maintenance window.

The selected recommendation status is updated to pending until
the next maintenance window.

A confirmation window appears.

4. Choose **Confirm application** to apply the recommendation. This window confirms whether the resources
    need an automatic or manual restart for the changes to take effect.

The following example shows the confirmation window to apply the recommendation immediately.

A banner displays a message when the recommendation applied is successful or
    has failed.

The following example shows the banner with the successful message.

###### To apply a configuration based Aurora recommendation using the Amazon RDS API

1. Use the [DescribeDBRecommendations](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbrecommendations.md) operation. The `RecommendedActions`
    in the output can have one or more recommended actions.

2. Use the [RecommendedAction](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-recommendedaction.md) object for each recommended action from step 1.
    The output contains `Operation` and `Parameters`.

The following example shows the output with one recommended action.

```nohighlight

       "RecommendedActions": [
           {
               "ActionId": "0b19ed15-840f-463c-a200-b10af1b552e3",
               "Title": "Turn on auto backup", // localized
               "Description": "Turn on auto backup for my-mysql-instance-1", // localized
               "Operation": "ModifyDbInstance",
               "Parameters": [
                   {
                       "Key": "DbInstanceIdentifier",
                       "Value": "my-mysql-instance-1"
                   },
                   {
                       "Key": "BackupRetentionPeriod",
                       "Value": "7"
                   }
               ],
               "ApplyModes": ["immediately", "next-maintenance-window"],
               "Status": "applied"
           },
           ... // several others
       ],

```

3. Use the `operation` for each recommended action from the output in step 2 and input
    the `Parameters` values.

4. After the operation in step 2 is successful, use the [ModifyDBRecommendation](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbrecommendation.md) operation
    to modify the recommendation status.
