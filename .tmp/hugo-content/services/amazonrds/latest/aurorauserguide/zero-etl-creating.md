# Creating Aurora zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift

When you create an Aurora zero-ETL integration, you specify the source Aurora DB cluster and the target Amazon Redshift data
warehouse. You can also customize encryption settings and add tags. Aurora creates an
integration between the source DB cluster and its target. Once the integration is active, any data
that you insert into the source DB cluster will be replicated into the configured Amazon Redshift
target.

## Prerequisites

Before you create a zero-ETL integration, you must create a source DB cluster and a target Amazon Redshift data warehouse. You also must allow replication
into the data warehouse by adding the DB cluster as an authorized
integration source.

For instructions to complete each of these steps, see [Getting started with Aurora zero-ETL integrations](zero-etl-setting-up.md).

## Required permissions

Certain IAM permissions are required to create a zero-ETL integration. At minimum, you
need permissions to perform the following actions:

- Create zero-ETL integrations for the source Aurora DB cluster.

- View and delete all zero-ETL integrations.

- Create inbound integrations into the target data warehouse.

The following sample policies demonstrate the [least privilege\
permissions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md#grant-least-privilege) required to create and manage integrations. You might not need
these exact permissions if your user or role has broader permissions, such as an
`AdministratorAccess` managed policy.

###### Note

Redshift Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) have the following format. Note the use of a
forward slash `(/`) rather than a colon ( `:`) before the
serverless namespace UUID.

- Provisioned cluster – `arn:aws:redshift:{region}:{account-id}:namespace:namespace-uuid`

- Serverless – `arn:aws:redshift-serverless:{region}:{account-id}:namespace/namespace-uuid`

### Choosing a target data warehouse in a different account

If you plan to specify a target Amazon Redshift data warehouse that's in another AWS account,
you must create a role that allows users in the current account to access resources
in the target account. For more information, see [Providing access\
to an IAM user in another AWS account that you own](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-common-scenarios-aws-accounts.md).

The role must have the following permissions, which allow the user to view
available Amazon Redshift provisioned clusters and Redshift Serverless namespaces in the target
account.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "redshift:DescribeClusters",
            "redshift-serverless:ListNamespaces"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

```

The role must have the following trust policy, which specifies the target account
ID.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

```

For instructions to create the role, see [Creating a role using custom trust policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-custom.md).

## Creating zero-ETL integrations

You can create a zero-ETL integration using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

###### Important

zero-ETL integrations do not support refresh or resync operations. If you encounter issues with an integration after creation, you must delete the integration and create a new one.

###### To create a zero-ETL integration

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Zero-ETL integrations**.

03. Choose **Create zero-ETL integration**.

04. For **Integration identifier**, enter a name for the
     integration. The name can have up to 63 alphanumeric characters and can
     include hyphens.

    ###### Important

    Catalog names are limited to 19 characters in length. Ensure your integration identifier meets this requirement if it will be used as a catalog name.

05. Choose **Next**.

06. For **Source**, select the Aurora DB cluster where
     the data will originate from.

    ###### Note

    RDS notifies you if the DB cluster parameters aren't configured correctly. If you
    receive this message, you can either choose **Fix it for**
    **me**, or configure them manually. For instructions to
    fix them manually, see [Step 1: Create a custom DB cluster parameter group](zero-etl-setting-up.md#zero-etl.parameters).

    Modifying DB cluster
    parameters requires a reboot. Before you can create the integration,
    the reboot must be complete and the new parameter values must be
    successfully applied to the cluster.

07. (Optional) Select **Customize data filtering**
    **options** and add data filters to your integration. You can
     use data filters to define the scope of replication to the target data
     warehouse. For more information, see [Data filtering for Aurora zero-ETL integrations](zero-etl-filtering.md).

08. Once your source DB cluster is
     successfully configured, choose **Next**.

09. For **Target**, do the following:

1. (Optional) To use a different AWS account for the Amazon Redshift target, choose **Specify a**
**different account**. Then, enter the ARN of an
    IAM role with permissions to display your data warehouses. For
    instructions to create the IAM role, see [Choosing a target data warehouse in a different account](#zero-etl.create-permissions-cross-account).

2. For **Amazon Redshift data warehouse**, select the target for replicated data from the
    source DB cluster. You can choose a
    provisioned Amazon Redshift _cluster_ or a Redshift Serverless
    _namespace_ as the target.

###### Note

RDS notifies you if the resource policy or case sensitivity
settings for the specified data warehouse aren't configured
correctly. If you receive this message, you can either choose
**Fix it for me**, or configure them manually.
For instructions to fix them manually, see [Turn on case sensitivity for your data warehouse](../../../redshift/latest/mgmt/zero-etl-using-setting-up.md#zero-etl-setting-up.case-sensitivity) and
[Configure authorization for your data warehouse](../../../redshift/latest/mgmt/zero-etl-using-setting-up.md#zero-etl-using.redshift-iam) in the
_Amazon Redshift Management_
_Guide_.

Modifying case sensitivity for a _provisioned_
Redshift cluster requires a reboot. Before you can create the
integration, the reboot must be complete and the new parameter value
must be successfully applied to the cluster.

If your selected source and target are in different
AWS accounts, then Amazon RDS cannot fix these settings for you. You
must navigate to the other account and fix them manually in
Amazon Redshift.

10. Once your target data warehouse is configured correctly, choose
     **Next**.

11. (Optional) For **Tags**, add one or more tags to the
     integration. For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Aurora andAmazon RDS resources](user-tagging.md).

12. For **Encryption**, specify how you want your
     integration to be encrypted. By default, RDS encrypts all integrations with
     an AWS owned key. To choose a customer managed key instead, enable
     **Customize encryption settings** and choose a
     KMS key to use for encryption. For more information, see [Encrypting Amazon Aurora resources](overview-encryption.md).

    Optionally, add an encryption context. For more information, see
     [Encryption\
     context](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#encrypt_context) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer_
    _Guide_.

    ###### Note

    Amazon RDS adds the following encryption context pairs in addition to
    any that you add:

- `aws:redshift:integration:arn` -
`IntegrationArn`

- `aws:servicename:id` -
`Redshift`

This reduces the overall number of pairs that you can add from 8
to 6, and contributes to the overall character limit of the grant
constraint. For more information, see [Using grant constraints](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/create-grant-overview.md#grant-constraints) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

13. Choose **Next**.

14. Review your integration settings and choose **Create zero-ETL integration**.

    If creation fails, see [I can't create a zero-ETL integration](zero-etl-troubleshooting.md#zero-etl.troubleshooting.creation) for
     troubleshooting steps.

The integration has a status of `Creating` while it's being created, and the
target Amazon Redshift data warehouse has a status of `Modifying`. During this time, you
can't query the data warehouse or make any configuration changes on it.

When the integration is successfully created, the status of the integration and the target
Amazon Redshift data warehouse both change to `Active`.

To create a zero-ETL integration using the AWS CLI, use the [create-integration](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-integration.md)
command with the following options:

###### Note

Remember that catalog names are limited to 19 characters. Choose your integration name accordingly if it will be used as a catalog name.

- `--integration-name` – Specify a name for the
integration.

- `--source-arn` – Specify the ARN of the Aurora DB cluster that will be the source for the
integration.

- `--target-arn` – Specify the ARN of the Amazon Redshift
data warehouse that will be the target for the integration.

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-integration \
    --integration-name my-integration \
    --source-arn arn:aws:rds:{region}:{account-id}:my-db \
    --target-arn arn:aws:redshift:{region}:{account-id}:namespace:namespace-uuid
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-integration ^
    --integration-name my-integration ^
    --source-arn arn:aws:rds:{region}:{account-id}:my-db ^
    --target-arn arn:aws:redshift:{region}:{account-id}:namespace:namespace-uuid
```

To create a zero-ETL integration by using the Amazon RDS API, use the [`CreateIntegration`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createintegration.md) operation with the following
parameters:

###### Note

Catalog names are limited to 19 characters. Ensure your IntegrationName parameter meets this requirement if it will be used as a catalog name.

- `IntegrationName` – Specify a name for the
integration.

- `SourceArn` – Specify the ARN of the Aurora DB cluster that will be the source for the
integration.

- `TargetArn` – Specify the ARN of the Amazon Redshift data
warehouse that will be the target for the integration.

## Encrypting integrations with a customer managed key

If you specify a custom KMS key rather than an AWS owned key when you create an
integration, the key policy must provide the Amazon Redshift service principal access to the
`CreateGrant` action. In addition, it must allow the current user to
perform to the `DescribeKey` and `CreateGrant` actions.

The following sample policy demonstrates how to provide the required permissions in
the key policy. It includes context keys to further reduce the scope of
permissions.

    ]
}

```

For more information, see [Creating a key policy](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-overview.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service_
_Developer Guide_.

## Next steps

After you successfully create a zero-ETL integration, you must create a destination database
within your target Amazon Redshift cluster or workgroup. Then, you can start adding data to the
source Aurora DB cluster and querying it in Amazon Redshift. For instructions, see [Creating destination databases in\
Amazon Redshift](../../../redshift/latest/mgmt/zero-etl-using-creating-db.md).
