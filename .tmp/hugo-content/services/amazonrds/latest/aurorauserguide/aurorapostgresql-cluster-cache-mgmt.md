# Fast recovery after failover with cluster cache management for Aurora PostgreSQL

For fast recovery of the writer DB instance in your Aurora PostgreSQL clusters if there's a
failover, use cluster cache management for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. Cluster cache management
ensures that application performance is maintained if there's a failover.

In a typical failover situation, you might see a temporary but large performance
degradation after failover. This degradation occurs because when the failover DB instance
starts, the buffer cache is empty. An empty cache is also known as a _cold_
_cache_. A cold cache degrades performance because the DB instance has to read
from the slower disk, instead of taking advantage of values stored in the buffer cache.

With cluster cache management, you set a specific reader DB instance as the failover
target. Cluster cache management ensures that the data in the designated reader's cache is
kept synchronized with the data in the writer DB instance's cache. The designated reader's
cache with prefilled values is known as a _warm cache_. If a failover
occurs, the designated reader uses values in its warm cache immediately when it's
promoted to the new writer DB instance. This approach provides your application much better
recovery performance.

Cluster cache management requires that the designated reader instance have the same
instance class type and size ( `db.r5.2xlarge` or `db.r5.xlarge`, for
example) as the writer. Keep this in mind when you create your Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters so
that your cluster can recover during a failover. For a listing of instance class types and
sizes, see [Hardware specifications for DB instance classes for Aurora](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md#Concepts.DBInstanceClass.Summary).

###### Note

Cluster cache management isn't supported for Aurora PostgreSQL secondary DB cluster that are
part of Aurora global databases. For primary clusters where this feature is supported,
it's recommended that no workload should run on the designated tier-0 reader.

###### Note

Allow at least 1 minute after completing these steps for cluster cache management
to be fully operational.

### Enabling cluster cache management

To enable cluster cache management, take the steps described following.

###### To enable cluster cache management

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Parameter**
**groups**.

3. In the list, choose the parameter group for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB
    cluster.

The DB cluster must use a parameter group other than the default,
    because you can't change values in a default parameter group.

4. For **Parameter group actions**, choose
    **Edit**.

5. Set the value of the `apg_ccm_enabled` cluster
    parameter to **1**.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

To enable cluster cache management for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, use
the AWS CLI [`modify-db-cluster-parameter-group`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster-parameter-group.md) command with the
following required parameters:

- `--db-cluster-parameter-group-name`

- `--parameters`

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster-parameter-group \
    --db-cluster-parameter-group-name my-db-cluster-parameter-group \
    --parameters "ParameterName=apg_ccm_enabled,ParameterValue=1,ApplyMethod=immediate"
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster-parameter-group ^
    --db-cluster-parameter-group-name my-db-cluster-parameter-group ^
    --parameters "ParameterName=apg_ccm_enabled,ParameterValue=1,ApplyMethod=immediate"
```

### Setting the promotion tier priority for the writer DB instance

For cluster cache management, make sure that the promotion priority is **tier-0** for the writer DB instance of the Aurora PostgreSQL DB
cluster. The _promotion tier priority_ is a value
that specifies the order in which an Aurora reader is promoted to the writer DB
instance after a failure. Valid values are 0–15, where 0 is the first
priority and 15 is the last priority. For more information about the promotion tier,
see [Fault tolerance for an Aurora DB cluster](concepts-aurorahighavailability.md#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance).

###### To set the promotion priority for the writer DB instance to tier-0

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Databases**.

3. Choose the **Writer** DB instance of the
    Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

4. Choose **Modify**. The **Modify DB**
**Instance** page appears.

5. On the **Additional configuration** panel, choose
    **tier-0** for the **Failover**
**priority**.

6. Choose **Continue** and check the summary of
    modifications.

7. To apply the changes immediately after you save them, choose
    **Apply immediately**.

8. Choose **Modify DB Instance** to save your
    changes.

To set the promotion tier priority to 0 for the writer DB instance using
the AWS CLI, call the [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) command with the following required
parameters:

- `--db-instance-identifier`

- `--promotion-tier`

- `--apply-immediately`

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier writer-db-instance \
    --promotion-tier 0 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier writer-db-instance ^
    ---promotion-tier 0  ^
    --apply-immediately
```

### Setting the promotion tier priority for a reader DB instance

You must set only one reader DB instance for cluster cache management. To do so,
choose a reader from the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster that is the same instance class and
size as the writer DB instance. For example, if the writer uses
`db.r5.xlarge`, choose a reader that uses this same instance class
type and size. Then set its promotion tier priority to 0.

The _promotion tier priority_ is a value that
specifies the order in which an Aurora reader is promoted to the writer DB instance
after a failure. Valid values are 0–15, where 0 is the first priority and 15
is the last priority.

###### To set the promotion priority of the reader DB instance to tier-0

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Choose a **Reader** DB instance of the
    Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster that is the same instance class as the
    writer DB instance.

4. Choose **Modify**. The **Modify DB**
**Instance** page appears.

5. On the **Additional configuration** panel, choose
    **tier-0** for the **Failover**
**priority**.

6. Choose **Continue** and check the summary of
    modifications.

7. To apply the changes immediately after you save them, choose
    **Apply immediately**.

8. Choose **Modify DB Instance** to save your
    changes.

To set the promotion tier priority to 0 for the reader DB instance using
the AWS CLI, call the [modify-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.md) command with the following required
parameters:

- `--db-instance-identifier`

- `--promotion-tier`

- `--apply-immediately`

###### Example

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier reader-db-instance \
    --promotion-tier 0 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier reader-db-instance ^
    ---promotion-tier 0  ^
    --apply-immediately
```

## Monitoring the buffer cache

After setting up cluster cache management, you can monitor the state of
synchronization between the writer DB instance's buffer cache and the designated
reader's warm buffer cache. To examine the buffer cache contents on both the writer DB
instance and the designated reader DB instance, use the PostgreSQL
`pg_buffercache` module. For more information, see the [PostgreSQL\
`pg_buffercache` documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbuffercache.html).

###### Using the `aurora_ccm_status` Function

Cluster cache management also provides the `aurora_ccm_status`
function. Use the `aurora_ccm_status` function on the writer DB instance
to get the following information about the progress of cache warming on the
designated reader:

- `buffers_sent_last_minute` – How many buffers have been sent
to the designated reader in the last minute.

- `buffers_found_last_minute` – The number of frequently
accessed buffers identified during the past minute.

- `buffers_sent_last_scan` – How many buffers have been sent
to the designated reader during the last complete scan of the buffer
cache.

- `buffers_found_last_scan` – How many buffers have been
identified as frequently accessed and needed to be sent during the last complete
scan of the buffer cache. Buffers already cached on the designated reader
aren't sent.

- `buffers_sent_current_scan` – How many buffers have been
sent so far during the current scan.

- `buffers_found_current_scan` – How many buffers have been
identified as frequently accessed in the current scan.

- `current_scan_progress` – How many buffers have been visited
so far during the current scan.

The following example shows how to use the `aurora_ccm_status` function to
convert some of its output into a warm rate and warm percentage.

```nohighlight

SELECT buffers_sent_last_minute*8/60 AS warm_rate_kbps,
   100*(1.0-buffers_sent_last_scan::float/buffers_found_last_scan) AS warm_percent
   FROM aurora_ccm_status();
```

## Troubleshooting CCM configuration

When you enable `apg_ccm_enabled` cluster parameter, cluster cache
management is automatically turned on at the instance level on the writer DB instance
and one reader DB instance on the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. The writer and reader instance
should use the same instance class type and size. Their promotion tier priority is set
to `0`. Other reader instances in the DB cluster should have a non-zero promotion
tier and cluster cache management is disabled for those instances.

The following reasons may lead to issues in the configuration and disable cluster
cache management:

- When there is no single reader DB instance set to promotion tier 0.

- When the writer DB instance is not set to promotion tier 0.

- When more than one reader DB instances are set to promotion tier 0.

- When the writer and one reader DB instances with promotion tier 0 doesn't have the
same instance size.
