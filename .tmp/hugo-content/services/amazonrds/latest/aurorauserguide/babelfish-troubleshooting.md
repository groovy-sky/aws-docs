Following, you can find troubleshooting ideas and workarounds for some
Babelfish DB cluster issues.

## Connection failure

Common causes of connection failures to a new Aurora DB cluster with
Babelfish include the following:

- Security group doesn't allow access
– If you're having trouble connecting to a Babelfish,
make sure that you added your IP address to the default Amazon EC2 security
group. You can use [https://checkip.amazonaws.com/](https://checkip.amazonaws.com/) to determine your IP address and
then add it to your in-bound rule for the TDS port and the PostgreSQL port.
For more information, see [Add rules to a security group](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/working-with-security-groups.md#adding-security-group-rule.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User_
_Guide_.

- Mismatching SSL configurations – If
the `rds.force_ssl` parameter is turned on (set to 1) on
Aurora PostgreSQL, then clients must connect to Babelfish over SSL. If
your client isn't set up correctly, you see an error message such as
the following:

```nohighlight

Cannot connect to your-Babelfish-DB-cluster, 1433
  ---------------------
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
no pg_hba_conf entry for host "256.256.256.256", user "your-user-name",
"database babelfish_db", SSL off (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 33557097)
...
```

This error indicates a possible SSL configuration issue between your local
client and the Babelfish DB cluster, and that the cluster requires
clients to use SSL (its `rds.force_ssl` parameter is set to 1).
For more information about configuring SSL, see [Using SSL with a PostgreSQL DB instance](../userguide/postgresql-concepts-general-ssl.md#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.SSL.Status) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

If you are using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to connect to
Babelfish and you see this error, you can choose **Encrypt**
**connection** and **Trust server certificate**
connection options on the Connection Properties pane and try again. These
settings handle the SSL connection requirement for SSMS.

For more information about troubleshooting Aurora connection issues, see [Can't connect to Amazon RDS DB instance](chap-troubleshooting.md#CHAP_Troubleshooting.Connecting).
