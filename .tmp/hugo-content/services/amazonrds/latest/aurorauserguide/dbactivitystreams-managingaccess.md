# IAM policy examples for database activity streams

Any user with appropriate AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role privileges for database activity streams
can create, start, stop, and modify the activity stream settings for a DB cluster. These
actions are included in the audit log of the stream. For best compliance practices, we
recommend that you don't provide these privileges to DBAs.

You set access to database activity streams using IAM policies. For more information about Aurora authentication, see [Identity and access management for Amazon Aurora](usingwithrds-iam.md). For more information about creating IAM policies, see
[Creating and using an IAM policy for IAM database access](usingwithrds-iamdbauth-iampolicy.md).

###### Example Policy to allow configuring database activity streams

To give users fine-grained access to modify activity streams, use the service-specific operation context keys
`rds:StartActivityStream` and `rds:StopActivityStream`
in an IAM policy. The following IAM
policy example allows a user or role to configure activity streams.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ConfigureActivityStreams",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:StartActivityStream",
                "rds:StopActivityStream"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Example Policy to allow starting database activity streams

The following IAM policy example allows a user or role to start activity streams.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"AllowStartActivityStreams",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":"rds:StartActivityStream",
            "Resource":"*"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Example Policy to allow stopping database activity streams

The following IAM policy example allows a user or role to stop activity streams.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"AllowStopActivityStreams",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":"rds:StopActivityStream",
            "Resource":"*"
        }
     ]
}

```

###### Example Policy to deny starting database activity streams

The following IAM policy example prevents a user or role from starting activity streams.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"DenyStartActivityStreams",
            "Effect":"Deny",
            "Action":"rds:StartActivityStream",
            "Resource":"*"
        }
     ]
}

```

###### Example Policy to deny stopping database activity streams

The following IAM policy example prevents a user or role from stopping activity streams.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"DenyStopActivityStreams",
            "Effect":"Deny",
            "Action":"rds:StopActivityStream",
            "Resource":"*"
        }
    ]
}
