# synch/mutex/innodb/temp\_pool\_manager\_mutex

The `synch/mutex/innodb/temp_pool_manager_mutex` wait event occurs when a session is waiting to acquire a mutex for managing the pool of session temporary tablespaces.

## Supported engine versions

This wait event information is supported for the following engine versions:

- Aurora MySQL version 3

## Context

Aurora MySQL version 3.x and higher uses `temp_pool_manager_mutex` to control multiple sessions
accessing the temporary tablespace pool at the same time. Aurora MySQL manages storage through an Aurora cluster volume for
persistent data and local storage for temporary files. A temporary tablespace is needed when a session
creates a temporary table on the Aurora cluster volume.

When a session first requests a temporary tablespace, MySQL allocates session temporary tablespaces from the shared pool.
A session can hold up to 2 temporary tablespaces at a time for the following table types:

- User-created temporary tables

- Optimizer-generated internal temporary tables

The default `TempTable` engine uses the following overflow mechanism to handle temporary tables:

- Stores tables in RAM up to the [`temptable_max_ram`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html) limit.

- Moves to memory-mapped files on local storage when RAM is full.

- Uses the shared cluster volume when memory-mapped files reach their [`temptable_max_mmap`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html) limit.

After temporary tables exceed both RAM and local storage limits, MySQL manages them using on-disk tablespace.

When a session requires an on-disk temporary table, MySQL:

- Looks for available `INACTIVE` tablespaces in the pool to reuse.

- Creates 10 new tablespaces if no `INACTIVE` spaces exist.

When a session disconnects, MySQL:

- Truncates the session's temporary tablespaces.

- Marks them as INACTIVE in the pool for reuse.

- Maintains the current pool size until server restart.

- Returns to the default pool size (10 tablespaces) after restart.

## Likely causes of increased waits

Common situations that cause this wait event:

- Concurrent sessions creating internal temporary tables on the cluster volume.

- Concurrent sessions creating user temporary tables on the cluster volume.

- Sudden termination of sessions using active tablespaces.

- Tablespace pool expansion during heavy write workloads.

- Concurrent queries accessing `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.`

## Actions

We recommend different actions depending on the causes of your wait event.

- [Review queries using INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](#ams-waits.io-temppoolmanager.actions.schema-queries)

- [Increase innodb\_sync\_array\_size parameter](#ams-waits.io-temppoolmanager.actions.sync_array)

- [Implement connection pooling](#ams-waits.io-temppoolmanager.actions.connection_pooling)

### Monitor and optimize temporary table usage

To monitor and optimize temporary table usage, use one of these methods:

- Check the `Created_tmp_disk_tables` counter in Performance Insights
to track on-disk temporary table creation across your Aurora cluster.

- Run this command in your database to directly monitor temporary table creation:
`mysql> show status like '%created_tmp_disk%'`.

###### Note

Temporary table behavior differs between Aurora MySQL reader nodes and writer nodes.
For more information, see [New temporary table behavior in Aurora MySQL version 3](ams3-temptable-behavior.md).

After identifying queries creating temporary tables, take these optimization steps:

- Use `EXPLAIN` to examine query execution plans and identify where
and why temporary tables are being created.

- Modify queries to reduce temporary table usage where possible.

If query optimization alone doesn't resolve performance issues, consider adjusting
these configuration parameters:

- [`temptable_max_ram`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html)\- Controls maximum RAM usage for temporary tables.

- [`temptable_max_mmap`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html) \- Sets the limit for memory-mapped file storage.

- [`tmp_table_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/server-system-variables.html)\- Applies when `aurora_tmptable_enable_per_table_limit`
is enabled (disabled by default).

###### Important

Note that certain query conditions will always require on-disk temporary tables,
regardless of configuration settings. For more information `TempTable` storage engine, see
[Use the TempTable storage engine on Amazon RDS for MySQL and Amazon Aurora MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/use-the-temptable-storage-engine-on-amazon-rds-for-mysql-and-amazon-aurora-mysql).

### Review queries using INFORMATION\_SCHEMA

When you query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables, MySQL creates InnoDB temporary tables on the cluster volume. Each session needs a temporary tablespace for these tables, which can lead to performance issues during high concurrent access.

To improve performance:

- Use `PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA` instead of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` where possible.

- If you must use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, reduce how often you run these queries.

### Increase innodb\_sync\_array\_size parameter

The `innodb_sync_array_size` parameter controls the size of the mutex/lock
wait array in MySQL. The default value of `1` works for general workloads, but
increasing it can reduce thread contention during high concurrency.

When your workload shows increasing numbers of waiting threads:

- Monitor the number of waiting threads in your workload.

- Set `innodb_sync_array_size` equal to or higher than your
instance's vCPU count to split the thread coordination structure and reduce contention.

###### Note

To determine the number of vCPUs available on your RDS instance, see the vCPU specifications in [Amazon RDS instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types).

### Implement connection pooling

MySQL assigns a dedicated tablespace to each session that creates a temporary table. This tablespace remains active until the database connection ends. To manage your resources more efficiently:

- Implement connection pooling to limit the number of active temporary tablespaces.

- Reuse existing connections instead of creating new ones for each operation.
