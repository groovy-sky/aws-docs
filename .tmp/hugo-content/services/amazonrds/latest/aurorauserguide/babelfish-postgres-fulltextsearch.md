# Using Full Text Search in Babelfish

Starting with version 4.0.0, Babelfish provides limited support for Full Text Search (FTS). FTS is a powerful feature in relational databases that enables efficient searching and indexing of text-heavy data.
It allows you to perform complex text searches and retrieve relevant results quickly. FTS is particularly valuable for applications that deal
with large volumes of textual data, such as content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and document archives.

## Understanding Babelfish Full Text Search supported features

Babelfish supports the following Full Text Search features:

- CONTAINS Clause:

- Basic support for the CONTAINS clause.

```nohighlight

CONTAINS (
       {
          column_name
       }
       , '<contains_search_condition>'
)
```

###### Note

Currently, only English language is supported.

- Comprehensive handling and translation of `simple_term` search strings.

- `FULLTEXT INDEX` Clause:

- Supports only `CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ON table_name(column_name [...n]) KEY INDEX index_name` statement.

- Supports full `DROP FULLTEXT INDEX` statement.

###### Note

In order to re-index the Full Text Index, you need to drop the Full Text Index and create a new one on the same column.

- Special characters in search condition:

- Babelfish ensures that single occurrences of special characters in search strings are handled effectively.

###### Note

While Babelfish now identifies special characters in search string, it's essential to recognize that the results obtained may vary compared to those obtained with T-SQL.

- Table alias in column\_name:

- With table alias support, users can create more concise and readable SQL queries for Full-Text Search.
