# aurora\_stat\_plans

Returns a row for every tracked execution plan.

## Syntax

```nohighlight

aurora_stat_plans(
    showtext
)
```

## Arguments

- showtext – Show the query and plan text. Valid values are NULL,
true or false. True will show the query and plan text.

## Return type

Returns a row for each tracked plan that contains all the columns from
`aurora_stat_statements` and the following additional columns.

- planid – plan identifier

- explain\_plan – explain plan text

- plan\_type:

- `no plan` \- no plan was captured

- `estimate` \- plan captured with estimated costs

- `actual` \- plan captured with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

- plan\_captured\_time – last time a plan was captured

## Usage notes

`aurora_compute_plan_id` must be enabled and
`pg_stat_statements` must be in `shared_preload_libraries`
for the plans to be tracked.

The number of plans available is controlled by the value set in the
`pg_stat_statements.max` parameter. When
`aurora_compute_plan_id` is enabled, you can track the plans up to
this specified value in `aurora_stat_plans`.

This function is available from Aurora PostgreSQL versions 14.10, 15.5, and for all
other later versions.

## Examples

In the example below, the two plans that are for the query identifier
 -5471422286312252535 are captured and the statements statistics are tracked by the
planid.

```nohighlight

db1=# select calls, total_exec_time, planid, plan_captured_time, explain_plan
db1-# from aurora_stat_plans(true)
db1-# where queryid = '-5471422286312252535'
