## Step 1: Create a directory using AWS Managed Microsoft AD

Directory Service creates a fully managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. When you create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, Directory Service creates two
domain controllers and Domain Name System (DNS) servers on your behalf. The directory servers are created in different
subnets in a VPC. This redundancy helps make sure that your directory remains accessible even if a failure occurs.

When you create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, Directory Service performs the following tasks on your behalf:

- Sets up an Active Directory within the VPC.

- Creates a directory administrator account with the username `Admin` and the specified password. You use this
account to manage your directory.

###### Note

Be sure to save this password. Directory Service doesn't store it. You can reset it, but you can't retrieve it.

- Creates a security group for the directory controllers.

When you launch an AWS Managed Microsoft AD, AWS creates an Organizational Unit (OU) that contains
all of your directory's objects. This OU has the NetBIOS name that you entered
when you created your directory. It is located in the domain root, which is owned
and managed by AWS.

The `Admin` account that was created with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory has permissions for the most common
administrative activities for your OU, including:

- Create, update, or delete users

- Add resources to your domain, such as file or print servers, and then assign
permissions for those resources to users in your OU

- Create additional OUs and containers

- Delegate authority

- Restore deleted objects from the Active Directory Recycle Bin

- Run AD and DNS Windows PowerShell modules on the Active Directory Web Service

The `Admin` account also has rights to perform the following domain-wide activities:

- Manage DNS configurations (add, remove, or update records, zones, and forwarders)

- View DNS event logs

- View security event logs

###### To create a directory with AWS Managed Microsoft AD

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Directory Service console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Directories** and choose **Set up Directory**.

3. Choose **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**. AWS Managed Microsoft AD is the only option that you can currently use with Amazon RDS.

4. Enter the following information:

**Directory DNS name**

The fully qualified name for the directory, such as `corp.example.com`.

**Directory NetBIOS name**

The short name for the directory, such as `CORP`.

**Directory description**

(Optional) A description for the directory.

**Admin password**

The password for the directory administrator. The directory creation process creates an administrator account with the
username Admin and this password.

The directory administrator password and can't include the word "admin." The password is case-sensitive and must
be 8–64 characters in length. It must also contain at least one character from three of the
following four categories:

- Lowercase letters (a–z)

- Uppercase letters (A–Z)

- Numbers (0–9)

- Non-alphanumeric characters (~!@#$%^&\*\_-+=\`\|\\(){}\[\]:;"'<>,.?/)

**Confirm password**

The administrator password re-entered.

5. Choose **Next**.

6. Enter the following information in the **Networking** section and then choose
    **Next**:

**VPC**

The VPC for the directory. Create the Aurora MySQL DB cluster in this same VPC.

**Subnets**

Subnets for the directory servers. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones.

7. Review the directory information and make any necessary changes. When the information is correct, choose **Create**
**directory**.

![Directory details page during creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/WinAuth2.png)

It takes several minutes to create the directory. When it has been successfully created,
the **Status** value changes to **Active**.

To see information about your directory, choose the directory name in the directory listing. Note the **Directory**
**ID** value because you need this value when you create or modify your Aurora MySQL DB cluster.

![Directory ID in the Directory details page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/WinAuth3.png)

## Step 2: (Optional) Create a trust for an on-premises Active Directory

If you don't plan to use your own on-premises Microsoft Active Directory, skip to [Step 3: Create an IAM role for use by Amazon Aurora](#aurora-mysql-kerberos-setting-up.CreateIAMRole).

To use Kerberos authentication with your on-premises Active Directory, you need to create a trusting domain relationship
using a forest trust between your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory and the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory (created in [Step 1: Create a directory using AWS Managed Microsoft AD](#aurora-mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-directory)). The trust can be one-way, where the AWS Managed Microsoft AD
directory trusts the on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. The trust can also be two-way, where both Active Directories
trust each other. For more information about setting up trusts using Directory Service, see [When to create a trust relationship](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms-ad-setup-trust.md) in the
_AWS Directory Service Administration Guide_.

###### Note

If you use an on-premises Microsoft Active Directory:

- Windows clients can't connect using Aurora custom endpoints. To learn more, see [Amazon Aurora endpoint connections](aurora-overview-endpoints.md).

- For [global databases](aurora-global-database.md):

- Windows clients can connect using instance endpoints or cluster endpoints in the primary AWS Region
of the global database only.

- Windows clients can't connect using cluster endpoints in secondary AWS Regions.

Make sure that your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory domain name includes a DNS suffix routing that corresponds to
the newly created trust relationship. The following screenshot shows an example.

![DNS routing corresponds to the created trust](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/kerberos-auth-trust.png)

## Step 3: Create an IAM role for use by Amazon Aurora

For Amazon Aurora to call Directory Service for you, you need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that uses the
managed IAM policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`. This role allows
Aurora to make calls to the Directory Service.

When you create a DB cluster using the AWS Management Console, and you have the `iam:CreateRole` permission, the console
creates this role automatically. In this case, the role name is `rds-directoryservice-kerberos-access-role`.
Otherwise, you must create the IAM role manually. When you create this IAM role, choose `Directory Service`,
and attach the AWS managed policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess` to it.

For more information about creating IAM roles for a service, see
[Creating a role to delegate\
permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Optionally, you can create policies with the required permissions instead of using the managed IAM policy
`AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`. In this case, the IAM role must have the following IAM trust
policy.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "directoryservice.rds.amazonaws.com",
          "rds.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

```

The role must also have the following IAM role policy.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ds:DescribeDirectories",
        "ds:AuthorizeApplication",
        "ds:UnauthorizeApplication",
        "ds:GetAuthorizedApplicationDetails"
      ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Step 4: Create and configure users

You can create users with the Active Directory Users and Computers tool. This tool is part of the Active Directory Domain
Services and Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services tools. Users represent individual people or entities that have
access to your directory.

To create users in an Directory Service directory, you use an on-premises or Amazon EC2 instance based on Microsoft Windows that is joined to
your Directory Service directory. You must be logged in to the instance as a user that has privileges to create users. For more
information, see [Manage users and groups in AWS Managed Microsoft AD](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/creating-ad-users-and-groups.md)
in the _AWS Directory Service Administration Guide_.

## Step 5: Create or modify an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

Create or modify an Aurora MySQL DB cluster for use with your directory. You can use the console, AWS CLI, or RDS API to associate
a DB cluster with a directory. You can do this task in one of the following ways:

- Create a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster using the console, the [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md) CLI command, or the [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md)
RDS API operation.

For instructions, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

- Modify an existing Aurora MySQL DB cluster using the console, the
[modify-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.md) CLI command, or the
[ModifyDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-modifydbcluster.md) RDS API operation.

For instructions, see [Modifying an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-modifying.md).

- Restore an Aurora MySQL DB cluster from a DB snapshot using the console, the
[restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot.md) CLI
command, or the [RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbclusterfromsnapshot.md) RDS API
operation.

For instructions, see [Restoring from a DB cluster snapshot](aurora-restore-snapshot.md).

- Restore an Aurora MySQL DB cluster to a point-in-time using the console, the
[restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time.md) CLI
command, or the [RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-restoredbclustertopointintime.md) RDS
API operation.

For instructions, see [Restoring a DB cluster to a specified time](aurora-pitr.md).

Kerberos authentication is only supported for Aurora MySQL DB clusters in a VPC. The DB cluster can be in the same VPC as the
directory, or in a different VPC. The DB cluster's VPC must have a VPC security group that allows outbound communication to
your directory.

When you use the console to create, modify, or restore a DB cluster, choose **Kerberos**
**authentication** in the **Database authentication** section. Choose **Browse**
**Directory** and then select the directory, or choose **Create a new**
**directory**.

![Kerberos authentication setting when creating a DB cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/kerberos-auth-create-cluster.png)

When you use the AWS CLI or RDS API, associate a DB cluster with a
directory. The following parameters are required for the DB cluster to use
the domain directory you created:

- For the `--domain` parameter, use the domain identifier ("d-\*" identifier) generated when you
created the directory.

- For the `--domain-iam-role-name` parameter, use the role you created that uses the managed IAM
policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`.

For example, the following CLI command modifies a DB cluster to use a directory.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
    --domain d-ID \
    --domain-iam-role-name role-name

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster ^
    --domain d-ID ^
    --domain-iam-role-name role-name

```

###### Important

If you modify a DB cluster to turn on Kerberos authentication, reboot the reader DB instances after making the change.

## Step 6: Create Aurora MySQL users that use Kerberos authentication

The DB cluster is joined to the AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain. Thus, you can create Aurora MySQL users from the Active Directory users in
your domain. Database permissions are managed through standard Aurora MySQL permissions that are granted to and revoked from
these users.

You can allow an Active Directory user to authenticate with Aurora MySQL. To do this,
first use the Amazon RDS primary user credentials to connect to the Aurora MySQL DB cluster
as with any other DB cluster. After you're logged in, create an externally
authenticated user with Kerberos authentication in Aurora MySQL as shown here:

```nohighlight

CREATE USER user_name@'host_name' IDENTIFIED WITH 'authentication_kerberos' BY 'realm_name';
```

- Replace `user_name` with the username. Users (both humans and applications)
from your domain can now connect to the DB cluster from a domain-joined client machine using Kerberos
authentication.

- Replace `host_name` with the
hostname. You can use `%` as a wild card. You can also use
specific IP addresses for the hostname.

- Replace `realm_name` with the directory realm name of the domain. The realm name is
usually the same as the DNS domain name in uppercase letters, such as `CORP.EXAMPLE.COM`. A realm is a
group of systems that use the same Kerberos Key Distribution Center.

The following example creates a database user with the name `Admin` that authenticates against the Active
Directory with the realm name `MYSQL.LOCAL`.

```nohighlight

CREATE USER Admin@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'authentication_kerberos' BY 'MYSQL.LOCAL';
```

### Modifying an existing Aurora MySQL login

You can also modify an existing Aurora MySQL login to use Kerberos authentication by using the following syntax:

```nohighlight

ALTER USER user_name IDENTIFIED WITH 'authentication_kerberos' BY 'realm_name';
```

## Step 7: Configure a MySQL client

To configure a MySQL client, take the following steps:

1. Create a `krb5.conf` file (or equivalent) to point to the domain.

2. Verify that traffic can flow between the client host and Directory Service. Use a network utility such as Netcat, for the
    following:

- Verify traffic over DNS for port 53.

- Verify traffic over TCP/UDP for port 53 and for Kerberos, which includes ports 88 and 464 for
Directory Service.

3. Verify that traffic can flow between the client host and the DB instance over the database port. For example, use
    `mysql` to connect and access the database.

The following is sample `krb5.conf` content for AWS Managed Microsoft AD.

```nohighlight

[libdefaults]
 default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
[realms]
 EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = example.com
  admin_server = example.com
 }
[domain_realm]
 .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
```

The following is sample `krb5.conf` content for an on-premises Microsoft Active Directory.

```nohighlight

[libdefaults]
 default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
[realms]
 EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = example.com
  admin_server = example.com
 }
 ONPREM.COM = {
  kdc = onprem.com
  admin_server = onprem.com
 }
[domain_realm]
 .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 example.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 .onprem.com = ONPREM.COM
 onprem.com = ONPREM.COM
 .rds.amazonaws.com = EXAMPLE.COM
 .amazonaws.com.cn = EXAMPLE.COM
 .amazon.com = EXAMPLE.COM
```

## Step 8: (Optional) Configure case-insensitive username comparison

By default, the character case of the MySQL database username must match that of the Active Directory login. However, you
can now use case-insensitive username comparison with the `authentication_kerberos` plugin. To do so, you set the
`authentication_kerberos_caseins_cmp` DB cluster parameter to `true`.

###### To use case-insensitive username comparison

1. Create a custom DB cluster parameter group. Follow the procedures in [Creating a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-creatingcluster.md).

2. Edit the new parameter group to set the value of `authentication_kerberos_caseins_cmp` to
    `true`. Follow the procedures in [Modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifyingcluster.md).

3. Associate the DB cluster parameter group with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster. Follow the procedures in [Associating a DB cluster parameter group with a DB cluster in Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-associatingcluster.md).

4. Reboot the DB cluster.
