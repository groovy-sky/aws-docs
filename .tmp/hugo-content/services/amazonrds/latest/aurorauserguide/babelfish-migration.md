# Migrating a SQL Server database to Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL

You can use Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL to migrate an SQL Server database to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL
DB cluster. Before migrating, review [Using Babelfish with a single database or multiple databases](babelfish-architecture.md#babelfish-single_vs_multi_db).

## Overview of the migration process

The following summary lists the steps required to successfully migrate your SQL
Server application and make it work with Babelfish. For information about the
tools you can use for the export and import processes and for more detail, see [Import/export tools for migrating from SQL Server to Babelfish](#babelfish-migration.import-export-tools). To load the data, we
recommend using AWS DMS with an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster as the target endpoint.

1. Create a new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster with Babelfish turned on. To
    learn how, see [Creating a Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](babelfish-create.md).

To import the various SQL artifacts exported from your SQL Server
    database, connect to the Babelfish cluster using a SQL Server tool
    such as [sqlcmd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility?view=sql-server-ver15). For more information, see [Using a SQL Server client to connect to your DB cluster](babelfish-connect-sqlserver.md).

2. On the SQL Server database that you want to migrate, export the data
    definition language (DDL). The DDL is SQL code that describes database
    objects that contain user data (such as tables, indexes, and views) and
    user-written database code (such as stored procedures, user-defined
    functions, and triggers).

For more information, see [Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to migrate to Babelfish](#babelfish-migration.import-export-tools.ssms).

3. Run an assessment tool to evaluate the scope of any changes that you might
    need to make so that Babelfish can effectively support the
    application running on SQL Server. For more information, see [Evaluating and handling differences between SQL Server and Babelfish](#babelfish-migration.assessing-the-source).

4. Review the AWS DMS target endpoint limitations and update the DDL script as
    necessary. For more information, see Limitations to using a PostgreSQL
    target endpoint with Babelfish tables in [Using Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL as a target](../../../dms/latest/userguide/chap-target-postgresql.md#CHAP_Target.PostgreSQL.Babelfish).

5. On your new Babelfish DB cluster, run the DDL within your specified
    T-SQL database to create only the schemas, user-defined data types, and
    tables with their primary key constraints.

6. Use AWS DMS to migrate your data from SQL Server to Babelfish tables.
    For continuous replication using SQL Server Change Data Capture or SQL
    Replication, use Aurora PostgreSQL instead of Babelfish as the endpoint.
    To do so, see the [Using Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL as a target for\
    AWS Database Migration Service](../../../dms/latest/userguide/chap-target-postgresql.md#CHAP_Target.PostgreSQL.Babelfish).

7. When the data load completes, create all the remaining T-SQL objects that
    support the application on your Babelfish cluster.

8. Reconfigure your client application to connect to the Babelfish
    endpoint instead of your SQL Server database. For more information, see
    [Connecting to a Babelfish DB cluster](babelfish-connect.md).

9. Modify your application as needed and retest. For more information, see
    [Differences between Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL and SQL Server](babelfish-compatibility.md).

You still need to assess your client-side SQL queries. The schemas generated from
your SQL Server instance convert only the server-side SQL code. We recommend that
you take the following steps:

- Capture client-side queries by using the SQL Server Profiler with the
TSQL\_Replay predefined template. This template captures T-SQL statement
information that you can then replay for iterative tuning and testing. You
can start the profiler within SQL Server Management Studio from the
**Tools** menu. Choose **SQL Server**
**Profiler** to open the profiler and choose the TSQL\_Replay
template.

To use for your Babelfish migration, start a trace and then run
your application using your functional tests. The profiler captures the
T-SQL statements. When you finish testing, stop the trace. Save the result
to an XML file with your client-side queries (File > Save as > Trace
XML File for Replay).

For more information, see [SQL Server Profiler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sql-server-profiler/sql-server-profiler?view=sql-server-ver16) in the Microsoft documentation. For more
information about the TSQL\_Replay template, see [SQL Server Profiler Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sql-server-profiler/sql-server-profiler-templates?view=sql-server-ver16).

- For applications with complex client-side SQL queries, we recommend that
you use Babelfish Compass to analyze these queries for
Babelfish compatibility. If the analysis indicates that the
client-side SQL statements contain unsupported SQL features, review the SQL
aspects in the client application and modify as needed.

- You can also capture the SQL queries as extended events (.xel format). To
do so, use the SSMS XEvent Profiler. After generating the .xel file, extract
the SQL statements into .xml files that Compass can then process. For more
information, see [Use the SSMS XEvent Profler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/extended-events/use-the-ssms-xe-profiler?view=sql-server-ver16) in the Microsoft
documentation.

When you're satisfied with all testing, analysis, and any modifications
needed for your migrated application, you can start using your Babelfish
database for production. To do so, stop the original database and redirect live
client applications to use the Babelfish TDS port.

###### Note

AWS DMS now supports replicating data from Babelfish. For more
information, see [AWS DMS now supports Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL as a source](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/06/aws-dms-babelfish-aurora-postgresql-source).

## Evaluating and handling differences between SQL Server and Babelfish

For best results, we recommend that you evaluate the generated DDL/DML and the
client query code before actually migrating your SQL Server database application to
Babelfish. Depending on the version of Babelfish and the specific
features of SQL Server that your application implements, you might need to refactor
your application or use alternatives for functionality that aren't fully
supported yet in Babelfish.

- To assess your SQL Server application code, use Babelfish Compass
on the generated DDL to determine how much T-SQL code is supported by
Babelfish. Identify T-SQL code that might need modifications before
running on Babelfish. For more information about this tool, see
[Babelfish Compass tool](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_compass/releases/latest) on GitHub.

###### Note

Babelfish Compass is an open-source tool. Report any issues
with Babelfish Compass through GitHub instead of through AWS
Support.

You can use Generate Script Wizard with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to
generate the SQL file that is assessed by Babelfish Compass or AWS Schema Conversion Tool
CLI. We recommend the following steps to streamline the assessment.

1. On the **Choose Objects** page, choose **Script**
**entire database and all database objects**.

![Using SSMS Generate script wizard to choose objects.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Babelfish-wizard-choose-objects.png)

2. For the **Set Scripting Options**, choose **Save**
**as script file** as a **Single script file**.

![Using SSMS Generate script wizard to set the scripting options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Babelfish-wizard-set-scripting-options.png)

3. Choose **Advanced** to change the default scripting
    options to identify features that normally are set to false for a full
    assessment:

- Script Change Tracking to True

- Script Full-Text Indexes to True

- Script Triggers to True

- Script Logins to True

- Script Owner to True

- Script Object-Level Permissions to True

- Script Collations to True

![Using SSMS Generate script wizard to set the advance scripting options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Babelfish-advanced-scripting-options.png)

4. Perform the remaining steps in the wizard to generate the file.

## Import/export tools for migrating from SQL Server to Babelfish

We recommend that you use AWS DMS as the primary tool for migrating from SQL Server to
Babelfish. However, Babelfish supports several other ways to migrate
data using SQL Server tools that includes the following.

- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for all versions of
Babelfish. For more information, see [Migrate from SQL Server to Aurora PostgreSQL using SSIS and\
Babelfish](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/migrate-from-sql-server-to-aurora-postgresql-using-ssis-and-babelfish).

- Use the SSMS Import/Export Wizard for Babelfish versions 2.1.0 and
later. This tool is available through the SSMS, but it's also available
as a standalone tool. For more information, see [Welcome to SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/import-export-data/welcome-to-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard?view=sql-server-ver16) in the
Microsoft documentation.

- The Microsoft bulk data copy program (bcp) utility lets you copy data from
a Microsoft SQL Server instance to a data file in the format you specify.
For more information, see [bcp Utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/bcp-utility?view=sql-server-ver16) in the Microsoft documentation. Babelfish
now supports the data migration using the BCP client and the bcp utility now
supports `-E` flag (for identity columns) and -b flag (for
batching inserts). Certain bcp options aren't supported, including
`-C`, `-T`, `-G`, `-K`,
`-R`, `-V`, and `-h`.

### Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to migrate to Babelfish

We recommend generating separate files for each of the specific object types.
You can use the Generate Scripts wizard in SSMS for each set of DDL statements
first, and then modify the objects as a group to fix any issues found during the
assessment.

Perform these steps to migrate the data using AWS DMS or other data migration
methods. Run these create script types first for a better and faster approach to
load the data on the Babelfish tables in Aurora PostgreSQL.

1. Run `CREATE SCHEMA` statements.

2. Run `CREATE TYPE` statements to create user-defined data
    types.

3. Run basic `CREATE TABLE` statements with the primary keys
    or unique constraints.

Perform the data load using the recommended import/export tool. Run the
modified scripts for the following steps to add the remaining database objects.
You need the create table statements to run these scripts for the constraints,
triggers, and indexes. After the scripts generate, delete the create table
statements.

1. Run `ALTER TABLE` statements for the check constraints,
    foreign key constraints, default constraints.

2. Run `CREATE TRIGGER` statements.

3. Run `CREATE INDEX` statements.

4. Run `CREATE VIEW` statements.

5. Run `CREATE STORED PROCEDURE` statements.

###### To generate scripts for each object type

Use the following steps to create the basic create table statements using
the Generate Scripts wizard in SSMS. Follow the same steps to generate
scripts for the different object types.

1. Connect to your existing SQL Server instance.

2. Open the context (right-click) menu for a database name.

3. Choose **Tasks**, and then choose **Generate**
**Scripts...**.

4. On the **Choose Objects** pane, choose
    **Select specific database objects**. Choose
    **Tables**, select all tables. Choose
    **Next** to continue.

![Using SSMS Generate Scripts wizard to choose objects and tables.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Babelfish-choose-objects-tables.png)

5. On the **Set Scripting Options** page, choose
    **Advanced** to open the
    **Options** settings. To generate the basic create
    table statements, change the following default values:

- Script Defaults to False.

- Script Extended Properties to False. Babelfish does not
support extended properties.

- Script Check Constraints to False. Script Foreign Keys to
False.

![Using SSMS Generate script wizard to set the advance options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Babelfish-advance-scripting-def-values.png)

6. Choose **OK**.

7. On the **Set Scripting Options** page, choose
    **Save as script file** and then choose the
    **Single script file** option. Enter your
    **File name**.

![Using SSMS Generate script wizard to set the default values of the script.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/Babelfish-set-scripting-def-values.png)

8. Choose **Next** to view the **Summary**
**wizard** page.

9. Choose **Next** to start the script
    generation.

You can continue to generate scripts for the other object types in the
    wizard. Instead of choosing **Finish** after the file
    is saved, choose the **Previous** button three times to
    go back to the **Choose Objects** page. Then repeat the
    steps in the wizard to generate scripts for the other object
    types.
