# Security with Amazon Aurora MySQL

Security for Amazon Aurora MySQL is managed at three levels:

- To control who can perform Amazon RDS management actions on Aurora MySQL DB clusters and DB
instances, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). When you connect to AWS using IAM credentials,
your AWS account must have IAM policies that grant the permissions required to
perform Amazon RDS management operations. For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon Aurora](usingwithrds-iam.md)

If you are using IAM to access the Amazon RDS console, make sure to first
sign in to the AWS Management Console with your IAM user credentials. Then go to the Amazon RDS
console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

- Make sure to create Aurora MySQL DB clusters in a virtual public cloud (VPC) based
on the Amazon VPC service. To control which devices and Amazon EC2 instances can open
connections to the endpoint and port of the DB instance for Aurora MySQL DB clusters
in a VPC, use a VPC security group. You can make these endpoint and port connections
by using Transport Layer Security (TLS). In addition, firewall rules at your company
can control whether devices running at your company can open connections to a DB
instance. For more information on VPCs, see [Amazon VPC and Amazon Aurora](user-vpc.md).

The supported VPC tenancy depends on the DB instance class used by your Aurora MySQL DB clusters.
With `default` VPC tenancy, the VPC runs on shared hardware. With `dedicated` VPC tenancy,
the VPC runs on a dedicated hardware instance. The burstable performance DB instance classes support default VPC tenancy only.
The burstable performance DB instance classes include the db.t2, db.t3, and db.t4g DB instance classes. All other Aurora MySQL DB
instance classes support both default and dedicated VPC tenancy.

###### Note

We recommend using the T DB instance classes only for development and test servers, or other non-production servers.
For more details on the T instance classes, see [Using T instance classes for development and testing](auroramysql-bestpractices-performance.md#AuroraMySQL.BestPractices.T2Medium).

For more information about instance classes, see [Amazon AuroraDB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md). For more information about `default` and `dedicated` VPC tenancy,
see [Dedicated instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-instance.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_.

- To authenticate login and permissions for an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you can
take either of the following approaches, or a combination of them:

- You can take the same approach as with a standalone instance of
MySQL.

Commands such as `CREATE USER`, `RENAME USER`,
`GRANT`, `REVOKE`, and `SET PASSWORD`
work just as they do in on-premises databases, as does directly modifying
database schema tables. For more information, see
[Access control and account management](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/access-control.html) in the MySQL documentation.

- You can also use IAM database authentication.

With IAM database authentication, you authenticate to your DB cluster by
using an IAM user or IAM role and an authentication token. An
_authentication token_ is a unique value that is
generated using the Signature Version 4 signing process. By using IAM
database authentication, you can use the same credentials to control access
to your AWS resources and your databases. For more information, see [IAM database authentication](usingwithrds-iamdbauth.md).

###### Note

For more information, see [Security in Amazon Aurora](usingwithrds.md).

In the following sections, see information about user permissions for Aurora MySQL and TLS connections with Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

###### Topics

- [Master user privileges with Amazon Aurora MySQL](#AuroraMySQL.Security.MasterUser)

- [TLS connections to Aurora MySQL DB clusters](#AuroraMySQL.Security.SSL)

## Master user privileges with Amazon Aurora MySQL

When you create an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB instance, the master user has the default privileges listed in [Master user account privileges](usingwithrds-masteraccounts.md).

To provide management services for each DB cluster, the `admin` and `rdsadmin` users are
created when the DB cluster is created. Attempting to drop, rename, change the password, or
change privileges for the `rdsadmin` account results in an error.

In Aurora MySQL version 2 DB clusters, the `admin` and `rdsadmin` users are
created when the DB cluster is created. In Aurora MySQL version 3 DB clusters, the `admin`, `rdsadmin`, and `rds_superuser_role` users are
created.

###### Important

We strongly recommend that you do not use the master user directly in your applications. Instead, adhere to the best
practice of using a database user created with the minimal privileges required for your application.

For management of the Aurora MySQL DB cluster, the standard `kill` and
`kill_query` commands have been restricted. Instead, use the Amazon RDS commands
`rds_kill` and `rds_kill_query` to terminate user sessions or
queries on Aurora MySQL DB instances.

###### Note

Encryption of a database instance and snapshots is not supported for the
China (Ningxia) region.

## TLS connections to Aurora MySQL DB clusters

Amazon Aurora MySQL DB clusters support Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections from
applications using the same process and public key as RDS for MySQL DB instances.

Amazon RDS creates an TLS certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance when
Amazon RDS provisions the instance. These certificates are signed by a certificate authority.
The TLS certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as the Common Name (CN) for the
TLS certificate to guard against spoofing attacks. As a result, you can only use the DB
cluster endpoint to connect to a DB cluster using TLS if your client supports Subject
Alternative Names (SAN). Otherwise, you must use the instance endpoint of a writer
instance.

For information about downloading certificates, see [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md).

We recommend the AWS JDBC Driver as a client that supports SAN with TLS. For more information about the AWS JDBC Driver and complete instructions for using it, see the
[Amazon Web Services (AWS) JDBC Driver GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper).

- [Encrypting connections to an Aurora MySQL DB cluster](#AuroraMySQL.Security.SSL.EncryptingConnections)

### Requiring a TLS connection to an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

You can require that all user connections to your Aurora MySQL DB cluster use TLS by
using the `require_secure_transport` DB cluster parameter. By default,
the `require_secure_transport` parameter is set to `OFF`. You
can set the `require_secure_transport` parameter to `ON` to
require TLS for connections to your DB cluster.

You can set the `require_secure_transport` parameter value by updating the
DB cluster parameter group for your DB cluster. You don't need to reboot your DB cluster
for the change to take effect. For more information on parameter
groups, see [Parameter groups for Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

###### Note

The `require_secure_transport` parameter is available for Aurora MySQL version 2 and 3.
You can set this parameter in a custom DB cluster parameter group. The parameter isn't available
in DB instance parameter groups.

When the `require_secure_transport` parameter is set to `ON` for a DB cluster, a
database client can connect to it if it can establish an encrypted connection. Otherwise, an error message similar to the following
is returned to the client:

```bash

MySQL Error 3159 (HY000): Connections using insecure transport are prohibited while --require_secure_transport=ON.
```

### TLS versions for Aurora MySQL

Aurora MySQL supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and
1.3. Starting in Aurora MySQL version 3.04.0 and higher, you can use the TLS 1.3
protocol to secure your connections. The following table shows the TLS support for
Aurora MySQL versions.

Aurora MySQL versionTLS 1.0TLS 1.1TLS 1.2TLS 1.3Default

Aurora MySQL version 2

DeprecatedDeprecated

Supported

Not supportedAll supported TLS versions

Aurora MySQL version 3 (lower than 3.04.0)

DeprecatedDeprecatedSupportedNot supportedAll supported TLS versions

Aurora MySQL version 3 (3.04.0 and higher)

Not supported Not supported SupportedSupportedAll supported TLS versions

###### Important

If you're using custom parameter groups for your Aurora MySQL clusters with version 2 and versions lower than 3.04.0, we recommend using TLS
1.2 because TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are less secure. The community edition of MySQL 8.0.26 and Aurora MySQL 3.03 and its minor versions deprecated
support for TLS versions 1.1 and 1.0.

The community edition of MySQL 8.0.28 and compatible Aurora MySQL versions 3.04.0 and higher do not support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0. If you're
using Aurora MySQL version 3.04.0 or higher, do not set the TLS protocol to 1.0 and 1.1 in your custom parameter group.

For Aurora MySQL versions 3.04.0 and higher, the default setting is TLS 1.3 and
TLS 1.2.

You can use the `tls_version` DB cluster parameter to indicate the
permitted protocol versions. Similar client parameters exist for most client tools
or database drivers. Some older clients might not support newer TLS versions. By
default, the DB cluster attempts to use the highest TLS protocol version allowed by
both the server and client configuration.

Set the `tls_version` DB cluster parameter to one of the following values:

- `TLSv1.3`

- `TLSv1.2`

- `TLSv1.1`

- `TLSv1`

You can also set the `tls_version` parameter as a string of
comma-separated list. If you want to use both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 protocols, the
`tls_version` parameter must include all protocols from the lowest to
the highest protocol. In this case, `tls_version` is set as:

```nohighlight

tls_version=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
```

For information about modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter group, see [Modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifyingcluster.md). If you use the AWS CLI to modify the `tls_version`
DB cluster parameter, the `ApplyMethod` must be set to `pending-reboot`. When the application method is
`pending-reboot`, changes to parameters are applied after you stop and restart the DB clusters associated
with the parameter group.

### Configuring cipher suites for connections to Aurora MySQL DB clusters

By using configurable cipher suites, you can have more control over the security
of your database connections. You can specify a list of cipher suites that you want
to allow to secure client TLS connections to your database. With configurable cipher
suites, you can control the connection encryption that your database server accepts.
Doing this prevents the use of insecure or deprecated ciphers.

Configurable cipher suites are supported in Aurora MySQL version 3 and Aurora MySQL
version 2. To specify the list of permissible TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 ciphers for
encrypting connections, modify the `ssl_cipher` cluster parameter. Set
the `ssl_cipher` parameter in a cluster parameter group using the
AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

Set the `ssl_cipher` parameter to a string of comma-separated cipher
values for your TLS version. For the client application, you can specify the ciphers
to use for encrypted connections by using the `--ssl-cipher` option when
connecting to the database. For more about connecting to your database, see
[Connecting to an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster](aurora-connecting.md#Aurora.Connecting.AuroraMySQL).

Starting in Aurora MySQL version 3.04.0 and higher, you can specify TLS 1.3 cipher
suites. To specify the permissible TLS 1.3 cipher suites, modify the
`tls_ciphersuites` parameter in your parameter group. TLS 1.3 has
reduced the number of available cipher suites due to changes in the naming
convention that removes the key exchange mechanism and certificate used. Set the
`tls_ciphersuites` to a string of comma-separated cipher values for
TLS 1.3.

The following table shows the supported ciphers along with the TLS encryption
protocol and valid Aurora MySQL engine versions for each cipher.

For information about modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter group, see
[Modifying parameters in a DB cluster parameter groupin Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups-modifyingcluster.md). If you use the
CLI to modify the `ssl_cipher` DB cluster parameter, make sure to set the
`ApplyMethod` to `pending-reboot`. When the application
method is `pending-reboot`, changes to parameters are applied after you
stop and restart the DB clusters associated with the parameter group.

You can also use the [describe-engine-default-cluster-parameters](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-engine-default-cluster-parameters.md) CLI command to determine
which cipher suites are currently supported for a specific parameter group family.
The following example shows how to get the allowed values for the
`ssl_cipher` cluster parameter for Aurora MySQL version 2.

For more information about ciphers, see the [ssl\_cipher](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html) variable in the MySQL documentation. For more information
about cipher suite formats, see the [openssl-ciphers list format](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-ciphers.html) and [openssl-ciphers string format](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-ciphers.html) documentation on the OpenSSL website.

### Encrypting connections to an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

To encrypt connections using the default `mysql` client, launch the
mysql client using the `--ssl-ca` parameter to reference the public key,
for example:

For MySQL 5.7 and 8.0:

```nohighlight

mysql -h myinstance.123456789012.rds-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
--ssl-ca=full_path_to_CA_certificate --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY
```

For MySQL 5.6:

```nohighlight

mysql -h myinstance.123456789012.rds-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
--ssl-ca=full_path_to_CA_certificate --ssl-verify-server-cert
```

Replace `full_path_to_CA_certificate` with the full path
to your Certificate Authority (CA) certificate. For information about downloading a
certificate, see [Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB cluster](usingwithrds-ssl.md).

You can require TLS connections for specific users accounts. For example, you can
use one of the following statements, depending on your MySQL version, to require TLS
connections on the user account `encrypted_user`.

For MySQL 5.7 and 8.0:

```sql

ALTER USER 'encrypted_user'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
```

For MySQL 5.6:

```sql

GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'encrypted_user'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
```

When you use an RDS Proxy, you connect to the proxy endpoint instead of the usual
cluster endpoint. You can make SSL/TLS required or optional for connections to the
proxy, in the same way as for connections directly to the Aurora DB cluster. For
information about using RDS Proxy, see [Amazon RDS Proxyfor Aurora](rds-proxy.md).
