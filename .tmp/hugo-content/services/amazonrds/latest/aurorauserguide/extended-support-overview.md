# Overview of Amazon RDS Extended Support

After the Aurora end of standard support date, if you didn't disable RDS Extended Support during
the [creation](extended-support-creating-db-instance.md) or [restoration](extended-support-restoring-db-instance.md) of your DB
instances, then Amazon Aurora will automatically enroll them in RDS Extended Support. Aurora
automatically upgrades your DB instance to the last minor version released before the
Aurora end
of standard support date, if you aren't already running that version. Amazon Aurora won't
upgrade your minor version until _after_ the Aurora end of
standard support date for your major engine version.

You can create new databases with major engine versions that have reached the Aurora end of
standard support date. Aurora automatically enrolls these new databases in RDS Extended Support and charges you
for this offering.

If you upgrade to an engine that's still under Aurora standard support _before_ the Aurora end of standard support date, Amazon Aurora won't
enroll your engine in RDS Extended Support.

If you attempt to restore a snapshot of a database compatible with an engine that's past
the Aurora end
of standard support date but isn't enrolled in RDS Extended Support, then Amazon Aurora will
attempt to upgrade the snapshot to be compatible with the latest engine version that is
still under Aurora standard support. If the restore fails, then Amazon Aurora will
automatically enroll your engine in RDS Extended Support with a version that's compatible with the
snapshot.

You can end enrollment in RDS Extended Support at any time. To end enrollment, upgrade each enrolled
engine to a newer engine version that's still under Aurora standard support. The end of
RDS Extended Support enrollment will be effective the day that you complete an upgrade to a newer
engine version that's still under Aurora standard support.

For more information about the Aurora end of standard support dates and
the RDS end of Extended Support dates, see [Release calendar for Aurora MySQL major versions](../auroramysqlreleasenotes/auroramysql-release-calendars.md#AuroraMySQL.release-calendars.major) and [Release calendar for Aurora PostgreSQL major versions](../aurorapostgresqlreleasenotes/aurorapostgresql-release-calendar.md#aurorapostgresql.major.versions.supported).
