## Storage scaling

Aurora storage automatically scales with the data in your cluster volume. As your data
grows, your cluster volume storage expands depending on the DB engine version. For
information about maximum Aurora cluster volume sizes for each engine version, see [Amazon Aurora size limits](chap-limits.md#RDS_Limits.FileSize.Aurora).
To learn what kinds of data are included in the cluster volume, see [Amazon Aurora storage](aurora-overview-storagereliability.md). For details about the maximum
size for a specific version, see [Amazon Aurora size limits](chap-limits.md#RDS_Limits.FileSize.Aurora).

The size of your cluster volume is evaluated on an hourly basis to determine your
storage costs. For pricing information, see the [Aurora pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing).

Even though an Aurora cluster volume can scale up in size to many tebibytes, you are
only charged for the space that you use in the volume. The mechanism for determining
billed storage space depends on the version of your Aurora cluster.

- When Aurora data is removed from the cluster volume, the overall billed space
decreases by a comparable amount. This dynamic resizing behavior happens when
underlying tablespaces are dropped or reorganized to require less space. Thus,
you can reduce storage charges by dropping tables and databases that you no
longer need. Dynamic resizing applies to certain Aurora versions. The following
are the Aurora versions where the cluster volume dynamically resizes as you
remove data:

Database engineVersions with dynamic resizingAurora MySQL

- Version 3 (compatible with MySQL 8.0): all
supported versions

- Version 2 (compatible with MySQL 5.7): 2.11 and
higher

Aurora PostgreSQLAll supported versionsAurora Serverless v2All supported versionsAurora Serverless v1Not available

- In Aurora versions lower than those in the preceding list, the cluster volume
can reuse space that's freed up when you remove data, but the volume itself
never decreases in size.

Dynamic resizing applies to operations that physically remove or resize tablespaces
within the cluster volume. Thus, it applies to SQL statements such as `DROP
                TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`, and
`ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION`. It doesn't apply to deleting rows
using the `DELETE` statement. If you delete a large number of rows from a
table, you can run the Aurora MySQL `OPTIMIZE TABLE` statement or use the
Aurora PostgreSQL `pg_repack` extension afterward to reorganize the table and
dynamically resize the cluster volume.

For Aurora MySQL, the following considerations apply:

- After you upgrade your DB cluster to a DB engine version that supports dynamic
resizing, and when the feature is enabled in that specific AWS Region, any
space that's later freed by certain SQL statements, such as `DROP
                          TABLE`, is reclaimable.

If the feature is explicitly disabled in a particular AWS Region, the space
might only be reusable—and not reclaimable—even on versions that
support dynamic resizing.

The feature was enabled for specific DB engine versions (1.23.0–1.23.4,
2.09.0–2.09.3, and 2.10.0) between November 2020 and March 2022, and is
enabled by default on any subsequent versions.

- A table is stored internally in one or more contiguous fragments of varying
sizes. While running `TRUNCATE TABLE` operations, the space
corresponding to the first fragment is reusable and not reclaimable. Other
fragments are reclaimable. During `DROP TABLE` operations, space
corresponding to the entire tablespace is reclaimable.

- The `innodb_file_per_table` parameter affects how table storage is
organized. When tables are part of the system tablespace, dropping the table
doesn't reduce the size of the system tablespace. Thus, make sure to set
`innodb_file_per_table` to 1 for Aurora MySQL DB clusters to take
full advantage of dynamic resizing.

- In version 2.11 and higher, the InnoDB temporary tablespace is dropped and
re-created on restart. This releases the space occupied by the temporary
tablespace to the system, and then the cluster volume resizes. To take full
advantage of the dynamic resizing feature, we recommend that you upgrade your DB
cluster to version 2.11 or higher.

###### Note

The dynamic resizing feature doesn't reclaim space immediately when tables in
tablespaces are dropped, but gradually at a rate of approximately 10 TB per day.
Space in the system tablespace isn't reclaimed, because the system tablespace is
never removed. Unreclaimed free space in a tablespace is reused when an operation
needs space in that tablespace. The dynamic resizing feature can reclaim storage
space only when the cluster is in an available state.

You can check how much storage space a cluster is using by monitoring the
`VolumeBytesUsed` metric in CloudWatch. For more information on storage
billing, see [How Aurora data storage is billed](aurora-overview-storagereliability.md#aurora-storage-data-billing).

- In the AWS Management Console, you can see this figure in a chart by viewing the
`Monitoring` tab on the details page for the cluster.

- With the AWS CLI, you can run a command similar to the following Linux example.
Substitute your own values for the start and end times and the name of the
cluster.

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name "VolumeBytesUsed" \
    --start-time "$(date -d '6 hours ago')" --end-time "$(date -d 'now')" --period 60 \
    --namespace "AWS/RDS" \
    --statistics Average Maximum Minimum \
    --dimensions Name=DBClusterIdentifier,Value=my_cluster_identifier
```

That command produces output similar to the following.

```nohighlight

{
      "Label": "VolumeBytesUsed",
      "Datapoints": [
          {
              "Timestamp": "2020-08-04T21:25:00+00:00",
              "Average": 182871982080.0,
              "Minimum": 182871982080.0,
              "Maximum": 182871982080.0,
              "Unit": "Bytes"
          }
      ]
}
```

The following examples show how you might track storage usage for an Aurora cluster
over time using AWS CLI commands on a Linux system. The `--start-time` and
`--end-time` parameters define the overall time interval as one day. The
`--period` parameter requests the measurements at one hour intervals. It
doesn't make sense to choose a `--period` value that's small,
because the metrics are collected at intervals, not continuously. Also, Aurora storage
operations sometimes continue for some time in the background after the relevant SQL
statement finishes.

The first example returns output in the default JSON format. The data points are
returned in arbitrary order, not sorted by timestamp. You might import this JSON data
into a charting tool to do sorting and visualization.

```nohighlight

$ aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name "VolumeBytesUsed" \
  --start-time "$(date -d '1 day ago')" --end-time "$(date -d 'now')" --period 3600
  --namespace "AWS/RDS" --statistics Maximum --dimensions Name=DBClusterIdentifier,Value=my_cluster_id
{
    "Label": "VolumeBytesUsed",
    "Datapoints": [
        {
            "Timestamp": "2020-08-04T19:40:00+00:00",
            "Maximum": 182872522752.0,
            "Unit": "Bytes"
        },
        {
            "Timestamp": "2020-08-05T00:40:00+00:00",
            "Maximum": 198573719552.0,
            "Unit": "Bytes"
        },
        {
            "Timestamp": "2020-08-05T05:40:00+00:00",
            "Maximum": 206827454464.0,
            "Unit": "Bytes"
        },
        {
            "Timestamp": "2020-08-04T17:40:00+00:00",
            "Maximum": 182872522752.0,
            "Unit": "Bytes"
        },
... output omitted ...

```

This example returns the same data as the previous one. The `--output`
parameter represents the data in compact plain text format. The `aws cloudwatch
            ` command pipes its output to the `sort` command. The `-k`
parameter of the `sort` command sorts the output by the third field, which is
the timestamp in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format.

```nohighlight

The sorted output shows how much storage was used at the start and end of the
monitoring period. You can also find the points during that period when Aurora allocated
more storage for the cluster. The following example uses Linux commands to reformat the
starting and ending `VolumeBytesUsed` values as gigabytes (GB) and as
gibibytes (GiB). Gigabytes represent units measured in powers of 10 and are commonly
used in discussions of storage for rotational hard drives. Gibibytes represent units
measured in powers of 2. Aurora storage measurements and limits are typically stated in
the power-of-2 units, such as gibibytes and tebibytes.

```nohighlight

$ GiB=$((1024*1024*1024))
$ GB=$((1000*1000*1000))
$ echo "Start: $((182872522752/$GiB)) GiB, End: $((206833664000/$GiB)) GiB"
Start: 170 GiB, End: 192 GiB
$ echo "Start: $((182872522752/$GB)) GB, End: $((206833664000/$GB)) GB"
Start: 182 GB, End: 206 GB

```

The `VolumeBytesUsed` metric tells you how much storage in the cluster is
incurring charges. Thus, it's best to minimize this number when practical. However,
this metric doesn't include some storage that Aurora uses internally in the cluster
and doesn't charge for. If your cluster is approaching the storage limit and might
run out of space, it's more helpful to monitor the
`AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` metric and try to maximize that number. The
following example runs a similar calculation as the previous one, but for
`AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` instead of
`VolumeBytesUsed`.

```nohighlight

$ aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name "AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal" \
  --start-time "$(date -d '1 hour ago')" --end-time "$(date -d 'now')" --period 3600 \
  --namespace "AWS/RDS" --statistics Maximum --dimensions Name=DBClusterIdentifier,Value=my_old_cluster_id \
  --output text | sort -k 3
AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal
DATAPOINTS      140530528288768.0       2023-02-23T19:25:00+00:00       Count
$ TiB=$((1024*1024*1024*1024))
$ TB=$((1000*1000*1000*1000))
$ echo "$((69797067915264 / $TB)) TB remaining for this cluster"
69 TB remaining for this cluster
$ echo "$((69797067915264 / $TiB)) TiB remaining for this cluster"
63 TiB remaining for this cluster

```

For a cluster running Aurora MySQL version 2.09 or higher, or Aurora PostgreSQL, the free
size reported by `VolumeBytesUsed` increases when data is added and decreases
when data is removed. The following example shows how. This report shows the maximum and
minimum storage size for a cluster at 15-minute intervals as tables with temporary data
are created and dropped. The report lists the maximum value before the minimum value.
Thus, to understand how storage usage changed within the 15-minute interval, interpret
the numbers from right to left.

```nohighlight

$ aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name "VolumeBytesUsed" \
  --start-time "$(date -d '4 hours ago')" --end-time "$(date -d 'now')" --period 1800 \

The following example shows how for clusters running compatible versions of
Aurora MySQL or Aurora PostgreSQL, the free size reported by
`AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` reflects the 256-TiB size limit. For more

## Instance scaling

You can scale your Aurora DB cluster as needed by modifying the DB instance class for
each DB instance in the DB cluster. Aurora supports several DB instance classes optimized
for Aurora, depending on database engine compatibility.

Database engineInstance scaling

Amazon Aurora MySQL

See [Scaling Aurora MySQL DB instances](auroramysql-managing-performance.md#AuroraMySQL.Managing.Performance.InstanceScaling)

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL

See [Scaling Aurora PostgreSQL DB instances](aurorapostgresql-managing.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.Performance.InstanceScaling)

## Read scaling

You can achieve read scaling for your Aurora DB cluster by creating up to
15 Aurora Replicas in a DB cluster. Each Aurora Replica returns the same
data from the cluster volume with minimal replica lag—usually considerably less
than 100 milliseconds after the primary instance has written an update. As your read
traffic increases, you can create additional Aurora Replicas and connect to them directly
to distribute the read load for your DB cluster. Aurora Replicas don't have to be of
the same DB instance class as the primary instance.

For information about adding Aurora Replicas to a DB cluster, see [Adding Aurora Replicas to a DB cluster](aurora-replicas-adding.md).

## Managing connections

The maximum number of connections allowed to an Aurora DB instance is determined by the
`max_connections` parameter in the instance-level parameter group for the
DB instance. The default value of that parameter varies depends on the DB instance class
used for the DB instance and database engine compatibility.

Database enginemax\_connections default value

Amazon Aurora MySQL

See [Maximum connections to an Aurora MySQL DB instance](auroramysql-managing-performance.md#AuroraMySQL.Managing.MaxConnections)

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL

See [Maximum connections to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB instance](aurorapostgresql-managing.md#AuroraPostgreSQL.Managing.MaxConnections)

###### Tip

If your applications frequently open and close connections, or keep a large number
of long-lived connections open, we recommend that you use Amazon RDS Proxy. RDS Proxy is a
fully managed, highly available database proxy that uses connection pooling to share
database connections securely and efficiently. To learn more about RDS Proxy, see
[Amazon RDS Proxyfor Aurora](rds-proxy.md).

## Managing query execution plans

If you use query plan management for Aurora PostgreSQL, you gain control over which plans
the optimizer runs. For more information, see [Managing query execution plans for Aurora PostgreSQL](aurorapostgresql-optimize.md).
