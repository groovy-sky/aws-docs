You might want to balance the load distribution for instances on your Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database. To analyze load distribution of the instances on an Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database,
use the following procedure.

###### To analyze load distribution of the instances on an Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database using the console

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Performance Insights**.

3. Choose an Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database. The Performance Insights dashboard is displayed for that Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database.

4. In the **Database load (DB load)** section, choose **Instances** for **Sliced**
**by**. To view the number of AAS and the estimated vCPU for all instances in your Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database, choose
    **Absolute** for **Viewed as**.
