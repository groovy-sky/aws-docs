## Overview of backtracking

Backtracking "rewinds" the DB cluster to the time you specify. Backtracking is not a replacement
for backing up your DB cluster so that you can restore it to a point in time. However, backtracking
provides the following advantages over traditional backup and restore:

- You can easily undo mistakes. If you mistakenly perform a destructive action, such as a DELETE
without a WHERE clause, you can backtrack the DB cluster to a time before
the destructive action with minimal interruption of service.

- You can backtrack a DB cluster quickly. Restoring a DB cluster to a point in time launches a
new DB cluster and restores it from backup data or a DB cluster snapshot,
which can take hours. Backtracking a DB cluster doesn't require a new
DB cluster and rewinds the DB cluster in minutes.

- You can explore earlier data changes. You can repeatedly backtrack a DB cluster back and forth
in time to help determine when a particular data change occurred. For
example, you can backtrack a DB cluster three hours and then backtrack
forward in time one hour. In this case, the backtrack time is two hours
before the original time.

###### Note

For information about restoring a DB cluster to a point in time, see
[Overview of backing up and restoring an Aurora DB cluster](aurora-managing-backups.md).

### Backtrack window

With backtracking, there is a target backtrack window and an actual backtrack
window:

- The _target backtrack window_ is the amount of time you want to be able to backtrack your
DB cluster. When you enable backtracking, you specify a _target backtrack window_. For example,
you might specify a target backtrack window of 24 hours if you want to be able to backtrack the DB cluster one day.

- The _actual backtrack window_ is the actual amount of
time you can backtrack your DB cluster, which can be smaller than the
target backtrack window. The actual backtrack window is based on your
workload and the storage available for storing information about
database changes, called _change_
_records._

As you make updates to your Aurora DB cluster with backtracking enabled, you generate
change records. Aurora retains change records for the target backtrack window,
and you pay an hourly rate for storing them. Both the target backtrack window
and the workload on your DB cluster determine the number of change records you
store. The workload is the number of changes you make to your DB cluster in a
given amount of time. If your workload is heavy, you store more change records
in your backtrack window than you do if your workload is light.

You can think of your target backtrack window as the goal for the maximum amount of
time you want to be able to backtrack your DB cluster. In most cases, you can
backtrack the maximum amount of time that you specified. However, in some cases,
the DB cluster can't store enough change records to backtrack the maximum amount
of time, and your actual backtrack window is smaller than your target.
Typically, the actual backtrack window is smaller than the target when you have
extremely heavy workload on your DB cluster. When your actual backtrack window
is smaller than your target, we send you a notification.

When backtracking is enabled for a DB cluster, and you delete a table stored in the DB
cluster, Aurora keeps that table in the backtrack change records. It does this so
that you can revert back to a time before you deleted the table. If you don't have enough
space in your backtrack window to store the table, the table might be removed from the
backtrack change records eventually.

### Backtracking time

Aurora always backtracks to a time that is consistent for the DB cluster.
Doing so eliminates the possibility of uncommitted transactions when the backtrack is
complete. When you specify a time for a backtrack, Aurora automatically chooses
the nearest possible consistent time. This approach means that the completed
backtrack might not exactly match the time you specify, but you can determine the exact time
for a backtrack by using the
[describe-db-cluster-backtracks](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-cluster-backtracks.md) AWS CLI command. For more information, see
[Retrieving existing backtracks](#AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Retrieving).

### Backtracking limitations

The following limitations apply to backtracking:

- Backtracking is only available for DB clusters that were created with the Backtrack feature enabled. You
can't modify a DB cluster to enable the Backtrack feature. You can enable the Backtrack feature when you create
a new DB cluster or restore a snapshot of a DB cluster.

- The limit for a backtrack window is 72 hours.

- Backtracking affects the entire DB cluster. For example, you can't
selectively backtrack a single table or a single data update.

- You can't create cross-Region read replicas from a backtrack-enabled
cluster, but you can still enable binary log (binlog) replication on the
cluster. If you try to backtrack a DB cluster for which binary logging is
enabled, an error typically occurs unless you choose to force the backtrack.
Any attempts to force a backtrack will break downstream read replicas and
interfere with other operations such as blue/green deployments.

- You can't backtrack a database clone to a time before that
database clone was created. However, you can use the original database to
backtrack to a time before the clone was created. For more information about
database cloning, see [Cloning a volume for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-managing-clone.md).

- Backtracking causes a brief DB instance disruption. You must stop or pause
your applications before starting a backtrack operation to ensure that there
are no new read or write requests. During the backtrack operation, Aurora
pauses the database, closes any open connections, and drops any uncommitted
reads and writes. It then waits for the backtrack operation to
complete.

- You can't restore a cross-Region snapshot of a backtrack-enabled cluster in an AWS Region that doesn't
support backtracking.

- If you perform an in-place upgrade for a backtrack-enabled cluster from Aurora MySQL version 2 to version 3, you
can't backtrack to a point in time before the upgrade happened.

## Region and version availability

Backtrack is not available for Aurora PostgreSQL.

Following are the supported engines and Region availability for Backtrack with Aurora MySQL.

## Upgrade considerations for backtrack-enabled clusters

You can upgrade a backtrack-enabled DB cluster from Aurora MySQL version 2 to version 3, because all minor versions of
Aurora MySQL version 3 are supported for Backtrack.

## Subscribing to a backtrack event with the console

The following procedure describes how to subscribe to a backtrack event using the
console. The event sends you an email or text notification when your actual
backtrack window is smaller than your target backtrack window.

###### To view backtrack information using the console

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. Choose **Event subscriptions**.

03. Choose **Create event subscription**.

04. In the **Name** box, type a name for the event subscription, and
     ensure that **Yes** is selected for **Enabled**.

05. In the **Target** section, choose **New email topic**.

06. For **Topic name**, type a name for the topic, and for
     **With these recipients**, enter the email addresses or
     phone numbers to receive the notifications.

07. In the **Source** section, choose **Instances** for **Source type**.

08. For **Instances to include**, choose **Select specific instances**,
     and choose your DB instance.

09. For **Event categories to include**, choose **Select specific event categories**,
     and choose **backtrack**.

    Your page should look similar to the following page.

10. Choose **Create**.

## Retrieving existing backtracks

You can retrieve information about existing backtracks for a DB cluster. This
information includes the unique identifier of the backtrack, the date and time
backtracked to and from, the date and time the backtrack was requested, and the
current status of the backtrack.

###### Note

Currently, you can't retrieve existing backtracks using the
console.

The following procedure describes how to retrieve existing backtracks
for a DB cluster using the AWS CLI.

###### To retrieve existing backtracks using the AWS CLI

- Call the [describe-db-cluster-backtracks](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-cluster-backtracks.md)
AWS CLI command and supply the following values:

- `--db-cluster-identifier` – The name of the
DB cluster.

The following example retrieves existing backtracks for
`sample-cluster`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-cluster-backtracks \
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-cluster-backtracks ^
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster

```

To retrieve information about the backtracks for a DB cluster using the Amazon RDS API, use the
[DescribeDBClusterBacktracks](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbclusterbacktracks.md) operation.
This operation returns information about backtracks for the DB cluster specified in
the `DBClusterIdentifier` value.
