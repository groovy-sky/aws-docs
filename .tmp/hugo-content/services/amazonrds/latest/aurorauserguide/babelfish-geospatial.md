# Babelfish supports Geospatial data types

Starting with versions 3.5.0 and 4.1.0, Babelfish includes support for the following two spatial data types:

- Geometry data type – This data type is intended for storing planar or Euclidean (flat-earth) data.

- Geography data type – This data type is intended for storing ellipsoidal or round-earth data, such as GPS latitude and longitude coordinates.

These data types allow for the storage and manipulation of spatial data, but with limitations.

## Understanding the Geospatial data types in Babelfish

- Geospatial data types are supported in various database objects such as views, procedures, and tables.

- Supports point data type to store location data as points defined by latitude, longitude, and a valid Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID). A point may contain Z (elevation), M (measure) values and can be empty.

- Supports linestring data type (from version 5.4.0) defined by a sequence of points and the line segments connecting them and a valid Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID). A linestring may contain points with Z (elevation), M (measure) values and can be empty.

- Supports polygon data type (from version 5.5.0 and 6.0.0). A Polygon is a two-dimensional surface stored as a sequence of points defining an exterior bounding ring and zero or more interior rings.

- Applications connecting to Babelfish through drivers like JDBC, ODBC, DOTNET, and PYTHON can utilize this Geospatial feature.

## Limitations in Babelfish for Geospatial data types

- Geometry and Geography types other than point, linestring and polygon instances aren't currently supported:

- CircularString

- CompoundCurve

- CurvePolygon

- MultiPoint

- MultiLineString

- MultiPolygon

- GeometryCollection

- Currently, spatial indexing isn't supported for Geospatial data types.

- Only the listed functions are currently supported for these data types. For more information, see
[Geometry data type functions supported in Babelfish](#babelfish-geospatial-overview-geometry) and
[Geography data type functions supported in Babelfish](#babelfish-geospatial-overview-geography).

- STDistance function output for Geography data might have minor precision variations compared to T-SQL.
This is due to the underlying PostGIS implementation.
For more information, see [ST\_Distance](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Distance.html)

- STIsValid function output for both Geometry and Geography data might have some deviations compared to T-SQL.
Due to this, the functions - STDistance, STContains, STInstersects, STDisjoint, STDimension, STArea, STEquals may also deviate from T-SQL for some cases ( returns output instead of throwing error ).
This is due to the underlying PostGIS implementation.
For more information, see [ST\_IsValid](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_IsValid.html).

- For optimal performance, use built-in Geospatial data types, without creating additional layers of abstraction in Babelfish.

- In Babelfish, Geospatial function names are used as keywords and will perform spatial operations only if used in the intended way.
