`pg_sleep` function and is waiting for
the sleep timeout to expire.

## Supported engine versions

This wait event information is supported for all versions of Aurora PostgreSQL.

## Likely causes of increased waits

This wait event occurs when an application, stored function, or user issues a SQL statement that calls
one of the following functions:

- `pg_sleep`

- `pg_sleep_for`

- `pg_sleep_until`

The preceding functions delay execution until the specified number of seconds have elapsed. For
example, `SELECT pg_sleep(1)` pauses for 1 second. For more information, see [Delaying Execution](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## Actions

Identify the statement that was running the `pg_sleep` function.
Determine if the use of the function is appropriate.
