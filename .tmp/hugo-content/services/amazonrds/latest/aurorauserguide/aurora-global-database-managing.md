# Managing an Amazon Aurora global database

You perform most management
operations on the individual clusters that make up an Aurora global database. When you choose
**Group related resources** on the **Databases** page in
the console, you see the primary cluster and secondary clusters grouped under the associated
global database. To find the AWS Regions where a global database's DB clusters are running,
its Aurora DB engine and version, and its identifier, use its
**Configuration** tab.

The cross-Region database failover processes are available to Aurora global databases only, not
for a single Aurora DB cluster. To learn more, see
[Using switchover or failover in Amazon Aurora Global Database](aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.md).

To recover an Aurora global database from an unplanned outage in its primary
Region, see [Recovering an Amazon Aurora global database from an unplanned outage](aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.md#aurora-global-database-failover).
