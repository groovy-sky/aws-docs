# Comparing Babelfish and SQL Server isolation levels

Below are a few examples on the nuances in how SQL Server and Babelfish implement the ANSI isolation levels.

###### Note

- Isolation level `REPEATABLE READ` and `SNAPSHOT` are the same in Babelfish.

- Isolation level `READ UNCOMMITTED` and `READ COMMITTED` are the same in Babelfish.

The following example shows how to create the base table for all the examples mentioned below:

```nohighlight

CREATE TABLE employee (
    id sys.INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name sys.VARCHAR(255)NOT NULL,
    age sys.INT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO employee (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'A', 10);
INSERT INTO employee (id, name, age) VALUES (2, 'B', 20);
INSERT INTO employee (id, name, age) VALUES (3, 'C', 30);
```

Idle in transaction

`SELECT * FROM employee;`

This step is executed after transaction 1 has committed. Row with id = 1 is updated by transaction 2 in previous step and is visible here.

In Babelfish, concurrent transactions running with Isolation Level serializable will fail with serialization anomaly error if the execution of these transaction is
inconsistent with all possible serial (one at a time) executions of those transactions.

The following tables provides details on serialization anomaly when concurrent transactions are executed. It shows observed results when using the `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level
in SQL Server compared to the `SERIALIZABLE` Babelfish implementation.

Transaction 2 commit fails with serialization error, the whole transaction has been rolled back. Retry transaction 2.

`SELECT * FROM employee;`

Changes from both transactions are visible.

Transaction 2 was rolled back. Only transaction 1 changes are seen.

In Babelfish, serialization anomaly is only possible if all the concurrent transactions are executing at isolation level `SERIALIZABLE`. In the following table, lets take the above
example but set transaction 2 to isolation level `REPEATABLE READ` instead.
