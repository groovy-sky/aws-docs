# synch/mutex/innodb/buf\_pool\_mutex

The `synch/mutex/innodb/buf_pool_mutex` event occurs when a thread has
acquired a lock on the InnoDB buffer pool to access a page in memory.

- [Context](#ams-waits.bufpoolmutex.context)

- [Likely causes of increased waits](#ams-waits.bufpoolmutex.causes)

- [Actions](#ams-waits.bufpoolmutex.actions)

## Relevant engine versions

This wait event information is supported for the following engine versions:

- Aurora MySQL version 2

## Context

The `buf_pool` mutex is a single mutex that protects the control data structures of the buffer pool.

For more information, see [Monitoring \
InnoDB Mutex Waits Using Performance Schema](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/monitor-innodb-mutex-waits-performance-schema.html) in the MySQL documentation.

## Likely causes of increased waits

This is a workload-specific wait event. Common causes for `synch/mutex/innodb/buf_pool_mutex` to appear
among the top wait events include the following:

- The buffer pool size isn't large enough to hold the working set of data.

- The workload is more specific to certain pages from a specific table in the database, leading to contention in the
buffer pool.

## Actions

We recommend different actions depending on the causes of your wait event.

### Identify the sessions and queries causing the events

Typically, databases with moderate to significant load have wait events. The wait events might be acceptable if
performance is optimal. If performance isn't optimal, then examine where the database is spending the most time. Look
at the wait events that contribute to the highest load, and find out whether you can optimize the database and application
to reduce those events.

###### To view the Top SQL chart in the AWS Management Console

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Performance Insights**.

3. Choose a DB instance. The Performance Insights dashboard is shown for that DB instance.

4. In the **Database load** chart, choose **Slice by wait**.

5. Underneath the **Database load** chart, choose **Top SQL**.

The chart lists the SQL queries that are responsible for the load. Those at the top of the list are most
    responsible. To resolve a bottleneck, focus on these statements.

For a useful overview of troubleshooting using Performance Insights, see the blog post [Analyze\
Amazon Aurora MySQL Workloads with Performance Insights](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/analyze-amazon-aurora-mysql-workloads-with-performance-insights).

### Use Performance Insights

This event is related to workload. You can use Performance Insights to do the following:

- Identify when wait events start, and whether there's any change in the workload around that time from the
application logs or related sources.

- Identify the SQL statements responsible for this wait event. Examine the execution plan of the queries to make
sure that these queries are optimized and using appropriate indexes.

If the top queries responsible for the wait event are related to the same database object or table, then consider
partitioning that object or table.

### Create Aurora Replicas

You can create Aurora Replicas to serve read-only traffic. You can also use Aurora
Auto Scaling to handle surges in read traffic. Make sure to run scheduled read-only
tasks and logical backups on Aurora Replicas.

For more information, see [Amazon Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas](aurora-integrating-autoscaling.md).

### Examine the buffer pool size

Check whether the buffer pool size is sufficient for the workload by looking at the metric
`innodb_buffer_pool_wait_free`. If the value of this metric is high and increasing continuously, that
indicates that the size of the buffer pool isn't sufficient to handle the workload. If
`innodb_buffer_pool_size` has been set properly, the value of `innodb_buffer_pool_wait_free`
should be small. For more information, see [Innodb\_buffer\_pool\_wait\_free](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-status-variables.html) in the MySQL documentation.

Increase the buffer pool size if the DB instance has enough memory for session
buffers and operating-system tasks. If it doesn't, change the DB instance to a
larger DB instance class to get additional memory that can be allocated to the
buffer pool.

###### Note

Aurora MySQL automatically adjusts the value of `innodb_buffer_pool_instances` based on the configured
`innodb_buffer_pool_size`.

### Monitor the global status history

By monitoring the change rates of status variables, you can detect locking or
memory issues on your DB instance. Turn on Global Status History (GoSH) if it
isn't already turned on. For more information on GoSH, see [Managing the global status history](../userguide/appendix-mysql-commondbatasks.md#Appendix.MySQL.CommonDBATasks.GoSH).

You can also create custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor status variables. For more information, see [Publishing custom\
metrics](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/publishingmetrics.md).
