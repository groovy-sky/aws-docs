# Connecting to Aurora MySQL with Kerberos authentication

To avoid errors, use a MySQL client with version 8.0.26 or higher on Unix platforms, 8.0.27 or higher on Windows.

## Using the Aurora MySQL Kerberos login to connect to the DB cluster

To connect to Aurora MySQL with Kerberos authentication, you log in as a database user that you created using the
instructions in [Step 6: Create Aurora MySQL users that use Kerberos authentication](aurora-mysql-kerberos-setting-up.md#aurora-mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-logins).

At a command prompt, connect to one of the endpoints associated with your Aurora MySQL DB cluster. When you're prompted
for the password, enter the Kerberos password associated with that username.

When you authenticate with Kerberos, a _ticket-granting ticket_ (TGT) is generated if one doesn't
already exist. The `authentication_kerberos` plugin uses the TGT to get a _service ticket_,
which is then presented to the Aurora MySQL database server.

You can use the MySQL client to connect to Aurora MySQL with Kerberos authentication using either Windows or Unix.

You can connect by using either one of the following methods:

- Obtain the TGT manually. In this case, you don't need to supply the password to the MySQL client.

- Supply the password for the Active Directory login directly to the MySQL client.

The client-side plugin is supported on Unix platforms for MySQL client versions 8.0.26 and higher.

###### To connect by obtaining the TGT manually

1. At the command line interface, use the following command to obtain
    the TGT.

```nohighlight

kinit user_name
```

2. Use the following `mysql` command to log in to the DB instance endpoint of your DB
    cluster.

```nohighlight

mysql -h DB_instance_endpoint -P 3306 -u user_name -p
```

###### Note

Authentication can fail if the keytab is rotated on the DB instance. In this case, obtain a new TGT by
rerunning `kinit`.

###### To connect directly

1. At the command line interface, use the following
    `mysql` command to log in to the DB instance endpoint
    of your DB cluster.

```nohighlight

mysql -h DB_instance_endpoint -P 3306 -u user_name -p
```

2. Enter the password for the Active Directory user.

On Windows, authentication is usually done at login time, so you don't need to obtain the TGT manually to connect
to the Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The case of the database username must match the character case of the user in the
Active Directory. For example, if the user in the Active Directory appears as `Admin`, the database
username must be `Admin`.

The client-side plugin is supported on Windows for MySQL client versions 8.0.27 and higher.

###### To connect directly

- At the command line interface, use the following `mysql` command to log in to the DB instance
endpoint of your DB cluster.

```nohighlight

mysql -h DB_instance_endpoint -P 3306 -u user_name
```

## Kerberos authentication with Aurora global databases

Kerberos authentication for Aurora MySQL is supported for Aurora global databases. To
authenticate users on the secondary DB cluster using the Active Directory of the
primary DB cluster, replicate the Active Directory to the secondary AWS Region.
You turn on Kerberos authentication on the secondary cluster using the same domain
ID as for the primary cluster. AWS Managed Microsoft AD replication is supported only with the
Enterprise version of Active Directory. For more information, see [Multi-Region replication](../../../directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms-ad-configure-multi-region-replication.md) in the
_AWS Directory Service Administration Guide_.

## Migrating from RDS for MySQL to Aurora MySQL

After you migrate from RDS for MySQL with Kerberos authentication enabled to Aurora MySQL, modify users created with the
`auth_pam` plugin to use the `authentication_kerberos` plugin. For example:

```nohighlight

ALTER USER user_name IDENTIFIED WITH 'authentication_kerberos' BY 'realm_name';
```

## Preventing ticket caching

If a valid TGT doesn't exist when the MySQL client application starts, the
application can obtain and cache the TGT. If you want to prevent the TGT from being
cached, set a configuration parameter in the `/etc/krb5.conf`
file.

###### Note

This configuration only applies to client hosts running Unix, not Windows.

###### To prevent TGT caching

- Add an `[appdefaults]` section to `/etc/krb5.conf` as follows:

```nohighlight

[appdefaults]
    mysql = {
      destroy_tickets = true
    }
```

## Logging for Kerberos authentication

The `AUTHENTICATION_KERBEROS_CLIENT_LOG` environment variable sets the logging level for Kerberos
authentication. You can use the logs for client-side debugging.

The permitted values are 1–5. Log messages are written to the standard error output. The following table describes
each logging level.
