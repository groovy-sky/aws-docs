# Monitoring an Amazon Aurora global database

When you create the Aurora DB clusters that make up your Aurora global database, you can choose many options that let you monitor your
DB cluster's performance. These options include the following:

- Amazon RDS Performance Insights – Enables performance schema in the underlying Aurora database engine. To learn more about Performance Insights and Aurora global databases,
see [Monitoring an Amazon Aurora global database with Amazon RDS Performance Insights](#aurora-global-database-pi).

- Enhanced monitoring – Generates metrics for process or thread utilization on the CPU. To learn about enhanced monitoring, see
[Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](user-monitoring-os.md).

- Amazon CloudWatch Logs – Publishes specified log types to CloudWatch Logs. Error logs are published by default, but you can choose
other logs specific to your Aurora database engine.

- For Aurora MySQL–based Aurora DB clusters, you can export the audit log, general log,
and slow query log.

- For Aurora PostgreSQL–based Aurora DB clusters, you can export the PostgreSQL log.

- For Aurora MySQL–based global databases, you can query specific `information_schema` tables to check the
status of your Aurora global database and its instances. To learn how, see [Monitoring Aurora MySQL-based global databases](#aurora-global-database-monitoring.mysql).

- For Aurora PostgreSQL–based global databases, you can use specific functions to check the
status of your Aurora global database and its instances. To learn how, see [Monitoring Aurora PostgreSQL-based global databases](#aurora-global-database-monitoring.postgres).

The following screenshot shows some of the options available on the Monitoring tab of a primary Aurora DB cluster in an Aurora global database.

## Monitoring an Amazon Aurora global database with Amazon RDS Performance Insights

You can use Amazon RDS Performance Insights for your Aurora global databases. You enable this
feature individually, for each Aurora DB cluster in your Aurora global database. To do so, you
choose **Enable Performance Insights** in the **Additional**
**configuration** section of the Create database page. Or you can modify your Aurora
DB clusters to use this feature after they are up and running. You can enable or turn off
Performance Insights for each cluster that's part of your Aurora global database.

The reports created by Performance Insights apply to each cluster in the global database.
When you add a new secondary AWS Region to an Aurora global database
that's already using Performance Insights, be sure that you enable Performance Insights in the newly added cluster.
It doesn't inherit the Performance Insights setting from the existing global database.

You can switch AWS Regions while viewing the Performance Insights page for a DB instance
that's attached to a global database. However, you might not see performance information
immediately after switching AWS Regions. Although the DB instances might have identical names
in each AWS Region, the associated Performance Insights URL is different for each DB instance.
After switching AWS Regions, choose the name of the DB instance again in the Performance
Insights navigation pane.

For DB instances associated with a global database, the factors affecting performance
might be different in each AWS Region. For example, the DB instances in each AWS Region might
have different capacity.

To learn more about using Performance Insights, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon Aurora](user-perfinsights.md).

## Monitoring Aurora global databases with Database Activity Streams

By using the Database Activity Streams feature, you can monitor and set alarms for auditing activity in the DB clusters in your global database.
You start a database activity stream on each DB cluster separately. Each cluster delivers audit data to its own Kinesis stream within its own AWS Region.
For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora with Database Activity Streams](dbactivitystreams.md).

## Monitoring Aurora MySQL-based global databases

To view the status of an Aurora MySQL-based global database, query the [information\_schema.aurora\_global\_db\_status](auroramysql-reference-istables.md#AuroraMySQL.Reference.ISTables.aurora_global_db_status) and
[information\_schema.aurora\_global\_db\_instance\_status](auroramysql-reference-istables.md#AuroraMySQL.Reference.ISTables.aurora_global_db_instance_status) tables.

###### Note

The `information_schema.aurora_global_db_status` and
`information_schema.aurora_global_db_instance_status` tables are only
available with Aurora MySQL version 3.04.0 and higher global databases.

###### To monitor an Aurora MySQL-based global database

1. Connect to the global database primary cluster endpoint using a MySQL client. For more information about how to connect, see [Connecting to Amazon Aurora Global Database](aurora-global-database-connecting.md).

2. Query the `information_schema.aurora_global_db_status` table in a mysql
    command to list the primary and secondary volumes. This query returns the lag times of
    the global database secondary DB clusters, as in the following example.

```sql

mysql> select * from information_schema.aurora_global_db_status;
```

```nohighlight

AWS_REGION | HIGHEST_LSN_WRITTEN | DURABILITY_LAG_IN_MILLISECONDS | RPO_LAG_IN_MILLISECONDS | LAST_LAG_CALCULATION_TIMESTAMP | OLDEST_READ_VIEW_TRX_ID
   -----------+---------------------+--------------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------
us-east-1  |           183537946 |                            0   |                      0 |  1970-01-01 00:00:00.000000     |               0
us-west-2  |           183537944 |                            428 |                      0 |  2023-02-18 01:26:41.925000     |               20806982
(2 rows)
```

The output includes a row for each DB cluster of the global database containing the
    following columns:

- **AWS\_REGION** – The AWS Region that this DB
cluster is in. For tables listing AWS Regions by engine, see
[Region availability](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md#Aurora.Overview.Availability).

- **HIGHEST\_LSN\_WRITTEN** – The highest log
sequence number (LSN) currently written on this DB cluster.

A _log sequence number (LSN)_ is a unique
sequential number that identifies a record in the database transaction log. LSNs are
ordered such that a larger LSN represents a later transaction.

- **DURABILITY\_LAG\_IN\_MILLISECONDS** – The difference in the timestamp values between the `HIGHEST_LSN_WRITTEN` on a
secondary DB cluster and the `HIGHEST_LSN_WRITTEN` on the primary DB cluster. This value is always 0 on the primary DB cluster of the Aurora global database.

- **RPO\_LAG\_IN\_MILLISECONDS** – The recovery point objective (RPO) lag. The RPO lag is the time
it takes for the most recent user transaction COMMIT to be stored on a secondary DB cluster after it's been stored
on the primary DB cluster of the Aurora global database. This value is always 0 on the primary DB cluster of the Aurora global database.

In simple terms, this metric calculates the recovery point objective for each Aurora MySQL DB cluster in the Aurora global database, that is, how much data might be lost
if there were an outage. As with lag, RPO is measured in time.

- **LAST\_LAG\_CALCULATION\_TIMESTAMP** – The timestamp that specifies when values were last calculated for
`DURABILITY_LAG_IN_MILLISECONDS` and `RPO_LAG_IN_MILLISECONDS`. A time value such as `1970-01-01 00:00:00+00` means
this is the primary DB cluster.

- **OLDEST\_READ\_VIEW\_TRX\_ID** – The ID of the oldest transaction that the writer DB instance can purge to.

3. Query the `information_schema.aurora_global_db_instance_status` table to
    list all secondary DB instances for both the primary DB cluster and the secondary DB
    clusters.

```sql

mysql> select * from information_schema.aurora_global_db_instance_status;
```

```nohighlight

ams-gdb-primary-i1   | 5af1e20f-43db-421f-9f0d-2b92774c7d02 | us-east-1  | 183537697   |            183537698 |                20806930 |            183537691 |                     21
(4 rows)

```

The output includes a row for each DB instance of the global database containing the
    following columns:

- **SERVER\_ID** – The server identifier for the
DB instance.

- **SESSION\_ID** – A unique identifier for the current session. A value of `MASTER_SESSION_ID` identifies the Writer (primary) DB instance.

- **AWS\_REGION** – The AWS Region that this DB
instance is in. For tables listing AWS Regions by engine, see
[Region availability](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md#Aurora.Overview.Availability).

- **DURABLE\_LSN** – The LSN made durable in
storage.

- **HIGHEST\_LSN\_RECEIVED** – The highest LSN
received by the DB instance from the writer DB instance.

- **OLDEST\_READ\_VIEW\_TRX\_ID** – The ID of the oldest transaction that the writer DB instance can purge to.

- **OLDEST\_READ\_VIEW\_LSN** – The oldest LSN used
by the DB instance to read from storage.

- **VISIBILITY\_LAG\_IN\_MSEC** – For readers in the primary DB cluster, how far this DB instance is lagging behind the writer DB instance in milliseconds.
For readers in a secondary DB cluster, how far this DB instance is lagging behind the secondary volume in milliseconds.

To see how these values change over time, consider the following transaction block where a
table insert takes an hour.

```sql

mysql> BEGIN;
mysql> INSERT INTO table1 SELECT Large_Data_That_Takes_1_Hr_To_Insert;
mysql> COMMIT;

```

In some cases, there might be a network disconnect between the primary DB cluster and
the secondary DB cluster after the `BEGIN` statement. If so, the secondary DB
cluster's **DURABILITY\_LAG\_IN\_MILLISECONDS** value starts
increasing. At the end of the `INSERT` statement, the
**DURABILITY\_LAG\_IN\_MILLISECONDS** value is 1 hour. However, the
**RPO\_LAG\_IN\_MILLISECONDS** value is 0 because all the user data
committed between the primary DB cluster and secondary DB cluster are still the same. As
soon as the `COMMIT` statement completes, the
**RPO\_LAG\_IN\_MILLISECONDS** value increases.

## Monitoring Aurora PostgreSQL-based global databases

To view the status of an Aurora PostgreSQL-based global database, use the `aurora_global_db_status` and
`aurora_global_db_instance_status` functions.

###### Note

Only Aurora PostgreSQL supports the `aurora_global_db_status` and
`aurora_global_db_instance_status` functions.

###### To monitor an Aurora PostgreSQL-based global database

1. Connect to the global database primary cluster endpoint using a PostgreSQL utility
    such as psql. For more information about how to connect, see [Connecting to Amazon Aurora Global Database](aurora-global-database-connecting.md).

2. Use the `aurora_global_db_status` function in a psql command to list the
    primary and secondary volumes. This shows the lag times of the global database secondary
    DB clusters.

```sql

postgres=> select * from aurora_global_db_status();
```

```nohighlight

(2 rows)

```

The output includes a row for each DB cluster of the global database containing the
    following columns:

- **aws\_region** – The AWS Region that this DB
cluster is in. For tables listing AWS Regions by engine, see
[Region availability](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md#Aurora.Overview.Availability).

- **highest\_lsn\_written** – The highest log
sequence number (LSN) currently written on this DB cluster.

A _log sequence number (LSN)_ is a unique
sequential number that identifies a record in the database transaction log. LSNs are
ordered such that a larger LSN represents a later transaction.

- **durability\_lag\_in\_msec** – The timestamp
difference between the highest log sequence number written on a secondary DB cluster
( `highest_lsn_written`) and the `highest_lsn_written` on the
primary DB cluster.

- **rpo\_lag\_in\_msec** – The recovery point
objective (RPO) lag. This lag is the time difference between the most recent user
transaction commit stored on a secondary DB cluster and the most recent user
transaction commit stored on the primary DB cluster.

- **last\_lag\_calculation\_time** – The timestamp
when values were last calculated for `durability_lag_in_msec` and
`rpo_lag_in_msec`.

- **feedback\_epoch** – The epoch a secondary DB
cluster uses when it generates hot standby information.

_Hot standby_ is when a DB cluster can connect
and query while the server is in recovery or standby mode. Hot standby feedback is
information about the DB cluster when it's in hot standby. For more information, see
[Hot\
standby](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

- **feedback\_xmin** – The minimum (oldest)
active transaction ID used by a secondary DB cluster.

3. Use the `aurora_global_db_instance_status` function to list all secondary
    DB instances for both the primary DB cluster and secondary DB clusters.

```sql

postgres=> select * from aurora_global_db_instance_status();
```

```

The output includes a row for each DB instance of the global database containing the following columns:

- **server\_id** – The server identifier for the DB instance.

- **session\_id** – A unique identifier for the current session.

- **aws\_region** – The AWS Region that this DB
instance is in. For tables listing AWS Regions by engine, see
[Region availability](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md#Aurora.Overview.Availability).

- **durable\_lsn** – The LSN made durable in storage.

- **highest\_lsn\_rcvd** – The highest LSN
received by the DB instance from the writer DB instance.

- **feedback\_epoch** – The epoch the DB instance
uses when it generates hot standby information.

_Hot standby_ is when a DB instance can connect
and query while the server is in recovery or standby mode. Hot standby feedback is
information about the DB instance when it's in hot standby. For more information,
see the PostgreSQL documentation on
[Hot standby](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hot-standby.html).

- **feedback\_xmin** – The minimum (oldest)
active transaction ID used by the DB instance.

- **oldest\_read\_view\_lsn** – The oldest LSN used
by the DB instance to read from storage.

- **visibility\_lag\_in\_msec** – How far this DB
instance is lagging behind the writer DB instance.

To see how these values change over time, consider the following transaction block where a
table insert takes an hour.

```sql

psql> BEGIN;
psql> INSERT INTO table1 SELECT Large_Data_That_Takes_1_Hr_To_Insert;
psql> COMMIT;
```

In some cases, there might be a network disconnect between the primary DB cluster and the
secondary DB cluster after the `BEGIN` statement. If so, the secondary DB
cluster's `durability_lag_in_msec` value starts increasing. At the end of the
`INSERT` statement, the `durability_lag_in_msec` value is 1 hour.
However, the `rpo_lag_in_msec` value is 0 because all the user data committed
between the primary DB cluster and secondary DB cluster are still the same. As soon as the
`COMMIT` statement completes, the `rpo_lag_in_msec` value increases.
