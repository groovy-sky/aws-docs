start parallel query clusters. You can create Aurora parallel query clusters that are compatible with
MySQL 5.7. Parallel query works for tables that use the `DYNAMIC` row format. Parallel query
clusters can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. Reader DB instances in parallel query clusters can
take advantage of the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level. You can also now create parallel query
clusters in additional AWS Regions. For more information about the parallel query feature and these
enhancements, see [Parallel query\
for Aurora MySQL](aurora-mysql-parallel-query.md).

Serverless DB clusters](aurora-serverless-viewing.md). As part of this enhancement, you can now define values for
instance-level parameters in a DB cluster parameter group, and those values apply to all DB instances in
the cluster unless you override them in the DB parameter group. For more information, see [Working with DB parameter groups and DB cluster\
parameter groups](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

You can use the Amazon CloudWatch metrics `TotalBackupStorageBilled`,
`SnapshotStorageUsed`, and `BackupRetentionPeriodStorageUsed` to monitor the
space usage of your Aurora backups. For more information about how to use CloudWatch metrics, see [Overview of monitoring](monitoringoverview.md). For more information
about how to manage storage for backup data, see [Understanding Aurora backup storage usage](aurora-storage-backup.md).

Custom endpoints

You can now create endpoints that are associated with an arbitrary set of DB instances. This feature
helps with load balancing and high availability for Aurora clusters where some DB instances have different
capacity or configuration than others. You can use custom endpoints instead of connecting to a specific
DB instance through its instance endpoint. For more information, see [Amazon Aurora endpoints](aurora-overview-endpoints.md).
