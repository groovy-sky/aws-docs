# Tutorial: Restoring a DB cluster from a DB cluster snapshot using the Amazon RDS console

In this tutorial, you restore a DB cluster from a DB cluster snapshot using the Amazon RDS console. When you restore a DB cluster from a snapshot using the AWS Management Console, the primary (writer) DB instance is also created.

###### Note

While the primary DB instance is being created, it appears as a reader instance, but after creation it's a writer
instance.

###### To restore a DB cluster from a DB cluster snapshot

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**.

03. Choose the DB cluster snapshot that you want to restore from.

04. For **Actions**, choose **Restore snapshot**.

    ![Restore snapshot option in the Actions menu in the RDS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/tut-restore-cluster1.png)

    The **Restore snapshot** page appears.

05. Under **DB instance settings**, do the following:

    1. Use the default setting for **DB engine**.

    2. For **Available versions**, choose a MySQL–8.0 compatible version, such as
        **Aurora MySQL 3.04.0 (compatible with MySQL 8.0.28)**.

06. Under **Settings**, for **DB instance identifier** enter the unique name that you
     want to use for the restored DB instance, for example `my-80`.

    ###### Note

    To create the DB cluster identifier, Amazon RDS appends `-cluster` to the DB instance identifier you specify.

07. Under **Connectivity**, use the default settings for the following:

- **Virtual private cloud (VPC)**

- **DB subnet group**

- **Public access**

- **VPC security group (firewall)**

08. Choose the **DB instance class**.

    For this tutorial, choose **Burstable classes (includes t classes)**, and then choose
     **db.t3.medium**.

    ###### Note

    We recommend using the T DB instance classes only for development and test servers, or other non-production
    servers. For more details on the T instance classes, see [DB instance class types](concepts-dbinstanceclass-types.md).

09. For **Database authentication**, use the default setting.

10. For **Encryption**, use the default settings.

    If the source DB cluster for the snapshot was encrypted, the restored DB cluster is also encrypted. You can't
     make it unencrypted.

11. Expand **Additional configuration** at the bottom of the page.

12. Make the following choices:
    1. For this tutorial, use the default value for **DB cluster**
       **parameter group**.

    2. For this tutorial, use the default value for **DB parameter**
       **group**.

    3. For **Log exports**, select all of the check boxes.

    4. For **Deletion protection**, select the **Enable deletion protection** check
        box.
13. Choose **Restore DB instance**.

The **Databases** page displays the restored DB cluster, with a status of `Creating`.

While the primary DB instance is being created, it appears as a reader instance, but after creation it's a writer
instance.
