# Creating a blue/green deployment in Amazon Aurora

RDS copies the blue environment's topology and features to a staging area. If the blue DB instance
has read replicas, they are copied as replicas of the green instance. The allocated storage of
all green replicas matches the green primary instance, while other storage parameters are
inherited from the blue replicas.

When you create a blue/green deployment, you specify the DB cluster to copy in
the deployment. The DB cluster you choose is the production DB cluster, and it becomes the DB cluster in
the blue environment. RDS copies the blue environment's topology to a staging area, along with its configured features.
The DB cluster is copied to the green environment, and RDS configures replication from the DB cluster in the blue
environment to the DB cluster in the green environment. RDS also copies all of the DB instances in the DB cluster.

## Preparing for a blue/green deployment

There are certain steps you must take before you create a blue/green deployment, depending
on the engine that your Aurora DB cluster is running.

### Preparing an Aurora MySQL DB cluster for a blue/green deployment

Before you create a blue/green deployment for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, the cluster must be
associated with a custom DB cluster parameter group with [binary logging](user-logaccess-mysql-binaryformat.md)
( `binlog_format`) turned on. Binary logging is required for replication from
the blue environment to the green environment. While any binlog format works, we recommend
`ROW` to reduce the risk of replication inconsistencies. For information about
creating a custom DB cluster parameter group and setting parameters, see [DB cluster parameter groups for Amazon Aurora DB clusters](user-workingwithdbclusterparamgroups.md).

###### Note

Enabling binary logging increases the number of write disk I/O operations to the DB cluster.
You can monitor IOPS usage with the `VolumeWriteIOPs` CloudWatch metric.

After you enable binary logging, make sure to reboot the DB cluster so that your changes take
effect. Blue/green deployments _require_ that the writer instance be in
sync with the DB cluster parameter group, otherwise creation fails. For more information, see
[Rebooting a DB instance within an Aurora cluster](aurora-reboot-db-instance.md).

In addition, we recommend changing the binary log retention period to a value other than
`NULL` to prevent binary log files from being purged. For more information, see
[Setting and showing binary log configuration](mysql-stored-proc-configuring.md).

### Preparing an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster for a blue/green deployment

Before you create a blue/green deployment for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, make sure to do the
following.

- Associate the cluster with a custom DB cluster parameter group that has logical
replication ( `rds.logical_replication`) enabled. Logical replication is
required for replication from the blue environment to the green environment.

When you enable logical replication, you also need to tune certain cluster
parameters, such as `max_replication_slots`,
`max_logical_replication_workers`, and `max_worker_processes`.
For instructions to enable logical replication and tune these parameters, see [Setting up logical replication for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](aurorapostgresql-replication-logical-configure.md).

In addition, make sure that the `synchronous_commit` parameter is set to
`on`.

After you configure the required parameters, reboot the DB cluster so that your changes
take effect. Blue/green deployments _require_ that the writer
instance be in sync with the DB cluster parameter group, otherwise creation fails. For more
information, see [Rebooting a DB instance within an Aurora cluster](aurora-reboot-db-instance.md).

- Confirm that your DB cluster is running a version of Aurora PostgreSQL that's compatible with
Blue/Green Deployments. For a list of compatible versions, see [Blue/Green Deployments with Aurora PostgreSQL](concepts-aurora-fea-regions-db-eng-feature-bluegreendeployments.md#Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.BlueGreenDeployments.apg).

- Make sure that all tables in the DB cluster have a primary key. PostgreSQL logical
replication doesn't allow UPDATE or DELETE operations on tables that don't have a
primary key.

### Preparing an Aurora Global Database DB cluster for a blue/green deployment

Before creating a blue/green deployment for your Aurora Global Database DB cluster, note the following points:

- All operations must be initiated from the same Region as the writer cluster of the Global Database.

- Parameter group configuration:

- The Green environment uses either a new parameter group you specify or the same parameter group as the blue cluster (default).

- Custom parameter groups are copied to the green environment.

- If a specified parameter group doesn't exist in the secondary region, the default parameter group in the secondary region is used for the green environment.

## Specifying changes when creating a blue/green deployment

You can make the following changes to the DB
cluster in the green environment when you create the
blue/green deployment.

You can make other modifications to the DB
cluster and its DB instances in the green environment after it
is deployed. For example, you might specify a higher engine version or a different parameter
group.

For information about modifying a DB cluster, see [Modifying an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-modifying.md).

###### Topics

- [Specify a higher engine version](#blue-green-deployments-engine-version)

- [Specify a different DB parameter group](#blue-green-deployments-parameters)

### Specify a higher engine version

You can specify a higher engine version if you want to test a DB engine upgrade. Upon
switchover, the database is upgraded to the major or minor DB engine version that you
specify.

### Specify a different DB parameter group

Specify a DB cluster parameter group that is different from the one
used by the DB cluster. You can test how parameter changes affect the DB cluster in the
green environment or specify a parameter group for a new major DB engine version in the case
of an upgrade.

If you specify a different DB cluster parameter group, the specified
parameter group is associated with the DB cluster in the green environment. If you don't
specify a different DB cluster parameter group, the DB cluster in the green environment is
associated with the same parameter group as the blue DB cluster.

## Creating a blue/green deployment

You can create a blue/green deployment using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS
API.

###### To create a blue/green deployment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose the DB
    cluster
    that you want to copy to a green environment.

3. Choose **Actions**, **Create blue/green**
**deployment**.

The **Create blue/green deployment** page appears.

![Create blue/green deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/blue-green-deployment-create-aurora.png)

4. Review the blue database identifiers. Make sure that they match the DB instances that
    you expect in the blue environment. If they don't, choose
    **Cancel**.

5. For **Blue/green deployment name**, enter a name for your
    blue/green deployment.

6. In the remaining sections, specify the settings for the green environment. For
    information about each setting, see [Settings for creating blue/green deployments](#create-blue-green-settings).

You can make other modifications to the databases in the green environment after it is deployed.

7. Choose **Create**.

To create a blue/green deployment using the AWS CLI, use the [create-blue-green-deployment](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-blue-green-deployment.md) command. For information about all available
options, see [Settings for creating blue/green deployments](#create-blue-green-settings).

###### Example
