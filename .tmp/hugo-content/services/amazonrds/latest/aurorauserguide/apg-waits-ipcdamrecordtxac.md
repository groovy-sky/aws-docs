# IPC:DamRecordTxAck

The `IPC:DamRecordTxAck` event occurs when Aurora PostgreSQL in a session using
database activity streams generates an activity stream event, then waits for that event to
become durable.

## Relevant engine versions

This wait event information is relevant for all Aurora PostgreSQL 10.7 and higher 10 versions, 11.4 and higher 11
versions, and all 12 and 13 versions.

## Context

In synchronous mode, durability of activity stream events is favored over database performance. While waiting for a durable
write of the event, the session blocks other database activity, causing the `IPC:DamRecordTxAck` wait event.

## Causes

The most common cause for the `IPC:DamRecordTxAck` event to appear
in top waits is that the Database Activity Streams (DAS) feature is a holistic audit.
Higher SQL activity generates activity stream events that need to be recorded.

## Actions

We recommend different actions depending on the causes of your wait event:

- Reduce the number of SQL statements or turn off database activity streams.
Doing this reduces the number of events that require durable writes.

- Change to asynchronous mode. Doing this helps to reduce contention on the
`IPC:DamRecordTxAck` wait event.

However, the DAS feature can't guarantee the durability of every event in
asynchronous mode.
