# Aurora MySQL global status variables

Aurora MySQL includes status variables from community MySQL and variables that are unique
to Aurora. You can examine these variables to learn about what's happening inside
the database engine. For more information about the status variables in community MySQL, see
[Server Status Variables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-status-variables.html)
in the community MySQL 8.0 documentation.

You can find the current values for Aurora MySQL global status variables by using a statement such as the following:

```nohighlight

show global status like '%aurora%';
```

###### Note

Global status variables are cleared when the DB engine reboots.

to a more stable state with sufficient memory resources.

This variable applies to Aurora MySQL version 3.06.0 and higher.

`aurora_oom_status`

Represents the current OOM status of this DB instance. When
the value is `NORMAL`, it indicates that there are
sufficient memory resources.

If the value changes to `RESERVED`, it indicates
that the server has low available memory. Actions are taken
based on the `aurora_oom_response` parameter
configuration.

For more information, see [Troubleshooting out-of-memory issues for Aurora MySQL databases](auroramysqloom.md).

This variable applies to Aurora MySQL version 3.06.0 and higher.

`Aurora_pq_bytes_returned`

queries. Divide by 16,384 to compare against `Aurora_pq_pages_pushed_down`.

`Aurora_pq_max_concurrent_requests`

The maximum number of parallel query sessions that can run concurrently on this Aurora DB instance.
This is a fixed number that depends on the AWS DB instance class.

transmission to the head node.

`Aurora_pq_request_attempted`

The number of parallel query sessions requested. This value might represent more than one session per query, depending
on SQL constructs such as subqueries and joins.

`Aurora_pq_request_executed`

The number of parallel query sessions run successfully.

`Aurora_pq_request_failed`

The number of parallel query sessions that returned an error to the client. In some cases, a request for a parallel
query might fail, for example due to a problem in the storage layer. In these cases, the query part that failed is
retried using the nonparallel query mechanism. If the retried query also fails, an error is returned to the client and
this counter is incremented.

`Aurora_pq_request_in_progress`

The number of parallel query sessions currently in progress. This number applies to the particular
Aurora DB instance that you are connected to, not the entire Aurora DB cluster. To see if a DB instance
is close to its concurrency limit, compare this value to
`Aurora_pq_max_concurrent_requests`.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen to satisfy a query. This value is the sum of several other more
granular counters. An `EXPLAIN` statement can increment this counter even though the query isn't
actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_below_min_rows`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen due to the number of rows in the table. An `EXPLAIN`
statement can increment this counter even though the query isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_bit`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because of an
unsupported data type in the list of projected columns.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_geometry`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has columns with the `GEOMETRY` data type. For information about Aurora MySQL versions that
remove this limitation, see [Upgrading parallel query clusters to Aurora MySQL version 3](aurora-mysql-parallel-query-optimizing.md#aurora-mysql-parallel-query-upgrade-pqv2).

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_lob`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has columns with a `LOB` data type, or `VARCHAR` columns that are stored
externally due to the declared length. For information about Aurora MySQL versions that remove this
limitation, see [Upgrading parallel query clusters to Aurora MySQL version 3](aurora-mysql-parallel-query-optimizing.md#aurora-mysql-parallel-query-upgrade-pqv2).

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_column_virtual`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
contains a virtual column.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_custom_charset`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has columns with a custom character set.

is currently being altered by a fast DDL `ALTER` statement.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_few_pages_outside_buffer_pool`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen, even though less than 95 percent of the table
data was in the buffer pool, because there wasn't enough unbuffered table data to make parallel
query worthwhile.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_full_text_index`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
has full-text indexes.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_high_buffer_pool_pct`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen because a high percentage of the table data
(currently, greater than 95 percent) was already in the buffer pool. In these cases, the optimizer
determines that reading the data from the buffer pool is more efficient. An `EXPLAIN`
statement can increment this counter even though the query isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_index_hint`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
includes an index hint.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_innodb_table_format`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the table
uses an unsupported InnoDB row format. Aurora parallel query only applies to the `COMPACT`,
`REDUNDANT`, and `DYNAMIC` row formats.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_long_trx`

The number of parallel query requests that used the nonparallel query processing path, due to the
query being started inside a long-running transaction. An `EXPLAIN` statement can increment
this counter even though the query isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_no_where_clause`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
doesn't include any `WHERE` clause.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_range_scan`

combined length of all the columns is too long.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_small_table`

The number of times parallel query wasn't chosen due to the overall size of the table, as determined by number of
rows and average row length. An `EXPLAIN` statement can increment this counter even though the query
isn't actually performed.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_temporary_table`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
refers to temporary tables that use the unsupported `MyISAM` or `memory` table
types.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_tx_isolation`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because query
uses an unsupported transaction isolation level. On reader DB instances, parallel query only applies to
the `REPEATABLE READ` and `READ COMMITTED` isolation levels.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_update_delete_stmts`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the query
is part of an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_unsupported_access`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the
`WHERE` clause doesn't meet the criteria for parallel query. This result can occur
if the query doesn't require a data-intensive scan, or if the query is a `DELETE` or
`UPDATE` statement.

`Aurora_pq_request_not_chosen_unsupported_storage_type`

The number of parallel query requests that use the nonparallel query processing path because the
Aurora MySQL DB cluster isn't using a supported Aurora cluster storage configuration. For more
