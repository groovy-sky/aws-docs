# Database engine updates for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL

Following, you can find information about Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL engine version releases and
updates. You can also find information about how to upgrade your Aurora PostgreSQL engine. For
more information about Aurora releases in general, see [Amazon Aurora versions](aurora-versionpolicy.md).

###### Tip

You can minimize the downtime required for a DB cluster upgrade by using a blue/green
deployment. For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora Blue/Green Deployments for database updates](blue-green-deployments.md).

## Identifying versions of Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL

Amazon Aurora includes certain features that are general to Aurora and available to all
Aurora DB clusters. Aurora includes other features that are specific to a particular
database engine that Aurora supports. These features are available only to those Aurora DB
clusters that use that database engine, such as Aurora PostgreSQL.

An Aurora database release typically has two version numbers, the database engine
version number and the Aurora version number. If an Aurora PostgreSQL release has an Aurora
version number, it's included after the engine version number in the [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL releases and engine versions](aurorapostgresql-updates-20180305.md) listing.

### Aurora version number

Aurora version numbers use the
`major`. `minor`. `patch`
naming scheme. An Aurora patch version includes important bug fixes added to a minor
version after its release. To learn more about Amazon Aurora major, minor, and patch
releases, see [Amazon Aurora major versions](aurora-versionpolicy-versioning.md#Aurora.VersionPolicy.MajorVersions), [Amazon Aurora minor versions](aurora-versionpolicy-versioning.md#Aurora.VersionPolicy.MinorVersions), and [Amazon Aurora patch versions](aurora-versionpolicy-versioning.md#Aurora.VersionPolicy.PatchVersions).

You can find out the Aurora version number of your Aurora PostgreSQL DB instance with
the following SQL query:

```sql

postgres=> SELECT aurora_version();
```

Starting with the release of PostgreSQL versions 13.3, 12.8, 11.13, 10.18, and for
all other later versions, Aurora version numbers align more closely to the PostgreSQL
engine version. For example, querying an Aurora PostgreSQL 13.3 DB cluster returns the
following:

```nohighlight

aurora_version
----------------
 13.3.1
(1 row)

```

Prior releases, such as Aurora PostgreSQL 10.14 DB cluster, return version numbers
similar to the following:

```nohighlight

aurora_version
----------------
 2.7.3
(1 row)
```

### PostgreSQL engine version numbers

Starting with PostgreSQL 10, PostgreSQL database engine versions use a
`major`. `minor` numbering
scheme for all releases. Some examples include PostgreSQL 10.18, PostgreSQL 12.7,
and PostgreSQL 13.3.

Releases prior to PostgreSQL 10 used a
`major`. `major`. `minor`
numbering scheme in which the first two digits make up the major version number and
a third digit denotes a minor version. For example, PostgreSQL 9.6 was a major
version, with minor versions 9.6.21 or 9.6.22 indicated by the third digit.

###### Note

The PostgreSQL engine version 9.6 is no longer supported. To upgrade, see
[Upgrading Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters](user-upgradedbinstance-postgresql.md). For version policies
and release timelines, see [How long Amazon Aurora major versions remain available](aurora-versionpolicy-versioning.md#Aurora.VersionPolicy.MajorVersionLifetime).

You can find out the PostgreSQL database engine version number with the following
SQL query:

```nohighlight

postgres=> SELECT version();

```

For an Aurora PostgreSQL 13.3 DB cluster, the results are as follows:

```nohighlight

version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostgreSQL 13.3 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc (GCC) 7.4.0, 64-bit
(1 row)

```
