# Using Aurora PostgreSQL as a Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock

You can use an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster as a Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock. For more information,
see [Create a vector store in Amazon Aurora](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-setup.md). A Knowledge Base automatically takes
unstructured text data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, converts it to text chunks and
vectors, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. With the generative AI applications, you
can use Agents for Amazon Bedrock to query the data stored in the Knowledge Base and use the results
of those queries to augment answers provided by foundational models. This workflow is called
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). For more information on RAG, see [Retrieval\
Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../../sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.md).

For detailed information about using Aurora PostgreSQL to build generative AI applications
using RAG, see this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/build-generative-ai-applications-with-amazon-aurora-and-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock).

## Preparing Aurora PostgreSQL to be used as a Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock

Follow the steps explained in the below sections to prepare Aurora PostgreSQL to be used
as a Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock.

### Creating and configuring Aurora PostgreSQL

To configure Amazon Bedrock with an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, you must first create an
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster and take note of the important fields for configuring it with
Amazon Bedrock. For more information about creating Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, see [Creating and connecting to an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](chap-gettingstartedaurora-creatingconnecting-aurorapostgresql.md).

- Enable Data API while creating Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. For more information
on the versions supported, see [Using the Amazon RDS Data API](data-api.md).

- Make sure to note down the Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of your
Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. You'll need it to configure the DB cluster for use with
Amazon Bedrock. For more information, see [Amazon\
Resource Names (ARNs)](user-tagging-arn.md).

### Connecting to a database and installing pgvector

You can connect to Aurora PostgreSQL using any of the connection utilities. For more
detailed information on these utilities, see [Connecting to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster](aurora-connecting.md#Aurora.Connecting.AuroraPostgreSQL). Alternatively, you can use
the RDS console query editor to run the queries. You need an Aurora DB cluster with
the RDS Data API enabled to use the query editor.

1. Log in to the database with your master user and set up pgvector. Use the
    following command if the extension is not installed:

```nohighlight

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

Use `pgvector` 0.5.0 and higher version that supports HNSW
    indexing. For more information, see [pgvector v0.5.0 with HNSW indexing](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/10/amazon-aurora-postgresql-pgvector-v0-5-0-hnsw-indexing).

2. Use the following command to check the version of the
    `pg_vector` installed:

```nohighlight

SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname='vector';
```

### Setting up database objects and privileges

1. Create a specific schema that Bedrock can use to query the data. Use the
    following command to create a schema:

```nohighlight

CREATE SCHEMA bedrock_integration;
```

2. Create a new role that Bedrock can use to query the database. Use the
    following command to create a new role:

```nohighlight

CREATE ROLE bedrock_user WITH PASSWORD 'password' LOGIN;
```

###### Note

Make a note of this password as you will need it later to create a
Secrets Manager password.

If you are using `psql` client, then use the following commands
    to create a new role:

```nohighlight

CREATE ROLE bedrock_user LOGIN;
\PASSWORD password;
```

3. Grant the `bedrock_user` permissions to manage the
    `bedrock_integration` schema. This will provide the ability
    to create tables or indexes within the schema.

```nohighlight

GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA bedrock_integration to bedrock_user;
```

4. Login as the `bedrock_user` and create a table in the
    `bedrock_integration schema`.

```nohighlight

CREATE TABLE bedrock_integration.bedrock_kb (id uuid PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(n), chunks text, metadata json, custom_metadata jsonb);
```

This command will create the `bedrock_kb` table in the
    `bedrock_integration` schema with Titan embeddings.

Replace n in the `vector(n)` data
    type with the appropriate dimension for the embedding model you are using.
    Use the recommendations below to help select your dimensions:

- For the Titan v2 model, use `vector(1024)`, or
`vector(512)`, or `vector (256)`. To learn
more, see [Amazon Titan Embeddings Text](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-embed-text.md).

- For the Titan v1.2 model, use `vector(1536)`. To learn
more, see [Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-embed-mm.md).

- For the Cohere Embed model, use `vector(1024)`. To
learn more, see [Cohere Embed models](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-embed.md).

- For the Cohere Embed Multilingual v3, use
`vector(1024)`.

The first four columns are mandatory. For metadata handling, Bedrock writes data from your metadata files to the `custom_metadata` column.
We recommend creating this column if you plan to use metadata and filtering. If you don't create a `custom_metadata` column, add individual columns for each metadata attribute in your table before you begin ingestion.
For more information, see [Configure and customize queries and response generation](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-test-config.md).

5. Follow these steps to create the required indexes that Bedrock uses to query your data:

- Create an index with the cosine operator which the
bedrock can use to query the data.

```nohighlight

CREATE INDEX ON bedrock_integration.bedrock_kb USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

- We recommend you to set the value of `ef_construction` to 256
for `pgvector` 0.6.0 and higher version that use parallel index
building.

```nohighlight

CREATE INDEX ON bedrock_integration.bedrock_kb USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (ef_construction=256);
```

- Create an index which Bedrock can use to query the text data.

```nohighlight

CREATE INDEX ON bedrock_integration.bedrock_kb USING gin (to_tsvector('simple', chunks));
```

- If you created a column for custom metadata, create an index which Bedrock can use to query the metadata.

```nohighlight

CREATE INDEX ON bedrock_integration.bedrock_kb USING gin (custom_metadata);
```

### Create a secret in Secrets Manager

Secrets Manager lets you store your Aurora credentials so that they can be
securely transmitted to applications. If you didn't choose the AWS secrets manager
option when creating Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, you can create a secret now. For more
information about creating AWS Secrets Manager database secret, see [AWS Secrets Manager database secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create-database-secret.md).

## Creating a Knowledge Base in the Bedrock console

While preparing Aurora PostgreSQL to be used as the vector store for a Knowledge Base, you
must gather the following details that you need to provide to Amazon Bedrock console.

- Amazon Aurora DB cluster ARN – The ARN of
your DB cluster.

- Secret ARN – The ARN of the AWS
Secrets Manager key for your DB cluster.

- Database name – The name of your
database. For example, you can use the default database
`postgres`.

- Table name – We recommend you to provide
a schema qualified name while creating the table using the command similar to
the following:

```nohighlight

CREATE TABLE bedrock_integration.bedrock_kb;
```

This command will create the `bedrock_kb` table in the
`bedrock_integration` schema.

- When creating the table, make sure to configure it with the specified columns
and data types. You can use your preferred column names instead of those listed
in the table. Remember to take a note of the names you chose for reference
during the Knowledge Base set up.

Column nameData typeDescriptionidUUID primary key

Contains unique identifiers for each
record.

chunksText

Contains the chunks of raw text from your data
sources.

embeddingVector

Contains the vector embeddings of the data
sources.

metadataJSON

Contains metadata required to carry out source
attribution and to enable data ingestion and
querying.

custom\_metadataJSONB

(Optional) Defines the target column where Amazon Bedrock writes metadata details from your data sources.

With these details, you can now create a Knowledge Base in the Bedrock console. For
more detailed information on setting up a vector index and creating a Knowledge Base
information, see [Create a vector store\
in Amazon Aurora](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-setup-rds.md) and [Create a vector store in\
Amazon Aurora](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.md).

After adding Aurora as your Knowledge Base, you can now ingest your data sources for
searching and querying. For more information, see [Ingest your data sources\
into the Knowledge Base](../../../bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-ingest.md).
