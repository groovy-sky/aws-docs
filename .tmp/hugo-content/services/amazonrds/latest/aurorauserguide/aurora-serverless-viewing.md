# Viewing Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters

###### Important

AWS has [announced the end-of-life date for Aurora Serverless v1: March 31st, 2025](https://repost.aws/questions/QUhcMVoChXRm2HLi8F-yih1g/announcement-support-for-aurora-s/announcement-support-for-aurora-serverless-v1-ending-soon). All Aurora Serverless v1 clusters that are
not migrated by March 31, 2025 will be migrated to Aurora Serverless v2 during the maintenance window. If the upgrade fails, Amazon Aurora converts the Serverless v1
cluster to a provisioned cluster with the equivalent engine version during the maintenance window. If applicable, Amazon Aurora will enroll the
converted provisioned cluster in Amazon RDS Extended Support. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Extended Support with Amazon Aurora](extended-support.md).

After you create one or more Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters, you can view which DB clusters are type
**Serverless** and which are type **Instance**. You can also view the
current number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) each Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster is using. Each ACU is a
combination of processing (CPU) and memory (RAM) capacity.

###### To view your Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you created the
    Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

    For each DB cluster, the DB cluster type is shown under **Role**. The Aurora Serverless v1
    DB clusters show **Serverless** for the type. You can view an Aurora Serverless v1 DB
    cluster's current capacity under **Size**.

4. Choose the name of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster to display its details.

    On the **Connectivity & security** tab, note the database endpoint. Use this endpoint
    to connect to your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster.

    Choose the **Configuration** tab to view the capacity settings.

    A _scaling event_ is generated when the DB cluster scales up, scales
    down, pauses, or resumes. Choose the **Logs & events** tab to see recent events. The
    following image shows examples of these events.

## Monitoring capacity and scaling events for your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster

You can view your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster in CloudWatch to monitor the capacity allocated to the DB cluster
with the `ServerlessDatabaseCapacity` metric. You can also monitor all of the standard Aurora CloudWatch
metrics, such as `CPUUtilization`, `DatabaseConnections`, `Queries`, and so
on.

You can have Aurora publish some or all database logs to CloudWatch. You select the logs to publish by enabling the
[configuration parameters such as general\_log\
and slow\_query\_log in the DB cluster parameter group](aurora-serverless-v1-how-it-works.md#aurora-serverless.parameter-groups) associated with
theAurora Serverless v1 cluster. Unlike provisioned clusters, Aurora Serverless v1 clusters don't require
you to specify in the DB cluster settings which log types to upload to CloudWatch. Aurora Serverless v1 clusters
automatically upload all the available logs. When you disable a log configuration parameter, publishing of
the log to CloudWatch stops. You can also delete the logs in CloudWatch if they are no longer needed.

To get started with Amazon CloudWatch for your Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster, see
[Viewing Aurora Serverless v1 logs with Amazon CloudWatch](aurora-serverless-v1-how-it-works.md#aurora-serverless.logging.monitoring).
To learn more about how to monitor Aurora DB clusters through CloudWatch, see
[Monitoring log events in Amazon CloudWatch](auroramysql-integrating-cloudwatch.md#AuroraMySQL.Integrating.CloudWatch.Monitor).

To connect to an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster, use the database endpoint. For more information, see
[Connecting to an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-connecting.md).

###### Note

You can't connect directly to specific DB instances in your Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters.
