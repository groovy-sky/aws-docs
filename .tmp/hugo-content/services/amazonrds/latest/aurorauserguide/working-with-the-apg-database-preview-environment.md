# Working with the database preview environment

The PostgreSQL community releases new major version of PostgreSQL annually. Similarly, Amazon Aurora makes PostgreSQL major versions available as Preview releases. This allows you
to create DB cluster using the Preview version and test out its features in the Database Preview Environment.

Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters in the Database Preview Environment are functionally similar to other Aurora PostgreSQL
DB clusters. However, you can't use a Preview version for production.

Keep in mind the following important limitations:

- All DB instances and DB clusters are deleted 60 days after you create them, along with any
backups and snapshots.

- You can only create a DB instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC) based on
the Amazon VPC service.

- You can't copy a snapshot of a DB instance to a production environment.

The following options are supported by the Preview.

- You can create DB instances using r5, r6g, r6i, r7g, r7i, r8g, x2g, t3 and t4g instance types only. For more
information about instance classes, see [Amazon AuroraDB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).

- You can use both single-AZ and multi-AZ deployments.

- You can use standard PostgreSQL dump and load functions to export databases
from or import databases to the Database Preview Environment.

## Supported DB instance class types

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL supports the following DB instance classes in the preview region:

###### Memory Optimized Classes

- db.r5 – memory-optimized instance classes

- db.r6g – memory-optimized instance classes powered by AWS Graviton2 processors

- db.r6i – memory-optimized instance classes

- db.r7g – memory-optimized instance classes powered by AWS Graviton3 processors

- db.r7i – memory-optimized instance classes

- db.r8g – memory-optimized instance classes powered by AWS Graviton4 processors

- db.x2g – memory-optimized instance classes powered by AWS Graviton2 processors

###### Note

For more information on the list of instance classes, see [DB instance class types](concepts-dbinstanceclass-types.md).

###### Burstable classes

- db.t3.medium

- db.t3.large

- db.t4g.medium

- db.t4g.large

## Creating a new DB cluster in the preview environment

Use the following procedure to create a DB cluster in the preview
environment.

###### To create a DB cluster in the preview environment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Dashboard** from the navigation
    pane.

3. In the Dashboard page, locate the **Database Preview Environment** section
    on the Dashboard page, as shown in the following image.

![Preview environment section with link displayed in RDS Console, Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/preview-environment-dashboard.png)

You can navigate directly to the [Database preview environment](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/rds-preview/home?region=us-east-2). Before you can proceed, you must acknowledge and
    accept the limitations.

![Preview environment limitations dialog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/preview-environment-console.png)

4. To create the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, follow the same process as that for creating any
    Aurora DB cluster. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-createinstance.md).

To create an instance in the Database Preview Environment using the Aurora API or the AWS CLI,
use the following endpoint.

```nohighlight

rds-preview.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

## PostgreSQL version 17 in the Database Preview environment

_**This is preview documentation for Aurora PostgreSQL version 17.**_
_**It is subject to change.**_

PostgreSQL version 17.0 is now available in the Amazon RDS Database Preview
environment. PostgreSQL version 17 contains several improvements that are
described in the following PostgreSQL documentation:

- [PostgreSQL 17 Released](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936)

For information on the Database Preview Environment, see [Working with the database preview environment](working-with-the-apg-database-preview-environment.md). To access the
Preview Environment from the console, select [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds-preview/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds-preview).
