# Understanding Babelfish architecture and configuration

You manage the Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition DB cluster running Babelfish much as you would any
Aurora DB cluster. That is, you benefit from the scalability, high-availability with failover
support, and built-in replication provided by an Aurora DB cluster. To learn more about these
capabilities, see [Managing performance and scaling for Aurora DB clusters](aurora-managing-performance.md), [High availability for Amazon Aurora](concepts-aurorahighavailability.md), and [Replication with Amazon Aurora](aurora-replication.md). You also have access
to many other AWS tools and utilities, including the following:

- Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability
service that provides you with data and actionable insights. For more information,
see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md).

- Performance Insights is a database performance tuning and monitoring
feature that helps you quickly assess the load on your database. To learn more,
see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon Aurora](user-perfinsights.md).

- Aurora global
databases span multiple AWS Regions, enabling low latency
global reads and providing fast recovery from the rare outage that might affect an entire AWS Region.
For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora Global Database](aurora-global-database.md).

- Automatic software patching keeps your database up-to-date with the latest security and
feature patches when they become available.

- Amazon RDS events notify you by email or SMS message of important database
events, such as an automated failover. For more information, see
[Monitoring Amazon Aurora events](working-with-events.md).

Following, you can learn about Babelfish architecture and how the SQL Server databases that you migrate are
handled by Babelfish. When you create your Babelfish DB cluster, you need to make some decisions
up front about single database or multiple databases, collations, and other details.
