# Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster

An Amazon Aurora DB cluster consists of a DB instance, compatible with either MySQL or
PostgreSQL, and a cluster volume that holds the data for the DB cluster, copied across
three Availability Zones as a single, virtual volume. By default, an Aurora DB cluster contains a primary
DB instance that performs reads and writes, and, optionally, up to 15 Aurora Replicas (reader DB instances). For more
information about Aurora DB clusters, see [Amazon Aurora DB clusters](aurora-overview.md).

Aurora has two main types of DB cluster:

- Aurora provisioned – You choose the DB instance class for the writer and reader instances based on your expected
workload. For more information, see [Amazon AuroraDB instance classes](concepts-dbinstanceclass.md).
Aurora provisioned has several options, including Aurora global databases. For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora Global Database](aurora-global-database.md).

- Aurora Serverless – Aurora Serverless v2 is an on-demand
automatic scaling configuration for Aurora. Capacity is adjusted automatically based
on application demand. You're charged only for the resources that your DB cluster
consumes. This automation is especially useful for environments with highly variable
and unpredictable workloads. For more information, see
[Using Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2.md).

Following, you can find out how to create an Aurora DB cluster. To get
started, first see [DB cluster prerequisites](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites).

For instructions on connecting to your Aurora DB cluster, see [Connecting to an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-connecting.md).

## DB cluster prerequisites

###### Important

Before you can create an Aurora DB cluster, you must complete the tasks in [Setting up your environment for Amazon Aurora](chap-settingup-aurora.md).

The following are prerequisites to complete before creating a DB cluster.

###### Topics

- [Configure the network for the DB cluster](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites.VPC)

- [Additional prerequisites](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites.Additional)

### Configure the network for the DB cluster

You can create an Amazon Aurora DB cluster only in a virtual private cloud (VPC) based
on the Amazon VPC service, in an AWS Region that has at least two Availability
Zones. The DB subnet group that you choose for the DB cluster must cover at least
two Availability Zones. This configuration ensures that your DB cluster always has
at least one DB instance available for failover, in the unlikely event of an
Availability Zone failure.

If you plan to set up connectivity between your new DB cluster and an EC2 instance in the same
VPC, you can do so during DB cluster creation. If you plan to connect to your DB cluster
from resources other than EC2 instances in the same VPC, you can configure the network
connections manually.

###### Topics

- [Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic)

- [Configure the network manually](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Manual)

#### Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance

When you create an Aurora DB cluster, you can use the AWS Management Console to set up connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance
and the new DB cluster. When you do so, RDS configures your VPC and network settings automatically. The DB cluster is
created in the same VPC as the EC2 instance so that the EC2 instance can access the DB cluster.

The following are requirements for connecting an EC2 instance with the DB cluster:

- The EC2 instance must exist in the AWS Region before you create the DB cluster.

If no EC2 instances exist in the AWS Region, the console provides a link to create one.

- Currently, the DB cluster can't be an Aurora Serverless DB cluster or part of an Aurora global database.

- The user who is creating the DB instance must have permissions to perform the following operations:

- `ec2:AssociateRouteTable`

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`

- `ec2:CreateRouteTable`

- `ec2:CreateSubnet`

- `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`

- `ec2:DescribeInstances`

- `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`

- `ec2:DescribeRouteTables`

- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`

- `ec2:DescribeSubnets`

- `ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute`

- `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress`

Using this option creates a private DB cluster. The DB cluster uses a DB subnet group with only
private subnets to restrict access to resources within the VPC.

To connect an EC2 instance to the DB cluster, choose **Connect to an EC2 compute resource**
in the **Connectivity** section on the **Create database** page.

![Connect an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/ec2-set-up-connection-create.png)

When you choose **Connect to an EC2 compute resource**, RDS sets the following options automatically.
You can't change these settings unless you choose not to set up connectivity with an EC2 instance by choosing **Don't connect**
**to an EC2 compute resource**.

Console optionAutomatic setting

**Network type**

RDS sets network type to **IPv4**. Currently, dual-stack mode isn't supported
when you set up a connection between an EC2 instance and the DB cluster.

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

RDS sets the VPC to the one associated with the EC2 instance.

**DB subnet group**

RDS requires a DB subnet group with a private subnet in the
same Availability Zone as the EC2 instance. If a DB subnet group
that meets this requirement exists, then RDS uses the existing
DB subnet group. By default, this option is set to
**Automatic setup**.

When you choose
**Automatic setup** and there is no DB
subnet group that meets this requirement, the following
action happens. RDS uses three available private subnets in
three Availability Zones where one of the Availability Zones
is the same as the EC2 instance. If a private subnet isn’t
available in an Availability Zone, RDS creates a private
subnet in the Availability Zone. Then RDS creates the DB
subnet group.

When a private subnet is
available, RDS uses the route table associated with the
subnet and adds any subnets it creates to this route table.
When no private subnet is available, RDS creates a route
table without internet gateway access and adds the subnets
it creates to the route table.

RDS also allows
you to use existing DB subnet groups. Select
**Choose existing** if you want to use
an existing DB subnet group of your choice.

**Public access**

RDS chooses **No** so that the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible.

For security, it is a best practice to keep the database private and make sure it isn't
accessible from the internet.

**VPC security group (firewall)**

RDS creates a new security group that is associated with the DB cluster. The security group is named
`rds-ec2-n`, where `n`
is a number. This security group includes an inbound rule with the EC2 VPC security group (firewall)
as the source. This security group that is associated with the DB cluster allows the EC2 instance to
access the DB cluster.

RDS also creates a new security group that is associated with the EC2 instance. The security group is named
`ec2-rds-n`, where `n` is a number.
This security group includes an outbound rule with the VPC security group of the DB cluster as the source.
This security group allows the EC2 instance to send traffic to the DB cluster.

You can add another new security group by choosing **Create new** and
typing the name of the new security group.

You can add existing security groups by choosing **Choose existing** and
selecting security groups to add.

**Availability Zone**

When you don't create an Aurora Replica in **Availability**
**& durability** during DB cluster creation (Single-AZ deployment),
RDS chooses the Availability Zone of the EC2 instance.

When you create an Aurora Replica during DB cluster creation (Multi-AZ deployment),
RDS chooses the Availability Zone of the EC2 instance for one DB instance in the DB
cluster. RDS randomly chooses a different Availability Zone for the other DB
instance in the DB cluster. Either the primary DB instance or the Aurora Replica
is created in the same Availability Zone as the EC2 instance. There is the possibility
of cross Availability Zone costs if the primary DB instance and EC2 instance are in
different Availability Zones.

For more information about these settings, see [Settings for Aurora DB clusters](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Settings).

If you make any changes to these settings after the DB cluster is created, the changes might affect the connection
between the EC2 instance and the DB cluster.

#### Configure the network manually

If you plan to connect to your DB cluster from resources other than EC2 instances in the same VPC,
you can configure the network connections manually. If you use the AWS Management Console
to create your DB cluster, you can have Amazon RDS automatically create a VPC for you.
Or you can use an existing VPC or create a new VPC for your Aurora DB cluster. Whichever
approach you take, your VPC must have at least one subnet in each of at least two Availability
Zones for you to use it with an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

By default, Amazon RDS creates the primary DB instance and the Aurora Replica in the Availability Zones
automatically for you. To choose a specific Availability Zone, you need to change the
**Availability & durability** Multi-AZ deployment setting
to **Don't create an Aurora Replica**. Doing so exposes an
**Availability Zone** setting that lets you choose from among the Availability Zones
in your VPC. However, we strongly recommend that you keep the default setting and let Amazon RDS create a Multi-AZ
deployment and choose Availability Zones for you. By doing so, your Aurora DB cluster is created
with the fast failover and high availability features that are two of Aurora's key benefits.

If you don't have a default VPC or you haven't created a VPC, you can
have Amazon RDS automatically create a VPC for you when you create a DB cluster
using the console. Otherwise, you must do the following:

- Create a VPC with at least one subnet in each of at least two of the
Availability Zones in the AWS Region where you want to deploy your DB
cluster. For more information, see [Working with a DB cluster in a VPC](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md#Overview.RDSVPC.Create) and [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB cluster (IPv4 only)](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createvpc.md).

- Specify a VPC security group that authorizes connections to your DB
cluster. For more information, see [Provide access to the DB cluster in the VPC by creating a security group](chap-settingup-aurora.md#CHAP_SettingUp_Aurora.SecurityGroup) and
[Controlling access with security groups](overview-rdssecuritygroups.md).

- Specify an RDS DB subnet group that defines at least two subnets in the
VPC that can be used by the DB cluster. For more information, see
[Working with DB subnet groups](user-vpc-workingwithrdsinstanceinavpc.md#USER_VPC.Subnets).

For information on VPCs, see [Amazon VPC and Amazon Aurora](user-vpc.md). For a tutorial
that configures the network for a private DB cluster, see [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB cluster (IPv4 only)](chap-tutorials-webserverdb-createvpc.md).

If you want to connect to a resource that isn't in the same VPC as the Aurora DB cluster, see the appropriate
scenarios in [Scenarios for accessing a DB cluster in a VPC](user-vpc-scenarios.md).

### Additional prerequisites

Before you create your DB cluster, consider the following additional prerequisites:

- If you are connecting to AWS using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials, your AWS account must have
IAM policies that grant the permissions required to perform Amazon RDS operations. For more information,
see [Identity and access management for Amazon Aurora](usingwithrds-iam.md).

If you are using IAM to access the Amazon RDS console, you must first sign on to the AWS Management Console with
your user credentials. Then go to the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

- If you want to tailor the configuration parameters for your DB cluster,
you must specify a DB cluster parameter group and DB parameter group with
the required parameter settings. For information about creating or modifying
a DB cluster parameter group or DB parameter group, see [Parameter groups for Amazon Aurora](user-workingwithparamgroups.md).

- Determine the TCP/IP port number to specify for your DB cluster.
The firewalls at some companies block connections to the default ports (3306 for
MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL) for Aurora. If your company firewall blocks the default
port, choose another port for your DB cluster. All instances in a DB cluster use the
same port.

- If the major engine version for your database has reached the RDS end of
standard support date, you must use the Extended Support CLI option or the RDS API
parameter. For more information, see RDS Extended Support in [Settings for Aurora DB clusters](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Settings).

## Creating a DB cluster

You can create an Aurora DB cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.

You can create a DB cluster using the AWS Management Console with **Easy create** enabled or not enabled. With
**Easy create** enabled, you specify only the DB engine type, DB instance size, and DB instance
identifier. **Easy create** uses the default setting for other configuration options. With
**Easy create** not enabled, you specify more configuration options when you create a database,
including ones for availability, security, backups, and maintenance.

###### Note

For this example, **Standard create** is enabled, and **Easy create** isn't
enabled. For information about creating a DB cluster with **Easy create** enabled, see [Getting started with Amazon Aurora](chap-gettingstartedaurora.md).

###### To create an Aurora DB cluster using the console

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you
     want to create the DB cluster.

    Aurora is not available in all AWS Regions. For a list of AWS Regions where Aurora is available, see [Region availability](concepts-regionsandavailabilityzones.md#Aurora.Overview.Availability).

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

04. Choose **Create database**.

05. For **Choose a database creation method**, choose **Standard create**.

06. For **Engine type**, choose one of the following:

- **Aurora (MySQL Compatible)**

- **Aurora (PostgreSQL Compatible)**

![Aurora MySQL engine selection interface showing version options and compatibility settings for database creation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-engine-options-mysql.png)

07. Choose the **Engine version**.

    For more information, see [Amazon Aurora versions](aurora-versionpolicy.md). You can
     use the filters to choose versions that are compatible with features that you want, such as Aurora Serverless v2.
     For more information, see [Using Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2.md).

08. In **Templates**, choose the template that matches your use case.

09. To enter your master password, do the following:

    1. In the **Settings** section, expand **Credential Settings**.

    2. Clear the **Auto generate a password** check box.

    3. (Optional) Change the **Master username** value and enter the same password
        in **Master password** and **Confirm**
       **password**.

By default, the new DB instance uses an automatically generated password for the master user.

10. In the **Connectivity** section under **VPC security group (firewall)**, if you select **Create new**,
     a VPC security group is created with an inbound rule that allows your local computer's IP address to access the database.

11. For **Cluster storage configuration**, choose either **Aurora I/O-Optimized** or
     **Aurora Standard**. For more information, see [Storage configurations for Amazon Aurora DB clusters](aurora-overview-storagereliability.md#aurora-storage-type).

    ![Cluster storage configuration showing Aurora I/O-Optimized.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/cluster-storage-configuration-create.png)

12. (Optional) Set up a connection to a compute resource for this DB cluster.

    You can configure connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance and the new DB cluster during
     DB cluster creation. For more information, see [Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic).

13. For the remaining sections, specify your DB cluster settings.
     For information about each setting, see
     [Settings for Aurora DB clusters](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Settings).

14. Choose **Create database**.

    If you chose to use an automatically generated password, the **View credential details** button appears
     on the **Databases** page.

    To view the master user name and password for the DB cluster, choose **View credential details**.

    To connect to the DB instance as the master user, use the user name and
     password that appear.

    ###### Important

    You can't view the master user password again. If you don't
    record it, you might have to change it. If you need to change the
    master user password after the DB instance is available, you can
    modify the DB instance to do so. For more information about
    modifying a DB instance, see [Modifying an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-modifying.md).

15. For **Databases**, choose the name of the new Aurora DB
     cluster.

    On the RDS console, the details for new DB cluster appear.
     The DB cluster and its DB instance have a status of **creating**
     until the DB cluster is ready to use.

    ![Summary during DB cluster creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/creating-status-aurora-mysql.png)

    When the state changes to **available** for both, you can connect to the DB cluster.
     Depending on the DB instance class and the amount of storage, it can take up to 20 minutes before
     the new DB cluster is available.

    To view the newly created cluster, choose **Databases** from
     the navigation pane in the Amazon RDS console. Then choose the DB cluster to
     show the DB cluster details. For more information, see [Viewing an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](accessing-monitoring.md#Aurora.Viewing).

    ![Amazon Aurora DB Instances List](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/AuroraLaunch04.png)

    On the **Connectivity & security** tab, note the port and the endpoint of the writer DB instance.
     Use the endpoint and port of the cluster in your JDBC and ODBC connection strings for any application
     that performs write or read operations.

###### Note

Before you can create an Aurora DB cluster using the AWS CLI, you must fulfill the
required prerequisites, such as creating a VPC and an RDS DB subnet group. For more
information, see [DB cluster prerequisites](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites).

You can use the AWS CLI to create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster or an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

###### To create an Aurora MySQL DB cluster using the AWS CLI

When you create an Aurora MySQL 8.0-compatible or 5.7-compatible DB cluster or DB instance, you specify
`aurora-mysql` for the `--engine` option.

Complete the following steps:

1. Identify the DB subnet group and VPC security group ID for your new DB
    cluster, and then call the [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md)
    AWS CLI command to create the Aurora MySQL DB cluster.

For example, the following command creates a new MySQL 8.0–compatible DB cluster named
    `sample-cluster`. The cluster uses the default engine version and the Aurora I/O-Optimized storage
    type.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster \
       --engine aurora-mysql --engine-version 8.0 \
       --storage-type aurora-iopt1 \
       --master-username user-name --manage-master-user-password \
       --db-subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup --vpc-security-group-ids sg-c7e5b0d2
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster ^
       --engine aurora-mysql --engine-version 8.0 ^
       --storage-type aurora-iopt1 ^
       --master-username user-name --manage-master-user-password ^
       --db-subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup --vpc-security-group-ids sg-c7e5b0d2
```

The following command creates a new MySQL 5.7–compatible DB cluster named `sample-cluster`. The
    cluster uses the default engine version and the Aurora Standard storage type.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster  \
       --engine aurora-mysql --engine-version 5.7 \
       --storage-type aurora \
       --master-username user-name --manage-master-user-password \
       --db-subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup --vpc-security-group-ids sg-c7e5b0d2
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster sample-cluster  ^
       --engine aurora-mysql --engine-version 5.7 ^
       --storage-type aurora ^
       --master-username user-name --manage-master-user-password ^
       --db-subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup --vpc-security-group-ids sg-c7e5b0d2
```

2. If you use the console to create a DB cluster, then Amazon RDS automatically
    creates the primary instance (writer) for your DB cluster. If you use
    the AWS CLI to create a DB cluster, you must explicitly create the primary
    instance for your DB cluster. The primary instance is the first instance
    that is created in a DB cluster. Until you create the primary DB
    instance, the DB cluster endpoints remain in the `Creating`
    status.

Call the [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) AWS CLI command to create the primary instance for
    your DB cluster. Include the name of the DB cluster as the
    `--db-cluster-identifier` option value.

###### Note

You can't set the `--storage-type` option for DB instances. You can set it only for DB
clusters.

For example, the following command creates a new MySQL 5.7–compatible or
    MySQL 8.0–compatible DB instance named `sample-instance`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance \
        --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-mysql --db-instance-class db.r5.large
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance ^
        --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-mysql --db-instance-class db.r5.large
```

###### To create an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster using the AWS CLI

1. Identify the DB subnet group and VPC security group ID for your new DB
    cluster, and then call the [create-db-cluster](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.md)
    AWS CLI command to create the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.

For example, the following command creates a new DB cluster named `sample-cluster`. The cluster uses the
    default engine version and the Aurora I/O-Optimized storage type.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster \
       --engine aurora-postgresql \
       --storage-type aurora-iopt1 \
       --master-username user-name --manage-master-user-password \
       --db-subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup --vpc-security-group-ids sg-c7e5b0d2
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster ^
       --engine aurora-postgresql ^
       --storage-type aurora-iopt1 ^
       --master-username user-name --manage-master-user-password ^
       --db-subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup --vpc-security-group-ids sg-c7e5b0d2
```

2. If you use the console to create a DB cluster, then Amazon RDS automatically
    creates the primary instance (writer) for your DB cluster. If you use
    the AWS CLI to create a DB cluster, you must explicitly create the primary
    instance for your DB cluster. The primary instance is the first instance
    that is created in a DB cluster. Until you create the primary DB
    instance, the DB cluster endpoints remain in the `Creating`
    status.

Call the [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) AWS CLI command to create the primary instance for
    your DB cluster. Include the name of the DB cluster as the
    `--db-cluster-identifier` option value.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance \
        --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-postgresql --db-instance-class db.r5.large
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier sample-instance ^
        --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster --engine aurora-postgresql --db-instance-class db.r5.large
```

These examples specify the `--manage-master-user-password` option
to generate the master user password and manage it in Secrets Manager. For more
information, see [Password management with Amazon Aurora and AWS Secrets Manager](rds-secrets-manager.md). Alternatively, you can use the
`--master-password` option to specify and manage the password
yourself.

###### Note

Before you can create an Aurora DB cluster using the AWS CLI, you must fulfill the
required prerequisites, such as creating a VPC and an RDS DB subnet group. For more
information, see [DB cluster prerequisites](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites).

Identify the DB subnet group and VPC security group ID for your new DB
cluster, and then call the [CreateDBCluster](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbcluster.md) operation to
create the DB cluster.

When you create an Aurora MySQL version 2 or 3 DB cluster or DB instance, specify `aurora-mysql` for the
`Engine` parameter.

When you create an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster or DB instance, specify `aurora-postgresql` for the
`Engine` parameter.

If you use the console to create a DB cluster, then Amazon RDS automatically creates the
primary instance (writer) for your DB cluster. If you use the RDS API to create a DB
cluster, you must explicitly create the primary instance for your DB cluster using the
[CreateDBInstance](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md). The
primary instance is the first instance that is created in a DB cluster. Until you create
the primary DB instance, the DB cluster endpoints remain in the `Creating`
status.

### Creating a primary (writer) DB instance

If you use the AWS Management Console to create a DB cluster, then Amazon RDS automatically creates the primary instance (writer) for your DB
cluster. If you use the AWS CLI or RDS API to create a DB cluster, you must explicitly create the primary instance for your DB
cluster. The primary instance is the first instance that is created in a DB cluster. Until you create the primary DB
instance, the DB cluster endpoints remain in the `Creating` status.

For more information, see [Creating a DB cluster](#Aurora.CreateInstance.Creating).

###### Note

If you have a DB cluster without a writer DB instance, also called a _headless_ cluster, you can't
use the console to create a writer instance. You must use the AWS CLI or RDS API.

The following example uses the [create-db-instance](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) AWS CLI
command to create a writer instance for an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster named `headless-test`.

```nohighlight

aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier no-longer-headless \
    --db-cluster-identifier headless-test \
    --engine aurora-postgresql \
    --db-instance-class db.t4g.medium
```

## Settings for Aurora DB clusters

The following table contains details about settings that you choose when you create an Aurora DB cluster.

Console settingSetting descriptionCLI option and RDS API parameter

**Auto minor version upgrade**

Choose **Enable auto minor version upgrade** if you want to enable your Aurora
DB cluster to receive preferred minor version upgrades to the DB engine automatically when they
become available.

The **Auto minor version upgrade** setting applies to both
Aurora PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

For more information about engine updates for Aurora PostgreSQL, see
[Database engine updates for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](aurorapostgresql-updates.md).

For more information about engine updates for Aurora MySQL, see
[Database engine updates for Amazon Aurora MySQL](auroramysql-updates.md).

Set this value for every DB instance in your Aurora cluster. If any DB instance in your cluster
has this setting turned off, the cluster isn't automatically upgraded.

Using the AWS CLI, run [`create-db-instance`](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.md) and set the `--auto-minor-version-upgrade|--no-auto-minor-version-upgrade`
option.

Using the RDS API, call [`CreateDBInstance`](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-createdbinstance.md) and set the `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade` parameter.

**AWS KMS key**

Only available if **Encryption** is
set to **Enable encryption**. Choose the AWS KMS key
to use for encrypting this DB cluster. For more information, see
[Encrypting Amazon Aurora resources](overview-encryption.md).
