# Monitoring backtracking for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster

You can view backtracking information and monitor backtracking metrics for a DB
cluster.

###### To view backtracking information and monitor backtracking metrics using the console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. Choose **Databases**.

3. Choose the DB cluster name to open information about it.

The backtrack information is in the **Backtrack** section.

When backtracking is enabled, the following information is available:

- **Target window** – The current amount
of time specified for the target backtrack window. The
target is the maximum amount of time that you can
backtrack if there is sufficient storage.

- **Actual window** – The actual amount of time you can backtrack,
which can be smaller than the target backtrack window. The actual backtrack window is based on
your workload and the storage available for retaining backtrack change records.

- **Earliest backtrack time** – The
earliest possible backtrack time for the DB cluster. You can't
backtrack the DB cluster to a time before the displayed
time.

4. Do the following to view backtracking metrics for the DB
    cluster:
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

2. Choose the name of the primary instance for the DB cluster to
       display its details.

3. In the **CloudWatch** section, type `Backtrack` into the **CloudWatch** box to
       show only the Backtrack metrics.

      The following metrics are displayed:

- **Backtrack Change Records Creation Rate**
**(Count)** – This metric shows the
number of backtrack change records created over five
minutes for your DB cluster. You can use this metric
to estimate the backtrack cost for your target
backtrack window.

- **\[Billed\] Backtrack Change Records Stored**
**(Count)** – This metric shows the
actual number of backtrack change records used by
your DB cluster.

- **Backtrack Window Actual (Minutes)** –
This metric shows whether there is a difference between the target backtrack window and the
actual backtrack window. For example, if your target backtrack window is 2 hours (120 minutes),
and this metric shows that the actual backtrack window is 100 minutes, then the actual backtrack
window is smaller than the target.

- **Backtrack Window Alert (Count)** –
This metric shows how often the actual backtrack window is smaller than the target backtrack
window for a given period of time.

###### Note

The following metrics might lag behind the current time:

- **Backtrack Change Records Creation Rate (Count)**

- **\[Billed\] Backtrack Change Records Stored (Count)**

The following procedure describes how to view backtrack information for a DB
cluster using the AWS CLI.

###### To view backtrack information for a DB cluster using the AWS CLI

- Call the [describe-db-clusters](../../../cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.md) AWS CLI command and supply
the following values:

- `--db-cluster-identifier` – The name of the
DB cluster.

The following example lists backtrack information for
`sample-cluster`.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-clusters \
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster

```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws rds describe-db-clusters ^
    --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster

```

To view backtrack information for a DB cluster using the Amazon RDS API, use the
[DescribeDBClusters](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbclusters.md) operation.
This operation returns backtrack information for the DB cluster specified in
the `DBClusterIdentifier` value.
