# Reading log file contents using REST

Amazon RDS provides a REST endpoint that allows access to DB instance log files. This is useful if you need to write
an application to stream Amazon RDS log file contents.

The syntax is:

```nohighlight

GET /v13/downloadCompleteLogFile/DBInstanceIdentifier/LogFileName HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json
host: rds.region.amazonaws.com
```

The following parameters are required:

- `DBInstanceIdentifier`—the name of the DB instance that
contains the log file you want to download.

- `LogFileName`—the name of the log file to be
downloaded.

The response contains the contents of the requested log file, as a stream.

The following example downloads the log file named _log/ERROR.6_ for the DB instance named
_sample-sql_ in the _us-west-2_ region.

```nohighlight

GET /v13/downloadCompleteLogFile/sample-sql/log/ERROR.6 HTTP/1.1
host: rds.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

```

If you specify a nonexistent DB instance, the response consists of the following error:

- `DBInstanceNotFound`— `DBInstanceIdentifier` does
not refer to an existing DB instance. (HTTP status code: 404)
