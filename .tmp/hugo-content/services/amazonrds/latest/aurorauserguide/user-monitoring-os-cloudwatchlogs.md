# Viewing OS metrics using CloudWatch Logs

After you have enabled Enhanced Monitoring for your DB cluster, you can view the metrics for it
using CloudWatch Logs, with each log stream representing a single DB instance or DB cluster being monitored. The log stream identifier is the
resource identifier ( `DbiResourceId`) for the DB instance or DB cluster.

###### To view Enhanced Monitoring log data

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. If necessary, choose the AWS Region that your DB cluster is in. For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/index-rande.md) in the
    _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

3. Choose **Logs** in the navigation pane.

4. Choose **RDSOSMetrics** from the list of log groups.

5. Choose the log stream that you want to view from the list of log streams.
