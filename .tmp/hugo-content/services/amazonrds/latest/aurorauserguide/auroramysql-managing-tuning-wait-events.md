# Tuning Aurora MySQL with wait events

The following table summarizes the Aurora MySQL wait events that most commonly indicate performance problems. The
following wait events are a subset of the list in [Aurora MySQL wait events](auroramysql-reference-waitevents.md).

Wait eventDescription

[cpu](ams-waits-cpu.md)

This event occurs when a thread is active in CPU or is waiting for CPU.

[io/aurora\_redo\_log\_flush](ams-waits-io-auredologflush.md)

This event occurs when a session is writing persistent data to Aurora storage.

[io/aurora\_respond\_to\_client](ams-waits-respond-to-client.md)

This event occurs when a thread is waiting to return a result set to a client.

[io/redo\_log\_flush](ams-waits-io-redologflush.md)

This event occurs when a session is writing persistent data to Aurora storage.

[io/socket/sql/client\_connection](ams-waits-client-connection.md)

This event occurs when a thread is in the process of handling a new connection.

[io/table/sql/handler](ams-waits-waitio.md)

This event occurs when work has been delegated to a storage engine.

[synch/cond/innodb/row\_lock\_wait](ams-waits-row-lock-wait.md)

This event occurs when one session has locked a row for an update, and another session tries to update the
same row.

[synch/cond/innodb/row\_lock\_wait\_cond](ams-waits-row-lock-wait-cond.md)

This event occurs when one session has locked a row for an update, and another session tries to update the
same row.

[synch/cond/sql/MDL\_context::COND\_wait\_status](ams-waits-cond-wait-status.md)

This event occurs when there are threads waiting on a table metadata lock.

[synch/mutex/innodb/aurora\_lock\_thread\_slot\_futex](ams-waits-waitsynch.md)

This event occurs when one session has locked a row for an update, and another session tries to update the
same row.

[synch/mutex/innodb/buf\_pool\_mutex](ams-waits-bufpoolmutex.md)

This event occurs when a thread has acquired a lock on the InnoDB buffer pool to access a page in
memory.

[synch/mutex/innodb/fil\_system\_mutex](ams-waits-innodb-fil-system-mutex.md)

This event occurs when a session is waiting to access the tablespace memory cache.

[synch/mutex/innodb/trx\_sys\_mutex](ams-waits-trxsysmutex.md)

This event occurs when there is high database activity with a large number of transactions.

[synch/sxlock/innodb/hash\_table\_locks](ams-waits-sx-lock-hash-table-locks.md)

This event occurs when pages not found in the buffer pool must be read from a file.

[synch/mutex/innodb/temp\_pool\_manager\_mutex](ams-waits-io-temppoolmanager.md)

This event occurs when a session is waiting to acquire a mutex for managing the pool of session temporary tablespaces.
