# Update the primary contact for your AWS account

You can update the primary contact information associated with your account, including
your contact's full name, company name, mailing address, telephone number, and website
address.

You edit the primary account contact differently, depending
on whether or not the accounts are standalone, or part of an organization:

- **Standalone AWS accounts** – For
AWS accounts not associated with an organization, you can update your own primary
account contact using the AWS Management Console, or via AWS CLI & SDKs. To
learn how to do this, see [Update standalone AWS account primary contact](#manage-acct-update-contact-primary-edit).

- **AWS accounts within an organization** –
For member accounts that are part of an AWS organization, a user in the management
account or delegated admin account can centrally update any member account in the
organization from the AWS Organizations console, or programmatically via the AWS CLI &
SDKs. To learn how to do this, see [Update AWS account primary\
contact in your organization](#manage-acct-update-contact-primary-orgs).

## Phone number and email address requirements

Before you proceed with updating your account's primary contact information, we
recommend that you first review the following requirements when entering phone numbers
and email addresses.

- Phone numbers should only contain numbers.

- Phone numbers must start with a `+` and country code and must not
have any leading zeros or additional spaces after the country code. For example,
`+1` (US/Canada) or `+44` (UK).

- Phone numbers must not include whitespaces between
the area code, exchange code, and local code. For example, +12025550179.

- For security purposes, phone numbers must be capable of receiving SMS from
AWS. Toll free numbers will not be accepted since most don't support
SMS.

- For business AWS accounts, it's a best practice to enter a company phone
number and email address rather than one belonging to an individual. Configuring
the accounts [root user](root-user.md) with an individual's
email address or phone number can make your account difficult to recover if that
individual leaves the company.

## Update the primary contact for a standalone AWS account or management account

To edit your primary contact details for a standalone AWS account, perform the steps
in the following procedure. The AWS Management Console procedure below always works
_only_ in the standalone context. You can use the AWS Management Console to
access or change only the primary contact information of the account you used to call
the operation.

AWS Management Console

###### To edit your primary contact for a standalone AWS account

###### Minimum permissions

To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM permissions:

- `account:GetContactInformation` (to see the
primary contact details)

- `account:PutContactInformation` (to update
the primary contact details)

1. Sign in to
    the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) as an IAM user or role that has the minimum
    permissions.

2. Choose your account name on the top right of the window, and
    then choose **Account**.

3. Scroll down to the section **Contact**
**information**, and next to it choose
    **Edit**.

4. Change the values in any of the available fields.

5. After you have made all of your changes, choose
    **Update**.

AWS CLI & SDKs

You can retrieve, update, or delete the **_primary_** contact
information by using the following AWS CLI commands or their AWS SDK
equivalent operations:

- [GetContactInformation](api-getcontactinformation.md)

- [PutContactInformation](api-putcontactinformation.md)

###### Notes

- To perform these operations from the management account or
a delegated admin account in an organization against member
accounts, you must [enable trusted access for the Account\
service](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-account.md#integrate-enable-ta-account).

###### Minimum permissions

For each operation, you must have the permission that maps to that
operation:

- `account:GetContactInformation`

- `account:PutContactInformation`

If you use these individual permissions, you can grant some users
the ability to only read the contact information, and grant others
the ability to both read and write.

###### Example

The following example retrieves the current primary contact
information for the caller's account.

```nohighlight

$ aws account get-contact-information
{
    "ContactInformation": {
        "AddressLine1": "123 Any Street",
        "City": "Seattle",
        "CompanyName": "Example Corp, Inc.",
        "CountryCode": "US",
        "DistrictOrCounty": "King",
        "FullName": "Saanvi Sarkar",
        "PhoneNumber": "+15555550100",
        "PostalCode": "98101",
        "StateOrRegion": "WA",
        "WebsiteUrl": "https://www.examplecorp.com"
    }
}
```

###### Example

The following example sets new primary contact information for the
caller's account.

```nohighlight

$ aws account put-contact-information --contact-information \
'{"AddressLine1": "123 Any Street", "City": "Seattle", "CompanyName": "Example Corp, Inc.", "CountryCode": "US", "DistrictOrCounty": "King",
"FullName": "Saanvi Sarkar", "PhoneNumber": "+15555550100", "PostalCode": "98101", "StateOrRegion": "WA", "WebsiteUrl": "https://www.examplecorp.com"}'
```

This command produces no output if it's successful.

## Update the primary contact for any AWS member account in your organization

To edit your primary contact details in any AWS member account in your organization,
perform the steps in the following procedure.

### Additional requirements

To update primary contact with the AWS Organizations console, you need to do some
preliminary settings:

- Your organization must enable _all features_ to manage settings on your
member accounts. This allows admin control over the member accounts. This is
set by default when you create your organization. If your organization is
set to _consolidated billing_ only, and you want to enable all features, see
[Enabling all features for an organization](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-org-support-all-features.md).

- You need to enable trusted access for the AWS Account Management service. To set this
up, see [Enable trusted access for AWS Account Management](using-orgs-trusted-access.md).

AWS Management Console

###### To edit your primary contact for any AWS account in your organization

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2) with the
    organization's management account credentials.

2. From **AWS accounts**,
    select the account that you want to update.

3. Choose **Contact info**, and
    locate **Primary**
**contact**,

4. Select **Edit**.

5. Change the values in any of the available fields.

6. After you have made all of your changes, choose
    **Update**.

AWS CLI & SDKs

You can retrieve, update, or delete the **_primary_**
contact information by using the following AWS CLI commands or their
AWS SDK equivalent operations:

- [GetContactInformation](api-getcontactinformation.md)

- [PutContactInformation](api-putcontactinformation.md)

###### Notes

- To perform these operations from the management
account or a delegated admin account in an organization
against member accounts, you must [enable trusted access for the Account\
service](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-account.md#integrate-enable-ta-account).

- You can't access an account in a different
organization from the one you're using to call the
operation.

###### Minimum permissions

For each operation, you must have the permission that maps to
that operation:

- `account:GetContactInformation`

- `account:PutContactInformation`

If you use these individual permissions, you can grant some
users the ability to only read the contact information, and
grant others the ability to both read and write.

###### Example

The following example retrieves the current primary contact
information for the specified member account in an organization.
The credentials used must be from either the organization's
management account, or from the Account Management's delegated
admin account.

```nohighlight

$ aws account get-contact-information --account-id 123456789012
{
    "ContactInformation": {
        "AddressLine1": "123 Any Street",
        "City": "Seattle",
        "CompanyName": "Example Corp, Inc.",
        "CountryCode": "US",
        "DistrictOrCounty": "King",
        "FullName": "Saanvi Sarkar",
        "PhoneNumber": "+15555550100",
        "PostalCode": "98101",
        "StateOrRegion": "WA",
        "WebsiteUrl": "https://www.examplecorp.com"
    }
}
```

###### Example

the specified member account in an organization. The credentials
used must be from either the organization's management account,
or from the Account Management's delegated admin account.

```nohighlight

$ aws account put-contact-information --account-id 123456789012 \
--contact-information '{"AddressLine1": "123 Any Street", "City": "Seattle", "CompanyName": "Example Corp, Inc.", "CountryCode": "US", "DistrictOrCounty": "King",
"FullName": "Saanvi Sarkar", "PhoneNumber": "+15555550100", "PostalCode": "98101", "StateOrRegion": "WA", "WebsiteUrl": "https://www.examplecorp.com"}'
```
