Retrieves the opt-in status of a particular Region.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

POST /getRegionOptStatus HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json

{
   "AccountId": "string",
   "RegionName": "string"
}
```

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[AccountId](#API_GetRegionOptStatus_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the 12-digit account ID number of the AWS account that you want to access
or modify with this operation. If you don't specify this parameter, it defaults to the
Amazon Web Services account of the identity used to call the operation. To use this
parameter, the caller must be an identity in the [organization's\
management account](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-getting-started-concepts.md#account) or a delegated administrator account. The specified
account ID must be a member account in the same organization. The organization must have
[all features\
enabled](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-org-support-all-features.md), and the organization must have [trusted access](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-integrate-services.md) enabled for
the Account Management service, and optionally a [delegated\
admin](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-getting-started-concepts.md#delegated-admin) account assigned.

###### Note

The management account can't specify its own `AccountId`. It must call
the operation in standalone context by not including the `AccountId`
parameter.

To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an organization, don't
specify this parameter. Instead, call the operation using an identity belonging to the
account whose contacts you wish to retrieve or modify.

Type: String

Pattern: `\d{12}`

Required: No

**[RegionName](#API_GetRegionOptStatus_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the Region-code for a given Region name (for example,
`af-south-1`). This function will return the status of whatever Region
you pass into this parameter.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 50.
