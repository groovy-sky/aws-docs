# RestoreTestingRecoveryPointSelection

`RecoveryPointSelection` has five parameters (three required and two
optional). The values you specify determine which recovery point is included in the restore
test. You must indicate with `Algorithm` if you want the latest recovery point
within your `SelectionWindowDays` or if you want a random recovery point, and
you must indicate through `IncludeVaults` from which vaults the recovery points
can be chosen.

`Algorithm` ( _required_) Valid values:
" `LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW`" or " `RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW`".

`Recovery point types` ( _required_) Valid values:
" `SNAPSHOT`" and/or " `CONTINUOUS`". Include `SNAPSHOT`
to restore only snapshot recovery points; include `CONTINUOUS` to restore
continuous recovery points (point in time restore / PITR); use both to restore either a
snapshot or a continuous recovery point. The recovery point will be determined by the value
for `Algorithm`.

`IncludeVaults` ( _required_). You must include one or more
backup vaults. Use the wildcard \["\*"\] or specific ARNs.

`SelectionWindowDays` ( _optional_) Value must be an
integer (in days) from 1 to 365. If not included, the value defaults to
`30`.

`ExcludeVaults` ( _optional_). You can choose to input one
or more specific backup vault ARNs to exclude those vaults' contents from restore
eligibility. Or, you can include a list of selectors. If this parameter and its value are
not included, it defaults to empty list.
