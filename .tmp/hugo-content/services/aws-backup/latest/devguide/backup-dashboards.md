# AWS Backup console dashboards

###### Note

The jobs dashboard is available in all Regions where AWS Backup Audit Manager is supported.
See [Feature availability by AWS Region](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-region) for those
Regions. All other Regions will be able to access the [CloudWatch Dashboard](cloudwatch.md#cloudwatch-dashboard).

## Backup dashboards overview

AWS Backup provides a Jobs dashboard in the console to help you monitor the health of your
backup, copy, and restore jobs. The same data that is visually displayed in the console can
be retrieved in the command line through AWS CLI.

The jobs dashboard can be used to identify issues with backup, copy, and restore jobs
through organization level or member account monitoring. With this information, you can
identify and diagnose events and possible issues to help ensure fidelity in your
activities.

The jobs dashboard can display two timeframes. By default, data from the latest 14 days
are displayed, but you can change the view to show the latest 7 days. If you change the
timeframe, the data will update to reflect to new time interval.

Note the dashboard displays data until the most recent 0:00 UTC; that is, the current
day's data is not included. The dashboard updates daily during approximately 1:30 - 2:30
UTC.

## Viewing the jobs dashboard

To view the jobs dashboard, [log into\
the AWS Backup console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup) and select **Jobs dashboards** in the left
navigation bar.

On the jobs dashboard page, you can select from the backup, copy, or restore jobs
tab.

The jobs dashboard overview displays the aggregated view over the specified timeframe
for job activity, including completed, completed with issues, expired, and failed jobs. By
default, data from the latest 14 days are displayed, but you can change the view to show 7
days.

###### Note

`Completed with issues` is a status of a job displayed in the console that
denotes a completed job with a status message.

### Job health

The line chart displays the successful and unsuccessful jobs rate lines over time. The
successful rate line shows an aggregation of completed and completed with issues jobs. The
unsuccessful rate line shows the sum of failed and expired jobs according to the specified
time range.

Jobs in a non-completed or non-failed state (jobs with a status of created, pending,
running, aborted, aborting, or partial) are not included; percentage totals may not equal
100%.

### Job status over time

With the bar chart, you can generate a custom bar chart that shows the number of jobs
in each category (Completed, Complete with issues, Failed, and Expired), distributed by
days.

With the dropdown menus, choose the status(es), resource types, and AWS Regions you
want to see in the chart. If you want to explore your selection further, select
**View jobs** to see a pre-filtered portion of the jobs/cross-account
monitoring page.

You can hover the mouse over a bar to display a popover that shows detailed job data
for the selected date.

### Problematic jobs

A **problematic** job is a job that has the status Failed, Expired,
or Completed with issues. Each chart displays the corresponding metric that contains
either the accounts, resource types, or top reasons that contain the highest number of
problematic jobs.

The default display sorts the dashboard widget by the specified metric in descending
order, starting with the metric with the highest number of problematic jobs that belong to
the metric.

The top problematic accounts display will only be visible in accounts that have access
through Organizations, such as administrative accounts and delegated administrator accounts. If
visible, you can hover over an account to display the number of problematic jobs that
belong to the chosen account.

You can select a bar within the graph to open a popup window. In this window, you can
select a job status to open a jobs/cross-account monitoring table filtered by the status
selected.

## Reasons for problematic jobs

The **Top problematic reasons** widget shows the message code category
to which error messages belong. However, the category might not explain the issues a job
experiences. Expand the message code categories below to see more details about the specific
messages or errors your jobs could be encountering. All error messages not belonging to the
message code categories below will fall under "MISCELLANEOUS".

## Obtaining dashboard data through AWS CLI

You can use the command line to retrieve the same data which appears in the console. Use
one of the following CLI commands:

- [`list-backup-job-summaries`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/list-backup-job-summaries.html)

- [`list-copy-job-summaries`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/list-copy-job-summaries.html)

- [`list-restore-job-summaries`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/list-restore-job-summaries.html)

There are the valid parameters you can include in each command:

```json

BackupJobSummaries (list)
    Region (string),
    Account (string),
    State (string),
    ResourceType (string),
    MessageCategory (string),
AggregationPeriod: (string),
NextToken (string),
MaxResults (number)

CopyJobSummaries (list)
    Region (string),
    Account (string),
    State (string),
    ResourceType (string),
    MessageCategory (string),
AggregationPeriod: (string),
NextToken (string),
MaxResults (number)

RestoreJobSummaries (list)
    Region (string),
    Account (string),
    State (string),
    ResourceType (string),
AggregationPeriod: (string),
NextToken (string)
```

This example shows a sample request where the a user has input
`list-backup-job-summaries` where the request asks to return all available
accounts with a state of `FAILED` over the prior 14 days:

```json

GET /audit/backup-job-summaries/
    ?accountId=ANY
    &state=FAILED
    &aggregationPeriod=FOURTEEN_DAYS
```

To obtain a job count for jobs with a status of `completed with issues`,
subtract the job count of `COMPLETED` jobs with a `MessageCategory` of
`SUCCESS` from the total number of `COMPLETED`.
