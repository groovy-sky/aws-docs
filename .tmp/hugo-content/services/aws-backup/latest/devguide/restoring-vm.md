# Restore a virtual machine using AWS Backup

You can restore a virtual machine to VMware, VMware Cloud on AWS, VMware Cloud on
AWS Outposts, an Amazon EBS volume, or [to an Amazon EC2 instance](restoring-ec2.md).
Restoring (or migrating) a virtual machine to EC2 requires a license. By default, AWS will
include a license (charges apply). For more information, see [Licensing options](../../../vm-import/latest/userguide/licensing.md) in the
_VM Import/Export User Guide_.

You can restore a VMware virtual machine using the AWS Backup console or through the AWS CLI.
When a virtual machine is restored, the VMware Tools folder is not included. See VMware
documentation to reinstall VMware Tools.

AWS Backup restores of virtual machines are non-destructive, meaning AWS Backup does not overwrite
existing virtual machines during a restore. Instead, the restore job deploys a new virtual
machine.

###### Tasks

- [Considerations when restoring a VM to an Amazon EC2 instance](#vm-restore-ec2)

- [Use the AWS Backup console to restore virtual machine recovery points](#vm-restore-console)

- [Use AWS CLI to restore virtual machine recovery points](#vm-restore-cli)

## Considerations when restoring a VM to an Amazon EC2 instance

- Restoring (or migrating) a virtual machine to EC2 requires a license. By default,
an AWS will include a license (charges apply). For more information, see [Licensing\
options](../../../vm-import/latest/userguide/licensing.md) in the _VM Import/Export User Guide_.

- There is a maximum limit of 5 TB (terabytes) for each virtual machine disk.

- You can't specify a key pair when you restore the virtual machine to an instance.
You can add a key pair to `authorized_keys` during launch (through instance
user data) or after launch (as described in [this troubleshooting section](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/troubleshootinginstancesconnecting.md#replacing-lost-key-pair) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide).

- Confirm your [operating system is supported](../../../vm-import/latest/userguide/prerequisites.md#vmimport-operating-systems) for import to and export from Amazon EC2 in the
_VM Import/Export User Guide_.

- Review limitations involved with [Importing VMs\
to Amazon EC2](../../../vm-import/latest/userguide/prerequisites.md#limitations-image) in the _VM Import/Export User Guide_.

- When you restore to an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CLI, you must specify
`"RestoreTo":"EC2Instance"`. All other attributes have default
values.

- Amazon EC2 offers [EC2 Allowed AMIs](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-allowed-amis.md). If
this setting is enabled in your account, add the alias `aws-backup-vault`
to your allowlist. Otherwise, restore operations of VM recovery points to EC2
instances will fail with an error message, such as "Source AMI not found in
Region".

- VMware restores to EC2 involving more than 21 disks are not supported.
As a workaround, use [VMware Restores to EBS](restoring-vm.md#restore-vm-ebs) to
restore each disk individually as an EBS volume, then attach the EBS volumes
to an EC2 instance.

## Use the AWS Backup console to restore virtual machine recovery points

You can restore a virtual machine from multiple locations in the left navigation pane
of the AWS Backup console:

- Choose **Hypervisors** to view recovery points for virtual
machines managed by a hypervisor that is connected to AWS Backup.

- Choose **Virtual machines** to view recovery points for virtual
machines across all your hypervisors that are connected to AWS Backup.

- Choose **Backup vaults** to view recovery points stored in a
specific AWS Backup vault.

- Choose **Protected resources** to view recovery points across all
your AWS Backup protected resources.

If you need to restore a virtual machine that no longer has a connection with Backup
gateway, choose **Backup vaults** or **Protected**
**resources** to locate your recovery point.

13. _Optional_: Check when your restore job has the status
     `Completed`. In the left navigation menu, choose
     **Jobs**.

## Use AWS CLI to restore virtual machine recovery points

Use `StartRestoreJob`.

You can specify the following metadata for a virtual machine restore to Amazon EC2 and
Amazon EBS:

```json

RestoreTo
InstanceType
VpcId
SubnetId
SecurityGroupIds
IamInstanceProfileName
InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior
HibernationOptions
DisableApiTermination
Placement
CreditSpecification
RamdiskId
KernelId
UserData
EbsOptimized
LicenseSpecifications
KmsKeyId
AvailabilityZone
EbsVolumeType
IsEncrypted
ItemsToRestore
RequireIMDSv2
NetworkInterfaces
```

AWS Backup supports both partial restores to Amazon EBS and full restores to Amazon EC2. For partial
restores, use `ItemsToRestore` to specify which disk to restore to the
specified EBS volume. When restoring to Amazon EC2, the parameter
`ItemsToRestore` can be left blank because it is ignored and the full list
of disks is restored.

You can specify the following metadata for a virtual machine restore to VMware, VMware
Cloud on AWS, and VMware cloud on AWS Outpost:

```json

RestoreTo
HypervisorArn
VMName
VMPath
ComputeResourceName
VMDatastore
DisksToRestore
ItemsToRestore
```

AWS Backup supports both partial and full restores to an on-premises virtual machine. You
can choose to restore all disks or only a subset of disks. When performing a partial
restore, specify your disk selection in `ItemsToRestore`. When performing a
full restore, you must either omit both `DisksToRestore` and
`ItemsToRestore`, or specify all the disks in
`DisksToRestore`. The `DisksToRestore` parameter does not support
subsets of disks.

This example shows how to conduct a full restore to VMware:

```json

'{"RestoreTo":"VMware","HypervisorArn":"arn:aws:backup-gateway:us-east-1:209870788375:hypervisor/hype-9B1AB1F1","VMName":"name","VMPath":"/Labster/vm","ComputeResourceName":"Cluster","VMDatastore":"vsanDatastore","DisksToRestore":"[{\"DiskId\":\"2000\",\"Label\":\"Hard disk 1\"}]","vmId":"vm-101"}'
```
