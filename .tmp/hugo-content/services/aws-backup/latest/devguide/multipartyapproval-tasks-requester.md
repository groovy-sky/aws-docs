**owns the logically air-gapped vault**.

You can associate a Multi-party approval team with a logically air-gapped vault to
enable collaborative approval for access to the vault (step 5 in the [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview)).

Console

###### Associate a Multi-party approval team with a logically air-gapped vault

If this is the first approval team to be associated with the vault, the team
will be associated with the vault. If the vault already has an associated team,
see [Update Multi-party approval\
team](#update-multpartyapproval-team) for steps.

CLI

Use the CLI command `associate-backup-vault-mpa-approval-team`,
modified with the following parameters:

```json

aws backup associate-backup-vault-mpa-approval-team \
--backup-vault-name VAULT_NAME \
--mpa-approval-team-arn MPA_TEAM_ARN \
--requester-comment "OPTIONAL_COMMENT" \

## Request access to a logically air-gapped vault

Requester: **User with access to recovery account**.

You can request access to a logically air-gapped vault in another account (step 6 in
the [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview)).

After an approval team
has granted the request, AWS Backup creates a restore access backup vault in your designated
recovery account so that account will have access to recovery points in the
connected logically air-gapped vault.

Console

###### Request access to a logically air-gapped vault

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

4. Select **Request vault access**.

5. Enter the source backup vault ARN of the logically air-gapped vault you
    want to access.

    input a name, AWS Backup will assign a name based on the name of the logically air
    gapped vault.

7. Enter an optional requester comment explaining the reason for the access
    request.

8. Select **Send request** to submit the access
    request.

The approval team members associated with the source vault will receive an
email notification to approve the request.

Once the request is approved by the required number ("threshold") of team
members, the restore access backup vault will be created in the recovery
account.

CLI

Use the CLI command `create-restore-access-backup-vault`:

```json

aws backup create-restore-access-backup-vault \
--source-backup-vault-arn SOURCE_VAULT_ARN \
--backup-vault-name OPTIONAL_VAULT_NAME \
--requester-comment "OPTIONAL_COMMENT" \
--region REGION
```

The MPA approval team members associated with the source vault will receive a
notification to approve the request. Once the request is approved by the required
number ("threshold") of team members, the restore access backup vault will be
created in the recovery account.

You can check the status of the vault using:

```json

aws backup describe-backup-vault \
--backup-vault-name VAULT_NAME \
