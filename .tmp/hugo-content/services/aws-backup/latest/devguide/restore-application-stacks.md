# Restore CloudFormation stacks

A CloudFormation composite backup is a combination of a CloudFormation template and all
associated nested recovery points. Any number of nested recovery points can be restored, but
the composite recovery point (which is the top-level recovery point) cannot be
restored.

When you restore a CloudFormation template recovery point, you create a new stack with a
change set to represent the backup.

## Restore CloudFormation with the AWS Backup console

From the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) you
can see the new stack and change set. To learn more about change sets, see [Updating stacks using change sets](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.md) in the _CloudFormation User_
_Guide_.

Determine which nested recovery points you want to restore from with your CloudFormation
stack, and then restore them using the AWS Backup console.

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

2. Go to **Backup vaults**, select the backup vault containing your
    desired recovery point, then click on **Recovery points**.

3. Restore the CloudFormation template recovery point.
1. Click the composite recovery point containing the nested recovery points you
       want to restore to bring up the Details page for the composite recovery
       point.

2. Under **Nested recovery points**, the nested recovery points
       will be displayed. Each recovery point will have a recovery point ID, a status, a
       resource ID, a resource type, a backup type, and the time that recovery point was
       created. Click the radio button next to the CloudFormation recovery point, then click
       **Restore**. Ensure that you are selecting the recovery point
       that has **resource type: CloudFormation** and **backup type:**
      **backup.**
4. Once the restore job for the CloudFormation template is completed, your restored CloudFormation
    template will be visible in the [CloudFormation\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) under **Stacks**.

5. Under **Stack names** you should find the restored template with
    the status of `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`.

6. Click on the name of the stack to see the stack's details.

7. There are tabs under the stack name. Click on **Change**
**sets**.

8. Execute the change set.

9. After this processes, the resources in the original stack will be recreated in the
    new stack. The stateful resources will be recreated empty. To recover the stateful
    resources, go back to the list of recovery points in the AWS Backup console, select the
    recovery point you need, and initiate a restore.

###### Note

If a CloudFormation restore operation fails, the stack may remain in `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`
status with a `FAILED` change set. Delete these stacks manually to avoid naming conflicts when
you retry the restore operation.

For more information,
see [Deleting a stack](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/cfn-console-delete-stack.md)
in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Restore CloudFormation with AWS CLI

In the command line interface, [`start-restore-job`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/start-restore-job.html) allows you to restore a CloudFormation stack.

The following list is the accepted metadata to restore an CloudFormation resource.

```json

// Mandatory metadata:
ChangeSetName // This is the name of the change set which will be created
StackName // This is the name of the stack that will be created by the new change set

// Optional metadata:
ChangeSetDescription // This is the description of the new change set
StackParameters // This is the JSON of the stack parameters required by the stack
aws:backup:request-id
```
