# ListSearchJobBackups

This operation returns a list of all backups (recovery
points) in a paginated format that were included in
the search job.

If a search does not display an expected backup in
the results, you can call this operation to display each
backup included in the search. Any backups that were not
included because they have a `FAILED` status
from a permissions issue will be displayed, along with a
status message.

Only recovery points with a backup index that has
a status of `ACTIVE` will be included in search results.
If the index has any other status, its status will be
displayed along with a status message.
