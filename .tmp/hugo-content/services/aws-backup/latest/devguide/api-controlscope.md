# ControlScope

A framework consists of one or more controls. Each control has its own control scope.
The control scope can include one or more resource types, a combination of a tag key and
value, or a combination of one resource type and one resource ID. If no scope is specified,
evaluations for the rule are triggered when any resource in your recording group changes in
configuration.

###### Note

To set a control scope that includes all of a particular resource, leave the
`ControlScope` empty or do not pass it when calling
`CreateFramework`.

## Contents

The tag key-value pair applied to those AWS resources that you want to

framework from the console (though the value can be an empty string when included
in a CloudFormation template).
