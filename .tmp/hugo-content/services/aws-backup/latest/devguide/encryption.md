# Encryption for backups in AWS Backup

## Independent encryption

AWS Backup offers independent encryption for [resource\
types that support full AWS Backup management](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource). Independent encryption means that
recovery points (backups) you create through AWS Backup can have an encryption method other
than one determined by the source resource's encryption. For example, your backup of an
Amazon S3 bucket can have a different encryption method than the source bucket you encrypted
with Amazon S3 encryption. This encryption is controlled through the AWS KMS key configuration in
the backup vault where your backup in stored.

Backups of resource types that are not fully managed by AWS Backup typically inherit the
encryption settings from their source resource. You can configure these encryption
settings according to that service's instructions, such as [Amazon EBS encryption](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.md) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

Your IAM role must have access to the KMS key being used to back up and restore the
object. Otherwise the job is successful but the objects are not backed up or restored. The
permissions in IAM policy and KMS key policy must be consistent. For more information, see
[Specifying KMS keys in IAM policy\
statements](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/cmks-in-iam-policies.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

The following table lists each supported resource type, how encryption is configured
for backups, and whether independent encryption for backups is supported. When AWS Backup
independently encrypts a backup, it uses the industry-standard AES-256 encryption
algorithm. For more information about encryption in AWS Backup, see [cross-Region](cross-region-backup.md) and [cross-account](create-cross-account-backup.md) backup.

Resource typeHow to configure encryptionIndependent AWS Backup encryptionAmazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)Amazon S3 backups are encrypted using a AWS KMS (AWS Key Management Service) key associated with the
backup vault. The AWS KMS key can either be a customer-managed key or an
AWS-managed key associated with the AWS Backup service. AWS Backup encrypts all backups
even if the source Amazon S3 buckets are not encrypted.SupportedVMware virtual machinesVM backups are always encrypted. The AWS KMS encryption key for virtual machine
backups is configured in the AWS Backup vault in which the virtual machine backups are
stored.SupportedAmazon DynamoDB after enabling [Advanced DynamoDB backup](advanced-ddb-backup.md)

DynamoDB backups are always encrypted. The AWS KMS encryption key for DynamoDB
backups is configured in the AWS Backup vault that the DynamoDB backups are stored
in.

SupportedAmazon DynamoDB without enabling [Advanced DynamoDB backup](advanced-ddb-backup.md)

DynamoDB backups are automatically encrypted with the same encryption key that
was used to encrypt the source DynamoDB table. Snapshots of unencrypted DynamoDB
tables are also unencrypted.

In order for AWS Backup to create a backup of an encrypted DynamoDB table, you must
add the permissions `kms:Decrypt` and
`kms:GenerateDataKey` to the IAM role used for backup. Alternately,
you can use the AWS Backup default service role.

Not supportedAmazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)Amazon EFS backups are always encrypted. The AWS KMS encryption key for Amazon EFS
backups is configured in the AWS Backup vault that the Amazon EFS backups are stored
in.SupportedAmazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)By default, Amazon EBS backups are either encrypted using the key that was used to
encrypt the source volume, or they are unencrypted. During restore, you can choose
to override the default encryption method by specifying a KMS key.Not supportedAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) AMIsAMIs are unencrypted. EBS snapshots are encrypted by the default encryption
rules for EBS backups (see entry for EBS). EBS snapshots of data and root volumes
can be encrypted and attached to an AMI. Not supportedAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)Amazon RDS snapshots are automatically encrypted with the same encryption key that
was used to encrypt the source Amazon RDS database. Snapshots of unencrypted Amazon RDS

unencrypted Aurora clusters are also unencrypted.Not supportedAWS Storage GatewayStorage Gateway snapshots are automatically encrypted with the same encryption key
that was used to encrypt the source Storage Gateway volume. Snapshots of unencrypted
Storage Gateway volumes are also unencrypted.

You don't need to use a customer
managed key across all services to enable Storage Gateway. You only need to copy the
Storage Gateway backup to a vault that configured a KMS key. This is because
Storage Gateway does not have a service-specific AWS KMS managed key.

## Encryption for copies of a backup to a different account or AWS Region

When you copy your backups across accounts or Regions, AWS Backup automatically encrypts
those copies for most resource types, even if the original backup is unencrypted. AWS Backup
encrypts the copy using the KMS key of the target vault.

Before you copy a backup from one account to another (cross-account copy job) or copy
a backup from one Region to another (cross-Region copy job), note the following
conditions, many of which depend on whether the resource type in the backup (recovery
point) is [fully managed by AWS Backup or not fully\
managed](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource).

- A copy of a backup to another AWS Region is encrypted using the key of the
destination vault.

- For a copy of a recovery point (backup) of a resource that is **fully**
**managed by AWS Backup**, you can choose to encrypt it with a [customer managed key (CMK)](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk) or an AWS Backup managed key
( `aws/backup`).

For a copy of a recovery point of a resource that is **not fully**
**managed** by AWS Backup, the key associated to the destination vault must be a
CMK or the managed key of the service that owns the underlying resource. For example,
if you are copying an EC2 instance, a Backup managed key cannot be used. Instead, a
CMK or Amazon EBS KMS key ( `aws/ebs`) must be used to avoid copy job
failure.

- Cross-account copy with AWS managed keys isn't supported for resources that
aren't fully managed by AWS Backup. The [key policy](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.md) of an AWS
managed key is immutable, which prevents copying the key across accounts. If your
resources are encrypted with AWS managed keys and you want to perform a
cross-account copy, you may [change the encryption\
keys](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/update-encryption-key-rds) to a customer managed key, which can be used for cross-account copying.
Or, you can follow the instructions in [Protecting encrypted Amazon RDS instances with cross-account and cross-Region\
backups](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/protecting-encrypted-amazon-rds-instances-with-cross-account-and-cross-region-backups) to continue using AWS managed keys.

- Copies of unencrypted Amazon Aurora, Amazon DocumentDB, and Amazon Neptune clusters are also
unencrypted.

## AWS Backup permissions, grants, and deny statements

To help avoid failed jobs, you can examine the AWS KMS key policy to ensure it has
required permissions and does not have any deny statements that prevent successful
operations.

Failed jobs can occur due to either one or more Deny statements applied to the KMS key
or due to a [grant](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/grants.md) revoked for the key.

In an AWS managed access policy such as [`AWSBackupFullAccess`](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsbackupfullaccess.md), there are Allow actions that permit AWS Backup
to interface with AWS KMS to create a grant on a KMS key on a customer's behalf as part
backup, copy, and storage operations.

At a minimum, the key policy requires the following permissions:

- `kms:createGrant`

- `kms:generateDataKey`

- `kms:decrypt`

If Deny policies are necessary, you will need to allowlist the required roles
for backup and restore operations.

These elements can look like:

          }
      }
    ]
}

```

These permissions must be part of the key, whether it is AWS managed or customer
managed.

1. Ensure required permissions are part of KMS key policy
1. Run KMS CLI `get-key-policy` ( [`kms:GetKeyPolicy`](../../../../reference/kms/latest/apireference/api-getkeypolicy.md)) to view the key policy attached to the
       specified KMS key.

2. Review the returned permissions.
2. Ensure there are no Deny statements that affect operations
1. Run (or re-run) CLI `get-key-policy` ( [`kms:GetKeyPolicy`](../../../../reference/kms/latest/apireference/api-getkeypolicy.md)) to view the key policy attached to the
       specified KMS key.

2. Review the policy.

3. Remove relevant Deny statements from the KMS key policy.
3. If needed, run [`kms:put-key-policy`](../../../../reference/kms/latest/apireference/api-putkeypolicy.md) to replace or update key policy with
    revised permissions and removed Deny statements.

Additionally, the key associated with the role initiating a cross-Region copy job must
have `"kms:ResourcesAliases": "alias/aws/backup"` in the
`DescribeKey` permission.
