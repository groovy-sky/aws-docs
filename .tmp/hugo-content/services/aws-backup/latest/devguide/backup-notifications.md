# Notification options with AWS Backup

There are two ways to receive notifications about AWS Backup:

- User Notifications can send notifications, including Amazon CloudWatch alarms, AWS Support,
and other services' notifications.

- Amazon Simple Notification Service can notify you of AWS Backup events.

## User Notifications and AWS Backup

AWS Backup supports management of your backup notifications from the [User Notifications \
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/notifications/home?notifications=). With [User Notifications](../../../notifications/latest/userguide/getting-started.md), you can view the progress of your backup, copy, and restore jobs
and changes to your backup policies, vaults, recovery points, and settings from the User
Notifications Notification Center.

Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon EventBridge alarms, and AWS Support case updates are among other types of
notifications you can manage from the console. Additionally, you can set up several delivery
options, including email, Amazon Q Developer in chat applications notifications, and AWS Console Mobile Application push notifications.

## Amazon SNS and AWS Backup events

AWS Backup takes advantage of the robust notifications delivered by Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You
can configure Amazon SNS to notify you of AWS Backup events from the Amazon SNS console.

###### Limitations

- While the Amazon SNS service allows cross-account notifications, AWS Backup does not currently
support this feature. You must specify your own AWS account ID and the resource ARN of
your topic.

- AWS Backup supports Standard topics for SNS best-effort deduplication, but AWS Backup does not
currently support SNS FIFO topics for Strict deduplication.

### Common use cases

- Set up notifications for failed backup jobs by following the steps in [How can I\
get notifications for AWS Backup jobs that failed?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/aws-backup-failed-job-notification) from AWS Premium
Support.

- Review sample Amazon SNS notification JSONs for completed, failed, and expired backup
jobs in the Examples of events table below.

For more information about Amazon SNS generally, see [Getting Started with Amazon SNS](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-getting-started.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

### AWS Backup notification APIs

After creating your topics using the Amazon SNS console or AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you can use
the following AWS Backup API operations to manage your backup notifications.

- [DeleteBackupVaultNotifications](api-deletebackupvaultnotifications.md) — Deletes event
notifications for the specified backup vault.

- [GetBackupVaultNotifications](api-getbackupvaultnotifications.md) — Lists all event
notifications for the specified backup vault.

- [PutBackupVaultNotifications](api-putbackupvaultnotifications.md) — Turns on notifications
for the specified topic and events.

AWS Backup supports the following events:

Job typeEventBackup job`BACKUP_JOB_STARTED` \| `BACKUP_JOB_COMPLETED` \|
`CONTINUOUS_BACKUP_INTERRUPTED`Copy job`COPY_JOB_STARTED` \| `COPY_JOB_SUCCESSFUL` \|
`COPY_JOB_FAILED`Restore job`RESTORE_JOB_STARTED` \| `RESTORE_JOB_COMPLETED`Recovery point`RECOVERY_POINT_MODIFIED`Recovery point indexing`RECOVERY_POINT_INDEX_COMPLETED` \| `RECOVERY_POINT_INDEX_DELETED` \|
`RECOVERY_POINT_INDEXING_FAILED`

AWS Backup for S3 supports two additional events:

- `S3_BACKUP_OBJECT_FAILED` notifies you of any S3 object that AWS Backup
failed to back up during a backup job.

- `S3_RESTORE_OBJECT_FAILED` notifies you of any S3 object that AWS Backup
failed to restore during a restore job.

AWS Backup for EKS supports three additional events:

- `EKS_BACKUP_OBJECT_FAILED` notifies you of any EKS objects that AWS Backup
failed to back up during a backup job.

- `EKS_RESTORE_OBJECT_FAILED` notifies you of any EKS objects that AWS Backup
failed to restore during a restore job.

- `EKS_RESTORE_OBJECT_SKIPPED` notifies you of any EKS objects that AWS Backup
skipped during a restore job.

### Examples of events

### AWS Backup notification command examples

You can use AWS CLI commands to subscribe to, list, and delete Amazon SNS notifications for
your AWS Backup events.

#### Example put backup vault notification

The following command subscribes to an Amazon SNS topic for the specified backup vault
that notifies you when a restore job is started or completed, or when a recovery point
is modified.

```sh

aws backup put-backup-vault-notifications
    --backup-vault-name myBackupVault
    --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:myBackupTopic
    --backup-vault-events RESTORE_JOB_STARTED RESTORE_JOB_COMPLETED RECOVERY_POINT_MODIFIED
```

#### Example get backup vault notification

The following command lists all events currently subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic for
the specified backup vault.

```sh

aws backup get-backup-vault-notifications
    --backup-vault-name myVault
```

The sample output is as follows:

```JSON

{
    "SNSTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:myBackupTopic",
    "BackupVaultEvents": [
        "RESTORE_JOB_STARTED",
        "RESTORE_JOB_COMPLETED",
        "RECOVERY_POINT_MODIFIED"
    ],
    "BackupVaultName": "myVault",
    "BackupVaultArn": "arn:aws:backup:region:account-id:backup-vault:myVault"
}
```

#### Example delete backup vault notification

The following command unsubscribes from an Amazon SNS topic for the specified backup
vault.

```nohighlight

aws backup delete-backup-vault-notifications
    --backup-vault-name myVault
```

### Specifying AWS Backup as a service principal

###### Note

To allow AWS Backup to publish SNS topics on your behalf, you must specify AWS Backup as a
service principal.

Include the following JSON in the access policy of the Amazon SNS topic that you use to
track AWS Backup events. You must specify the resource Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your
topic.

```JSON

{
      "Sid": "My-statement-id",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "backup.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:myTopic"
}
```

For more information about specifying a service principal in an Amazon SNS access policy,
see [Allowing Any AWS Resource to Publish to a Topic](../../../sns/latest/dg/accesspolicylanguage-usecases-sns.md#AccessPolicyLanguage_UseCase4_Sns) in the
_Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

###### Note

If your topic is encrypted, you must include additional permissions in your policy
to allow AWS Backup to publish to it. For more information about enabling services to publish
to encrypted topics, see [Enable\
Compatibility between Event Sources from AWS Services and Encrypted Topics](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-key-management.md#sns-what-permissions-for-sse)
in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.
