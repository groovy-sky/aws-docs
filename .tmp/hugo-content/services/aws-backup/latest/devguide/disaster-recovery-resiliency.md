# Resilience in AWS Backup

AWS Backup takes its resilience — and your data security — extremely seriously.

AWS Backup stores your backups with _at least_ as much resilience and
durability as your resource’s original AWS service would give you, if you backed it up
there.

AWS Backup is designed to use the AWS global infrastructure to replicate your backups across
multiple Availability Zones for durability of 99.999999999% (11 nines) in any given year,
provided that you adhere to the current AWS Backup documentation.

AWS Backup encrypts your backup plans at rest and continuously backs them up. You can also
restrict access to your backup plans using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials and policies. For
more information, see [Authentication](authentication.md),
[Access Control](access-control.md), and [Security Best Practices\
in IAM](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md).

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are
connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. AWS Backup stores
your backups across Availability Zones. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault
tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures. For
more information, see [AWS Backup Service Level Agreement\
(SLA)](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/sla).

Furthermore, AWS Backup empowers you to copy your backups across Regions for even greater
resilience. For more information about the AWS Backup cross-Region copy feature, see [Creating a Backup Copy](recov-point-create-a-copy.md).

Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure).
