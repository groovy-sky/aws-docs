# Administrator tasks

Several tasks involving AWS Backup and Multi-party overview required a user with admin
permissions and access to the management account.

## Create an approval team

A user at your organization with admin permissions for an AWS account needs to
[set up\
Multi-party approval](../../../mpa/latest/userguide/setting-up.md) (step 3 in the [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview)).

Before doing this step, it is recommended as a best practice you have both a primary
organization and a secondary organization (for recovery purposes) set up through
AWS Organizations (step 1 in [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview).

See [Create an approval\
team](../../../mpa/latest/userguide/create-team.md#create-team-steps) in the _Multi-party approval user guide_ to create
your team.

During the [`aws mpa create-approval-team`](../../../../reference/mpa/latest/apireference/api-createapprovalteam.md) operation, one of the parameters
is `policies`. This is a list of ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) for Multi-party
approval resource policies that define permissions that protect the team.

The policy shown in the example in the _Multi-party approval User_
_Guide_ in the procedure [Create an approval\
team](../../../mpa/latest/userguide/create-team.md#create-team-steps) contains the policy
`["arn:aws:mpa::aws:policy/backup.amazonaws.com/CreateRestoreAccessVault"]`
with several necessary permissions.

Follow these steps to return a list of available policies by using `mpa
              list-policies`:

1. List Policies:

```json

aws mpa list-policies --region us-east-1
```

2. List all policy versions:

```json

aws mpa list-policy-versions --policy-arn arn:aws:mpa:::aws:policy/backup.amazonaws.com/CreateRestoreAccessVault --region us-east-1
```

3. Get details on a policy:

```json

aws mpa get-policy-version --policy-version-arn arn:aws:mpa:::aws:policy/backup.amazonaws.com/CreateRestoreAccessVault/1 --region us-east-1
```

Expand below to see the policy that will created then attached to your approval team
by this operation:

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VaultOwnerPermissions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Resource": "*",
      "Action": [
        "mpa:StartSession",
        "mpa:CancelSession"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "mpa:RequestedOperation": "backup:RevokeRestoreAccessBackupVault",
          "mpa:ProtectedResourceAccount": "${aws:PrincipalAccount}"
        },
        "Bool": {
          "aws:ViaAWSService": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Share a Multi-party approval team using AWS RAM

You can share a Multi-party approval team with other AWS accounts using [AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)](../../../ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-create.md), step 4 in the [overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview).

Console

###### Share a Multi-party approval team using AWS RAM

01. Sign in to the [AWS RAM\
     console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home?region=us-east-1).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Resource**
    **shares**.

03. Choose **Create resource share**.

04. In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for your
     resource share.

05. Under **Resource type**, select **Multi-party**
    **approval Team** from the dropdown menu.

06. Under **Resources**, select the approval team you want to
     share.

07. Under **Principals**, specify the AWS accounts with
     whom you want to share the approval team.

08. To share with specific AWS accounts, select **AWS**
    **accounts** and enter the 12-digit account IDs.

09. To share with an organization or organizational unit, select
     **Organization** or **Organizational**
    **unit** and enter the appropriate ID.

10. ( _Optional_) Under **Tags**, add any
     tags you want to associate with this resource share.

11. Choose **Create resource share**.

The resource share status will initially show as `PENDING`. Once
the recipient accounts accept the invitation, the status will change to
`ACTIVE`.

CLI

To share a Multi-party approval team using AWS RAM through the CLI, use the
following commands:

First, identify the ARN of the approval team you want to share:

```json

aws mpa list-approval-teams --region us-east-1
```

Create a resource share using the create-resource-share command:

```json

aws ram create-resource-share \
--name "MPA-Team-Share" \
--resource-arns "arn:aws:mpa:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_ID:approval-team/TEAM_ID" \
--principals "ACCOUNT_ID_TO_SHARE_WITH" \
--permission-arns "arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMMPAApprovalTeamAccess" \
--region us-east-1
```

To share with an organization instead of specific accounts:

```json

aws ram create-resource-share \
--name "MPA-Team-Share" \
--resource-arns "arn:aws:mpa:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_ID:approval-team/TEAM_ID" \
--permission-arns "arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMMPAApprovalTeamAccess" \
--allow-external-principals \
--region us-east-1
```

Check the status of your resource share:

```json

aws ram get-resource-shares \
--resource-owner SELF \
--region us-east-1
```

The recipient account(s) will need to accept the resource share
invitation:

```json

aws ram get-resource-share-invitations --region us-east-1
```

Run in recipient account to accept an invitation:

```json

aws ram accept-resource-share-invitation \
--resource-share-invitation-arn "arn:aws:ram:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:resource-share-invitation/INVITATION_ID" \
--region us-east-1
```

Once the invitation is accepted, the Multi-party approval team will be
available for use in the recipient account.

AWS offers tools to share account access, including through [AWS Resource Access Manager](logicallyairgappedvault.md#lag-share) and [Multi-party access](../../../mpa/latest/userguide/share-team.md). When you choose
to share a logically air-gapped vault with another account, consider the following
details:

FeatureAWS RAM based sharingMulti-party approval based access**Access to logically air-gapped vaults**Once RAM share is complete, the vaults can be accessed.Any attempt by a different account must be approved by a threshold number
of Multi-party approval team members. The approval session automatically expires
24 hours after the request is initiated.**Access removal**The account which owns the logically air-gapped vault can end RAM based
sharing at any time.Access to a vault can only be removed by a request to the Multi-party
approval team.**Copy across accounts and/or Regions**Not currently supported.Backups can be copied within the same account or with other accounts in the
same organization as the recovery account.**Cross-Region transfer billing**Cross-Region transfers are billed to the same account that owns the restore
access backup vault.**Recommended use**Primary use is for data loss recovery and for restore testing.Primary use is for situations where account access or security is suspected
to be compromised.**Regions**Available in all AWS Regions where logically air-gapped vaults are
supported.Available in all AWS Regions where logically air-gapped vaults are
supported.**Restores**All supported resource types can be restored from a shared account.All supported resource types can be restored from a shared account.**Setup**Sharing can occur as soon as the AWS Backup account sets up RAM sharing and the
receiving account accepts the share.Sharing requires the management account to first create a team, then set up RAM sharing.
Then, the management account opts in to Multi-party approval and assigns that team to a
logically air-gapped vault.**Sharing**

Sharing is done through RAM within same AWS organization or across AWS
organizations.

Access is granted according to the 'push' model, in which the account that
owns the logically air-gapped vault first grants access. Then, the other
account accepts access.

Access to a logically air-gapped vault is through Organizations supported approval
teams within the same AWS organization or across organizations.

Access is granted according to the 'pull' model, where the receiving
account first requests access, then the approval team grants or denies the
request.
