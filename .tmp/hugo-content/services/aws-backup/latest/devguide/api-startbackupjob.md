## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[BackupOptions](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

The backup option for a selected resource. This option is only available for
Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backup jobs.

Valid values: Set to `"WindowsVSS":"enabled"` to enable the
`WindowsVSS` backup option and create a Windows VSS backup. Set to
`"WindowsVSS""disabled"` to create a regular backup. The
`WindowsVSS` option is not enabled by default.

Type: String to string map

Key Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]{1,50}$`

Value Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]{1,50}$`

Required: No

**[BackupVaultName](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified
by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the AWS
Region where they are created.

Type: String

Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_]{2,50}$`

Required: Yes

**[CompleteWindowMinutes](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

A value in minutes during which a successfully started backup must complete, or else
AWS Backup will cancel the job. This value is optional. This value begins
counting down from when the backup was scheduled. It does not add additional time for
`StartWindowMinutes`, or if the backup started later than scheduled.

Like `StartWindowMinutes`, this parameter has a maximum value of
100 years (52,560,000 minutes).

Type: Long

Required: No

**[IamRoleArn](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example,
`arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access`.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[IdempotencyToken](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

A customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between otherwise identical
calls to `StartBackupJob`. Retrying a successful request with the same
idempotency token results in a success message with no action taken.

Type: String

Required: No

**[Index](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

Include this parameter to enable index creation if your backup
job has a resource type that supports backup indexes.

Resource types that support backup indexes include:

- `EBS` for Amazon Elastic Block Store

- `S3` for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

Index can have 1 of 2 possible values, either `ENABLED` or
`DISABLED`.

To create a backup index for an eligible `ACTIVE` recovery point
that does not yet have a backup index, set value to `ENABLED`.

To delete a backup index, set value to `DISABLED`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `ENABLED | DISABLED`

Required: No

**[Lifecycle](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when
it expires. AWS Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according
to the lifecycle that you define.

Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90
days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to
cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed
after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the [Feature \
availability by resource](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource) table. AWS Backup ignores this expression for
other resource types.

This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (36,500 days).

Type: [Lifecycle](api-lifecycle.md) object

Required: No

**[LogicallyAirGappedBackupVaultArn](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

The ARN of a logically air-gapped vault. ARN must be in the same account and Region.
If provided, supported fully managed resources back up directly to logically air-gapped vault,
while other supported resources create a temporary (billable) snapshot in backup vault,
then copy it to logically air-gapped vault. Unsupported resources only back up to the specified
backup vault.

Type: String

Required: No

**[RecoveryPointTags](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

The tags to assign to the resources.

Type: String to string map

Required: No

**[ResourceArn](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN
depends on the resource type.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[StartWindowMinutes](#API_StartBackupJob_RequestSyntax)**

A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be canceled if it
doesn't start successfully. This value is optional, and the default is 8 hours.
If this value is included, it must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.

This parameter has a maximum value of 100 years (52,560,000 minutes).

During the start window, the backup job status remains in `CREATED` status until it
has successfully begun or until the start window time has run out. If within the start
window time AWS Backup receives an error that allows the job to be retried,
AWS Backup will automatically retry to begin the job at least every 10 minutes
until the backup
successfully begins (the job status changes to `RUNNING`) or until the job status
changes to `EXPIRED` (which is expected to occur when the start window time is over).

Type: Long

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-type: application/json

{
   "BackupJobId": "string",
   "CreationDate": number,
   "IsParent": boolean,
   "RecoveryPointArn": "string"
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[BackupJobId](#API_StartBackupJob_ResponseSyntax)**

Uniquely identifies a request to AWS Backup to back up a resource.

Type: String

**[CreationDate](#API_StartBackupJob_ResponseSyntax)**

The date and time that a backup job is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC). The value of `CreationDate` is accurate to milliseconds. For
example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087
AM.

Type: Timestamp

**[IsParent](#API_StartBackupJob_ResponseSyntax)**

This is a returned boolean value indicating this is a parent (composite)
backup job.

Type: Boolean

**[RecoveryPointArn](#API_StartBackupJob_ResponseSyntax)**

_Note: This field is only returned for Amazon EFS and Advanced DynamoDB_
_resources._

An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example,
`arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45`.
