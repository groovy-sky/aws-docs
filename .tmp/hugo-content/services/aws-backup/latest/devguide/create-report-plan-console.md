# Creating report plans using the AWS Backup console

There are two types of reports. One type is a **jobs report**, which
shows jobs finished in the last 24 hours and all active jobs. The second type of report is a
**compliance report**. Compliance reports can monitor resource levels or
the different controls that are in effect. When you create a report, you choose which type
of report to create.

Depending on your type of account, the console display may vary. Only management
accounts will see multi-account functionality.

Similar to a _backup plan_, you create a _report_
_plan_ to automate the creation of your reports and define their destination Amazon S3
bucket. A report plan requires that you have an S3 bucket to receive your reports. You can't
use a bucket from another account. For instructions on setting up a new S3 bucket, see
[Step 1: Create your\
first S3 bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/getstartedwiths3.md#creating-bucket) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### To create your report plan in the AWS Backup console

01. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Reports**.

03. Choose **Create report plan**.

04. Choose one of the report templates from the list.

05. Enter a unique **Report plan name**. The name must be between 1 and
     256 characters, starting with a letter, and consisting of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers
     (0-9), and underscores (\_).

06. (Optional) Enter a **Report plan description**.

07. _Compliance report templates for one account only_. Choose one or
     more frameworks on which to report. You can add a maximum 1,000 frameworks to a report
     plan.

1. Choose your AWS Region.

2. Choose a framework from that Region.

3. Choose **Add framework**.

08. (Optional) To add tags to your report plan, choose **Add tags to the report**
    **plan**.

09. If you are using a management account, you can specify which accounts you want to
     include in this report plan. You can select **Only my account**, which
     will generate reports on just the account to which you’re currently logged in. Or, you
     can select **One or more accounts in my organization**
     ( _available to management and delegated administrator_
    _accounts_).

10. ( _If you are creating a compliance report for one Region only, skip this_
    _step_). You can select which Regions to include in your report. Click the
     drop down menu to show Regions available to you. Select _All available_
    _Regions_ or the Regions you prefer.
    1. The **Include new Regions when they are incorporated into Backup Audit**
       **Manager** check box will trigger new Regions to be included in your
        reports when they become available.
11. Choose the **File format** of your report. All reports can be
     exported in CSV format. Additionally, reports for a single Region can be exported
     in JSON format.

12. For **S3 bucket name**, choose a bucket from your account.

13. (Optional) Enter a bucket prefix.

    AWS Backup delivers your _current account, current Region_ reports to
     `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/Backup/accountID/Region/year/month/day/report-name`.

    AWS Backup delivers your _cross-account_ reports to
     `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/Backup/crossaccount/Region/year/month/day/report-name`

    AWS Backup delivers your _cross-Region_ reports to
     `s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/Backup/accountID/crossregion/year/month/day/report-name`

14. Choose **Create report plan**.

Next, you must allow your S3 bucket to receive reports from AWS Backup. After you create a
report plan, AWS Backup Audit Manager automatically generates an S3 bucket access policy for you
to apply.

If you encrypt your bucket using a customer managed KMS key, the KMS key policy must
meet the following requirements:

- The `Principal` attribute must include the Backup Audit Manager
service-linked role [`AWSServiceRolePolicyForBackupReports`](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) ARN.

- The `Action` attribute must include `kms:GenerateDataKey` and
`kms:Decrypt` at minimum.

The policy [AWSServiceRolePolicyForBackupReports](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) has these permissions.

###### To view and apply this access policy to your S3 bucket

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Reports**.

3. Under **Report plan name**, select a report plan by choosing its
    name.

4. Choose **Edit**.

5. Choose **View access policy for S3 bucket**. You can also use the
    policy at the end of this procedure.

6. Choose **Copy permissions**.

7. Choose **Edit bucket policy**. Note that until the backup report is
    created the first time, the service-linked role referred to in the S3 bucket policy will
    not yet exist, resulting in the error "Invalid principal".

8. Copy the permissions to the **Policy**.

**Sample bucket policy**

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal":{
        "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-service-role/reports.backup.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForBackupReports"
      },
      "Action":"s3:PutObject",
      "Resource":[
        "arn:aws:s3:::BucketName/*"
      ],
      "Condition":{
        "StringEquals":{
          "s3:x-amz-acl":"bucket-owner-full-control"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

If you use a custom AWS Key Management Service to encrypt your target S3 bucket that stores the reports,
include the following actions in your policy:

```JSON

      "Action":[
        "kms:GenerateDataKey",
        "kms:Encrypt"
      ],
      "Resource":[
        "*"
      ],
```
