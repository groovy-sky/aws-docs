# ListTags

Returns the tags assigned to the resource, such as a target recovery point, backup plan,
or backup vault.

This operation returns results depending on the resource type used in the value for
`resourceArn`. For example, recovery points of Amazon DynamoDB with
Advanced Settings have an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that begins with
`arn:aws:backup`. Recovery points (backups) of DynamoDB without
Advanced Settings enabled have an ARN that begins with
`arn:aws:dynamodb`.

When this operation is called and when you include values of `resourceArn`
that have an ARN other than `arn:aws:backup`, it may return one of the
exceptions listed below. To prevent this exception, include only values representing
resource types that are fully managed by AWS Backup. These have an ARN that begins
`arn:aws:backup` and they are noted in the [Feature availability by resource](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource) table.
