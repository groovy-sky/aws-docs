**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Hello Amazon Glacier

The following code example shows how to get started using Amazon Glacier.

.NET

**SDK for .NET**

###### Note

There's more on GitHub. Find the complete example and learn how to set up and run in the
[AWS Code\
Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/dotnetv3/EventBridge).

```csharp

using Amazon.Glacier;
using Amazon.Glacier.Model;

namespace GlacierActions;

public static class HelloGlacier
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        var glacierService = new AmazonGlacierClient();

        Console.WriteLine("Hello Amazon Glacier!");
        Console.WriteLine("Let's list your Glacier vaults:");

        // You can use await and any of the async methods to get a response.
        // Let's get the vaults using a paginator.
        var glacierVaultPaginator = glacierService.Paginators.ListVaults(
            new ListVaultsRequest { AccountId = "-" });

        await foreach (var vault in glacierVaultPaginator.VaultList)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{vault.CreationDate}:{vault.VaultName}, ARN:{vault.VaultARN}");
        }
    }
}
