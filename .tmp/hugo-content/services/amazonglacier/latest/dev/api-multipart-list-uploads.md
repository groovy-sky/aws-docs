**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# List Multipart Uploads (GET multipart-uploads)

## Description

This multipart upload operation lists in-progress multipart uploads for the specified
vault. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by
an [Initiate Multipart Upload (POST multipart-uploads)](api-multipart-initiate-upload.md) request, but has not yet been
completed or stopped. The list returned in the List Multipart Upload response has no
guaranteed order.

The List Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default, this operation
returns up to 50 multipart uploads in the response. You should always check the
`marker` field in the response body for a marker at which to continue the
list; if there are no more items the `marker` field is `null`.

If the `marker` is not null, to fetch the next set of multipart uploads you
sent another List Multipart Uploads request with the `marker` request
parameter set to the marker value Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) returned in response to your
previous List Multipart Uploads request.

Note the difference between this operation and the [List Parts (GET uploadID)](api-multipart-list-parts.md))
operation. The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart uploads for a vault.
The List Parts operation returns parts of a specific multipart upload identified by an
Upload ID.

For information about multipart upload, see [Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload)](uploading-archive-mpu.md).

## Requests

### Syntax

To list multipart uploads, send a `GET` request to the URI of the
`multipart-uploads` subresource of the vault. You may optionally
specify `marker` and `limit` parameters.

```nohighlight

GET /AccountId/vaults/VaultName/multipart-uploads HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

### Request Parameters

Name  Description  Required `limit`

Specifies the maximum number of uploads returned in the response body. If not
specified, the List Uploads operation returns up to 50
uploads.

Type: String

Constraints: Minimum integer value of `1`. Maximum integer value of
`50`.

No`marker`

An opaque string used for pagination. `marker` specifies the upload at
which the listing of uploads should begin. Get the
`marker` value from a previous List Uploads
response. You need only include the `marker` if you
are continuing the pagination of results started in a previous
List Uploads request.

Type: String

Constraints: None

No

{
  "Marker": String,
  "UploadsList" : [
    {

  ]
}
```

### Response Headers

This operation uses only response headers that are common to most responses. For information about common response headers, see
[Common Response Headers](api-common-response-headers.md).

### Response Body

The response body contains the following JSON fields.

**ArchiveDescription**

The description of the archive that was specified in the Initiate Multipart Upload
request. This field is `null` if no archive description was
specified in the Initiate Multipart Upload operation.

_Type_: String

**CreationDate**

The UTC time that the multipart upload was initiated.

_Type_: String. A string representation in the ISO 8601 date format, for example `2013-03-20T17:03:43.221Z`.

**Marker**

An opaque string that represents where to continue pagination of the results. You use
the `marker` in a new List Multipart Uploads request to
obtain more uploads in the list. If there are no more uploads, this
value is `null`.

_Type_: String

**PartSizeInBytes**

The part size specified in the [Initiate Multipart Upload (POST multipart-uploads)](api-multipart-initiate-upload.md) request. This is the
size of all the parts in the upload except the last part, which may be
smaller than this size.

_Type_: Number

**MultipartUploadId**

The ID of the multipart upload.

_Type_: String

**UploadsList**

A list of metadata about multipart upload objects. Each item in the list contains a set
of name-value pairs for the corresponding upload, including
`ArchiveDescription`, `CreationDate`,
`MultipartUploadId`, `PartSizeInBytes`, and
`VaultARN`.

_Type_: Array

**VaultARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault that contains the archive.

_Type_: String

### Errors

For information about Amazon Glacier
exceptions and error messages, see [Error Responses](api-error-responses.md).

## Examples

### Example: List All Multipart Uploads

The following example lists all the multipart uploads in progress for the vault. The
example shows an HTTP `GET` request to the URI of the
`multipart-uploads` subresource of a specified vault. Because the
`marker` and `limit` parameters are not specified in the
request, up to 1,000 in-progress multipart uploads are returned.

#### Example Request

```nohighlight

GET /-/vaults/examplevault/multipart-uploads HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
x-amz-Date: 20170210T120000Z
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20141123/us-west-2/glacier/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-amz-glacier-version,Signature=9257c16da6b25a715ce900a5b45b03da0447acf430195dcb540091b12966f2a2
```

#### Example Response

In the response Amazon Glacier returns a list of all in-progress multipart uploads for the
specified vault. The `marker` field is `null`, which
indicates that there are no more uploads to list.

### Example: Partial List of Multipart Uploads

The following example demonstrates how to use pagination to get a limited number of
results. The example shows an HTTP `GET` request to the URI of the
`multipart-uploads` subresource for a specified vault. In this
example, the `limit` parameter is set to 1, which means that only one
upload is returned in the list, and the `marker` parameter indicates the
multipart upload ID at which the returned list begins.

#### Example Request

```nohighlight

GET /-/vaults/examplevault/multipart-uploads?limit=1&marker=xsQdFIRsfJr20CW2AbZBKpRZAFTZSJIMtL2hYf8mvp8dM0m4RUzlaqoEye6g3h3ecqB_zqwB7zLDMeSWhwo65re4C4Ev HTTP/1.1

```

#### Example Response

In the response, Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) returns a list of no more than two in-progress multipart
uploads for the specified vault, starting at the specified marker and returning
two results.
