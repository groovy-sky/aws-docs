**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy)

## Description

This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the following:

- Installing a vault lock policy on the specified vault.

- Setting the lock state of vault lock to `InProgress`.

- Returning a lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking process.

You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be up to 20 KB in size.
For more information about vault lock policies, see [Vault Lock Policies](vault-lock-policy.md).

You must complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the vault lock enters the
`InProgress` state. After the 24 hour window ends, the lock ID expires,
the vault automatically exits the `InProgress` state, and the vault lock
policy is removed from the vault. You call [Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId)](api-completevaultlock.md) to complete the vault locking process by
setting the state of the vault lock to `Locked`.

###### Note

After a vault lock is in the `Locked` state, you cannot initiate a new vault lock
for the vault.

You can stop the vault locking process by calling [Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy)](api-abortvaultlock.md). You can get the state of the vault lock by
calling [Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy)](api-getvaultlock.md). For more
information about the vault locking process, see [Amazon Glacier Vault Lock](vault-lock.md).

If this operation is called when the vault lock is in the `InProgress` state, the
operation returns an `AccessDeniedException` error. When the vault lock is in
the `InProgress` state you must call [Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy)](api-abortvaultlock.md) before you can initiate a new vault lock
policy.

## Requests

To initiate the vault locking process, send an HTTP `POST` request to the URI of
the `lock-policy` subresource of the vault, as shown in the following syntax
example.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

POST /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
Content-Length: Length
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01

{
  "Policy": "string"
}
```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

### Request Parameters

This operation does not use request parameters.

x-amzn-RequestId: x-amzn-RequestId
Date: Date
x-amz-lock-id: lockId

```

### Response Headers

A successful response includes the following response headers, in addition to the response headers that are common to all operations. For more information about common response headers, see
[Common Response Headers](api-common-response-headers.md).

Name  Description `x-amz-lock-id`

Type: String

### Response Body

This operation does not return a response body.

### Errors

For information about Amazon Glacier
exceptions and error messages, see [Error Responses](api-error-responses.md).

## Examples

### Example Request

The following example sends an HTTP `PUT` request to the URI of the
vault's `lock-policy` subresource. The `Policy` JSON string
uses "\\" as an escape character.

```nohighlight

PUT /-/vaults/examplevault/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
x-amz-Date: 20170210T120000Z

```

### Example Response

If the request was successful, Amazon Glacier returns an `HTTP 201 Created` response, as
shown in the following example.

```

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
