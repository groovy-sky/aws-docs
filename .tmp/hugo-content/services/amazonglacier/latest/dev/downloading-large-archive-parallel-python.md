**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Downloading a Large Archive Using Parallel Processing with Python

This topic describes how to download a large archive from Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) using parallel processing with Python. This approach allows you to reliably download archives of any size by breaking them into smaller pieces that can be processed independently.

## Overview

The Python script provided in this example performs the following tasks:

1. Sets up the necessary AWS resources (Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS queues) for notifications

2. Initiates an archive retrieval job with Amazon Glacier

3. Monitors an Amazon SQS queue for job completion notifications

4. Splits the large archive into manageable chunks

5. Downloads chunks in parallel using multiple worker threads

6. Saves each chunk to disk for later reassembly

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.6 or later installed

- AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) installed

- AWS credentials configured with appropriate permissions for Amazon Glacier, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS

- Sufficient disk space to store the downloaded archive chunks

## Example: Downloading an Archive Using Parallel Processing with Python

The following Python script demonstrates how to download a large archive from Amazon Glacier using parallel processing:

```python

notify_queue_name = 'GlacierJobCompleteNotifyQueue' # SQS queue for Glacier recall notification
chunk_download_queue_name='GlacierChunkReadyNotifyQueue' # SQS queue for chunks
sns_topic_name = 'GlacierRecallJobCompleted' # the SNS topic to be notified when Glacier archive is restored.
chunk_queue_visibility_timeout = 7200 # 2 hours - this may need to be adjusted.
region = 'us-east-1'
archive_id = "archive_id_to_restore"
retrieve_archive = True # set to false if you do not want to restore from Glacier - useful for restarting or parallel processing of the chunk queue.
workers = 12 # the number of parallel worker threads for downloading chunks.

## Using the Script

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Replace the placeholder values in the script with your specific information:

- `output_file_path`: Directory where chunk files will be saved

- `vault_name`: Name of your S3 Glacier vault

- `notify_queue_name`: Name for the job notification queue

- `chunk_download_queue_name`: Name for the chunk download queue

- `sns_topic_name`: Name for the SNS topic

- `region`: AWS region where your vault is located

- `archive_id`: ID of the archive to retrieve

2. Run the script:

```

python download_large_archive.py
```

3. After all chunks are downloaded, you can combine them into a single file using a command like:

```

cat /path/to/chunks/*.chunk > complete_archive.file
```

## Important Considerations

When using this script, keep the following in mind:

- Archive retrieval from S3 Glacier can take several hours to complete, depending on the retrieval tier selected.

- The script runs indefinitely, continuously polling the queues. You may want to add a termination condition based on your specific requirements.

- Ensure you have sufficient disk space to store all the chunks of your archive.

- If the script is interrupted, you can restart it with `retrieve_archive=False` to continue downloading chunks without initiating a new retrieval job.

- Adjust the `chunk_size` and `workers` parameters based on your network bandwidth and system resources.

- Standard AWS charges apply for Amazon S3 retrievals, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS usage.
