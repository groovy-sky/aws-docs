**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Describe Job (GET JobID)

## Description

This operation returns information about a job you previously initiated, including the job
initiation date, the user who initiated the job, the job status code/message, and the
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to notify after Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) completes the job. For more information
about initiating a job, see [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](api-initiate-job-post.md).

###### Note

This operation enables you to check the status of your job. However, we strongly recommend
that you set up an Amazon SNS topic and specify it in your initiate job request so that
Amazon Glacier can notify the topic after it completes the job.

A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Amazon Glacier completes the job.

## Requests

### Syntax

To obtain information about a job, you use the HTTP `GET` method and scope the
request to the specific job. Note that the relative URI path is the same one that
Amazon Glacier returned to you when you initiated the job.

```nohighlight

GET /AccountID/vaults/VaultName/jobs/JobID HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: date
Authorization: signatureValue
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

###### Note

In the request, if you omit the `JobID`, the response returns a list of all
active jobs on the specified vault. For more information about listing jobs,
see [List Jobs (GET jobs)](api-jobs-get.md).

### Request Parameters

This operation does not use request parameters.

### Request Headers

This operation uses only request headers that are common to all operations. For information about common request headers, see
[Common Request Headers](api-common-request-headers.md).

### Request Body

This operation does not have a request body.

### Response Headers

This operation uses only response headers that are common to most responses. For information about common response headers, see
[Common Response Headers](api-common-response-headers.md).

### Response Body

The response body contains the following JSON fields.

**Action**

The job type. It is either `ArchiveRetrieval`,
`InventoryRetrieval`, or `Select`.

_Type_: String

**ArchiveId**

The archive ID requested for a select or archive retrieval job. Otherwise, this field is
`null`.

_Type_: String

**ArchiveSHA256TreeHash**

The SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive for an archive retrieval job. For inventory
retrieval jobs, this field is `null`.

_Type_: String

**ArchiveSizeInBytes**

For an `ArchiveRetrieval` job, this is the size in bytes of the archive being
requested for download. For the `InventoryRetrieval` job, the
value is `null`.

_Type_: Number

**Completed**

The job status. When an archive or inventory retrieval job is completed, you get the
job's output using the [Get Job Output (GET output)](api-job-output-get.md).

_Type_: Boolean

**CompletionDate**

The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time that the job request completed. While the job
is in progress, the value is null.

_Type_: String

**CreationDate**

The UTC time that the job was created.

_Type_: A string representation in the ISO 8601 date format, for example `2013-03-20T17:03:43.221Z`.

**InventoryRetrievalParameters**

Input parameters used for a range inventory retrieval.

_Type_: [InventoryRetrievalJobInput](api-inventoryretrievaljobinput.md) object

**InventorySizeInBytes**

For an `InventoryRetrieval` job, this is the size in bytes of the inventory
requested for download. For the `ArchiveRetrieval` or `Select` job, the
value is `null`.

_Type_: Number

**JobDescription**

The job description you provided when you initiated the job.

_Type_: String

**JobId**

The ID that identifies the job in Amazon Glacier.

_Type_: String

**JobOutputPath**

Contains the job output location.

_Type_: String

**OutputLocation**

An object that contains information about the location where the
select job results and errors are stored.

_Type_: [OutputLocation](api-outputlocation.md) object

**RetrievalByteRange**

The retrieved byte range for archive retrieval jobs in the form
" `StartByteValue`- `EndByteValue`."
If you don't specify a range in the archive retrieval, then the whole
archive is retrieved; also _StartByteValue_ equals 0,
and _EndByteValue_ equals the size of the archive
minus 1. For inventory retrieval or select jobs, this field is
`null`.

_Type_: String

**SelectParameters**

An object that contains information about the parameters used for a
select.

_Type_: [SelectParameters](api-selectparameters.md) object

**SHA256TreeHash**

The SHA256 tree hash value for the requested range of an archive.
If the [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](api-initiate-job-post.md) request for an archive
specified a tree-hash aligned range, then this field returns a value.
For more information about tree-hash alignment for archive range
retrievals, see [Receiving Checksums When Downloading Data](checksum-calculations-range.md).

For the specific case when the whole archive is retrieved, this value
is the same as the `ArchiveSHA256TreeHash` value.

This field is `null` in the following situations:

- Archive retrieval jobs that specify a range that is not
tree-hash aligned.

- Archival jobs that specify a range that is equal to the whole archive and the job
status is `InProgress`.

- Inventory jobs.

- Select jobs.

_Type_: String

**SNSTopic**

An Amazon SNS topic that receives notification.

_Type_: String

**StatusCode**

The code indicating the status of the job.

_Valid Values_: `InProgress` \| `Succeeded` \|
`Failed`

_Type_: String

**StatusMessage**

A friendly message that describes the job status.

_Type_: String

**Tier**

The data access tier to use for the select or archive retrieval.

_Valid Values_: `Bulk` \| `Expedited` \|
`Standard`

_Type_: String

**VaultARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault of which the job is a subresource.

_Type_: String

### Errors

For information about Amazon Glacier
exceptions and error messages, see [Error Responses](api-error-responses.md).

## Examples

The following example shows the request for a job that retrieves an archive.

### Example Request: Get job description

```nohighlight

GET /-/vaults/examplevault/jobs/HkF9p6o7yjhFx-K3CGl6fuSm6VzW9T7esGQfco8nUXVYwS0jlb5gq1JZ55yHgt5vP54ZShjoQzQVVh7vEXAMPLEjobID HTTP/1.1

```

### Example Response

The response body includes JSON that describes the specified job. Note that for both the
inventory retrieval and archive retrieval jobs, the JSON fields are the same.
However, when a field doesn't apply to the type of job, its value is
`null`. The following is an example response for an archive retrieval
job. Note the following:

- The `Action` field value is `ArchiveRetrieval`.

- The `ArchiveSizeInBytes` field shows the size of the
archive requested in the archive retrieval job.

- The `ArchiveSHA256TreeHash` field shows the SHA256 tree
hash for the entire archive.

- The `RetrievalByteRange` field shows the range requested in
the Initiate Job request. In this example, the whole archive is
requested.

- The `SHA256TreeHash` field shows the SHA256 tree hash for the range requested
in the Initiate Job request. In this example, it is the same as the
`ArchiveSHA256TreeHash` field, which means that the whole
archive was requested.

- The `InventorySizeInBytes` field value is `null` because it does not apply to
an archive retrieval job.

The following is an example response for an inventory retrieval job. Note the
following:

- The `Action` field value is `InventoryRetrieval`.

- The `ArchiveSizeInBytes`, `ArchiveSHA256TreeHash`, and
`RetrievalByteRange` field values are null because these
fields do not apply to an inventory retrieval job.

- The `InventorySizeInBytes` field value is `null` because the job
is still in progress, and has not fully prepared the inventory for download.
If the job was completed before your describe job request, this field would
give you the size of the output.
