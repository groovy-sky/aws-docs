**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Tagging Your Amazon Glacier Vaults

You can assign your own metadata to Amazon Glacier vaults in the form of tags. A
_tag_ is a key-value pair that you define for a vault. For basic
information about tagging, including restrictions on tags, see [Tagging Amazon Glacier Resources](tagging.md).

The following topics describe how you can add, list, and remove tags for vaults.

## Tagging Vaults by Using the AWS CLI

Follow these steps to add, list, or remove tags by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

Each tag is composed of a key and a value. Each vault can have up to 50 tags.

1. To add tags to a vault, use the `add-tags-to-vault` command.

```nohighlight

aws glacier add-tags-to-vault --vault-name examplevault --account-id 111122223333 --tags id=1234,date=2020
```

    For more information on this vault operation, see [Add Tags To Vault](api-addtagstovault.md).

2. To list all the tags attached to a vault, use the `list-tags-for-vault`
    command.

```nohighlight

aws glacier list-tags-for-vault --vault-name examplevault --account-id 111122223333
```

    For more information on this vault operation, see [List Tags For Vault](api-listtagsforvault.md).

3. To remove one or more tags from the set of tags attached to a vault, use the
    `remove-tags-from-vault` command.

```nohighlight

aws glacier remove-tags-from-vault --vault-name examplevault --account-id 111122223333 --tag-keys date
```

For more information on this vault operation, see [Remove Tags From Vault](api-removetagsfromvault.md).

## Tagging Vaults by Using the Amazon Glacier API

following documentation:

[Add Tags To Vault (POST tags add)](api-addtagstovault.md)
