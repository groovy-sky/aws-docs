# AMD drivers for your EC2 instance

An instance with an attached AMD GPU, such as a G4ad instance, must have the
appropriate AMD driver installed. Depending on your requirements, you can either use an
AMI with the driver preinstalled or download a driver from Amazon S3.

To install NVIDIA drivers on an instance with an attached NVIDIA GPU, such as a G4dn
instance, see [NVIDIA drivers](install-nvidia-driver.md) instead.

## AMIs with the AMD driver installed

AWS offers different Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that come with the AMD drivers
installed. Open [Marketplace offerings with the AMD driver](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?VendorId=e6a5002c-6dd0-4d1e-8196-0a1d1857229b&filters=VendorId&page=1&searchTerms=AMD+Radeon+Pro+Driver).

## AMD driver download

If you aren't using an AMI with the AMD driver installed, you can download the AMD
driver and install it on your instance. Only the following operating system versions
support AMD drivers:

- Amazon Linux 2 with kernel version 5.4

- Ubuntu 20.04

- Ubuntu 22.04

- Ubuntu 24.04

- Windows Server 2016

- Windows Server 2019

- Windows Server 2022

These downloads are available to AWS customers only. By downloading, you agree
to use the downloaded software only to develop AMIs for use with the AMD Radeon
Pro V520 hardware. Upon installation of the software, you are bound by the terms of
the [AMD End User License Agreement](https://www.amd.com/en/legal/eula.html).

1. Connect to your Windows instance and open a PowerShell window.

2. Configure default credentials for the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell on your Windows instance.
    For more information, see [Getting Started with the\
    AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](../../../powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-started.md) in the _AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide_.

###### Important

Your user or role must have the permissions granted that contains the
**AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy. For more
information, see [AWS managed policy: AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess](../../../s3/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.md#security-iam-awsmanpol-amazons3readonlyaccess) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

3. Set the key prefix according to your version of Windows:

- Windows 10 and Windows 11

```powershell

$KeyPrefix = "latest/AMD_GPU_WINDOWS10"
```

- Windows Server 2016

```powershell

$KeyPrefix = "archives"
```

- Windows Server 2019

```powershell

$KeyPrefix = "latest/AMD_GPU_WINDOWS_2K19" # use "archives" for Windows Server 2016
```

- Windows Server 2022

```powershell

$KeyPrefix = "latest/AMD_GPU_WINDOWS_2K22"
```

4. Download the drivers from Amazon S3 to your desktop using the following
    PowerShell commands.

```powershell

$Bucket = "ec2-amd-windows-drivers"
$LocalPath = "$home\Desktop\AMD"
$Objects = Get-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -KeyPrefix $KeyPrefix -Region us-east-1
foreach ($Object in $Objects) {
$LocalFileName = $Object.Key
if ($LocalFileName -ne '' -and $Object.Size -ne 0) {
       $LocalFilePath = Join-Path $LocalPath $LocalFileName
       Copy-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -Key $Object.Key -LocalFile $LocalFilePath -Region us-east-1
       }
}
```

5. Unzip the downloaded driver file and run the installer using the following
    PowerShell commands.

```powershell

Expand-Archive $LocalFilePath -DestinationPath "$home\Desktop\AMD\$KeyPrefix" -Verbose

```

Now, check the content of the new directory. The directory name can be
    retrieved using the `Get-ChildItem` PowerShell command.

```powershell

Get-ChildItem "$home\Desktop\AMD\$KeyPrefix"
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```
Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\AMD\latest

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
   ----                -------------         ------ ----
d-----       10/13/2021  12:52 AM                210414a-365562C-Retail_End_User.2
```

Install the drivers:

```powershell

pnputil /add-driver $home\Desktop\AMD\$KeyPrefix\*.inf /install /subdirs
```

6. Follow the instructions to install the driver and reboot your instance as
    required.

7. To verify that the GPU is working properly, check Device Manager. You
    should see "AMD Radeon Pro V520 MxGPU" listed as a display adapter.

8. To help take advantage of the four displays of up to 4K resolution, set up
    the high-performance display protocol, [Amazon DCV](../../../dcv/index.md).
