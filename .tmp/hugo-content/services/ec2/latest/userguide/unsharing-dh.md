# Unshare a Dedicated Host that is shared with other AWS accounts

The Dedicated Host owner can unshare a shared Dedicated Host at any time. When you unshare a shared
Dedicated Host, the following rules apply:

- Consumers with whom the Dedicated Host was shared can no longer launch new instances
onto it.

- Instances owned by consumers that were running on the Dedicated Host at the time of
unsharing continue to run but are scheduled for [retirement](schedevents-actions-retire.md).
Consumers receive retirement notifications for the
instances and they have two weeks to take action on the notifications.
However, if the Dedicated Host is reshared with the consumer within the retirement
notice period, the instance retirements are cancelled.

To unshare a shared Dedicated Host that you own, you must remove it from the resource share.
