## EFA driver metrics for an Amazon EC2 instance

The Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) driver publishes multiple metrics from the instances that have EFA
interfaces attached, in real time. You can use these metrics to troubleshoot application
performance and networking issues, choose the right cluster size for a workload,
plan scaling activities proactively, and benchmark applications to determine whether they
maximize the EFA performance available on an instance.

### Available EFA driver metrics

The EFA driver publishes the following metrics to the instance in real time. They provide
the cumulative number of errors, connection events, and packets or bytes sent, received,
retransmitted, or dropped by the attached EFA devices since instance launch or the last
driver reset.

### Retrieve EFA driver metrics for your instance

You can use the [rdma-tool](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/rdma.8.html)
command line tool to retrieve the metrics for all EFA interfaces attached to an instance as
follows:

```nohighlight

$ rdma -p statistic show
link rdmap0s31/1
    tx_bytes 0
    tx_pkts 0
    rx_bytes 0
    rx_pkts 0
    rx_drops 0
    send_bytes 0
    send_wrs 0
    recv_bytes 0
    recv_wrs 0
    rdma_read_wrs 0
    rdma_read_bytes 0
    rdma_read_wr_err 0
    rdma_read_resp_bytes 0
    rdma_write_wrs 0
    rdma_write_bytes 0
    rdma_write_wr_err 0
    retrans_bytes 0
    retrans_pkts 0
    retrans_timeout_events 0
    unresponsive_remote_events 0
    impaired_remote_conn_events 0
```

Alternatively, you can retrieve the metrics for each EFA interface attached to an instance
from the sys files using the following command.

```nohighlight

$ more /sys/class/infiniband/device_number/ports/port_number/hw_counters/* | cat
```

For example

```nohighlight

$ more /sys/class/infiniband/rdmap0s31/ports/1/hw_counters/* | cat

## Amazon VPC flow logs

You can create an Amazon VPC Flow Log to capture information about the traffic going to and from
an EFA. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3. After you create a
flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination. For more
information, see [VPC Flow Logs](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.md) in
the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

You create a flow log for an EFA in the same way that you create a flow log for an
elastic network interface. For more information, see [Create a flow\
log](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-flow-logs.md#create-flow-log) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

In the flow log entries, EFA traffic is identified by the `srcAddress` and
`destAddress`, which are both formatted as MAC addresses, as shown in
the following example.

```nohighlight

version accountId  eniId        srcAddress        destAddress       sourcePort destPort protocol packets bytes start      end        action log-status
2       3794735123 eni-10000001 01:23:45:67:89:ab 05:23:45:67:89:ab -          -        -        9       5689  1521232534 1524512343 ACCEPT OK
```

## Amazon CloudWatch

If you are using EFA in an Amazon EKS cluster, you can monitor your EFAs using
CloudWatch Container Insights. Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights supports all of the
[EFA driver metrics](#efa-driver-metrics), except:
`retrans_bytes`, `retrans_pkts`, `retrans_timeout_events`, `unresponsive_remote_events`, and `impaired_remote_conn_events`.

For more information, see [Amazon EKS and Kubernetes Container Insights metrics](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/container-insights-metrics-enhanced-eks.md#Container-Insights-metrics-EFA) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.
