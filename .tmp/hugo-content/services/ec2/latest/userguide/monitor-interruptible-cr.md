# Monitor interruptible Capacity Reservations with EventBridge and CloudTrail

Interruptible Capacity Reservations send EventBridge notifications and CloudTrail events to help you monitor and respond to capacity changes.

## EventBridge notifications

You receive two types of EventBridge notifications. For information about how to set up EventBridge notifications, see [Creating Amazon EventBridge rules](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.md).

### Instance interruption warning

If you're running instances in an interruptible reservation, you receive this notification 2 minutes before your instances are terminated:

```nohighlight

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Capacity Reservation Instance Interruption Warning",
    "source": "aws.ec2",
    "account": "[instance owner Account ID]",
    "time": "[Current time in yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ]",
    "resources": "[instance arn]",
    "region": "[region]",
    "detail": {
        "instance-id": "[instance-id]",
        "instance-action": "terminate",
        "instance-termination-time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ",
        "azId": "[availability-zone-id]"
    }
}
```

### Reclamation completion

If you own the source reservation, you receive this notification when capacity reclamation finishes:

```nohighlight

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Interruptible Capacity Reservation Allocation Reclamation Completed",
    "source": "aws.ec2",
    "account": "[source Capacity Reservation Owner Account ID]",
    "time": "[Current time in yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ]",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": ["source_cr_arn"],
    "detail": {
        "sourceCapacityReservationId": "string",
        "instanceType": "string",
        "availabilityZoneId": "string",
        "TotalInstanceCount": "current total count in the source",
        "ReclaimedInstanceCount": "count of instances added to the source",
        "targetInstanceCount": "number"
    }
}
```

## CloudTrail events

CloudTrail logs these events for interruptible Capacity Reservations:

- `InterruptibleCapacityReservationCreated` — When you create an interruptible allocation

- `InterruptibleCapacityReservationAllocationUpdated` — When you modify the allocation

- `InterruptibleCapacityReservationCancelled` — When you cancel the allocation

- `CapacityReservationModified` — When we modify the source reservation for allocation

- `InterruptibleCapacityReservationInstancesTerminated` — When we terminate instances during reclamation
