# Security group rules for different use cases

You can create a security group and add rules that reflect the role of the instance that's
associated with the security group. For example, an instance that's configured as a web
server needs security group rules that allow inbound HTTP and HTTPS access. Likewise, a
database instance needs rules that allow access for the type of database, such as access
over port 3306 for MySQL.

The following are examples of the kinds of rules that you can add to security groups
for specific kinds of access.

###### Examples

- [Web server rules](#sg-rules-web-server)

- [Database server rules](#sg-rules-db-server)

- [Rules to connect to instances from your computer](#sg-rules-local-access)

- [Rules to connect to instances from an instance with the same security group](#sg-rules-other-instances)

- [Rules for ping/ICMP](#sg-rules-ping)

- [DNS server rules](#sg-rules-dns)

- [Amazon EFS rules](#sg-rules-efs)

- [Elastic Load Balancing rules](#sg-rules-elb)

For instructions, see [Create a security group](creating-security-group.md) and [Configure security group rules](changing-security-group.md#add-remove-security-group-rules).

## Web server rules

The following inbound rules allow HTTP and HTTPS access from any IP address. If
your VPC is enabled for IPv6, you can add rules to control inbound HTTP and HTTPS
traffic from IPv6 addresses.

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortSource IPNotesTCP680 (HTTP)0.0.0.0/0Allows inbound HTTP access from any IPv4 addressTCP6443 (HTTPS)0.0.0.0/0Allows inbound HTTPS access from any IPv4 addressTCP680 (HTTP)::/0Allows inbound HTTP access from any IPv6
addressTCP6443 (HTTPS)::/0Allows inbound HTTPS access from any IPv6
address

## Database server rules

The following inbound rules are examples of rules you might add for database
access, depending on what type of database you're running on your instance. For more
information about Amazon RDS instances, see the [Amazon RDS User Guide](../../../amazonrds/latest/userguide.md).

For the source IP, specify one of the following:

- A specific IP address or range of IP addresses (in CIDR block notation) in your local
network

- A security group ID for a group of instances that access the
database

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortNotesTCP61433 (MS SQL)The default port to access a Microsoft SQL Server database, for
example, on an Amazon RDS instanceTCP63306 (MYSQL/Aurora)The default port to access a MySQL or Aurora database, for

an Amazon RDS instanceTCP61521 (Oracle)The default port to access an Oracle database, for example, on an
Amazon RDS instance

You can optionally restrict outbound traffic from your database servers. For example, you
might want to allow access to the internet for software updates, but restrict all
other kinds of traffic. You must first remove the default outbound rule that allows
all outbound traffic.

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortDestination IPNotesTCP680 (HTTP)0.0.0.0/0Allows outbound HTTP access to any IPv4 addressTCP6443 (HTTPS)0.0.0.0/0Allows outbound HTTPS access to any IPv4 addressTCP680 (HTTP)::/0(IPv6-enabled VPC only) Allows outbound HTTP access to any
IPv6 addressTCP6443 (HTTPS)::/0(IPv6-enabled VPC only) Allows outbound HTTPS access to any
IPv6 address

## Rules to connect to instances from your computer

To connect to your instance, your security group must have inbound rules that
allow SSH access (for Linux instances) or RDP access (for Windows instances).

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortSource IPTCP622 (SSH)The public IPv4 address of your computer, or a range of IP addresses in your local
network. If your VPC is enabled for IPv6 and your instance has an
IPv6 address, you can enter an IPv6 address or range.TCP63389 (RDP)The public IPv4 address of your computer, or a range of IP addresses in your local
network. If your VPC is enabled for IPv6 and your instance has an
IPv6 address, you can enter an IPv6 address or range.

## Rules to connect to instances from an instance with the same security group

To allow instances that are associated with the same security group to communicate
with each other, you must explicitly add rules for this.

###### Note

If you configure routes to forward the traffic between two instances in
different subnets through a middlebox appliance, you must ensure that the security groups for both instances allow
traffic to flow between the instances. The security group for each instance must reference the private IP address of
the other instance, or the CIDR range of the subnet that contains the other instance, as the source. If you reference
the security group of the other instance as the source, this does not allow traffic to flow between the instances.

The following table describes the inbound rule for a security group that
enables associated instances to communicate with each other. The rule allows all
types of traffic.

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortsSource IP-1 (All)-1 (All)-1 (All)The ID of the security group, or the CIDR range of the subnet that contains
the other instance (see note).

## Rules for ping/ICMP

The **ping** command is a type of ICMP traffic. To ping your instance,
you must add one of the following inbound ICMP rules.

TypeProtocolSourceCustom ICMP - IPv4Echo requestThe public IPv4 address of your computer, a specific IPv4 address, or an IPv4 or IPv6
address from anywhere.All ICMP - IPv4IPv4 ICMP (1)The public IPv4 address of your computer, a specific IPv4 address, or an IPv4 or IPv6
address from anywhere.

To use the **ping6** command to ping the IPv6 address for your instance,
you must add the following inbound ICMPv6 rule.

TypeProtocolSourceAll ICMP - IPv6IPv6 ICMP (58)The IPv6 address of your computer, a specific IPv4 address, or an IPv4 or IPv6
address from anywhere.

## DNS server rules

If you've set up your EC2 instance as a DNS server, you must ensure that TCP and
UDP traffic can reach your DNS server over port 53.

For the source IP, specify one of the following:

- An IP address or range of IP addresses (in CIDR block notation) in a network

- The ID of a security group for the set of instances in your network that require access
to the DNS server

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortTCP653UDP1753

## Amazon EFS rules

If you're using an Amazon EFS file system with your Amazon EC2 instances, the security group
that you associate with your Amazon EFS mount targets must allow traffic over the NFS
protocol.

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortsSource IPNotesTCP62049 (NFS)The ID of the security groupAllows inbound NFS access from resources (including the mount
target) associated with this security group

To mount an Amazon EFS file system on your Amazon EC2 instance, you must connect to your
instance. Therefore, the security group associated with your instance must have
rules that allow inbound SSH from your local computer or local network.

Protocol typeProtocol numberPortsSource IPNotesTCP622 (SSH)The IP address range of your local computer, or the range of IP
addresses (in CIDR block notation) for your network.Allows inbound SSH access from your local computer.

## Elastic Load Balancing rules

If you register your EC2 instances with a load balancer, the security group
associated with your load balancer must allow communication with the instances.
For more information, see the following in the Elastic Load Balancing documentation.

- [Security groups for your Application Load Balancer](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-update-security-groups.md)

- [Security groups for your Network Load Balancer](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-security-groups.md)
