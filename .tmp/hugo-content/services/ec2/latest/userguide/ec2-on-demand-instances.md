# Purchasing On-Demand Instances for Amazon EC2

With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You
have full control over the instance's lifecycle—you decide when to launch, stop,
hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it.

There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. You pay only for the
seconds that your On-Demand Instances are in the `running` state, with a 60-second minimum.
The price per second for a running On-Demand Instance is fixed, and is listed on the [Amazon EC2 Pricing, On-Demand\
Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand).

We recommend that you use On-Demand Instances for applications with short-term, irregular workloads
that cannot be interrupted.

For significant savings over On-Demand Instances, use [AWS Savings Plans](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans),
[Spot Instances](using-spot-instances.md), or
[Reserved Instances for Amazon EC2 overview](ec2-reserved-instances.md).

## On-Demand Instance quotas

There are quotas for the number of running On-Demand Instances per AWS account per Region. On-Demand Instance
quotas are managed in terms of the _number of virtual central_
_processing units (vCPUs)_ that your running On-Demand Instances are using, regardless
of the instance type. Each quota type specifies the maximum number of vCPUs for one or more
instance families.

Your account includes the following quotas for On-Demand Instances. Instances that are in the
pending, stopping, stopped, and hibernated states do not count towards your On-Demand Instance
quotas. Capacity Reservations count toward your On-Demand Instance quotas, even if they are unused.

For information about the different instance families, generations, and sizes, see
the [Amazon EC2 Instance Types Guide](../instancetypes/instance-types.md).

You can launch any combination of instance types that meet your changing application
needs, as long as the number of vCPUs does not exceed your account quota. For example,
with a Standard instance quota of 256 vCPUs, you could launch 32 `m5.2xlarge`
instances (32 x 8 vCPUs) or 16 `c5.4xlarge` instances (16 x 16 vCPUs). For
more information, see [EC2 On-Demand Instance limits](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs).

### Monitor On-Demand Instance quotas and usage

You can view and manage your On-Demand Instance quotas for each Region using the following methods.

###### To view your current quotas using the Service Quotas console

1. Open the Service Quotas console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas).

2. From the navigation bar, select a Region.

3. In the filter field, enter `On-Demand`.

4. The **Applied quota value** column displays the maximum
    number of vCPUs for each On-Demand Instance quota type for your account.

###### To view your current quotas using the AWS Trusted Advisor console

Open [Service limits page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/trustedadvisor/home?) in the AWS Trusted Advisor console.

###### To configure CloudWatch alarms

With Amazon CloudWatch metrics integration, you can monitor your EC2 usage against your
quotas. You can also configure alarms to warn about approaching quotas. For more information, see [Service\
Quotas and Amazon CloudWatch alarms](../../../servicequotas/latest/userguide/configure-cloudwatch.md) in the _Service Quotas User Guide_.

### Request a quota increase

Even though Amazon EC2 automatically increases your On-Demand Instance quotas based on your usage,
you can request a quota increase if necessary. For example, if you intend to launch
more instances than your current quota allows, you can request a quota increase by
using the
Service Quotas console described in [Amazon EC2 service quotas](ec2-resource-limits.md).

## Query the prices of On-Demand Instances

You can use the Price List Service API or the AWS Price List API to query the
prices of On-Demand Instances. For more information, see [Using the AWS Price List API](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/price-changes.md)
in the _AWS Billing User Guide_.
