# Windows Service administration for EC2Launch v2 and EC2Config agents

If you've logged into your instance as a user with administrative rights, you can manage the
EC2Launch v2 and EC2Config launch agents just as you would any other Windows service. EC2Launch v1 is a
set of PowerShell scripts that is managed via scheduled task by default. This section covers service
administration for EC2Launch v2 and EC2Config.

To apply updated settings to your instance, you can stop and restart the EC2Launch v2 agent or the
EC2Config service launch agent from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) interface for Services.
Similarly, when you install a new version of the launch agent, you must stop the agent first, then
restart it when the installation is complete.

###### Note

You must open the MMC Services interface as an administrator to select these actions. To
do this, you can select **Run as administrator** from the context menu.
Alternatively, to open the interface using your keyboard, follow these steps:

1. Using the `Tab` key or arrow keys, select the **Services**
    menu item from the **Administrative Tools** menu.

2. Use the following keyboard combination to open as an administrator:
    `Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `Enter`.

The following procedures list steps to stop and start the launch agent on your instance.
