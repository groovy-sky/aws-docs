# Subscribe to macOS AMI notifications

To be notified when new AMIs are released or when bridgeOS has been updated,
subscribe for notifications using Amazon SNS.

For more information about EC2 macOS AMIs, see [Amazon EC2 macOS AMIs release notes](macos-ami-overview.md).

###### To subscribe to macOS AMI notifications

1. Open the Amazon SNS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home).

2. In the navigation bar, change the Region to **US East (N. Virginia)**,
    if necessary. You must use this Region because the SNS notifications that you
    are subscribing to were created in this Region.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Subscriptions**.

4. Choose **Create subscription**.

5. For the **Create subscription** dialog box, do the
    following:
1. For **Topic ARN**, copy and paste one of the
       following Amazon Resource Names (ARNs):

2. For **Protocol**, choose one of the following:

use to receive the notifications. After you create your subscription
you'll receive a confirmation message with the subject line `AWS
                                          Notification - Subscription Confirmation`. Open the email and
choose **Confirm subscription** to complete your
subscription

- **SMS:**

For **Endpoint**, type a phone number
that you can use to receive the notifications.

the notifications.

Whenever macOS AMIs are released, we send notifications to the subscribers
of the `amazon-ec2-macos-ami-updates` topic. Whenever bridgeOS is
updated, we send notifications to the subscribers of the
`amazon-ec2-bridgeos-updates` topic. If you no longer want to receive
these notifications, use the following procedure to unsubscribe.
