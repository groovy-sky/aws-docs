# Monitor Capacity Blocks using EventBridge

When your Capacity Block reservation starts, Amazon EC2 will emit an event through EventBridge that
indicates your capacity is ready to use. Forty minutes before your Capacity Block reservation
ends, you receive another EventBridge event that tells you that any instances running in the
reservation will begin to terminate in 10 minutes. For more information about EventBridge
events, see [Amazon EventBridge Events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events.md).

The following event structures for events emitted for Capacity Blocks:
