# Reset Windows admin password for EC2 instance using EC2Config

If you have lost your Windows administrator password and are using a Windows AMI
before Windows Server 2016, you can use the EC2Config agent to generate a new
password.

If you are using a Windows Server 2016 or later AMI, see [Reset Windows admin password for EC2 instance using EC2Launch](resettingadminpassword-ec2launch.md) or, you can use the [EC2Rescue tool](windows-server-ec2rescue.md), which uses the EC2Launch
service to generate a new password.

###### Note

If you have disabled the local administrator account on the instance and your instance
is configured for Systems Manager, you can also re-enable and reset your local administrator
password by using EC2Rescue and Run Command. For more information, see [Use EC2Rescue for Windows Server with\
Systems Manager Run Command](ec2rw-ssm.md).

###### Note

There is an AWS Systems Manager Automation document that automatically applies the manual steps
necessary to reset the local administrator password. For more information, see [Reset passwords and SSH keys on EC2 instances](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-ec2reset.md)
in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

To reset your Windows administrator password using EC2Config, you need to do the following:

- [Step 1: Verify that the EC2Config service is running](#resetting-password-ec2config-step1)

- [Step 2: Detach the root volume from the instance](#resetting-password-ec2config-step2)

- [Step 3: Attach the volume to a temporary instance](#resetting-password-ec2config-step3)

- [Step 4: Modify the configuration file](#resetting-password-ec2config-step4)

- [Step 5: Restart the original instance](#resetting-password-ec2config-step5)

## Step 1: Verify that the EC2Config service is running

Before you attempt to reset the administrator password, verify that the EC2Config service is installed and running. You use the
EC2Config service to reset the administrator password later in this section.

###### To verify that the EC2Config service is running

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and then select the
    instance that requires a password reset. This instance is referred to as the
    _original_ instance in this procedure.

3. Choose **Actions**, **Monitor and troubleshoot**,
    **Get system log**.

4. Locate the EC2 Agent entry, for example, **EC2 Agent: Ec2Config**
**service v3.18.1118**. If you see this entry, the EC2Config
    service is running.

If the system log output is empty, or if the EC2Config service is not
    running, troubleshoot the instance using the Instance Console Screenshot
    service. For more information, see [Capture a screenshot of an unreachable instance](troubleshoot-unreachable-instance.md#instance-console-screenshot).

## Step 2: Detach the root volume from the instance

You can't use EC2Config to reset an administrator password if the volume on which the password is stored is attached to
an instance as the root volume. You must detach the volume from the original instance before you can attach it to a temporary
instance as a secondary volume.

###### To detach the root volume from the instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance that requires a password reset and choose
    **Instance state**, **Stop instance**.
    After the status of the instance changes to **Stopped**,
    continue with the next step.

4. (Optional) If you have the private key that you specified when you launched
    this instance, continue with the next step. Otherwise, use the following steps
    to replace the instance with a new instance that you launch with a new key
    pair.
1. Create a new key pair using the Amazon EC2 console. To give your new key
       pair the same name as the one for which you lost the private key, you
       must first delete the existing key pair.

2. Select the instance to replace. Note the instance type, VPC, subnet,
       security group, and IAM role of the instance.

3. With the instance selected, choose **Actions**, **Image and templates**,
       **Create image**. Type a name and a description for
       the image and choose **Create image**.

4. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**. Wait for the image status to change to
       **available**. Then, select the image and choose **Launch instance from AMI**.

5. Complete the fields to launch an instance, making sure to select the same instance type, VPC, subnet,
       security group, and IAM role as the instance to replace, and then
       choose **Launch instance**.

6. When prompted, choose the key pair that you created for the new
       instance, and then choose **Launch instance**.

7. (Optional) If the original instance has an associated Elastic IP
       address, transfer it to the new instance. If the original instance has
       EBS volumes in addition to the root volume, transfer them to the new
       instance.
5. Detach the root volume from the original instance as follows:
1. Select the original instance and choose the **Storage** tab.
       Note the name of the root device under **Root device name**.
       Find the volume with this device name under **Block devices**,
       and note the volume ID.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Volumes**.

3. In the list of volumes, select the volume that you noted as the root device,
       and choose **Actions**, **Detach Volume**.
       After the volume status changes to **available**, continue
       with the next step.
6. If you created a new instance to replace your original instance, you can
    terminate the original instance now. It's no longer needed. For the
    remainder of this procedure, all references to the original instance apply to
    the new instance that you created.

## Step 3: Attach the volume to a temporary instance

Next, launch a temporary instance and attach the volume to it as a secondary volume. This is the instance you use to modify
the configuration file.

###### To launch a temporary instance and attach the volume

1. Launch the temporary instance as follows:
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, choose **Launch instances**, and then select an AMI.

      ###### Important

      To avoid disk signature collisions, you must select an AMI for a
      different version of Windows. For example, if the original instance
      runs Windows Server 2019, launch the temporary instance using the
      base AMI for Windows Server 2016.

2. Leave the default instance type and choose **Next: Configure**
      **Instance Details**.

3. On the **Configure Instance Details** page, for
       **Subnet**, select the same Availability Zone as
       the original instance and choose **Review and**
      **Launch**.

      ###### Important

      The temporary instance must be in the same Availability Zone as
      the original instance. If your temporary instance is in a different
      Availability Zone, you can't attach the original instance's root
      volume to it.

4. On the **Review Instance Launch** page, choose
       **Launch**.

5. When prompted, create a new key pair, download it to a safe location
       on your computer, and then choose **Launch**
      **Instances**.
2. Attach the volume to the temporary instance as a secondary volume as
    follows:
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Volumes**, select the
       volume that you detached from the original instance, and then choose
       **Actions**, **Attach Volume**.

2. In the **Attach Volume** dialog box, for
       **Instances**, start typing the name or ID of your
       temporary instance and select the instance from the list.

3. For **Device**, type `xvdf` (if
       it isn't already there), and choose **Attach**.

## Step 4: Modify the configuration file

After you have attached the volume to the temporary instance as a secondary volume, modify the `Ec2SetPassword` plugin in the configuration file.

###### To modify the configuration file

1. From the temporary instance, modify the configuration file on the secondary volume as follows:
1. Launch and connect to the temporary instance.

2. Use the following instructions to bring the drive online: [Make an Amazon EBS \
       volume available for use](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-using-volumes.md).

3. Navigate to the secondary volume, and open `\Program
      								Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Settings\config.xml`
       using a text editor, such as Notepad.

4. At the top of the file, find the plugin with the name
       `Ec2SetPassword`, as shown in the screenshot. Change
       the state from `Disabled` to `Enabled` and
       save the file.

      ![The area of the Config.xml file to change](../../../images/awsec2/latest/userguide/images/pwreset-config-png.md)
2. After you have modified the configuration file, detach the secondary volume from the temporary instance as follows:
1. Using the **Disk Management** utility, bring the
       volume offline.

2. Disconnect from the temporary instance and return to the Amazon EC2 console.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Volumes**,
       select the volume, and then choose **Actions**,
       **Detach Volume**. After the volume's status
       changes to **available**, continue with the next
       step.

## Step 5: Restart the original instance

After you have modified the configuration file, reattach the volume to the original instance as
the root volume and connect to the instance using its key pair to retrieve the administrator password.

1. Reattach the volume to the original instance as follows:
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Volumes**, select the volume
       that you detached from the temporary instance, and then choose **Actions**,
       **Attach Volume**.

2. In the **Attach Volume** dialog box, for
       **Instances**, start typing the name or ID of your
       original instance and then select the instance.

3. For **Device**, type
       `/dev/sda1`.

4. Choose **Attach**. After the volume status changes to
       `in-use`, continue to the next step.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**. Select the
    original instance and choose **Instance state**,
    **Start instance**. After the
    instance state changes to `Running`, continue to the next
    step.

3. Retrieve your new Windows administrator password using the private key for the
    new key pair and connect to the instance. For more information, see [Connect to your Windows instance using RDP](connecting-to-windows-instance.md).

###### Important

The instance gets a new public IP address after you stop and start it.
Make sure to connect to the instance using its current public DNS name.
For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance state changes](ec2-instance-lifecycle.md).

4. (Optional) If you have no further use for the temporary instance, you can
    terminate it. Select the temporary instance, and choose
    **Instance State**,
    **Terminate instance**.
