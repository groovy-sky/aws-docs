# Sample Amazon Linux 2023 image description

The sample Amazon Linux 2023 image description has the following characteristics:

1. **Unified Kernel Image (UKI) boot** — Boot using a single, signed binary
    that combines the kernel, `initrd`, and boot parameters into one immutable image.

2. **Read-only root filesystem** — Use Enhanced Read-Only File System
    ( `erofs`) with dm-verity protection to ensure that the root filesystem cannot be modified and maintains
    cryptographic integrity verification.

3. **Ephemeral overlay filesystem** — Create a temporary overlay filesystem
    that allows temporary writes to directories like `/etc`, `/run`, and `/var`. Since
    this overlay filesystem exists only in memory, all changes are automatically lost when the instance reboots,
    ensuring the system returns to its original trusted state.

4. **Disabled remote access methods** — Remove the following remote access
    mechanisms to prevent remote access:

Access MethodDescriptionImage description implementationSSHExcludes OpenSSH server. Makes the instance inherently incapable of handling SSH traffic.Ignore the `openssh-server` package \*User DataRemoves Cloud-init. Eliminates the ability for operators to provide user data to instances and run
boot-time scripts.Ignore the `cloud-init` and `cloud-init-cfg-ec2` packages \*ChronyDisables the chrony command port. Prevents operators from running chrony commands on running
instances.Ignore the `amazon-chrony-config` package \*MOTDRemoves MOTD package. Eliminates the ability for operators to change messages or functionality on
running instances.Ignore the `update-motd` package \*AWS SSMRemoves the AWS SSM agent. Prevents remote access to running instances using AWS SSM.Ignore the `amazon-ssm-agent` package \*EC2 Instance ConnectRemoves EC2 Instance Connect package. Disables SSH access using this tool.Ignore the `ec2-instance-connect` package \*Serial ConsoleDisables serial console. Ensures that console access is unavailable for running instances and
removes the operators' ability to login to the serial console.Disabled via kernel command line parameter
