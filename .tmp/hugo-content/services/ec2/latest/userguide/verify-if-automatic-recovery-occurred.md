# Verify if automatic instance recovery occurred

If your instance appears to have been offline and then unexpectedly rebooted, it might
have undergone [automatic instance\
recovery](ec2-instance-recover.md#ec2-automatic-instance-recovery-key-concepts) in response to an underlying hardware or software issue. You can verify this
by checking for automatic instance recovery events in your Health Dashboard. You can also check whether
an underlying hardware or software issue was detected for your instance by checking the
**StatusCheckFailed\_System** Amazon CloudWatch metric.

## Check for events in Health Dashboard

When an automatic instance recovery attempt occurs, AWS sends events to your Health Dashboard.
The specific event depends on the configured recovery mechanism and whether the attempt
succeeded or failed.

###### To check for automatic instance recovery events in the Health Dashboard

1. Open the Health Dashboard at
    [https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/](https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd).

2. Look for the events associated with automatic instance recovery. The presence of
    these events can confirm whether an attempt at automatic instance recovery occurred and
    its outcome.

- Success event: `AWS_EC2_SIMPLIFIED_AUTO_RECOVERY_SUCCESS`

- Failure event: `AWS_EC2_SIMPLIFIED_AUTO_RECOVERY_FAILURE`

- CloudWatch action based recovery

- Success event: `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_SUCCESS`

- Failure event: `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_FAILURE`

## Monitor system status checks with CloudWatch

You can verify if an underlying hardware or software issue was detected for your
instance by checking the [StatusCheckFailed\_System](viewing-metrics-with-cloudwatch.md#status-check-metrics) metric in CloudWatch. The metric value indicates whether a
system status check passed (no hardware or software issue) or failed (hardware or software
issue).

###### To verify if an underlying hardware or software issue was detected

1. Open the CloudWatch console **Metrics** page at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?#metricsV2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?).

2. Verify that you're in the same Region as your EC2 instance.

3. Paste the following metric in the **Metrics** search field, and
    press Enter.

```nohighlight

StatusCheckFailed_System
```

4. Choose **EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics**.

5. In the table, select the check box next to the instance that you want to
    check.

6. Change the query period to the time that you suspect the recovery event
    occurred.

7. Choose the **Graphed metrics** tab, and for
    **StatusCheckFailed\_System**, do the following:
1. For **Statistic**, choose either **Average**,
       **Maximum**, or **Minimum**.

2. For **Period**, choose **1 minute**.
8. Check the value for **StatusCheckFailed\_System**.

- Value of **0**: The system status check passed, indicating no
underlying hardware or software issue.

- Value of **1**: The system status check failed, indicating an
underlying hardware or software issue.
