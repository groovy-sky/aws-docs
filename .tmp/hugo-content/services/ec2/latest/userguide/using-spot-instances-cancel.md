# Cancel a Spot Instance request

If you no longer want your Spot Instance request, you can cancel it. You can only cancel Spot Instance
requests that are `open`, `active`, or
`disabled`.

- Your Spot Instance request is `open` when your request has not
yet been fulfilled and no instances have been launched.

- Your Spot Instance request is
`active` when your request has been fulfilled and Spot Instances have launched
as a result.

- Your Spot Instance request is `disabled` when you stop your Spot Instance.

If your Spot Instance request is `active` and has an associated running Spot Instance, canceling
the request does not terminate the instance. For more information about terminating
a Spot Instance, see [Terminate a Spot Instance](using-spot-instances-request.md#terminating-a-spot-instance).
