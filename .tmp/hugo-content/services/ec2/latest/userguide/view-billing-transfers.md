# View billing assignment requests for shared EC2 Capacity Reservations

A Capacity Reservation owner can view only the most recent billing assignment request that
they initiated. And consumer accounts can view only the most recent billing
assignment requests sent to them.

Requests can be viewed for 24 hours after they enter the
`cancelled`, `expired`, or `revoked`
state. After 24 hours, they can no longer be viewed.

Console

###### (Capacity Reservation owner) To view requests you initiated

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation panel, select **Capacity Reservations**
    and then choose the shared Capacity Reservation for which to view
    requests.

3. The **Billing of available capacity**
    section shows the most recent request and its current
    state.

###### (Consumer account) To requests sent to you

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation panel, select
    **Capacity Reservations**.

3. If you have pending requests, the **Pending**
**billing assignment requests** banner appears at
    the top of the screen. If the banner does not appear, you do
    not have pending requests.

To view the requests, choose **Review**
**requests** in the banner.
