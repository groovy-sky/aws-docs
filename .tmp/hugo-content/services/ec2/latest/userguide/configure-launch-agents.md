# Windows launch agents on Amazon EC2 Windows instances

Each AWS Windows AMI includes a Windows launch agent that's pre-configured with default
settings. Launch agents perform tasks during instance startup and run if an instance is
stopped and later started, or restarted. For information about a specific agent, see the
detail pages in the following list.

For more information about AWS Windows AMIs, see the [AWS \
Windows AMI reference](../windows-ami-reference/windows-amis.md).
