# Manage the IPv6 addresses for your EC2 instances

If your VPC and subnet have IPv6 CIDR blocks associated with them, you can assign an
IPv6 address to your instance during or after launch. You can access the IPv6 addresses
for your instances in the console on either the **Instances** page or
the **Network Interfaces** page. The following tasks configure IP
addresses for your instances. To configure IP addresses for your network interfaces
instead, see [Manage the IP addresses for your network interface](managing-network-interface-ip-addresses.md).

###### Tasks

- [Assign an IPv6 address to an instance](#assign-ipv6-address)

- [View the IPv6 addresses for an instance](#view-ipv6-addresses)

- [View IPv6 addresses using instance metadata](#view-ipv6-addresses-imds)

- [Unassign an IPv6 address from an instance](#unassign-ipv6-address)

## Assign an IPv6 address to an instance

You can specify an IPv6 address from the IPv6 address range of the subnet, or let
Amazon EC2 choose one for you. This address is assigned to the primary network interface.
Note that the following instance types do not support IPv6 addresses:
C1, M1, M2, M3, and T1.

Console

###### To assign an IPv6 address at launch

Follow the procedure to [launch an instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md). When you configure [Network Settings](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-network-settings), choose
the option to **Auto-assign IPv6 IP**. If you don't
see this option, the selected subnet does not have an associated
IPv6 CIDR block.

###### To assign an IPv6 address after launch

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select your instance, and choose **Actions**,
    **Networking**, **Manage IP**
**addresses**.

4. Expand the network interface. Under **IPv6**
**addresses**, choose **Assign new IP**
**address**.

5. Enter an IPv6 address from the range of the subnet, or leave
    the field blank to let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv6 address for you. If
    you don't see this option, the instance subnet does not have an
    associated IPv6 CIDR block.

6. Choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

###### To assign an IPv6 address at launch

Use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command with the
`--ipv6-addresses` option. The following example
assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```nohighlight

--ipv6-addresses Ipv6Address=2001:db8::1234:5678:1.2.3.4 Ipv6Address=2001:db8::1234:5678:5.6.7.8
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv6 addresses, use the
`--ipv6-address-count` option instead. The following
example assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```nohighlight

--ipv6-address-count 2
```

###### To assign an IPv6 address after launch

Use the [assign-ipv6-addresses](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/assign-ipv6-addresses.md) command. The following example
assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 assign-ipv6-addresses \
    --network-interface-id eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --ipv6-addresses 2001:db8::1234:5678:1.2.3.4 2001:db8::1234:5678:5.6.7.8
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv6 addresses, use the
`--ipv6-address-count` option instead. The following
example assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 assign-ipv6-addresses \
    --network-interface-id eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --ipv6-address-count 2
```

PowerShell

###### To assign an IPv6 address at launch

Use the [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md) cmdlet with the
`-Ipv6Address` parameter. The following example
assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```powershell

-Ipv6Address $ipv6addr1,$ipv6addr2
```

Define the IPv6 addresses as follows.

```powershell

$ipv6addr1 = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.InstanceIpv6Address
$ipv6addr1.Ipv6Address = "2001:db8::1234:5678:1.2.3.4"
$ipv6addr2 = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.InstanceIpv6Address
$ipv6addr2.Ipv6Address = "2001:db8::1234:5678:5.6.7.8"
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv6 addresses, use the
`-Ipv6AddressCount` parameter instead. The following
example assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```powershell

-Ipv6AddressCount 2
```

###### To assign an IPv6 address after launch

Use the [Register-EC2Ipv6AddressList](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/register-ec2ipv6addresslist.md) cmdlet. The following
example assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```powershell

Register-EC2Ipv6AddressList `
    -NetworkInterfaceId eni-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Ipv6Address "2001:db8::1234:5678:1.2.3.4","2001:db8::1234:5678:5.6.7.8"
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv6 addresses, use the
`-Ipv6AddressCount` parameter instead. The following
example assigns two IPv6 addresses.

```powershell

Register-EC2Ipv6AddressList `
    -NetworkInterfaceId eni-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Ipv6AddressCount 2
```

## View the IPv6 addresses for an instance

You can view the IPv6 addresses for your instances.

Console

###### To view the IPv6 addresses for an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select the instance.

4. On the **Networking** tab, locate
    **IPv6 addresses**.

AWS CLI

###### To view the IPv6 address for an instance

Use the [describe-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --query "Reservations[*].Instances[].Ipv6Address" \
    --output text
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

2001:db8::1234:5678:1.2.3.4
```

PowerShell

###### To view the IPv6 address for an instance

Use the [Get-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2instance.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

(Get-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0).Instances.Ipv6Address
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

2001:db8::1234:5678:1.2.3.4
```

## View IPv6 addresses using instance metadata

After you connect to your instance, you can retrieve the IPv6 addresses using
instance metadata. First, you must get the MAC address of the instance from
`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/`.
