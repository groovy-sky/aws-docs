# Host maintenance for Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host

With host maintenance, in the rare event that a Dedicated Host becomes degraded, we automatically
migrate instances running on it onto a healthy replacement Dedicated Host. This helps to minimize
the downtime for your workload, and simplify the management of your Dedicated Hosts. Host maintenance
is also performed for planned and routine Amazon EC2 maintenance.

Amazon EC2 supports two types of host maintenance:

- **Live migration host maintenance** — Instances
are automatically migrated to the replacement host within 24 hours, without stopping
and restarting them.

- **Reboot-based host maintenance** — Instances
are scheduled for _instance reboot_ scheduled events, during which
they are automatically stopped and restarted on the replacement host.

For more information about host recovery, see [Host recovery](dedicated-hosts-recovery.md).

## Considerations

- Host maintenance is available in all AWS Regions, except the
China Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

- Host maintenance is not supported in AWS Outposts,
AWS Local Zones, and AWS Wavelength Zones.

- Host maintenance can't be turned on or off for hosts already within a
host resource group. Hosts added to a host resource group retain their
host maintenance setting. For more information, see [Host resource groups](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.md).

- Host maintenance is not supported with the following instance types, because they have
instance store root volumes: C1, C3, D2, I2, M1, M2, M3, R3, and X1.

Dedicated Host integrates with **AWS License Manager**—Tracks
licenses across your Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts (supported only in Regions in which AWS License Manager is
available). For more information, see the [AWS License Manager User Guide](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/license-manager.md).

You must have sufficient licenses in your AWS account for your new Dedicated Host. The
licenses associated with your degraded host are released when the host is released
after the completion of the scheduled event.

## Pricing

There are no additional charges for using host maintenance, but the usual Dedicated Host
charges apply. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/pricing).

As soon as host maintenance is initiated, you are no longer billed for the
degraded Dedicated Host. Billing for the replacement Dedicated Host begins only after it
enters the `available` state.

If the degraded Dedicated Host was billed using the On-Demand rate, the replacement Dedicated Host is
also billed using the On-Demand rate. If the degraded Dedicated Host had an active Dedicated Host Reservation, it
is transferred to the new Dedicated Host.
