# Get started with EFA and NCCL for ML workloads on Amazon EC2

The NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) is a library of standard collective
communication routines for multiple GPUs across a single node or multiple nodes. NCCL
can be used together with EFA, Libfabric, and MPI to support various machine learning
workloads. For more information, see the [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) website.

###### Requirements

- Only accelerated computing P series instance types are supported. For more
information, see [Amazon EC2 accelerated computing instances](../instancetypes/ac.md#ac-sizes).

- Only Amazon Linux 2023, Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 24.04, and Ubuntu 22.04 base AMIs are supported.

- Only NCCL 2.4.2 and later is supported with EFA.

For more information about running machine learning workloads with EFA and
NCCL using an AWS Deep Learning AMIs, see [Using EFA on the DLAMI](../../../dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-efa-using.md) in the _AWS Deep Learning AMIs Developer Guide_.

## Step 1: Prepare an EFA-enabled security group

An EFA requires a security group that allows all inbound and outbound traffic to and from the
security group itself. The following procedure creates a security group that allows all inbound and outbound traffic to
and from itself, and that allows inbound SSH traffic from any IPv4 address for SSH connectivity.

###### Important

This security group is intended for testing purposes only. For your production environments, we recommend that you create
an inbound SSH rule that allows traffic only from the IP address from which you are connecting, such as the IP address of your computer, or
a range of IP addresses in your local network.

For other scenarios, see [Security group rules for different use cases](security-group-rules-reference.md).

###### To create an EFA-enabled security group

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups** and then
    choose **Create security group**.

3. In the **Create security group** window, do the following:
1. For **Security group name**, enter a descriptive
       name for the security group, such as `EFA-enabled security
      									group`.

2. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a brief description
       of the security group.

3. For **VPC**, select the VPC into which you intend to
       launch your EFA-enabled instances.

4. Choose **Create security group**.
4. Select the security group that you created, and on the **Details** tab,
    copy the **Security group ID**.

5. With the security group still selected, choose **Actions**, **Edit inbound rules**,
    and then do the following:
1. Choose **Add rule**.

2. For **Type**, choose **All traffic**.

3. For **Source type**, choose **Custom** and paste the security group ID that
       you copied into the field.

4. Choose **Add rule**.

5. For **Type**, choose **SSH**.

6. For **Source type**, choose **Anywhere-IPv4**.

7. Choose **Save rules**.
6. With the security group still selected, choose **Actions**, **Edit outbound rules**,
    and then do the following:
1. Choose **Add rule**.

2. For **Type**, choose **All traffic**.

3. For **Destination type**, choose **Custom** and paste the security group ID that you copied into the field.

4. Choose **Save rules**.

## Step 2: Launch a temporary instance

Launch a temporary instance that you can use to install and configure the EFA software
components. You use this instance to create an EFA-enabled AMI from which you
can launch your EFA-enabled instances.

###### To launch a temporary instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, and then choose
    **Launch Instances** to open the new launch instance wizard.

3. ( _Optional_) In the **Name and tags** section,
    provide a name for the instance, such as `EFA-instance`. The name is assigned
    to the instance as a resource tag ( `Name=EFA-instance`).

4. In the **Application and OS Images** section, select an AMI for
    one of the supported operating systems.

5. In the **Instance type** section, select a supported instance
    type.

6. In the **Key pair** section, select the key pair to use for the
    instance.

7. In the **Network settings** section, choose **Edit**,
    and then do the following:
1. For **Subnet**, choose the subnet in which to launch the
       instance. If you do not select a subnet, you can't enable the instance for EFA.

2. For **Firewall (security groups)**, choose **Select**
      **existing security group**, and then select the security group that you
       created in the previous step.

3. Expand the **Advanced network configuration** section.

      For **Network interface 1**, select **Network card index = 0**,
       **Device index = 0**, and **Interface type = EFA with ENA**.

      ( _Optional_) If you are using a multi-card instance type, such as `p4d.24xlarge`
       or `p5.48xlarge`, for each additional network interface required, choose
       **Add network interface**, for **Network card index**
       select the next unused index, and then select **Device index = 1**
       and **Interface type = EFA with ENA** or **EFA-only**.
8. In the **Storage** section, configure the volumes as needed.

###### Note

You must provision an additional 10 to 20 GiB of storage for the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit.
If you do not provision enough storage, you will receive an `insufficient disk
   								space` error when attempting to install the Nvidia drivers and CUDA
toolkit.

9. In the **Summary** panel on the right, choose **Launch**
**instance**.

## Step 3: Install Nvidia GPU drivers, Nvidia CUDA toolkit, and cuDNN

        the kernel that you are currently running.

       ```nohighlight

       $ sudo yum install -y wget kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r)
       ```

    2. Add `nouveau` to the `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf ` deny list
        file.

       ```nohighlight

       $ cat << EOF | sudo tee --append /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
       blacklist vga16fb
       blacklist nouveau
       blacklist rivafb
       blacklist nvidiafb
       blacklist rivatv
       EOF
       ```

    3. Append `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rdblacklist=nouveau"` to the `grub` file and rebuild the Grub configuration.

       ```nohighlight

       $ echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rdblacklist=nouveau"' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/grub \
       && sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
       ```
04. Reboot the instance and reconnect to it.

05. Prepare the required repositories
    1. Enable the EPEL repository and set the distribution to `rhel7`.

       ```nohighlight

       $ sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel \
       && distribution='rhel7'
       ```

    2. Set up the CUDA network repository and update the repository cache.

       ```nohighlight

       $ ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) \
       && sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/$distribution/${ARCH}/cuda-$distribution.repo \
       && sudo yum clean expire-cache
       ```

    3. ( _Kernel version 5.10 only_) Perform these steps only if you are using Amazon Linux 2 with
        kernel version 5.10. If you are using Amazon Linux 2 with kernel version 4.12, skip these steps. To check your
        kernel version, run **uname -r**.
       1. Create the Nvidia driver configuration file named `/etc/dkms/nvidia.conf`.

          ```nohighlight

          $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/dkms \
          && echo "MAKE[0]=\"'make' -j2 module SYSSRC=\${kernel_source_dir} IGNORE_XEN_PRESENCE=1 IGNORE_PREEMPT_RT_PRESENCE=1 IGNORE_CC_MISMATCH=1 CC=/usr/bin/gcc10-gcc\"" | sudo tee /etc/dkms/nvidia.conf
          ```

       2. ( `p4d.24xlarge` and `p5.48xlarge` only) Copy the Nvidia driver configuration file.

          ```nohighlight

          $ sudo cp /etc/dkms/nvidia.conf /etc/dkms/nvidia-open.conf
          ```
06. Install the Nvidia GPU drivers, NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, and cuDNN.

    ```

07. Reboot the instance and reconnect to it.

08. ( `p4d.24xlarge` and `p5.48xlarge` only) Start the Nvidia Fabric Manager service, and ensure that it starts
     automatically when the instance starts. Nvidia Fabric Manager is required for NV Switch Management.

    ```nohighlight

    $ sudo systemctl enable nvidia-fabricmanager && sudo systemctl start nvidia-fabricmanager
    ```

09. Ensure that the CUDA paths are set each time that the instance starts.

- For _bash_ shells, add the following statements to
`/home/username/.bashrc` and
`/home/username/.bash_profile`.

```nohighlight

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

- For _tcsh_ shells, add the following statements to
`/home/username/.cshrc`.

```nohighlight

setenv PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

10. To confirm that the Nvidia GPU drivers are functional, run the following command.

    ```nohighlight

    $ nvidia-smi -q | head
    ```

    The command should return information about the Nvidia GPUs, Nvidia
     GPU drivers, and Nvidia CUDA toolkit.

      NVRM version: NVIDIA UNIX x86_64 Kernel Module  450.42.01  Tue Jun 15 21:26:37 UTC 2021
      ```

      In the example above, major version `450` of the kernel module was installed. This means that you need
       to install Nvidia Fabric Manager version `450`.

2. Install the Nvidia Fabric Manager. Run the following command and specify the major version
       identified in the previous step.

      ```nohighlight

      $ sudo apt install -o Dpkg::Options::='--force-overwrite' nvidia-fabricmanager-major_version_number
      ```

      For example, if major version `450` of the kernel module was installed, use the following command to
       install the matching version of Nvidia Fabric Manager.

      ```nohighlight

      $ sudo apt install -o Dpkg::Options::='--force-overwrite' nvidia-fabricmanager-450
      ```

3. Start the service, and ensure that it starts automatically when the instance starts.
       Nvidia Fabric Manager is required for NV Switch Management.

      ```nohighlight

      $ sudo systemctl start nvidia-fabricmanager && sudo systemctl enable nvidia-fabricmanager
      ```
8. Ensure that the CUDA paths are set each time that the instance starts.

- For _bash_ shells, add the following statements to
`/home/username/.bashrc` and
`/home/username/.bash_profile`.

```nohighlight

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

&& sudo dpkg -i gdrcopy_2.4-1_amd64.*.deb
```

## Step 5: Install the EFA software

Install the EFA-enabled kernel, EFA drivers, Libfabric, aws-ofi-nccl plugin, and Open
MPI stack that is required to support EFA on your instance.

###### To install the EFA software

1. Connect to the instance you launched. For more information, see [Connect to your Linux instance using SSH](connect-to-linux-instance.md).

2. Download the EFA software installation files. The software installation files are packaged into a compressed tarball ( `.tar.gz`) file.
    To download the latest _stable_ version, use the following command.

You can also get the latest version by replacing the version number with `latest` in the preceding command.

```nohighlight

$ curl -O https://efa-installer.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer-1.47.0.tar.gz
```

3. ( _Optional_) Verify the authenticity and integrity of the EFA tarball ( `.tar.gz`) file.

We recommend that you do this to verify the identity of the software publisher and to check that the file
has not been altered or corrupted since it was published. If you do not want to verify the tarball file, skip
this step.

###### Note

Alternatively, if you prefer to verify the tarball file by using an MD5 or SHA256 checksum instead, see
[Verify the EFA installer using a checksum](efa-verify.md).

1. Download the public GPG key and import it into your keyring.

```nohighlight

$ wget https://efa-installer.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer.key && gpg --import aws-efa-installer.key
```

The command should return a key value. Make a note of the key value, because you need it in the next step.

2. Verify the GPG key's fingerprint. Run the following command and specify the key
    value from the previous step.

```nohighlight

$ gpg --fingerprint key_value
```

The command should return a fingerprint that is identical to `4E90 91BC BB97 A96B 26B1  5E59 A054 80B1 DD2D 3CCC`. If
    the fingerprint does not match, don't run the EFA installation script, and contact
    Support.

3. Download the signature file and verify the signature of the EFA tarball file.

```nohighlight

$ wget https://efa-installer.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer-1.47.0.tar.gz.sig && gpg --verify ./aws-efa-installer-1.47.0.tar.gz.sig
```

The following shows example output.

```nohighlight

gpg: Signature made Wed 29 Jul 2020 12:50:13 AM UTC using RSA key ID DD2D3CCC
gpg: Good signature from "Amazon EC2 EFA <ec2-efa-maintainers@amazon.com>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 4E90 91BC BB97 A96B 26B1  5E59 A054 80B1 DD2D 3CCC
```

If the result includes `Good signature`, and the fingerprint matches the fingerprint returned in the
    previous step, proceed to the next step. If not, don't run the EFA installation script, and contact Support.

4. Extract the files from the compressed `.tar.gz` file and navigate into
    the extracted directory.

```nohighlight

$ tar -xf aws-efa-installer-1.47.0.tar.gz && cd aws-efa-installer
```

5. Run the EFA software installation script.

###### Note

From EFA 1.30.0, both Open MPI 4.1 and Open MPI 5 are installed by default.
Unless you need Open MPI 5, we recommend that you install only Open MPI 4.1. The
following command installs Open MPI 4.1 only. If you want to install Open MPI
4.1 and Open MPI 5, remove `--mpi=openmpi4`.

```nohighlight

$ sudo ./efa_installer.sh -y --mpi=openmpi4
```

**Libfabric** is installed in the `/opt/amazon/efa`
    directory. The **aws-ofi-nccl plugin** is installed in the
    `/opt/amazon/ofi-nccl` directory. **Open MPI**
    is installed in the `/opt/amazon/openmpi` directory.

6. If the EFA installer prompts you to reboot the instance, do so and then reconnect
    to the instance. Otherwise, log out of the instance and then log back in to complete
    the installation.

7. Confirm that the EFA software components were successfully installed.

```nohighlight

$ fi_info -p efa -t FI_EP_RDM
```

The command should return information about the Libfabric EFA interfaces. The following
    example shows the command output.

- `p3dn.24xlarge` with single network interface

```nohighlight

provider: efa
fabric: EFA-fe80::94:3dff:fe89:1b70
domain: efa_0-rdm
version: 2.0

```nohighlight

$ cd /opt
```

2. Clone the official NCCL repository to the instance and navigate into the local
    cloned repository.

```nohighlight

$ sudo git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl.git -b v2.23.4-1 && cd nccl
```

3. Build and install NCCL and specify the CUDA installation directory.

```nohighlight

$ sudo make -j src.build CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
```

## Step 7: Install the NCCL tests

Install the NCCL tests. The NCCL tests enable you to confirm that NCCL is properly
installed and that it is operating as expected. For more information about the
NCCL tests, see the [nccl-tests\
repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests).

###### To install the NCCL tests

1. Navigate to your home directory.

```nohighlight

$ cd $HOME
```

2. Clone the official nccl-tests repository to the instance and navigate into the
    local cloned repository.

```nohighlight

$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests.git && cd nccl-tests
```

3. Add the Libfabric directory to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.

- Amazon Linux 2023 and Amazon Linux 2

```nohighlight

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/amazon/efa/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

- Ubuntu 24.04 and Ubuntu 22.04

```nohighlight

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/amazon/efa/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

4. Install the NCCL tests and specify the MPI, NCCL, and CUDA installation directories.

```nohighlight

$ make MPI=1 MPI_HOME=/opt/amazon/openmpi NCCL_HOME=/opt/nccl/build CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
```

## Step 8: Test your EFA and NCCL configuration

Run a test to ensure that your temporary instance is properly configured for EFA and NCCL.

###### To test your EFA and NCCL configuration

1. Create a host file that specifies the hosts on which to run the tests. The following command creates a
    host file named `my-hosts` that includes a reference to the instance itself.
IMDSv2

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4 >> my-hosts

```

IMDSv1

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4 >> my-hosts
```

2. Run the test and specify the host file ( `--hostfile`) and the number of GPUs to use
    ( `-n`). The following command runs the `all_reduce_perf` test on 8
    GPUs on the instance itself, and specifies the following environment variables.

- `FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA=1`—( `p4d.24xlarge` only) uses the device's RDMA functionality for
one-sided and two-sided transfer.

- `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`—enables detailed debugging output. You can also
specify `VERSION` to print only the NCCL version at the start of the test, or
`WARN` to receive only error messages.

For more information about the NCCL test arguments, see the
[NCCL Tests README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests/blob/master/README.md)
in the official nccl-tests repository.

- `p3dn.24xlarge`

```nohighlight

$ /opt/amazon/openmpi/bin/mpirun \
  -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/nccl/build/lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/opt/amazon/efa/lib:/opt/amazon/openmpi/lib:/opt/amazon/ofi-nccl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
  -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO \
  --hostfile my-hosts -n 8 -N 8 \
  --mca pml ^cm --mca btl tcp,self --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0 --bind-to none \
$HOME/nccl-tests/build/all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 1G -f 2 -g 1 -c 1 -n 100
```

- `p4d.24xlarge` and `p5.48xlarge`

```nohighlight

$ /opt/amazon/openmpi/bin/mpirun \
  -x FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA=1 \
  -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/nccl/build/lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/opt/amazon/efa/lib:/opt/amazon/openmpi/lib:/opt/amazon/ofi-nccl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
  -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO \
  --hostfile my-hosts -n 8 -N 8 \
  --mca pml ^cm --mca btl tcp,self --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0 --bind-to none \
$HOME/nccl-tests/build/all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 1G -f 2 -g 1 -c 1 -n 100
```

3. You can confirm that EFA is active as the underlying provider for NCCL when
    the `NCCL_DEBUG` log is printed.

```nohighlight

ip-192-168-2-54:14:14 [0] NCCL INFO NET/OFI Selected Provider is efa*
```

The following additional information is displayed when using a `p4d.24xlarge` instance.

```nohighlight

ip-192-168-2-54:14:14 [0] NCCL INFO NET/OFI Running on P4d platform, Setting NCCL_TOPO_FILE environment variable to /home/ec2-user/install/plugin/share/aws-ofi-nccl/xml/p4d-24xl-topo.xml
```

## Step 9: Install your machine learning applications

Install the machine learning applications on the temporary instance. The installation procedure varies
depending on the specific machine learning application. For more information about installing
software on your Linux instance, see [Manage software on your Amazon Linux 2 instance](../../../linux/al2/ug/managing-software.md).

###### Note

Refer to your machine learning application’s documentation for installation
instructions.

## Step 10: Create an EFA and NCCL-enabled AMI

After you have installed the required software components, you create an AMI that
you can reuse to launch your EFA-enabled instances.

###### To create an AMI from your temporary instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the temporary instance that you created and choose **Actions**,
    **Image**, **Create image**.

4. For **Create image**, do the following:
1. For **Image name**, enter a descriptive name for the
       AMI.

2. (Optional) For **Image description**, enter a brief
       description of the purpose of the AMI.

3. Choose **Create image**.
5. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

6. Locate the AMI tht you created in the list. Wait for the status to change from
    `pending` to `available` before continuing to the next
    step.

## Step 11: Terminate the temporary instance

At this point, you no longer need the temporary instance that you launched.
You can terminate the instance to stop incurring charges for it.

###### To terminate the temporary instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the temporary instance that you created and then choose **Actions**,
    **Instance state**, **Terminate instance**.

4. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Terminate**.

## Step 12: Launch EFA and NCCL-enabled instances into a cluster placement group

Launch your EFA and NCCL-enabled instances into a cluster placement group using the EFA-enabled
AMI and the EFA-enabled security group that you created earlier.

###### Note

- It is not an absolute requirement to launch your EFA-enabled instances into
a cluster placement group. However, we do recommend running your EFA-enabled
instances in a cluster placement group as it launches the instances into a
low-latency group in a single Availability Zone.

- To ensure that capacity is available as you scale your cluster’s instances, you
can create a Capacity Reservation for your cluster placement group. For more information, see
[Use Capacity Reservations with cluster placement groups](cr-cpg.md).

## Step 13: Enable passwordless SSH

To enable your applications to run across all of the instances in your cluster,
you must enable passwordless SSH access from the leader node to the member nodes. The leader
node is the instance from which you run your applications. The remaining instances in the
cluster are the member nodes.

###### To enable passwordless SSH between the instances in the cluster

1. Select one instance in the cluster as the leader node, and connect to it.

2. Disable `strictHostKeyChecking` and enable
    `ForwardAgent` on the leader node. Open `~/.ssh/config`
    using your preferred text editor and add the following.

```nohighlight

Host *
       ForwardAgent yes
Host *
       StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

3. Generate an RSA key pair.

```nohighlight

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

The key pair is created in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory.

4. Change the permissions of the private key on the leader node.

```nohighlight

$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

5. Open `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` using your preferred text editor and copy
    the key.

6. For each member node in the cluster, do the following:
1. Connect to the instance.

2. Open `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` using your preferred text
       editor and add the public key that you copied earlier.
7. To test that the passwordless SSH is functioning as expected, connect to your leader node
    and run the following command.

```nohighlight

$ ssh member_node_private_ip
```

You should connect to the member node without being prompted for a key or password.
