# Determine whether Amazon EC2 terminated a Spot Instance

A Spot Instance runs until Amazon EC2 terminates it in response to a Spot Instance interruption, or until
you terminate it yourself. For more information, see [Behavior of Spot Instance interruptions](interruption-behavior.md).

After a Spot Instance is terminated, you can use AWS CloudTrail to see whether Amazon EC2 terminated it.
If the CloudTrail log includes a `BidEvictedEvent`, this indicates that Amazon EC2
terminated the Spot Instance. If instead you see a `TerminateInstances` event,
this indicates that a user terminated the Spot Instance.

Alternatively, if you want to receive notification that Amazon EC2 is going to interrupt
your Spot Instance, use Amazon EventBridge to respond to the [EC2 Spot Instance Interruption Warning event](spot-instance-termination-notices.md#ec2-spot-instance-interruption-warning-event).

###### To view BidEvictedEvent events in CloudTrail

1. Open the CloudTrail console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Event history**.

3. From the list of filters, choose **Event name**, and
    then in the filter field to the right, enter `BidEvictedEvent`.

4. (Optional) Select a time range.

5. If the list is not empty, choose **BidEvictedEvent** from
    the resulting entry to open its details page. You can find information about
    the Spot Instance in the **Event record** pane, including the ID of
    the Spot Instance. The following is an example of the event record.

```json

{
       "eventVersion": "1.05",
       "userIdentity": {
           "accountId": "123456789012",
           "invokedBy": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
       },
       "eventTime": "2016-08-16T22:30:00Z",
       "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
       "userAgent": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
       "sourceIPAddress": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
       "eventName": "BidEvictedEvent",
       "awsRegion": "us-east-2",
       "eventID": "d27a6096-807b-4bd0-8c20-a33a83375054",
       "eventType": "AwsServiceEvent",
       "recipientAccountId": "123456789012",
       "RequestParameters": null,
       "ResponseElements": null,
       "serviceEventDetails": {
           "instanceIdSet": [
             "i-1eb2ac8eEXAMPLE"
           ]
       }
}
```

6. If you did not find an entry for the `BidEvictedEvent` event,
    enter `TerminateInstances` as the event name. For more
    information about the event record for `TerminateInstances`, see
    [Amazon EC2 API event examples](monitor-with-cloudtrail.md#cloudtrail-event-examples).
