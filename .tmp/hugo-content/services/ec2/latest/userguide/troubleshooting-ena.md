# Troubleshoot the ENA kernel driver on Linux

The Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) is designed to improve operating system health and
reduce the chances of long-term disruption because of unexpected hardware behavior and or
failures. The ENA architecture keeps device or driver failures as transparent to the system
as possible. This topic provides troubleshooting information for ENA.

If you are unable to connect to your instance, start with the
[Troubleshoot connectivity issues](#ena-connectivity-issues)
section.

If you experience performance degradation after migrating to a sixth generation instance
type, see the article [What do I need to do\
before I migrate my EC2 instance to a sixth generation instance to make sure that I get\
maximum network performance?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/migrate-to-gen6-ec2-instance)

If you are able to connect to your instance, you can gather diagnostic information by
using the failure detection and recovery mechanisms that are covered in the later sections
of this topic.

## Troubleshoot connectivity issues

If you lose connectivity while enabling enhanced networking, the
`ena` module might be incompatible with your instance's current
running kernel. This can happen if you install the module for a specific kernel version
(without **dkms**, or with an improperly configured
**dkms.conf** file) and then your instance kernel is updated. If the
instance kernel that is loaded at boot time does not have the `ena`
module properly installed, your instance will not recognize the network adapter and your
instance becomes unreachable.

If you enable enhanced networking for a PV instance or AMI, this can also
make your instance unreachable.

If your instance becomes unreachable after enabling enhanced networking with ENA, you
can disable the `enaSupport` attribute for your instance and it will
fall back to the stock network adapter.

###### To disable enhanced networking with ENA (EBS-backed instances)

1. From your local computer, stop the instance by using the Amazon EC2 console, the
    [stop-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.md) command (AWS CLI), or the
    [Stop-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/stop-ec2instance.md) cmdlet (AWS Tools for PowerShell).

2. From your local computer, disable the enhanced networking attribute by using the
    [modify-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.md)
    command with the `--no-ena-support` option or the
    [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2instanceattribute.md)
    cmdlet with the `-EnaSupport $false` parameter.

3. From your local computer, start the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, the
    [start-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.md) command, or the
    [Start-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/start-ec2instance.md) cmdlet.

4. (Optional) Connect to your instance and try reinstalling the
    `ena` module with your current kernel version by following
    the steps in [Enable enhanced networking with ENA on your EC2 instances](enhanced-networking-ena.md).

###### To disable enhanced networking with ENA (instance store-backed instances)

1. Create a new AMI as described in [Create an Amazon S3-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-instance-store.md).

2. When you register the AMI, be sure to include the `--no-ena-support` option in the
    [stop-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.md) command (AWS CLI) or the
    `-EnaSupport $false` parameter in the
    [Register-EC2Image](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/register-ec2image.md) cmdlet.

## Keep-alive mechanism

The ENA device posts keep-alive events at a fixed rate (usually once every second).
The ENA driver implements a watchdog mechanism, which checks for the presence of
these keep-alive messages. If a message or messages are present, the watchdog is
rearmed, otherwise the driver concludes that the device experienced a failure and then
does the following:

- Dumps its current statistics to syslog

- Resets the ENA device

- Resets the ENA driver state

The above reset procedure may result in some traffic loss for a short
period of time (TCP connections should be able to recover), but should not otherwise
affect the user.

The ENA device may also indirectly request a device reset procedure, by not sending a
keep-alive notification, for example, if the ENA device reaches an unknown state after
loading an irrecoverable configuration.

The following is an example of the reset procedure:

## Register read timeout

The ENA architecture suggests a limited usage of memory mapped I/O (MMIO) read
operations. MMIO registers are accessed by the ENA device driver only during its
initialization procedure.

If the driver logs (available in **dmesg** output) indicate failures of
read operations, this may be caused by an incompatible or incorrectly compiled driver, a
busy hardware device, or hardware failure.

Intermittent log entries that indicate failures on read operations should not be
considered an issue; the driver will retry them in this case. However, a sequence of log
entries containing read failures indicate a driver or hardware problem.

Below is an example of driver log entry indicating a read operation failure due to a
timeout:

```nohighlight

[ 47.113698] [ENA_COM: ena_com_reg_bar_read32] reading reg failed for timeout. expected: req id[1] offset[88] actual: req id[57006] offset[0]

[ 47.346221] [ENA_COM: ena_com_dev_reset] Reg read32 timeout occurred
```

## Statistics

If you experience insufficient network performance or latency issues, you should
retrieve the device statistics and examine them. These statistics can be obtained using
**ethtool** as follows.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ ethtool -S ethN
NIC statistics:
	tx_timeout: 0
	suspend: 0
	resume: 0

## Driver error logs in syslog

The ENA driver writes log messages to **syslog** during system boot.
You can examine these logs to look for errors if you are experiencing issues. Below is
an example of information logged by the ENA driver in **syslog** during
system boot, along with some annotations for select messages.

###### Which errors can I ignore?

The following warnings that may appear in your system's error logs can be ignored
for the Elastic Network Adapter:

**`Set host attribute isn't supported`**

Host attributes are not supported for this device.

**`failed to alloc buffer for rx queue`**

This is a recoverable error, and it indicates that there may have
been a memory pressure issue when the error was thrown.

**`Feature X isn't**
**supported`**

The referenced feature is not supported by the Elastic Network
Adapter. Possible values for `X` include:

- 10: RSS Hash function configuration
is not supported for this device.

- 12: RSS Indirection table
configuration is not supported for this device.

- 18: RSS Hash Input configuration is
not supported for this device.

- 20: Interrupt moderation is not
supported for this device.

- 27: The Elastic Network Adapter driver
does not support polling the Ethernet capabilities from snmpd.

**`Failed to config AENQ`**

The Elastic Network Adapter does not support AENQ
configuration.

**`Trying to set unsupported AENQ events`**

This error indicates an attempt to set an AENQ events group that
is not supported by the Elastic Network Adapter.

## Sub-optimal configuration notifications

The ENA device detects sub-optimal configuration settings in the driver
that you can change. The device notifies the ENA driver and logs a warning to
the console. The following example shows the format of the warning message.

```nohighlight

Sub-optimal configuration notification code: 1. Refer to AWS ENA documentation for additional details and mitigation options.
```

The following list shows notification code details and recommended actions for sub-optimal
configuration findings.

- **Code 1: ENA Express with wide LLQ configuration is not recommended**

ENA Express ENI is configured with wide LLQ. This configuration is
sub-optimal and could impact performance for ENA Express. We recommend that
you disable wide LLQ settings when you use ENA Express ENIs as follows.

```nohighlight

sudo rmmod ena && sudo modprobe ena force_large_llq_header=0
```

For more information about optimal configuration for ENA Express, see
[Improve network performance between EC2 instances with ENA Express](ena-express.md).

- **Code 2: ENA Express ENI with sub-optimal Tx queue**
**depth is not recommended**

ENA Express ENI is configured with sub-optimal Tx queue depth. This configuration
could impact performance for ENA Express. We recommend that you enlarge all Tx
queues to the maximum value for the network interface when you use ENA Express
ENIs as follows.

You can run the following **ethtool** commands to adjust
LLQ size. To learn more about how to control, query, and enable wide-LLQ, see the [Large Low-Latency Queue (Large LLQ)](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/tree/master/kernel/linux/ena) topic of the Linux kernel driver for
ENA documentation in the _Amazon Drivers GitHub repository_.

```nohighlight

ethtool -g interface
```

Set your Tx queues to the maximum depth:

```nohighlight

ethtool -G interface tx depth
```

For more information about optimal configuration for ENA Express, see
[Improve network performance between EC2 instances with ENA Express](ena-express.md).

- **Code 3: ENA with regular LLQ size and Tx packet**
**traffic exceeds the maximum header supported size**

By default, ENA LLQ supports Tx packet header size up to 96 bytes. If the packet
header size is larger than 96 bytes, the packet is dropped. To mitigate this issue,
we recommend that you enable wide-LLQ, which increases the supported Tx packet
header size to a maximum of 224 bytes.

However, when you enable wide-LLQ, the maximum Tx ring size is reduced from 1000 to 512
entries. Wide-LLQ is enabled by default for all Nitro v4 and later instance types.

- Nitro v4 instance types have a default maximum wide-LLQ Tx ring size of 512 entries,
which can't be changed.

- Nitro v5 instance types have a default wide-LLQ Tx ring size of 512 entries, which you
can increase up to 1000 entries.

You can run the following **ethtool** commands to adjust
LLQ size. To learn more about how to control, query, and enable wide-LLQ, see the [Large Low-Latency Queue (Large LLQ)](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/tree/master/kernel/linux/ena) topic of the Linux kernel driver for
ENA documentation in the _Amazon Drivers GitHub repository_.

Find the maximum depth for your Tx queues:

```nohighlight

ethtool -g interface
```

Set your Tx queues to the maximum depth:

```nohighlight

ethtool -G interface tx depth
```
