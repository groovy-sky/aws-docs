# Launch an Amazon EC2 instance

An instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. You launch an instance from an Amazon
Machine Image (AMI). The AMI provides the operating system, application server, and
applications for your instance.

When you create your AWS account, you can get started with
Amazon EC2 for free using the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free). Your
Free Tier benefits depend on when you created your AWS account. If your created your
AWS account before July 15, 2025 and it's less than 12 months old, you can use the
Free Tier to launch and use a `t2.micro` instance for free (in Regions where
`t2.micro` is unavailable, you can use a `t3.micro` instance
under the Free Tier). You incur charges for your instance or usage that counts against your Free Tier limits while the
instance is running, even if it remains idle. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing). If you created your
AWS account on or after July 15, 2025, you can use `t3.micro`,
`t3.small`, `t4g.micro`, `t4g.small`,
`c7i-flex.large`, and `m7i-flex.large` instance types for 6 months
or until your credits are used up. For more information, see [Free Tier benefits before and after July 15, 2025](ec2-free-tier-usage.md#ec2-free-tier-comparison).

When you launch your instance, you can launch your instance in a subnet that is associated
with one of the following resources:

- An Availability Zone – This option is the default.

- A Local Zone – To launch an instance in a Local Zone, you must opt in to
the Local Zone, and then create a subnet in the zone. For more information, see
[Get\
started with Local Zones](../../../local-zones/latest/ug/getting-started.md).

- A Wavelength Zone – To launch an instance in a Wavelength Zone, you must
opt in to the Wavelength Zone, and then create a subnet in the zone. For information
about how to launch an instance in a Wavelength Zone, see [Get started\
with AWS Wavelength](../../../wavelength/latest/developerguide/get-started-wavelength.md).

- An Outpost – To launch an instance in an Outpost, you must create an
Outpost. For information about how to create an Outpost, see [Get started with AWS Outposts](../../../outposts/latest/userguide/get-started-outposts.md).

After you launch your instance, you can connect to it and use it. To begin, the instance
state is `pending`. When the instance state is `running`, the instance
has started booting. There might be a short time before you can connect to the instance.
Note that bare metal instance types might take longer to launch.

Depending on how you plan to connect to your instance, you might want to make certain
configurations while launching your instance. These configurations could include specifying
inbound security group rules for certain traffic or associating an instance profile role.
For more information on the connection methods you can use to connect and their
requirements, see [Connect to your EC2 instance](connect.md).

The instance receives a public DNS name that you can use to contact the instance from the
internet. The instance also receives a private DNS name that other instances within the same
VPC can use to contact the instance.

When you're finished with an instance, to avoid incurring unnecessary costs, be sure to
terminate it. For more information, see [Terminate Amazon EC2 instances](terminating-instances.md).

If you need to launch a large number of instances, use multiple instance types, or use
multiple purchasing options such as On-Demand Instance, Reserved Instance, and Spot Instance, consider using EC2 Fleet. For more
information, see [EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet](fleets.md).

If you want to automate the lifecycle of your instances, including automatic scaling,
health checks, and replacement of unhealthy instances, consider using [Amazon EC2 Auto\
Scaling](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.md).

The following methods are some of the ways that you can launch an instance.

Use a CloudFormation template to specify an instance.
