# Onboard your address range for use in Amazon EC2

The onboarding process for BYOIP includes the following tasks, depending on your needs.

###### Tasks

- [Provision a publicly advertisable address range in AWS](#byoip-provision)

- [Provision an IPv6 address range that's not publicly advertisable](#byoip-provision-non-public)

- [Advertise the address range through AWS](#byoip-advertise)

- [Deprovision the address range](#byoip-deprovision)

- [Validate your BYOIP](#byoip-validation)

## Provision a publicly advertisable address range in AWS

When you provision an address range for use with AWS, you are confirming that
you control the address range and are authorizing Amazon to advertise it. We also
verify that you control the address range through a signed authorization message.
This message is signed with the self-signed X.509 key pair that you used when
updating the RDAP record with the X.509 certificate. AWS requires a
cryptographically signed authorization message that it presents to the RIR. The RIR
authenticates the signature against the certificate that you added to RDAP, and
checks the authorization details against the ROA.

###### To provision the address range

1. ###### Compose message

Compose the plaintext authorization message. The format of the message is
    as follows, where the date is the expiry date of the message:

```nohighlight

1|aws|account|cidr|YYYYMMDD|SHA256|RSAPSS
```

Replace the account number, address range, and expiry date with your own
    values to create a message resembling the following:

```nohighlight

text_message="1|aws|0123456789AB|198.51.100.0/24|20211231|SHA256|RSAPSS"
```

This is not to be confused with a ROA message, which has a similar
    appearance.

2. ###### Sign message

Sign the plaintext message using the private key that you created
    previously. The signature returned by this command is a long string that you
    need to use in the next step.

###### Important

We recommend that you copy and paste this command. Except for the
message content, do not modify or replace any of the values.

```nohighlight

signed_message=$( echo -n $text_message | openssl dgst -sha256 -sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss -sigopt rsa_pss_saltlen:-1 -sign private-key.pem -keyform PEM | openssl base64 | tr -- '+=/' '-_~' | tr -d "\n")
```

3. ###### Provision address

Use the AWS CLI [provision-byoip-cidr](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/provision-byoip-cidr.md) command to provision the address range.
    The `--cidr-authorization-context` option uses the message and
    signature strings that you created previously.

###### Important

You must specify the AWS Region where the BYOIP range should be
provisioned if it differs from your [Configure the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.md) `Default region name`.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 provision-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --cidr-authorization-context Message="$text_message",Signature="$signed_message" --region us-east-1
```

Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call
    returns immediately, but the address range is not ready to use until its
    status changes from `pending-provision` to
    `provisioned`.

4. ###### Monitor progress

While most provisioning will be completed within two hours, it might take
    up to one week to complete the provisioning process for publicly
    advertisable ranges. Use the [describe-byoip-cidrs](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-byoip-cidrs.md) command to monitor progress, as in this
    example:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-byoip-cidrs --max-results 5 --region us-east-1
```

If there are issues during provisioning and the status goes to
    `failed-provision`, you must run the
    `provision-byoip-cidr` command again after the issues have
    been resolved.

## Provision an IPv6 address range that's not publicly advertisable

By default, an address range is provisioned to be publicly advertisable to the
internet. You can provision an IPv6 address range that will not be publicly
advertisable. For routes that are not publicly advertisable, the provisioning
process generally completes within minutes. When you associate an IPv6 CIDR block
from a non-public address range with a VPC, the IPv6 CIDR can only be accessed
through hybrid connectivity options that support IPv6, such as [Direct Connect](../../../directconnect/latest/userguide/welcome.md), [AWS Site-to-Site VPN](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpc-vpn.md), or [Amazon VPC Transit Gateways](../../../vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.md).

A ROA is not required to provision a non-public address range.

###### Important

- You can only specify whether an address range is publicly advertisable
during provisioning. You cannot change the advertisable status later
on.

- Amazon VPC doesn't support [unique\
local address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address) (ULA) CIDRs. All VPCs must have unique IPv6
CIDRs. Two VPCs can’t have the same IPv6 CIDR range.

To provision an IPv6 address range that will not be publicly advertisable, use the
following [provision-byoip-cidr](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/provision-byoip-cidr.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 provision-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --cidr-authorization-context Message="$text_message",Signature="$signed_message" --no-publicly-advertisable --region us-east-1
```

## Advertise the address range through AWS

After the address range is provisioned, it is ready to be advertised. You must
advertise the exact address range that you provisioned. You can't advertise only a
portion of the provisioned address range.

If you provisioned an IPv6 address range that will not be publicly advertised, you
do not need to complete this step.

We recommend that you stop advertising the address range or any portion of the range from other locations
before you advertise it through AWS. If you keep advertising your IP address range or any portion of it from other locations, we can't reliably support it or troubleshoot issues.
Specifically, we can't guarantee that traffic to the address range or a portion of the range will enter our
network.

To minimize down time, you can configure your AWS resources to use an address
from your address pool before it is advertised, and then simultaneously stop
advertising it from the current location and start advertising it through AWS. For
more information about allocating an Elastic IP address from your address pool, see
[Allocate an Elastic IP address](working-with-eips.md#using-instance-addressing-eips-allocating).

###### Limitations

- You can run the **advertise-byoip-cidr** command at most
once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each
time.

- You can run the **withdraw-byoip-cidr** command at most
once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each
time.

To advertise the address range, use the following [advertise-byoip-cidr](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/advertise-byoip-cidr.md)
command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 advertise-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --region us-east-1
```

To stop advertising the address range, use the following [withdraw-byoip-cidr](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/withdraw-byoip-cidr.md)
command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 withdraw-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --region us-east-1
```

## Deprovision the address range

To stop using your address range with AWS, first release any Elastic IP
addresses and disassociate any IPv6 CIDR blocks that are still allocated from the
address pool. Then stop advertising the address range, and finally, deprovision the
address range.

You cannot deprovision a portion of the address range. If you want to use a more
specific address range with AWS, deprovision the entire address range and
provision a more specific address range.

(IPv4) To release each Elastic IP address, use the following [release-address](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/release-address.md)
command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 release-address --allocation-id eipalloc-12345678abcabcabc --region us-east-1
```

(IPv6) To disassociate an IPv6 CIDR block, use the following [disassociate-vpc-cidr-block](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/disassociate-vpc-cidr-block.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 disassociate-vpc-cidr-block --association-id vpc-cidr-assoc-12345abcd1234abc1 --region us-east-1
```

To stop advertising the address range, use the following [withdraw-byoip-cidr](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/withdraw-byoip-cidr.md)
command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 withdraw-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --region us-east-1
```

To deprovision the address range, use the following [deprovision-byoip-cidr](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/deprovision-byoip-cidr.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 deprovision-byoip-cidr --cidr address-range --region us-east-1
```

It can take up to a day to deprovision an address range.

## Validate your BYOIP

1. Validate the self-signed x.509 key pair

Validate that the certificate has been uploaded and is valid via the whois
    command.

For ARIN, use `whois -h whois.arin.net r +
                           2001:0DB8:6172::/48` to look up the
    RDAP record for your address range. Check the `Public Comments`
    section for the `NetRange` (network range) in the command output. The
    certificate should be added in the `Public Comments` section for the
    address range.

You can inspect the `Public Comments` containing the certificate
    using the following command:

```nohighlight

whois -h whois.arin.net r + 2001:0DB8:6172::/48 | grep Comments | grep BEGIN
```

This returns output with the contents of the key, which should be similar to
    the following:

```nohighlight

Public Comments:

For RIPE, use `whois -r -h whois.ripe.net
                           2001:0DB8:7269::/48` to look up the
    RDAP record for your address range. Check the `descr` section for the
    `inetnum` object (network range) in the command output. The
    certificate should be added as a new `descr` field for the address
    range.

You can inspect the `descr` containing the certificate using the
    following command:

```nohighlight

whois -r -h whois.ripe.net 2001:0DB8:7269::/48 | grep descr | grep BEGIN
```

This returns output with the contents of the key, which should be similar to

2. Validate the creation of a ROA object

Validate the successful creation of the ROA objects using the RIPEstat Data
    API. Be sure to test your address range against the Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618,
    plus the ASNs that are currently authorized to advertise the address
    range.

You can inspect the ROA objects from different Amazon ASNs with your address
    range by using the following command:

```nohighlight

curl --location --request GET "https://stat.ripe.net/data/rpki-validation/data.json?resource=ASN&prefix=CIDR
```

In this example output, the response has a result of `"status":
                           "valid"` for the Amazon ASN 16509. This indicates the ROA object for
    the address range was created successfully:

```json

```

A status of `“unknown”` indicates the ROA object for the address range has
not been created. A status of `“invalid_asn”` indicates that the ROA object
for the address range was not created successfully.
