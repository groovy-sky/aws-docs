In addition to receiving notification of scheduled events in email, you can check
for scheduled events.

Console

###### To view scheduled events for your instances

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. The dashboard displays any resources with an associated event
    under **Scheduled events**.

AWS CLI

###### To view scheduled events for your instances

Use the [describe-instance-status](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-status.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instance-status \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --query "InstanceStatuses[].Events"
```

The following example output shows a reboot event.

```json

[
    "Events": [
        {
            "InstanceEventId": "instance-event-0d59937288b749b32",

AWS Health

You can use the AWS Health Dashboard to learn about events that can affect your
instance. The Health Dashboard organizes issues in three groups: open issues,
scheduled changes, and other notifications. The scheduled changes group
contains items that are ongoing or upcoming.

For more information, see [Getting\
started with your AWS Health Dashboard](../../../health/latest/ug/getting-started-health-dashboard.md) in the
_AWS Health User Guide_.
