# Use Amazon S3 with Amazon EC2 instances

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data
availability, security, and performance. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of
data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, backups, and big data analytics,
from an Amazon EC2 instance or from anywhere over the internet. For more information, see
[What is Amazon S3?](../../../s3/latest/userguide/welcome.md)

There are two ways to access Amazon S3 data from your Amazon EC2 instances:

- **File access** \- Use [Amazon S3 Files](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-files.md) to mount an S3 bucket as a high performance file system on your instance.

- **Object access** \- Use the [Amazon S3 API](../../../s3/latest/api.md), AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or tools like wget to copy objects to and from S3.

## File access with Amazon S3 Files

Amazon S3 Files is a serverless file system that lets you mount your S3 general purpose bucket as a high performance file system on your compute instance. S3 Files provides access to your S3 objects as files using standard file system operations such as read and write on the local mount path.

###### Prerequisites

Before you set up S3 Files with your EC2 instance, make sure you have the following:

- You must have an S3 file system and at least one mount target in available state. For instructions on creating an S3 file system, see the [Amazon S3 Files User Guide](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-files.md).

- An EC2 instance running Linux OS with an instance profile attached to it. Learn more about required permissions to mount the file system.

- Security groups that allow NFS traffic (port 2049) between your instance and the file system’s mount targets. [Learn more about required security groups settings.](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-files-prereq-policies.md#s3-files-prereq-security-groups)

###### Mount S3 file system to an EC2 instance

You can either mount an S3 file system at launch or after launch on a running instance.

###### Mount a file system at instance launch using the EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Choose **Launch instance**.

3. Select a subnet under **Network settings**.

4. Select the default security group to make sure that your EC2 instance can access your S3 file system. You can't access your EC2 instance by Secure Shell (SSH) using this security group. For access by SSH, later you can edit the default security and add a rule to allow SSH or a new security group that allows SSH. You can use the following settings:
1. **Type:** SSH

2. **Protocol:** TCP

3. **Port Range:** 22

4. **Source:** Anywhere 0.0.0.0/0
5. Under **Storage**, select **File systems** and choose **S3 Files**.

1. Under the file system drop down, you will see your file systems in the Availability Zone based on the subnet you selected in your Network settings. Choose the S3 file system that you want to mount. If you don’t have any file systems, choose **Create a new file system** to create a new one.

2. Enter a local mount path on your EC2 instance where you want to mount the file system (for example, `/mnt/s3files`).

3. A command will be generated to mount the file system and add it to fstab. You can add this command to User data field in **Advanced details**. Your EC2 instance will then be configured to mount the S3 file system at launch and whenever it's rebooted. You can also run these commands in your EC2 instance after it is launched.
6. Under **Advanced details**, attach an instance profile to your instance. Your IAM role must have permissions to mount the file system and access S3 bucket. [Learn more about required permissions](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-files-prereq-policies.md#s3-files-prereq-iam).

7. Choose **Launch instance**.

8. After the instance launches, the required software utilities will be installed and file system mounted. You can view the file system by navigating to your local mount path.

###### Mount a file system to an Amazon EC2 instance after launch

1. [Connect to your EC2 instance](connect.md) through Secure Shell (SSH) or EC2 Instance Connect on EC2 Console.

2. You mount your S3 file system using a mount helper utility `amazon-efs-utils`. Install the `amazon-efs-utils` package using the following command:

1. If you’re using Amazon Linux, run the following command to install efs-utils from Amazon's repositories:

      ```nohighlight

      sudo yum -y install amazon-efs-utils
      ```

2. If you are using other [supported Linux distributions](https://github.com/aws/efs-utils?tab=readme-ov-file), you can do the following:

      ```nohighlight

      curl https://amazon-efs-utils.aws.com/efs-utils-installer.sh | sudo sh -s -- --install
      ```

3. Refer to the [efs-utils GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws/efs-utils?tab=readme-ov-file) for other Linux distributions.
3. Create a directory for file system mount point using the following command:

```nohighlight

sudo mkdir {path/to/mount}
```

4. Mount the S3 file system:

```nohighlight

FS="{YOUR_FILE_SYSTEM_ID}"
sudo mount -t s3files $FS:/ {path/to/mount}

```

5. Confirm the file system is mounted.

```nohighlight

df -h {path/to/mount}
```

You can now read and write S3 objects as files on your local mount path using standard file system operations. If you have objects in your S3 bucket then you can view them as files using the following commands.

```nohighlight

ls {path/to/mount}
```

## Object-based access

You can copy files to and from Amazon S3 using the S3 API, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or standard HTTP tools. If you have permission, you can copy a file to or from Amazon S3 and your instance using one of the following methods.

wget

###### Note

This method works for public objects only. If the object is not public, you receive
an `ERROR 403: Forbidden` message. If you receive this error, you must use
either the Amazon S3 console, AWS CLI, AWS API, AWS SDK, or AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, and you must have
the required permissions. For more information, see [Identity and access management \
for Amazon S3](../../../s3/latest/userguide/security-iam.md) and [Downloading an object](../../../s3/latest/userguide/download-objects.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

The **wget** utility is an HTTP and FTP client that allows you to
download public objects from Amazon S3. It is installed by default in Amazon Linux and
most other distributions, and available for download on Windows. To download an Amazon S3
object, use the following command, substituting the URL of the object to
download.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ wget https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path-to-file
```

PowerShell

You can use the [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://aws.amazon.com/powershell) to move
objects to and from Amazon S3.

Use the [Copy-S3Object](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/copy-s3object.md)
cmdlet to copy an Amazon S3 object to your Windows instance as follows.

```powershell

Copy-S3Object `
    -BucketName amzn-s3-demo-bucket `
    -Key path-to-file `
    -LocalFile my_copied_file.ext
```

Alternatively, you can open the Amazon S3 console by using a web browser on the
Windows instance.

AWS CLI

You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to download restricted items from Amazon S3 and
also to upload items. For more information, such as how to install and configure the
tools, see the [AWS Command Line Interface detail\
page](https://aws.amazon.com/cli).

The [aws s3 cp](../../../cli/latest/reference/s3/cp.md) command is similar to the Unix
**cp** command. You can copy files from Amazon S3 to your instance, copy
files from your instance to Amazon S3, and copy files from one Amazon S3 location to
another.

Use the following command to copy an object from Amazon S3 to your instance.

```nohighlight

aws s3 cp s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my_folder/my_file.ext my_copied_file.ext
```

Use the following command to copy an object from your instance back into Amazon S3.

```nohighlight

aws s3 cp my_copied_file.ext s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my_folder/my_file.ext
```

The [aws s3 sync](../../../cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.md) command can synchronize an entire Amazon S3 bucket to a
local directory location. This can be helpful for downloading a data set and keeping the
local copy up-to-date with the remote set. If you have the proper permissions on the
Amazon S3 bucket, you can push your local directory back up to the cloud when you are
finished by reversing the source and destination locations in the command.

Use the following command to download an entire Amazon S3 bucket to a local directory on
your instance.

```nohighlight

aws s3 sync s3://amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket local_directory
```

Amazon S3 API

You can use an API to access data in Amazon S3. You can use this
API to help develop your application and integrate it with other APIs and SDKs.
For more information, see [Code examples for Amazon S3 using AWS SDKs](../../../s3/latest/api/service-code-examples.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.
