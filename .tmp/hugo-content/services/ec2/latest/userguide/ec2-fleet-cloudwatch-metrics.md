# Monitor your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet using CloudWatch

You can monitor your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet using the Amazon CloudWatch metrics described in this
section.

###### Important

To ensure accuracy, we recommend that you enable detailed monitoring when using
these metrics. For more information, see [Manage detailed monitoring for your EC2 instances](manage-detailed-monitoring.md).

For more information about using CloudWatch, see [Monitor your instances using CloudWatch](using-cloudwatch.md).

## EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet metrics

The `AWS/EC2Spot` namespace includes the following metrics for your
fleet, plus the CloudWatch metrics for the Spot Instances in your fleet. For more information,
see [Instance metrics](viewing-metrics-with-cloudwatch.md#ec2-cloudwatch-metrics).

MetricDescription`AvailableInstancePoolsCount`

The Spot capacity pools specified in the fleet
request.

Units: Count

`BidsSubmittedForCapacity`

The capacity for which Amazon EC2 has submitted fleet
requests.

Units: Count

`EligibleInstancePoolCount`

The Spot capacity pools specified in the fleet request
where Amazon EC2 can fulfill requests. Amazon EC2 does not fulfill
requests in pools where the maximum price you're willing to
pay for Spot Instances is less than the Spot price or the Spot price
is greater than the price for On-Demand Instances.

Units: Count

`FulfilledCapacity`

The capacity that Amazon EC2 has fulfilled.

Units: Count

`MaxPercentCapacityAllocation`

The maximum value of
`PercentCapacityAllocation` across all fleet
pools specified in the fleet request.

Units: Percent

`PendingCapacity`

The difference between `TargetCapacity` and
`FulfilledCapacity`.

Units: Count

`PercentCapacityAllocation`

The capacity allocated for the Spot capacity pool for the
specified dimensions. To get the maximum value recorded
across all Spot capacity pools, use
`MaxPercentCapacityAllocation`.

Units: Percent

`TargetCapacity`

The target capacity of the fleet request.

Units: Count

`TerminatingCapacity`

The capacity that is being terminated because the
provisioned capacity is greater than the target
capacity.

Units: Count

If the unit of measure for a metric is `Count`, the most useful
statistic is `Average`.

## EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet dimensions

To filter the data for your fleet, use the following dimensions.

DimensionsDescription`AvailabilityZone`

Filter the data by Availability Zone.

`FleetRequestId`

Filter the data by fleet request.

`InstanceType`

Filter the data by instance type.

## View the CloudWatch metrics for your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet

You can view the CloudWatch metrics for your fleet using the Amazon CloudWatch console. These
metrics are displayed as monitoring graphs. These graphs show data points if the
fleet is active.

Metrics are grouped first by namespace, and then by the various combinations
of dimensions within each namespace. For example, you can view all fleet metrics
or fleet metrics groups by fleet request ID, instance type, or Availability
Zone.

###### To view fleet metrics

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, expand **Metrics**, and
    choose **All metrics**.

3. Choose the **EC2 Spot** namespace.

###### Note

If the **EC2 Spot** namespace is not displayed,
there are two reasons for this. Either you have never used EC2 Fleet or
Spot Fleet in the Region—only the AWS services that you're using
send metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. Or, if you have used EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet in the
Region, but not for the past two weeks, the namespace does not
appear.

4. To filter the metrics by dimension, choose one of the
    following:

- **Fleet Request Metrics** – Group by
fleet request

- **By Availability Zone** – Group by
fleet request and Availability Zone

- **By Instance Type** – Group by fleet
request and instance type

- **By Availability Zone/Instance Type**
– Group by fleet request, Availability Zone, and instance
type

5. To view the data for a metric, select the checkbox next to the
    metric.
