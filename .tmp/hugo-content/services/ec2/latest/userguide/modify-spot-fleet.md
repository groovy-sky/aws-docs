# Modify a Spot Fleet request

You can modify an active Spot Fleet request to complete the following tasks:

- Increase the total target capacity and On-Demand portion

- Decrease the total target capacity and On-Demand portion

When you increase the total target capacity, the Spot Fleet launches additional Spot Instances
according to the [allocation\
strategy](ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.md) for its Spot Fleet request. When you increase the On-Demand portion, the
Spot Fleet launches additional On-Demand Instances.

When you decrease the total target capacity, the Spot Fleet cancels any open requests that
exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the
size of the fleet reaches the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is
`diversified`, the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the pools.
Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not
replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.

###### Considerations

- You can't modify a one-time Spot Fleet request. You can only modify a Spot Fleet request
if you selected **Maintain target capacity** when you created
the Spot Fleet request.

- When a Spot Fleet terminates an instance because the target capacity was decreased,
the instance receives a Spot Instance interruption notice.

Console

###### To modify a Spot Fleet request

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Spot**
**Requests**.

3. Select your Spot Fleet request.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Modify target**
**capacity**.

5. In **Modify target capacity**, do the
    following:
1. Enter the new target capacity and On-Demand
       portion.

2. (Optional) If you are decreasing the target capacity but
       want to keep the fleet at its current size, clear
       **Terminate instances**.

3. Choose **Submit**.

AWS CLI

###### To modify a Spot Fleet request

Use the [modify-spot-fleet-request](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-spot-fleet-request.md) command to update the target
capacity of the specified Spot Fleet request.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-spot-fleet-request \
    --spot-fleet-request-id sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE \
    --target-capacity 20
```

You can modify the previous command as follows to decrease the target
capacity of the specified Spot Fleet without terminating any Spot Instances as a
result.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-spot-fleet-request \
    --spot-fleet-request-id sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE \
    --target-capacity 10 \
    --excess-capacity-termination-policy NoTermination
```

PowerShell

###### To modify a Spot Fleet request

Use the [Edit-EC2SpotFleetRequest](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2spotfleetrequest.md) cmdlet to update the target
capacity of the specified Spot Fleet request.

```

You can modify the previous command as follows to decrease the target
capacity of the specified Spot Fleet without terminating any Spot Instances as a
result.

```powershell

Edit-EC2SpotFleetRequest `
    -SpotFleetRequestId "sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE" `
