# Monitor and programmatically respond to the events emitted by your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet using Amazon EventBridge

When the state of an EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet changes, it emits a notification. The
notification is made available as an event that is sent to Amazon EventBridge (formerly known
as Amazon CloudWatch Events). Events are emitted on a best effort basis.

You can use Amazon EventBridge to create rules that trigger programmatic actions in response
to an event. For example, you can create two EventBridge rules: one triggered when a fleet
state changes, and another triggered when an instance in the fleet is terminated. In
this example, you can configure the first rule so that, if the fleet state changes,
the rule invokes an SNS topic, sending an email notification to you. You can
configure the second rule so that, if an instance in the fleet is terminated, the
rule invokes a Lambda function to launch a new instance.

###### Note

Only fleets of type `maintain` and `request` emit
events. Fleets of type `instant` do not emit events because they
submit synchronous one-time requests, and the state of the fleet is known
immediately in the response. To use Amazon EventBridge to monitor fleet events, the
request type must be `maintain` or `request`.

For instructions on how to describe a fleet's event history, see [Describe the event history for your EC2 Fleet](describe-ec2-fleet.md#describe-ec2-fleet-event-history).

## Create Amazon EventBridge rules to monitor EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet events

When a state change notification is emitted for an EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet, it is sent as
an event to Amazon EventBridge as a JSON file. If EventBridge detects an event pattern that
matches a pattern defined in a rule, EventBridge invokes the target (or targets)
specified in the rule.

You can write EventBridge rules to automate actions based on matching event patterns.

The following fields in the event form the event pattern that is defined in
the rule:

`"source": "aws.ec2fleet"`

Identifies that the event is from EC2 Fleet.

`"detail-type": "EC2 Fleet State
                                    Change"`

Identifies the event type.

`"detail": { "sub-type": "submitted"
                                }`

Identifies the event sub-type.

For the list of EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet events and example event data, see [EC2 Fleet event types](#ec2-fleet-event-types) and
[Spot Fleet event types](#spot-fleet-event-types).

### Create an EventBridge rule to send a notification

The following example creates an EventBridge rule to send an email, text message,
or mobile push notification every time that Amazon EC2 emits an EC2 Fleet state change
notification. The signal in this example is emitted as an `EC2 Fleet
                            State Change` event, which triggers the action defined by the
rule.

###### Prerequisite

Before creating the EventBridge rule, you must create the Amazon SNS topic for the
email, text message, or mobile push notification.

###### To create an EventBridge rule to send a notification when an EC2 Fleet state changes

1. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events).

2. Choose **Create rule**.

3. For **Define rule detail**, do the
    following:
1. Enter a **Name** for the rule, and,
       optionally, a description.

      A rule can't have the same name as another rule in the
       same Region and on the same event bus.

2. For **Event bus**, choose
       **default**. When an AWS service in
       your account generates an event, it always goes to your
       account's default event bus.

3. For **Rule type**, choose **Rule**
      **with an event pattern**.

4. Choose **Next**.
4. For **Build event pattern**, do the
    following:
1. For **Event source**, choose
       **AWS events or EventBridge partner**
      **events**.

2. For **Event pattern**, for this example
       you’ll specify the following event pattern to match the
       `EC2 Fleet Instance Change` event.

      ```JSON

      {
       "source": ["aws.ec2fleet"],
       "detail-type": ["EC2 Fleet Instance Change"]
      }
      ```

      To add the event pattern, you can either use a template by
       choosing **Event pattern form**, or specify
       your own pattern by choosing **Custom pattern (JSON**
      **editor)**, as follows:
      1. To use a template to create the event pattern, do
          the following:
         1. Choose **Event pattern**
            **form**.

         2. For **Event source**,
             choose **AWS services**.

         3. For **AWS Service**,
             choose **EC2 Fleet**.

         4. For **Event type**, choose
             **EC2 Fleet Instance**
            **Change**.

         5. To customize the template, choose
             **Edit pattern** and make your
             changes to match the example event pattern.
      2. (Alternative) To specify a custom event pattern,
          do the following:
         1. Choose **Custom pattern (JSON**
            **editor)**.

         2. In the **Event pattern**
             box, add the event pattern for this
             example.
3. Choose **Next**.
5. For **Select target(s)**, do the
    following:
1. For **Target types**, choose
       **AWS service**.

2. For **Select a target**, choose
       **SNS topic** to send an email, text
       message, or mobile push notification when the event
       occurs.

3. For **Topic**, choose an existing topic.
       You first need to create an Amazon SNS topic using the Amazon SNS
       console. For more information, see [Using\
       Amazon SNS for application-to-person (A2P) messaging](../../../sns/latest/dg/sns-user-notifications.md)
       in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

4. (Optional) Under **Additional settings**,
       you can optionally configure additional settings. For more
       information, see [Creating Amazon EventBridge rules that react to events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.md)
       (step 16) in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

5. Choose **Next**.
6. (Optional) For **Tags**, you can optionally
    assign one or more tags to your rule, and then choose
    **Next**.

7. For **Review and create**, do the
    following:
1. Review the details of the rule and modify them as
       necessary.

2. Choose **Create rule**.

For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge rules](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.md)
and [Amazon EventBridge event\
patterns](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.md) in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_

### Create an EventBridge rule to trigger a Lambda function

The following example creates an EventBridge rule to trigger a Lambda function
every time that Amazon EC2 emits an EC2 Fleet instance change notification for when an
instance is launched. The signal in this example is emitted as an `EC2
                            Fleet Instance Change` event, sub-type `launched`,
which triggers the action defined by the rule.

Before creating the EventBridge rule, you must create the Lambda function.

###### To create the Lambda function to use in the EventBridge rule

1. Open the AWS Lambda console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).

2. Choose **Create function**.

3. Enter a name for your function, configure the code, and then
    choose **Create function**.

For more information, see [Create your first Lambda function](../../../lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.md) in the
    _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

###### To create an EventBridge rule to trigger a Lambda function when an instance in an EC2 Fleet changes state

1. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events).

2. Choose **Create rule**.

3. For **Define rule detail**, do the
    following:
1. Enter a **Name** for the rule, and,
       optionally, a description.

      A rule can't have the same name as another rule in the
       same Region and on the same event bus.

2. For **Event bus**, choose
       **default**. When an AWS service in
       your account generates an event, it always goes to your
       account's default event bus.

3. For **Rule type**, choose **Rule**
      **with an event pattern**.

4. Choose **Next**.
4. For **Build event pattern**, do the
    following:
1. For **Event source**, choose
       **AWS events or EventBridge partner**
      **events**.

2. For **Event pattern**, for this example
       you’ll specify the following event pattern to match the
       `EC2 Fleet Instance Change` event and
       `launched` sub-type.

      ```JSON

      {
       "source": ["aws.ec2fleet"],
       "detail-type": ["EC2 Fleet Instance Change"],
       "detail": {
         "sub-type": ["launched"]
      }
      ```

      To add the event pattern, you can either use a template by
       choosing **Event pattern form**, or specify
       your own pattern by choosing **Custom pattern (JSON**
      **editor)**, as follows:
      1. To use a template to create the event pattern, do
          the following:
         1. Choose **Event pattern**
            **form**.

         2. For **Event source**,
             choose **AWS services**.

         3. For **AWS Service**,
             choose **EC2 Fleet**.

         4. For **Event type**, choose
             **EC2 Fleet Instance**
            **Change**.

         5. Choose **Edit pattern**,
             and add `"detail": {"sub-type":
                                                              ["launched"]` to match the example event
             pattern. For proper JSON format, insert a comma
             ( `,`) after the preceding square
             bracket ( `]`).
      2. (Alternative) To specify a custom event pattern,
          do the following:
         1. Choose **Custom pattern (JSON**
            **editor)**.

         2. In the **Event pattern**
             box, add the event pattern for this
             example.
3. Choose **Next**.
5. For **Select target(s)**, do the
    following:
1. For **Target types**, choose
       **AWS service**.

2. For **Select a target**, choose
       **SNS topic** to send an email, text
       message, or mobile push notification when the event
       occurs.

3. For **Topic**, choose **Lambda**
      **function**, and for
       **Function**, choose the function that
       you created to respond when the event occurs.

4. (Optional) Under **Additional settings**,
       you can optionally configure additional settings. For more
       information, see [Creating Amazon EventBridge rules that react to events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.md)
       (step 16) in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

5. Choose **Next**.
6. (Optional) For **Tags**, you can optionally
    assign one or more tags to your rule, and then choose
    **Next**.

7. For **Review and create**, do the
    following:
1. Review the details of the rule and modify them as
       necessary.

2. Choose **Create rule**.

For a tutorial on how to create a Lambda function and an EventBridge rule that
runs the Lambda function, see [Tutorial:\
Log the State of an Amazon EC2 Instance Using EventBridge](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-log-ec2-instance-state.md) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

## EC2 Fleet event types

There are five EC2 Fleet event types. For each event type, there are several
sub-types.

###### Event types

- [EC2 Fleet State Change](#ec2-fleet-state-change)

- [EC2 Fleet Spot Instance Request Change](#ec2-fleet-spot-instance-request-change)

- [EC2 Fleet Instance Change](#ec2-fleet-instance-change)

- [EC2 Fleet Information](#ec2-fleet-info)

- [EC2 Fleet Error](#ec2-fleet-config-not-valid)

### EC2 Fleet State Change

EC2 Fleet sends an `EC2 Fleet State Change` event to Amazon EventBridge when
an EC2 Fleet changes state.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "715ed6b3-b8fc-27fe-fad6-528c7b8bf8a2",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Fleet State Change",
    "source": "aws.ec2fleet",
    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "2020-11-09T09:00:20Z",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:fleet/fleet-598fb973-87b7-422d-be4d-6b0809bfff0a"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "sub-type": "active"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`active`

The EC2 Fleet request has been validated and Amazon EC2 is attempting to
maintain the target number of running instances.

`deleted`

The EC2 Fleet request is deleted and has no running instances. The
EC2 Fleet will be deleted two days after its instances are
terminated.

`deleted_running`

The EC2 Fleet request is deleted and does not launch additional
instances. Its existing instances continue to run until they are
interrupted or terminated. The request remains in this state
until all instances are interrupted or terminated.

`deleted_terminating`

The EC2 Fleet request is deleted and its instances are terminating.
The request remains in this state until all instances are
terminated.

`expired`

The EC2 Fleet request has expired. If the request was created with
`TerminateInstancesWithExpiration` set, a
subsequent `terminated` event indicates that the
instances are terminated.

`modify_in_progress`

The EC2 Fleet request is being modified. The request remains in
this state until the modification is fully processed.

`modify_succeeded`

The EC2 Fleet request was modified.

`submitted`

The EC2 Fleet request is being evaluated and Amazon EC2 is preparing to
launch the target number of instances.

`progress`

The EC2 Fleet request is in the process of being fulfilled.

### EC2 Fleet Spot Instance Request Change

EC2 Fleet sends an `EC2 Fleet Spot Instance Request Change` event to
Amazon EventBridge when a Spot Instance request in the fleet changes state.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "19331f74-bf4b-a3dd-0f1b-ddb1422032b9",

    ],
    "detail": {
        "spot-instance-request-id": "sir-rmqske6h",
        "description": "SpotInstanceRequestId sir-rmqske6h, PreviousState: cancelled_running",
        "sub-type": "cancelled"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`active`

The Spot Instance request is fulfilled and has an associated
Spot Instance.

`cancelled`

You cancelled the Spot Instance request, or the Spot Instance request
expired.

`disabled`

You stopped the Spot Instance.

`submitted`

The Spot Instance request is submitted.

### EC2 Fleet Instance Change

EC2 Fleet sends an `EC2 Fleet Instance Change` event to Amazon EventBridge
when an instance in the fleet changes state.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "542ce428-c8f1-0608-c015-e8ed6522c5bc",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Fleet Instance Change",

    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "2020-11-09T09:00:23Z",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:fleet/fleet-598fb973-87b7-422d-be4d-6b0809bfff0a"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "instance-id": "i-0c594155dd5ff1829",
        "description": "{\"instanceType\":\"c5.large\",\"image\":\"ami-6057e21a\",\"productDescription\":\"Linux/UNIX\",\"availabilityZone\":\"us-east-1d\"}",

    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`launched`

A new instance was launched.

`terminated`

The instance was terminated.

`termination_notified`

An instance termination notification was sent when a Spot Instance was
terminated by Amazon EC2 during scale-down, when the target capacity
of the fleet was modified down, for example, from a target
capacity of 4 to a target capacity of 3.

### EC2 Fleet Information

EC2 Fleet sends an `EC2 Fleet Information` event to Amazon EventBridge when
there is an error during fulfillment. The information event does not block
the fleet from attempting to fulfil its target capacity.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "76529817-d605-4571-7224-d36cc1b2c0c4",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Fleet Information",
    "source": "aws.ec2fleet",
    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "2020-11-09T08:17:07Z",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:fleet/fleet-8becf5fe-bb9e-415d-8f54-3fa5a8628b91"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "description": "c4.xlarge, ami-0947d2ba12ee1ff75, Linux/UNIX, us-east-1a, Spot price in either SpotFleetRequestConfigData or SpotFleetLaunchSpecification or LaunchTemplate or LaunchTemplateOverrides is less than Spot market price $0.0619",
        "sub-type": "launchSpecUnusable"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`fleetProgressHalted`

The price in every launch specification is not valid because
it is below the Spot price (all the launch specifications have
produced `launchSpecUnusable` events). A launch
specification might become valid if the Spot price
changes.

`launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted`

The configuration is not valid and several attempts to launch
instances have failed. For more information, see the description
of the event.

`launchSpecUnusable`

The price in a launch specification is not valid because it is
below the Spot price.

`registerWithLoadBalancersFailed`

An attempt to register instances with load balancers failed.
For more information, see the description of the event.

### EC2 Fleet Error

EC2 Fleet sends an `EC2 Fleet Error` event to Amazon EventBridge when there is
an error during fulfillment. The error event blocks the fleet from
attempting to fulfil its target capacity.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "69849a22-6d0f-d4ce-602b-b47c1c98240e",

    ],
    "detail": {
        "description": "m3.large, ami-00068cd7555f543d5, Linux/UNIX: IPv6 is not supported for the instance type 'm3.large'. ",
        "sub-type": "spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`iamFleetRoleInvalid`

The EC2 Fleet does not have the required permissions to either
launch or terminate an instance.

`allLaunchSpecsTemporarilyBlacklisted`

None of the configurations are valid, and several attempts to
launch instances have failed. For more information, see the
description of the event.

`spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded`

You’ve reached the limit on the number of Spot Instances that you can
launch.

`spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid`

The configuration is not valid. For more information, see the
description of the event.

## Spot Fleet event types

There are five Spot Fleet event types. For each event type, there are several
sub-types.

        "description": "SpotInstanceRequestId sir-a2w9gc5h, PreviousState: cancelled_running",
        "sub-type": "cancelled"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

The Spot Instance request is fulfilled and has an associated
Spot Instance.

`cancelled`

You cancelled the Spot Instance request, or the Spot Instance request
expired.

`disabled`

### EC2 Spot Fleet Instance Change

Spot Fleet sends an `EC2 Spot Fleet Instance Change` event to
Amazon EventBridge when an instance in the fleet changes state.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "11591686-5bd7-bbaa-eb40-d46529c2710f",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Spot Fleet Instance Change",
    "source": "aws.ec2spotfleet",
    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "2020-11-09T07:25:02Z",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:spot-fleet-request/sfr-c8a764a4-bedc-4b62-af9c-0095e6e3ba61"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "instance-id": "i-08b90df1e09c30c9b",
        "description": "{\"instanceType\":\"r4.2xlarge\",\"image\":\"ami-032930428bf1abbff\",\"productDescription\":\"Linux/UNIX\",\"availabilityZone\":\"us-east-1a\"}",
        "sub-type": "launched"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`launched`

A new instance was launched.

`terminated`

The instance was terminated.

`termination_notified`

An instance termination notification was sent when a Spot Instance was
terminated by Amazon EC2 during scale-down, when the target capacity
of the fleet was modified down, for example, from a target
capacity of 4 to a target capacity of 3.

### EC2 Spot Fleet Information

Spot Fleet sends an `EC2 Spot Fleet Information` event to Amazon EventBridge
when there is an error during fulfillment. The information event does not
block the fleet from attempting to fulfil its target capacity.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "73a60f70-3409-a66c-635c-7f66c5f5b669",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Spot Fleet Information",
    "source": "aws.ec2spotfleet",
    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "2020-11-08T20:56:12Z",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:spot-fleet-request/sfr-2531ea06-af18-4647-8757-7d69c94971b1"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "description": "r3.8xlarge, ami-032930428bf1abbff, Linux/UNIX, us-east-1a, Spot bid price is less than Spot market price $0.5291",
        "sub-type": "launchSpecUnusable"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`fleetProgressHalted`

The price in every launch specification is not valid because
it is below the Spot price (all the launch specifications have
produced `launchSpecUnusable` events). A launch
specification might become valid if the Spot price
changes.

`launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted`

The configuration is not valid and several attempts to launch
instances have failed. For more information, see the description
of the event.

`launchSpecUnusable`

The price in a launch specification is not valid because it is
below the Spot price.

`registerWithLoadBalancersFailed`

An attempt to register instances with load balancers failed.
For more information, see the description of the event.

### EC2 Spot Fleet Error

Spot Fleet sends an `EC2 Spot Fleet Error` event to Amazon EventBridge when
there is an error during fulfillment. The error event blocks the fleet from
attempting to fulfil its target capacity.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "10adc4e7-675c-643e-125c-5bfa1b1ba5d2",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Spot Fleet Error",
    "source": "aws.ec2spotfleet",
    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "2020-11-09T06:56:07Z",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:spot-fleet-request/sfr-38725d30-25f1-4f30-83ce-2907c56dba17"
    ],
    "detail": {
        "description": "r4.2xlarge, ami-032930428bf1abbff, Linux/UNIX: The associatePublicIPAddress parameter can only be specified for the network interface with DeviceIndex 0. ",
        "sub-type": "spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid"
    }
}
```

The possible values for `sub-type` are:

`iamFleetRoleInvalid`

The Spot Fleet does not have the required permissions to either
launch or terminate an instance.

`allLaunchSpecsTemporarilyBlacklisted`

None of the configurations are valid, and several attempts to
launch instances have failed. For more information, see the
description of the event.

`spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded`

You’ve reached the limit on the number of Spot Instances that you can
launch.

`spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid`

The configuration is not valid. For more information, see the
description of the event.
