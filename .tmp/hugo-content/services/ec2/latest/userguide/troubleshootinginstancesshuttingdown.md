# Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance termination issues

Shutting down or deleting your instance is known as instance termination. The following
information can help you troubleshoot issues when you terminate your instance.

You are not billed for any instance usage while an instance is not in the
`running` state. In other words, when you terminate an instance, you stop incurring
charges for that instance as soon as its state changes to `shutting-down`.

## Instance terminates immediately

Several issues can cause your instance to terminate immediately on start-up. See
[Instance terminates immediately](troubleshooting-launch.md#troubleshooting-launch-internal) for more information.

## Delayed instance termination

If your instance remains in the `shutting-down` state longer than a few
minutes, it might be because:

- The instance is running shutdown scripts.

- There's a problem with the underlying host computer.

After several hours in the `shutting-down` state, Amazon EC2 treats the instance
as stuck and forcibly terminates it.

To resolve a stuck instance yourself:

1. **Force terminate the instance**

Use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI to force terminate the instance. For the
    steps, see [Force terminate an instance](#force-terminate-ec2-instance).

The instance will first attempt a graceful shutdown, which includes flushing
    file system caches and metadata (although you can optionally bypass the graceful
    shutdown). If the graceful shutdown fails to complete within the timeout period,
    the instance shuts down forcibly without flushing the file system caches and
    metadata.

2. **If force terminate fails**

If, after several hours, the instance has not terminated and it appears stuck
    terminating, do the following:
1. Post a request for help on [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/). To help expedite a resolution, include the instance
       ID, and describe the steps that you've already taken.

2. Alternatively, if you have a support plan, create a technical support case
       in the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

### Force terminate an instance

If it appears that your instance is stuck terminating, you can force your instance to
terminate. If, after several hours, the instance has not terminated, post a request
for help to [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/). To help expedite a resolution, include the instance ID and
describe the steps that you've already taken. Alternatively, if you have a support
plan, create a technical support case in the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

Console

###### To force terminate an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and
    select the stuck instance.

3. Choose **Instance state**, **Force**
**terminate instance**.

Note that **Force terminate instance** is
    only available in the console if your instance is in the
    `stopping` state. If your instance is in another
    state (except `shutting-down` and
    `terminated`) you can use the AWS CLI to force
    terminate your instance.

4. (Optional) To bypass the graceful OS shutdown during the force
    terminate, select the **Skip OS shutdown**
    checkbox.

5. Choose **Force terminate**.

AWS CLI

###### To force terminate an instance

Use the [terminate-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.md) command with the
`--force` option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 terminate-instances \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --force
```

To bypass the graceful OS shutdown during force terminate, include the
`--skip-os-shutdown` option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 terminate-instances \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --force \
    --skip-os-shutdown
```

PowerShell

###### To force terminate an instance

Use the [Remove-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/remove-ec2instance.md) cmdlet and set
`-Enforce` to `true`.

```powershell

Remove-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Enforce $true
```

To bypass the graceful OS shutdown during force terminate, include
`-SkipOsShutdown $true`.

```powershell

Remove-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Enforce $true `
    -SkipOsShutdown $true
```

## Terminated instance still displayed

After you terminate an instance, it remains visible for a short while before being deleted.
The state shows as `terminated`. If the entry is not deleted after
several hours, contact Support.

## Error: The instance may not be terminated. Modify its 'disableApiTermination' instance attribute

If you try to terminate an instance and get the `The instance i-1234567890abcdef0 may not be
            terminated. Modify its 'disableApiTermination' instance attribute` error message, it indicates that the instance
has been enabled for termination protection. Termination protection prevents the instance from being accidentally
terminated.

You must disable termination protection before you can terminate the instance.

For more information, see [Change instance termination protection](using-changingdisableapitermination.md).

## Instances automatically launched or terminated

Generally, the following behaviors mean that you've used Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, EC2 Fleet, or Spot Fleet to scale
your computing resources automatically based on criteria that you've defined:

- You terminate an instance and a new instance launches automatically.

- You launch an instance and one of your instances terminates automatically.

- You stop an instance and it terminates and a new instance launches automatically.

To stop automatic scaling, find the Auto Scaling group or the fleet that is launching the instances
and either set its capacity to 0 or delete it.
