# EC2 Windows Utility Driver version history

The following table shows which `EC2WinUtil` drivers run on each version of Windows
Server on Amazon EC2. Earlier versions of the operating system use the driver that's preinstalled on
AWS Windows Server AMIs that the instance launched from. AMIs that are shared with you or that
you subscribe to through AWS Marketplace don't have the driver preinstalled.
