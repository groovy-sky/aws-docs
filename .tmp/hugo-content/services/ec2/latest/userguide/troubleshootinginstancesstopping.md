# Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance stop issues

If your Amazon EBS-backed instance appears stuck in the `stopping` state, the issue
might be with the underlying host computer.

To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Force stop the instance**

Use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI to force stop the instance. For the
    steps, see [Force stop an instance](#force-stop-instance).

The instance will first attempt a graceful shutdown, which includes flushing file
    system caches and metadata (although you can optionally bypass the graceful
    shutdown). If the graceful shutdown fails to complete within the timeout period, the
    instance shuts down forcibly without flushing the file system caches and
    metadata.

2. **After force stop**

Perform file system check and repair procedures.

###### Important

Performing these procedures is crucial because a forced stop prevents flushing
of file system caches and metadata.

3. **If force stop fails**

If, after 10 minutes, the instance has not stopped, do the following:
1. Post a request for help on [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/). To help expedite a resolution, include the instance
       ID, and describe the steps that you've already taken.

2. Alternatively, if you have a support plan, create a technical support case
       in the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

3. While waiting for assistance, you can create a replacement instance if
       needed. For the steps, see [(Optional) Create a replacement instance](#Creating_Replacement_Instance).

There is no cost for instance usage while an instance is in the `stopping`
state or in any other state except `running`. You are only charged for instance
usage when an instance is in the `running` state.

## Force stop an instance

You can force an instance to stop. If, after 10 minutes, the instance has not stopped,
post a request for help on [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/). To help expedite
a resolution, include the instance ID, and describe the steps that you've already taken.
Alternatively, if you have a support plan, create a technical support case in the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

###### Note

Using the console, you can force an instance to stop while the instance is in the
`stopping` state only. Using the AWS CLI, you can force an instance to
stop while the instance is in the `pending`, `running`, or
`stopping` state.

Console

###### To force stop an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and
    select the stuck instance.

3. Choose **Instance state**, **Force stop**
**instance**.

Note that **Force stop instance** is only
    available in the console if your instance is in the
    `stopping` state. If your instance is in another
    state (except `shutting-down` and
    `terminated`) you can use the AWS CLI to force stop your
    instance.

4. (Optional) To bypass the graceful OS shutdown during the force
    stop, select the **Skip OS shutdown**
    checkbox.

5. Choose **Force stop**.

AWS CLI

###### To force stop an instance

Use the [stop-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.md) command with the `--force`
option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 stop-instances \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --force
```

To bypass the graceful OS shutdown during force stop, include the
`--skip-os-shutdown` option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 stop-instances \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --force \
    --skip-os-shutdown
```

PowerShell

###### To force stop an instance

Use the [Stop-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/stop-ec2instance.md)
cmdlet and set `-Enforce` to `true`.

```powershell

Stop-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Enforce $true
```

To bypass the graceful OS shutdown during force stop, include
`-SkipOsShutdown $true`.

```powershell

Stop-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Enforce $true `
    -SkipOsShutdown $true
```

## (Optional) Create a replacement instance

While you are waiting for assistance from [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/) or the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home), you can create a replacement instance if needed. Create an AMI
from the stuck instance, and launch a new instance using the new AMI.

###### Important

You can create a replacement instance if the stuck instance produces [system status checks](monitoring-instances-status-check.md) only, as
instance status checks will result in the AMI copying over an exact replica of the
broken operating system. After you've confirmed the status message, create the AMI
and launch a new instance using the new AMI.

Console

###### To create a replacement instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and
    select the stuck instance.

3. Choose **Actions**, **Image and**
**templates**, **Create image**.

4. On the **Create image** page, do the
    following:

1. Enter a name and description for the AMI.

2. Clear **Reboot instance**.

3. Choose **Create image**.

For more information, see [Create an AMI from an instance](creating-an-ami-ebs.md#how-to-create-ebs-ami).

5. Launch a new instance from the AMI and verify that the new
    instance is working.

6. Select the stuck instance, and choose
    **Actions**, **Instance state**,
    **Terminate (delete) instance**. If the
    instance also gets stuck terminating, Amazon EC2 automatically forces it
    to terminate within a few hours.

If you are unable to create an AMI from the instance as described in the previous
procedure, you can set up a replacement instance as follows:

###### (Alternate) To create a replacement instance using the console

1. Select the instance and choose **Description**,
    **Block devices**. Select each volume and make note of its
    volume ID. Be sure to note which volume is the root volume.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Volumes**. Select each
    volume for the instance, and choose **Actions**,
    **Create Snapshot**.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**. Select the
    snapshot that you just created, and choose **Actions**,
    **Create Volume**.

4. Launch an instance with the same operating system as the stuck instance. Note
    the volume ID and device name of its root volume.

5. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, select the
    instance that you just launched, and choose **Instance state**,
    **Stop instance**.

6. In the navigation pane, choose **Volumes**, select the root
    volume of the stopped instance, and choose **Actions**,
    **Detach Volume**.

7. Select the root volume that you created from the stuck instance, choose
    **Actions**, **Attach Volume**, and attach
    it to the new instance as its root volume (using the device name that you made
    note of). Attach any additional non-root volumes to the instance.

8. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and select the
    replacement instance. Choose **Instance state**,
    **Start instance**. Verify that the instance is
    working.

9. Select the stuck instance, choose **Instance state**,
    **Terminate (delete) instance**. If the instance also gets
    stuck terminating, Amazon EC2 automatically forces it to terminate within a few
    hours.

AWS CLI

###### To create a replacement instance

1. Create an AMI from the stuck instance using the [create-image](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-image.md)
    command with the `--no-reboot` option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-image \
       --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
       --name "my-replacement-ami" \
       --description ""AMI for replacement instance" \
       --no-reboot
```

2. Launch a new instance from the AMI that you just created, using the
    [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md)
    command.

3. Verify that the new instance is working.

4. (Optional) Terminate the stuck instance using the [terminate-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
```

PowerShell

###### To create a replacement instance

1. Create an AMI from the stuck instance using the
    [New-EC2Image](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2image.md)
    cmdlet and set `-NoReboot` to `true`.

```powershell

New-EC2Image `
       -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
       -Name "my-replacement-ami" `
       -Description "AMI for replacement instance" `
       -NoReboot $true
```

2. Launch a new instance from the AMI that you just created, using the
    [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md)
    cmdlet.

3. Verify that the new instance is working.

4. (Optional) Terminate the stuck instance using the
    [Remove-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/remove-ec2instance.md)
    cmdlet.

```powershell

Remove-EC2Instance -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0
```
