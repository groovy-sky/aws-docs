# Start a hibernated Amazon EC2 instance

Start a hibernated instance by starting it in the same way that you would start a
stopped instance.

For Spot Instances, if Amazon EC2 hibernated the instance, then only Amazon EC2 can resume it. You
can only resume a hibernated Spot Instance if _you_
hibernated it. Spot Instances can only be resumed if capacity is available and the Spot price
is less than or equal to your specified maximum price.

Console

###### To start a hibernated instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select a hibernated instance, and choose **Instance**
**state**, **Start instance**. It can
    take a few minutes for the instance to enter the
    `running` state. During this time, the instance [status checks](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md#types-of-instance-status-checks)
    show the instance in a failed state until the instance has
    started.

AWS CLI

###### To start a hibernated instance

Use the [start-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
```

PowerShell

###### To start a hibernated instance

Use the [Start-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/start-ec2instance.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

Start-EC2Instance -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0
```
