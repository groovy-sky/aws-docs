# Capacity Reservations in Wavelength Zones

_AWS Wavelength_ enables developers to build applications that deliver
ultra-low latencies to mobile devices and end users. Wavelength deploys standard AWS
compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks. You
can extend an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to one or more Wavelength Zones. You can then use AWS
resources like Amazon EC2 instances to run applications that require ultra-low latency and a
connection to AWS services in the Region. For more information, see [AWS Wavelength Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength).

When you create On-Demand Capacity Reservations, you can choose the Wavelength Zone and you can launch
instances into a Capacity Reservation in a Wavelength Zone by specifying the subnet associated with the
Wavelength Zone. A Wavelength Zone is represented by an AWS Region code followed by an
identifier that indicates the location, for example
`us-east-1-wl1-bos-wlz-1`.

Wavelength Zones are not available in every Region. For information about the Regions that
support Wavelength Zones, see [Available Wavelength\
Zones](../../../wavelength/latest/developerguide/wavelength-quotas.md) in the _AWS Wavelength Developer Guide_.

###### Considerations

You can't use Capacity Reservation groups in a Wavelength Zone.

###### To use a Capacity Reservation in a Wavelength Zone

1. Enable the Wavelength Zone for use in your AWS account. For more information,
    see [Get\
    started with AWS Wavelength](../../../wavelength/latest/developerguide/get-started-wavelength.md) in the _AWS Wavelength Developer_
_Guide_.

2. Create a Capacity Reservation in the Wavelength Zone. For **Availability**
**Zone**, choose the Wavelength. The Wavelength is represented by an AWS
    Region code followed by an identifier that indicates the location, for example
    `us-east-1-wl1-bos-wlz-1`. For more information, see [Create a Capacity Reservation](capacity-reservations-create.md).

3. Create a subnet in the Wavelength Zone. For **Availability**
**Zone**, choose the Wavelength Zone. For more information, see [Create a\
    subnet in your VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/create-subnets.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

4. Launch an instance. For **Subnet**, choose the
    subnet in the Wavelength Zone (for example `subnet-123abc |
   						us-east-1-wl1-bos-wlz-1`), and for **Capacity Reservation**, choose the specification (either `open` or
    target it by ID) that's required for the Capacity Reservation that you created in the Wavelength.
    For more information, see [Launch instances into an existing Capacity Reservation](capacity-reservations-launch.md).
