# Logging Capacity Blocks API calls with AWS CloudTrail

Capacity Blocks is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions
taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Capacity Blocks. CloudTrail captures API calls for
Capacity Blocks as events. The calls captured include calls from the Capacity Blocks console and
code calls to the Capacity Blocks API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable
continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Capacity Blocks. If
you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail
console in **Event history**. Using the information collected by CloudTrail,
you can determine the request that was made to Capacity Blocks, the IP address from which the
request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.

To learn more about CloudTrail, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.md).

## Capacity Blocks information in CloudTrail

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity
occurs in Capacity Blocks, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other
AWS service events in **Event history**. You can view, search,
and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see [Viewing events with CloudTrail Event history](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md).

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for
Capacity Blocks, create a trail. A _trail_ enables CloudTrail to deliver log
files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the
trail applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the
AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify.
Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon
the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

- [Overview for creating a trail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.md)

- [CloudTrail supported services and\
integrations](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.md)

- [Configuring Amazon SNS notifications for\
CloudTrail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/configure-sns-notifications-for-cloudtrail.md)

- [Receiving CloudTrail log files from multiple\
regions](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.md) and [Receiving CloudTrail log files from multiple\
accounts](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.md)

All Capacity Blocks actions are logged by CloudTrail and are documented in the
Amazon EC2 API Reference. For example, calls to the `CapacityBlockScheduled`, and
`CapacityBlockActive` actions generate entries in the CloudTrail log
files.

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The
identity information helps you determine the following:

- Whether the request was made with root or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user
credentials.

- Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a
role or federated user.

- Whether the request was made by another AWS service.

For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity element](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md).

## Understanding Capacity Blocks log file entries

A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3
bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event
represents a single request from any source and includes information about the
requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on.
CloudTrail log files aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't
appear in any specific order.
