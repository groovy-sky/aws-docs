## Invalid device name

### Description

You get the `Invalid device name device_name` error when you try to launch
a new instance.

### Cause

If you get this error when you try to launch an instance, the device name specified for one or more
volumes in the request has an invalid device name. Possible causes include:

- The device name might be in use by the selected AMI.

- The device name might be reserved for root volumes.

- The device name might be used for another volume in the request.

- The device name might not be valid for the operating system.

### Solution

To resolve the issue:

- Ensure that the device name is not used in the AMI that you selected. Run the following command
to view the device names used by the AMI.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-images --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 --query 'Images[*].BlockDeviceMappings[].DeviceName'
```

- Ensure that you are not using a device name that is reserved for root volumes. For more information,
see [Available device names](device-naming.md#available-ec2-device-names).

- Ensure that each volume specified in your request has a unique device name.

- Ensure that the device names that you specified are in the correct format. For more information,
see [Available device names](device-naming.md#available-ec2-device-names).

## Instance limit exceeded

### Description

You get the `InstanceLimitExceeded` error when you try to launch a new instance or restart a stopped instance.

### Cause

If you get an `InstanceLimitExceeded` error when you try to launch a new
instance or restart a stopped instance, you have reached the limit on the number of
instances that you can launch in a Region. When you create your AWS account, we set
default limits on the number of instances you can run on a per-Region basis.

### Solution

You can request an instance limit increase on a per-region basis. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 service quotas](ec2-resource-limits.md).

## Insufficient instance capacity

### Description

You get the `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` error when you try to launch a new instance or restart a stopped instance.

### Cause

If you get this error when you try to launch an instance or restart a stopped instance,
AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to fulfill your
request.

### Solution

To resolve the issue, try the following:

- Wait a few minutes and then submit your request again; capacity can shift
frequently.

- Submit a new request with a reduced number of instances. For example, if you're making a
single request to launch 15 instances, try making 3 requests for 5 instances, or 15 requests
for 1 instance instead.

- If you're launching an instance, submit a new request without specifying an Availability
Zone.

- If you're launching an instance, submit a new request using a different instance type
(which you can resize at a later stage). For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance type changes](ec2-instance-resize.md).

- If you are launching instances into a cluster placement group, you can get an insufficient
capacity error.

## The requested configuration is currently not supported. Please check the documentation for supported configurations.

### Description

You get the `Unsupported` error when you try to launch a new instance
because the instance configuration is not supported.

### Cause

The error message provides additional details. For example, an instance type or instance
purchasing option might not be supported in the specified Region or Availability
Zone.

### Solution

Try a different instance configuration. To search for an instance type that meets your
requirements, see [Find an Amazon EC2 instance type](instance-discovery.md).

## Instance terminates immediately

### Description

Your instance goes from the `pending` state to the `terminated`
state.

### Cause

The following are a few reasons why an instance might immediately terminate:

- You've exceeded your EBS volume limits. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume limits for Amazon EC2 instances](volume-limits.md).

- An EBS snapshot is corrupted.

- The root EBS volume is encrypted and you do not have permissions to access the
KMS key for decryption.

- A snapshot specified in the block device mapping for the AMI is encrypted and you
do not have permissions to access the KMS key for decryption or you do not have access
to the KMS key to encrypt the restored volumes.

- The Amazon S3-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part (an
image.part. _xx_ file).

For more information, get the termination reason using one of the following methods.

###### To get the termination reason using the Amazon EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, and select
    the instance.

3. On the first tab, find the reason next to
    **State transition reason**.

###### To get the termination reason using the AWS CLI

1. Use the [describe-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.md) command and specify the instance ID.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0
```

2. Review the JSON response returned by the command and note the values in
    the `StateReason` response element.

The following code block shows an example of a `StateReason`
    response element.

```json

"StateReason": {
     "Message": "Client.VolumeLimitExceeded: Volume limit exceeded",
     "Code": "Server.InternalError"
},
```

###### To get the termination reason using AWS CloudTrail

For more information, see [Viewing\
events with CloudTrail event history](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md) in the
_AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

### Solution

Depending on the termination reason, take one of the following actions:

- **`Client.VolumeLimitExceeded: Volume limit**
**exceeded`** — Delete unused volumes. You can [submit a request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) to increase your volume
limit.

- **`Client.InternalError: Client**
**error on launch`** — Ensure that you have the
permissions required to access the AWS KMS keys used to decrypt and encrypt volumes.
For more information, see [Using \
key policies in AWS KMS](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

## Insufficient permissions

### Description

You get the `"errorMessage": "You are not authorized to
					perform this operation."` error when you try to launch a new instance, and
the launch fails.

### Cause

If you get this error when you try to launch an instance, you don't have the required IAM
permissions to launch the instance.

Possible missing permissions include:

- `ec2:RunInstances`

- `iam:PassRole`

Other permissions might also be missing. For the list of permissions required to launch an
instance, see the example IAM policies under [Example: Use the EC2 launch instance wizard](iam-policies-ec2-console.md#ex-launch-wizard) and [Launch instances (RunInstances)](examplepolicies-ec2.md#iam-example-runinstances).

### Solution

To resolve the issue:

- If you are making requests as an IAM user, verify that you have the
following permissions:

- `ec2:RunInstances` with a wildcard resource ("\*")

- `iam:PassRole` with the resource matching the role ARN (for example, `arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/ExampleRoleName`)

- If you don't have the preceding permissions, [edit the IAM policy](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-edit.md) associated with the IAM
role or user to add the missing required permissions.

If your issue is not resolved and you continue receiving a launch failure error, you can
decode the authorization failure message included in the error. The decoded message
includes the permissions that are missing from the IAM policy. For more information,
see [How do I\
decode an authorization failure message after I receive an\
"UnauthorizedOperation" error during an EC2 instance launch?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ec2-not-auth-launch)

## High CPU usage shortly after Windows starts (Windows instances only)

###### Note

This troubleshooting tip is for Windows instances only.

If Windows Update is set to **Check for updates but let me choose whether to**
**download and install them** (the default instance setting) this check can
consume anywhere from 50 - 99% of the CPU on the instance. If this CPU consumption
causes problems for your applications, you can manually change Windows Update settings
in **Control Panel** or you can use the following script in the Amazon EC2
user data field:

```nohighlight

reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\Auto Update" /v AUOptions /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f net stop wuauserv net start wuauserv
```

When you run this script, specify a value for /d. The default value is 3. Possible
values include the following:

1. Never check for updates

2. Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install
    them

3. Download updates but let me choose whether to install them

4. Install updates automatically

After you modify the user data for your instance, you can run it. For more
information, see [Run commands on your Windows instance at launch](user-data.md).

## Launching an IMDSv1-enabled instance fails

### Description

You get an `UnsupportedOperation` exception with the following message:

`You can't launch instances with IMDSv1 because httpTokensEnforced is
				enabled for this account. Either launch the instance with httpTokens=required or
				contact your account owner to disable httpTokensEnforced using the
				ModifyInstanceMetadataDefaults API or the account settings in the EC2
				console.`

### Cause

This error is thrown when you attempt to launch a new instance to be IMDSv1 enabled
( `httpTokens = optional`) in an account where the EC2 account
settings or an AWS Organization declarative policy enforces the use of
IMDSv2 ( `httpTokensEnforced = enabled`).

### Solution

If you’re ready to use IMDSv2 only, launch your instance with IMDSv1
disabled ( `httpTokens = required`). To check if you’re ready, see [Transition to using Instance Metadata Service Version 2](instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2.md).

If you still require IMDSv1 support on new or existing instances, you'll need to
disable IMDSv2 enforcement for the account in the Region. To disable
IMDSv2 enforcement, set `HttpTokensEnforced` to
`disabled`. For more information, see [ModifyInstanceMetadataDefaults](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-modifyinstancemetadatadefaults.md) in the Amazon EC2 API Reference. If you prefer to
configure this setting using the console, see [Enforce IMDSv2 at the account level](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#enforce-imdsv2-at-the-account-level).
