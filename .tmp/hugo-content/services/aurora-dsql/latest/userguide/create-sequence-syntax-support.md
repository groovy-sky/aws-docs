# `CREATE SEQUENCE`

`CREATE SEQUENCE` — define a new sequence generator.

###### Important

In PostgreSQL, specifying `CACHE` is optional and defaults to 1. In a
distributed system such as Amazon Aurora DSQL, sequence operations involve coordination, and a cache
size of 1 can increase coordination overhead under high concurrency. While larger
cache values allow sequence numbers to be served from locally preallocated
ranges, improving throughput, unused reserved values can be lost, making gaps and ordering
effects more visible. Because applications differ in their sensitivity to allocation ordering
versus throughput, Amazon Aurora DSQL requires `CACHE` to be specified explicitly and
currently supports `CACHE = 1` or `CACHE >= 65536`, providing a
clear distinction between allocation behavior that is closer to strictly sequential generation
and allocation optimized for highly concurrent workloads.

When `CACHE >= 65536`, sequence values remain guaranteed to be unique but
might not be generated in strict increasing order across sessions, and gaps can occur,
particularly when cached values are not fully consumed. These characteristics are consistent
with PostgreSQL semantics for cached sequences under concurrent use, where both systems guarantee
distinct values but do not guarantee strictly sequential ordering across sessions.

Within a single client session, sequence values may not always appear strictly increasing,
particularly outside explicit transactions. This behavior is similar to PostgreSQL deployments
that use connection pooling. Allocation behavior closer to a single-session PostgreSQL environment
can be achieved by using `CACHE = 1` or by obtaining sequence values within
explicit transactions.

With `CACHE = 1`, sequence allocation follows PostgreSQL's non-cached sequence
behavior.

## Supported syntax

```sql

CREATE SEQUENCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] name CACHE cache
    [ AS data_type ]
    [ INCREMENT [ BY ] increment ]
    [ MINVALUE minvalue | NO MINVALUE ] [ MAXVALUE maxvalue | NO MAXVALUE ]
    [ [ NO ] CYCLE ]
    [ START [ WITH ] start ]
    [ OWNED BY { table_name.column_name | NONE } ]

where data_type is BIGINT
      and cache = 1 or cache >= 65536
```

## Description

`CREATE SEQUENCE` creates a new sequence number generator. This involves creating
and initializing a new special single-row table with the name `name`.
The generator will be owned by the user issuing the command.

If a schema name is given then the sequence is created in the specified schema. Otherwise
it is created in the current schema. The sequence name must be distinct from the name of any
other relation (table, sequence, index, view, materialized view, or foreign table) in the same
schema.

After a sequence is created, you use the functions `nextval`,
`currval`, and `setval` to operate on the sequence. These functions are
documented in [Sequence manipulation functions](sequence-functions-syntax-support.md).

Although you cannot update a sequence directly, you can use a query like:

```sql

SELECT * FROM name;
```

to examine some of the parameters and current state of a sequence. In particular, the
`last_value` field of the sequence shows the last value allocated by any session.
(Of course, this value might be obsolete by the time it is printed, if other sessions are
actively doing `nextval` calls.) Other parameters such as
`increment` and `maxvalue` can be observed in
the `pg_sequences` view.

## Parameters

**`IF NOT EXISTS`**

Do not throw an error if a relation with the same name already exists. A notice is
issued in this case. Note that there is no guarantee that the existing relation is
anything like the sequence that would have been created — it might not even be a
sequence.

**`name`**

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the sequence to be created.

**`data_type`**

The optional clause `AS data_type` specifies the
data type of the sequence. Valid types are `bigint`. `bigint` is
the default. The data type determines the default minimum and maximum values of the
sequence.

**`increment`**

The optional clause `INCREMENT BY
            increment` specifies which value is added to the current
sequence value to create a new value. A positive value will make an ascending sequence, a
negative one a descending sequence. The default value is 1.

**`minvalue` / `NO MINVALUE`**

The optional clause `MINVALUE
            minvalue` determines the minimum value a sequence can
generate. If this clause is not supplied or `NO MINVALUE` is specified, then
defaults will be used. The default for an ascending sequence is 1. The default for a
descending sequence is the minimum value of the data type.

**`maxvalue` / `NO MAXVALUE`**

The optional clause `MAXVALUE
            maxvalue` determines the maximum value for the sequence.
If this clause is not supplied or `NO MAXVALUE` is specified, then default
values will be used. The default for an ascending sequence is the maximum value of the
data type. The default for a descending sequence is -1.

**`CYCLE` / `NO CYCLE`**

The `CYCLE` option allows the sequence to wrap around when the
`maxvalue` or `minvalue` has been
reached by an ascending or descending sequence respectively. If the limit is reached, the
next number generated will be the `minvalue` or
`maxvalue`, respectively.

If `NO CYCLE` is specified, any calls to `nextval` after the
sequence has reached its maximum value will return an error. If neither `CYCLE`
or `NO CYCLE` are specified, `NO CYCLE` is the default.

**`start`**

The optional clause `START WITH start` allows
the sequence to begin anywhere. The default starting value is
`minvalue` for ascending sequences and
`maxvalue` for descending ones.

**`cache`**

The clause `CACHE cache` specifies how many
sequence numbers are to be preallocated and stored in memory for faster access. The
acceptable values for `CACHE` in Aurora DSQL are 1 or any number >= 65536. The
minimum value is 1 (only one value can be generated at a time, meaning no cache).

**`OWNED BY table_name.column_name` / `OWNED BY NONE`**

The `OWNED BY` option causes the sequence to be associated with a specific
table column, such that if that column (or its whole table) is dropped, the sequence will
be automatically dropped as well. The specified table must have the same owner and be in
the same schema as the sequence. `OWNED BY NONE`, the default, specifies that
there is no such association.

## Notes

Use [DROP SEQUENCE](drop-sequence-syntax-support.md) to remove a sequence.

Sequences are based on `bigint` arithmetic, so the range cannot exceed the range
of an eight-byte integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807).

Because `nextval` and `setval` calls are never rolled back, sequence
objects cannot be used if "gapless" assignment of sequence numbers is needed.

Each session will allocate and cache successive sequence values during one access to the
sequence object and increase the sequence object's `last_value` accordingly. Then,
the next `cache`-1 uses of `nextval` within that session
simply return the preallocated values without touching the sequence object. So, any numbers
allocated but not used within a session will be lost when that session ends, resulting in
"holes" in the sequence.

Furthermore, although multiple sessions are guaranteed to allocate distinct sequence values,
the values might be generated out of sequence when all the sessions are considered. For example,
with a `cache` setting of 10, session A might reserve values 1..10 and
return `nextval` =1, then session B might reserve values 11..20 and return
`nextval` =11 before session A has generated `nextval` =2\. Thus, with a
`cache` setting of one it is safe to assume that `nextval`
values are generated sequentially; with a `cache` setting greater than
one you should only assume that the `nextval` values are all distinct, not that they
are generated purely sequentially. Also, `last_value` will reflect the latest value
reserved by any session, whether or not it has yet been returned by `nextval`.

Another consideration is that a `setval` executed on such a sequence will not be
noticed by other sessions until they have used up any preallocated values they have
cached.

## Examples

Create an ascending sequence called `serial`, starting at 101:

```sql

CREATE SEQUENCE serial CACHE 65536 START 101;
```

Select the next number from this sequence:

```sql

SELECT nextval('serial');

 nextval
---------
     101
```

Select the next number from this sequence:

```sql

SELECT nextval('serial');

 nextval
---------
     102
```

Use this sequence in an `INSERT` command:

```sql

INSERT INTO distributors VALUES (nextval('serial'), 'nothing');
```

Reset the sequence to a specific value using `setval`:

```sql

SELECT setval('serial', 200);
SELECT nextval('serial');

 nextval
---------
     201
```

## Compatibility

`CREATE SEQUENCE` conforms to the SQL standard, with the following
exceptions:

- Obtaining the next value is done using the `nextval()` function instead of
the standard's `NEXT VALUE FOR` expression.

- The `OWNED BY` clause is a PostgreSQL extension.
