# Troubleshoot managed certificate renewal

ACM tries to automatically renew your ACM certificates before they expire so that no
action is required from you. Consult the following topics if you have trouble with [Managed certificate renewal in AWS Certificate Manager](managed-renewal.md).

## Preparing for automatic domain validation

Before ACM can renew your certificates automatically, the following must be
true:

- Your certificate must be associated with an AWS service that is integrated with
ACM. For information about the resources that ACM supports, see [Services integrated with ACM](acm-services.md).

- For email-validated certificates, ACM must be able to reach you at an
administrator email address for each domain listed in your certificate. The email
addresses that will be tried are listed in [AWS Certificate Manager email validation](email-validation.md).

- For DNS-validated certificates, make sure that your DNS configuration contains the
correct CNAME records as described in [AWS Certificate Manager DNS validation](dns-validation.md).

- For HTTP-validated certificates, make sure that your redirects are configured as
described in [AWS Certificate Manager HTTP validation](http-validation.md).

## Handling failures in managed certificate renewal

As the certificate nears expiration (45 days for DNS, 45 for EMAIL and 60 days for
Private), ACM attempts to renew the certificate if it meets the [eligibility criteria](managed-renewal.md). You
might have to take actions for the renewal to succeed. For more information, see [Managed certificate renewal in AWS Certificate Manager](managed-renewal.md).

## Managed certificate renewal for email-validated certificates

ACM certificates are valid for 198 days. Renewing a certificate requires action by the domain owner. ACM begins sending renewal notices to the email addresses associated with the domain 45 days before expiration. The notifications contain a link that the
domain owner can click for renewal. Once all listed domains are validated,
ACM issues a renewed certificate with the same ARN.

See [Validate with\
Email](email-validation.md) for instructions on identifying which domains are in the
`PENDING_VALIDATION` state and repeating the validation process for those
domains.

## Managed certificate renewal for DNS-validated certificates

ACM does not attempt TLS validation for DNS-validated certificates. If ACM fails to
renew a certificate you validated with DNS validation, it is most likely due to missing or
inaccurate CNAME records in your DNS configuration. If this occurs, ACM notifies you that
the certificate could not be renewed automatically.

###### Important

You must insert the correct CNAME records into your DNS database. Consult your domain
registrar about how to do this.

You can find the CNAME records for your domains by expanding your certificate and its
domain entries in the ACM console. Refer to the figures below for details. You can also
retrieve CNAME records by using the [DescribeCertificate](../../../../reference/acm/latest/apireference/api-describecertificate.md) operation in the ACM API or the [describe-certificate](../../../cli/latest/reference/acm/describe-certificate.md) command in the ACM CLI. For more information, see [AWS Certificate Manager DNS validation](dns-validation.md).

Choose the target certificate from the console.

Expand the certificate window to find the certificate's CNAME information.

If the problem persists, contact the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support).

## Managed certificate renewal for HTTP-validated certificates

ACM attempts to renew HTTP-validated certificates automatically. If renewal fails,
it's likely due to issues with the HTTP validation records. In such cases, ACM notifies
you that the certificate couldn't be renewed automatically.

###### Important

You must ensure that the content at the `RedirectFrom` location matches the
content at the `RedirectTo` location for each domain in the certificate.

You can find the HTTP validation information for your domains by expanding your
certificate and its domain entries in the ACM console. You can also retrieve this
information using the [DescribeCertificate](../../../../reference/acm/latest/apireference/api-describecertificate.md) operation in the ACM API or the [describe-certificate](../../../cli/latest/reference/acm/describe-certificate.md) command in the ACM CLI. For more information, see [AWS Certificate Manager HTTP validation](http-validation.md).

If the problem persists, contact the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support).

## Understanding renewal timing

[Managed certificate renewal in AWS Certificate Manager](managed-renewal.md) is an asynchronous
process. This means that the steps don't occur in immediate succession. After all domain
names in an ACM certificate have been validated, there might be a delay before ACM
obtains the new certificate. An additional delay can occur between the time when ACM
obtains the renewed certificate and the time when that certificate is deployed to the AWS
resources that use it. Therefore, changes to the certificate status can take up to several
hours to appear in the console.
