# Renewal for domains validated by HTTP

ACM provides automated managed renewal for certificates that were originally
issued using HTTP validation through CloudFront.

At 45 days prior to expiration, ACM checks for the following renewal
criteria:

###### Note

Previously issued certificates with a 395-day validity period renew
60 days before expiration and receive a renewed validity period of
198 days. Certificates with a 198-day validity period renew 45 days
before expiration.

- The certificate is currently in use by CloudFront.

- All required HTTP validation records are accessible and contain the
expected content.

If these criteria are met, ACM considers the domain names validated and renews
the certificate.

ACM sends AWS Health events and Amazon EventBridge events if it can't automatically
validate a domain during renewal. These events are sent at 30 days, 15
days, seven days, three days, and one day prior to expiration. For more information,
see [Amazon EventBridge support for ACM](supported-events.md).

To ensure successful renewal, make sure that the content at the
`RedirectFrom` location matches the content at the
`RedirectTo` location for each domain in the certificate.
