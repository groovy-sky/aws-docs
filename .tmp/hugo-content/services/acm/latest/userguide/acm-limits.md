# Quotas

The following AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service quotas apply to each AWS region per each AWS
account.

To see what quotas can be adjusted, see the [ACM quotas table](../../../../general/latest/gr/acm.md#limits_acm) in the _AWS General Reference_
_Guide_. To request quota increases, create a case at the [Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

## General quotas

###### The following general service quotas apply to your AWS account when  using ACM.

ItemDefault quota**Number of ACM certificates**

Expired and
revoked certificates continue to count toward this total.

Certificates
signed by a CA from AWS Private CA do not count toward this total.

2500**Number of ACM certificates per year (last 365**
**days)**

You can request up to twice your quota of ACM certificates
per year, region, and account. For example, if your quota is 2,500, you can
request up to 5,000 ACM certificates per year in a given region and account. You
can only have 2,500 certificates at any given time. To request 5,000 certificates
in a year, you must delete 2,500 during the year to stay within the quota. If you
need more than 2,500 certificates at any given time, you must contact the
**[Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home)**.

Certificates signed by a CA
from AWS Private CA do not count toward this total.

5,000**Number of imported certificates**2,500**Number of imported certificates per year (last 365**
**days)**5,000**Number of domain names per ACM**
**certificate**

The default quota is 10 domain names for each ACM
certificate. Your quota may be greater.

The first domain name that
you submit is included as the subject common name (CN) of the certificate. All
names are included in the Subject Alternative Name extension.

You can
request up to 100 domain names. To request an increase to your quota, create a request in the Service Quotas console for the ACM service. Before creating a case, however, make sure you
understand how adding more domain names can create more administrative work for
you if you use email validation. For more information, see [Domain validation](acm-bestpractices.md#best-practices-validating).

The quota for the number of domain names per ACM certificate
applies only to certificates that are provided by ACM. This quota does not apply
to certificates that you import into ACM. The following sections apply only to
ACM certificates.

10**Number of Private CAs**

ACM is integrated
with AWS Private Certificate Authority (AWS Private CA). You can use the ACM console, AWS CLI, or ACM API to
request private certificates from an existing private certificate authority (CA)
hosted by AWS Private CA. These certificates are managed within the ACM environment
and have the same restrictions as public certificates issued by ACM. For more
information, see [Request a private certificate in AWS Certificate Manager](gs-acm-request-private.md). You can also issue private
certificates by using the standalone AWS Private CA service. For more information, see
[Issue a Private End-Entity\
Certificate](../../../privateca/latest/userguide/pcaissuecert.md).

A private CA that has been deleted will count towards
your quota until the end of its restoration period. For more information, see [Deleting Your Private CA](../../../acm-pca/latest/userguide/pcadeleteca.md).200**Number of Private Certificates per CA**
**(lifetime)**1,000,000

## API rate quotas

The following quotas apply to the ACM API for each region and account. ACM throttles
API requests at different quotas depending on the API operation. Throttling means that ACM
rejects an otherwise valid request because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the
number of requests per second. When a request is throttled, ACM returns a
`ThrottlingException` error. The following table lists each API operation and
the quota at which ACM throttles requests for that operation.

###### Note

In addition to the API actions listed in the table below, ACM can also call the
external `IssueCertificate` action from AWS Private CA. For up-to-date rate quota
information on `IssueCertificate`, see the [endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/acm-pca.md#limits_acm-pca) for
AWS Private CA.
