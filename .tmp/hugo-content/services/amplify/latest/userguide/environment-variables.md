# Using environment variables in an Amplify application

Environment variables are key-value pairs that you can add to your application's settings
to make them available to Amplify Hosting. As a best practice, you can use environment
variables to expose application configuration data. All environment variables that you add are
encrypted to prevent rogue access.

Amplify enforces the following constraints on the environment variables that you create.

- Amplify doesn't allow you to create environment variable names with an `AWS`
prefix. This prefix is reserved for Amplify internal use only.

- The value of an environment variable can't exceed 5500 characters.

###### Important

Don't use environment variables to store secrets. For a Gen 2 app, use the **Secret management** feature in the Amplify console. For more information, see [Secrets and environment vars](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/secrets-and-vars) in the _Amplify_
_Documentation_. For a Gen 1 app, store secrets
in an environment secret created using the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. For more information,
see [Managing environment secrets](environment-secrets.md).

## Amplify environment variable reference

The following environment variables are accessible by default within the Amplify

USER\_DISABLE\_TESTS

The test step is skipped during a build. You can disable tests for all
branches or specific branches in an app.

This environment variable is used for apps that perform tests during the

This includes some padding of ‘0’ so it always has the same
length.

The path to use for diff based frontend deployment comparisons, relative
to the root of your repository.

`dist`

AMPLIFY\_DIFF\_BACKEND

Enable or disable diff based backend builds. This applies to Gen 1 apps
only. For more information, see [Configuring diff based backend builds for a Gen 1 app](edit-build-settings.md#enable-diff-backend)

`true`

AMPLIFY\_BACKEND\_PULL\_ONLY

Amplify manages this environment variable. This applies to Gen 1 apps
only. For more information, see [Edit an existing frontend to point to a different backend](reuse-backends.md#reuse-backends-edit-existing)

`true`

AMPLIFY\_BACKEND\_APP\_ID

Amplify manages this environment variable. This applies to Gen 1 apps
only. For more information, see [Edit an existing frontend to point to a different backend](reuse-backends.md#reuse-backends-edit-existing)

`abcd1234`

AMPLIFY\_SKIP\_BACKEND\_BUILD

If you do not have a backend section in your build specification and want
to disable backend builds, set this environment variable to
`true`. This applies to Gen 1 apps only.

`true`

AMPLIFY\_ENABLE\_DEBUG\_OUTPUT

Set this variable to `true` to print a stack trace in the logs. This is helpful
for debugging backend build errors.

specified by the AMPLIFY\_USERPOOL\_ID environment variable.

`true`

###### Note

The `AMPLIFY_AMAZON_CLIENT_ID` and
`AMPLIFY_AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables are OAuth tokens, not
an AWS access key and secret key.

## Frontend framework environment variables

If you are developing your app with a frontend framework that supports its own
environment variables, it is important to understand that these are not the same as the
environment variables you configure in the Amplify console. For example, React (prefixed
REACT\_APP) and Gatsby (prefixed GATSBY), enable you to create runtime environment variables
that those frameworks automatically bundle into your frontend production build. To
understand the effects of using these environment variables to store values, refer to the
documentation for the frontend framework you are using.

Storing sensitive values, such as API keys, inside these frontend framework prefixed
environment variables is not a best practice and is highly discouraged.
