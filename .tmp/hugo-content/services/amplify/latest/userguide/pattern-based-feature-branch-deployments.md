# Pattern-based feature branch deployments

Pattern-based branch deployments allow you to automatically deploy branches that match a
specific pattern to Amplify. Product teams using feature branch or GitFlow workflows for
their releases, can now define patterns such as `release**` to automatically deploy Git
branches that begin with ‘release’ to a shareable URL.

1. Choose **App settings**, then **Branch settings**.

2. On the **Branch settings** page, choose **Edit**.

3. Select **Branch autodetection** to automatically connect branches to Amplify that match a pattern set.

4. In the **Branch autodetection - patterns** box, enter the patterns for automatically deploying branches.

- `*` – Deploys all branches
in your repository.

- `release*` – Deploys all
branches that begin with the word ‘release'.

- `release*/` – Deploys all
branches that match a ‘release /’ pattern.

- Specify multiple patterns in a comma-separated list. For example,
`release*, feature*`.

5. Set up automatic password protection for all branches that are automatically
    created by selecting **Branch autodetection access**
**control** .

6. For Gen 1 applications built with an Amplify backend, you can choose to create a
    new environment for every connected branch, or point all branches to an existing
    backend.

7. Choose **Save**.

## Pattern-based feature branch deployments for an app connected to a custom domain

You can use pattern-based feature branch deployments for an app connected to an
Amazon Route 53 custom domain.
