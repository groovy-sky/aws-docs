# Configuring the build instance for an Amplify application

Amplify Hosting offers configurable build instance sizes that enable you to provide your
application's build instance with the CPU, memory, and disk space resources that it requires.
Prior to the release of this feature, Amplify provided a fixed size build instance
configuration of 8 GiB of memory and 4 vCPUs.

Amplify supports three build instance types: Standard,
Large, and XLarge. If you don't specify an instance type,
Amplify uses the default Standard instance. You can configure the build
instance type for an application using the Amplify console, the AWS CLI, or the SDKs.

The cost for each build instance type is calculated per build minute. For pricing details,
see [AWS Amplify Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing).

The following table describes the compute specifications for each build instance
type:

## Understanding build instance types

The build instance type setting is configured at the application level and extends to all
of the application's branches. The following key details apply to build instance types:

- The build instance type that you configure for an application automatically applies to
auto-created branches and pull request previews.

- The _Concurrent jobs_ service quota applies across all build
instance types in your AWS account. For example, if your _Concurrent_
_jobs_ limit is five, you can run up to a maximum of 5 builds across all
instance types in your AWS account.

- The cost for each build instance type is calculated per build minute. The build
instance allocation process can require additional overhead time before your build starts.
For larger instances, especially XLarge, your build might experience latency before the
build starts, due to this overhead time. However, you are billed only for the actual build
time, not the overhead time.

You can configure the build instance type when you create a new application or you can
update the instance type on an existing application. For instructions on configuring this
setting in the Amplify console, see [Configuring the build instance type in the Amplify console](#configure-build-instance-type). You can also update this setting using the
SDKs. For more information, see the [CreateApp](../../../../reference/amplify/latest/apireference/api-createapp.md), and [UpdateApp](../../../../reference/amplify/latest/apireference/api-updateapp.md)
APIs in the _Amplify API Reference_.

If you have existing applications in your account that were created before the release of
the customizable build instance type feature, they are using the default
Standard instance type. When you update the build instance type for an
existing application, any builds that are queued or in progress before your update will
utilize the previously configured build instance type. For example, if you have an existing
application with the `main` branch deployed to Amplify and you update its build
instance type from **Standard** to **Large**, all new builds
that you initiate from the `main` branch will use the **Large**
build instance type. However, any builds that are in progress at the time that you update the
build instance type will continue to run on the **Standard** instance.

## Configuring the build instance type in the Amplify console

Use the following procedure to configure the build instance type when you create a new
Amplify application.

###### To configure the build instance type for a new application

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. On the **All apps** page, choose **Create new**
**app**.

3. On the **Start building with Amplify** page, choose your Git
    repository provider, then choose **Next**.

4. On the **Add repository branch** page, do the following:
1. In the **Recently updated repositories** list, select the name of
       the repository to connect.

2. In the **Branch** list, select the name of the repository branch
       to connect.

3. Choose **Next**.
5. On the **App settings** page, open the **Advanced**
**settings** section.

6. For **Build instance type**, choose your desired instance type from
    the list.

7. If you are deploying a Node.js runtime based application, configure the heap memory
    size to effectively utilize a large instance type. You can do this on the **App**
**settings** page by either setting an environment variable or updating the build
    settings. For more information, see [Configuring an application's heap memory to utilize large instance types](#configuring-heap-memory).
   - Set an environment variable
     1. In the **Advanced settings**, **Environment**
        **variables** section, choose **Add new**.

     2. For **Key** enter `NODE_OPTIONS`.

     3. For **Value**, enter `--max-old-space-size=memory_size_in_mb`. Replace `memory_size_in_mb` with your desired heap memory size in megabytes.
   - Update the build settings
     1. In the **Build settings** section, choose **Edit YML file**.

     2. Add the following command to the `preBuild` phase. Replace `memory_size_in_mb` with your desired heap memory size in megabytes.

        ```nohighlight

        export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=memory_size_in_mb'
        ```

     3. Choose **Save**.
8. Choose, **Next**.

9. On the **Review** page, choose **Save and**
**deploy**.

Use the following procedure to configure the build instance type for an existing Amplify
application.

###### To configure the build instance type for an existing application

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. Choose the app that you want to configure the build instance type for.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, the choose
    **Build settings**.

4. On the **Build settings** page, in the **Advanced**
**settings** section, choose **Edit**.

5. On the **Edit settings** page, for **Build instance**
**type**, choose your desired instance type from the list.

6. Choose **Save**. This change will take effect the next time you
    deploy the application.

7. (Optional) To deploy the updated application immediately, do the following:
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Overview**.

2. On your application's overview page, choose the branch to redeploy.

3. On the **Deployment** page, choose a deployment, such as the most
       recent deployment. Then, choose **Redeploy this version**. A new
       deployment will begin.

4. When the deployment completes, the application's build settings will show that the
       branch is using the updated build instance type.

## Configuring an application's heap memory to utilize large instance types

If you are building memory intensive applications, use this section to understand how to
configure your application to utilize large instance types. Programming languages and
frameworks often rely on allocating dynamic memory, also known as heap memory, during runtime
to manage application memory requirements. Heap memory is requested by the runtime environment
and allocated by the host operating system. By default, runtime environments enforce a maximum
heap size limit available to the application. This means that no additional memory will be
available for the application beyond the heap size, even though the host operating system or
container has a larger amount of memory available.

As an example, the JavaScript Node.js v8 runtime environment enforces a default heap size
limit which depends on several factors, including the host memory size. As a result,
Standard and Large build instances have a default Node.js heap
size of 2096 MB and the XLarge instance has a default heap size of 4144 MB.
Therefore, building an application with a 6000 MB memory requirement using the default Node.js
heap size on any Amplify build instance type will result in a failed build due to an out-of-memory error.

To work around the Node.js default heap size memory limits, you can do one of the
following:

- Set the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable in your Amplify application
to the value
`--max-old-space-size=memory_size_in_mb`. For
`memory_size_in_mb`, specify your desired heap memory size in
megabytes.

For instructions, see [Setting environment variables](setting-env-vars.md).

- Add the following command to the `preBuild` phase in your Amplify
application's build specification.

```nohighlight

export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=memory_size_in_mb'
```

You can update the build specification in the Amplify console or in your
application's `amplify.yml` file in your project repository. For
instructions, see [Configuring the build settings for an Amplify application](build-settings.md).

The following example Amplify build specification sets a Node.js heap memory size to
7000 MB for building a React frontend application:

```yaml

version: 1
frontend:
    phases:
      preBuild:
        commands:
          # Set the heap size to 7000 MB
        - export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=7000'
        # To check the heap size memory limit in MB
        - node -e "console.log('Total available heap size (MB):', v8.getHeapStatistics().heap_size_limit / 1024 / 1024)"
        - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
artifacts:
    baseDirectory: build
    files:
      - '**/*'
cache:
    paths:
      - .npm/**/*
```

To effectively utilize large instance types, it is important to have a sufficient heap
memory size configured. Configuring a small heap size for a memory intensive application will
likely result in a build failure. The application's build logs might not directly indicate an
out-of-memory error as the application runtime can crash unexpectedly. Configuring a heap size
as large as the host memory might result in the host operating system swapping or terminating
other processes, and potentially disrupting your build process. As a reference, Node.js
recommends setting a maximum heap size of 1536 MB on a machine with approximately 2000 MB of
memory to leave some memory for other uses.

The optimal heap size depends on your application's needs and resource usage. If you
encounter out-of-memory errors, start with a moderate heap size and then gradually increase it
as needed. As a guideline, we recommend starting with 6000 MB for a Standard
instance type, 12000 MB for a Large instance type, and 60000 MB for an
XLarge instance type.
