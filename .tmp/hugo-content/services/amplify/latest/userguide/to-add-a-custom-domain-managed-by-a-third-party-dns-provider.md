# Adding a custom domain managed by a third-party DNS provider

If you are not using Amazon Route 53 to manage your domain, you can add a custom domain
managed by a third-party DNS provider to your app deployed with Amplify.

If you are using GoDaddy, see [Updating DNS records for a domain managed by GoDaddy](to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-godaddy.md) for instructions specific to this provider.

###### To add a custom domain managed by a third-party DNS provider

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

02. Choose your app that you want to add a custom domain to.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, **Custom**
    **domains**.

04. On the **Custom domains** page, choose **Add**
    **domain**.

05. Enter the name of your root domain. For example, if the name of your domain is
     **https://example.com**, enter
     `example.com`.

06. Amplify detects that you are not using a Route 53 domain and gives you the option
     to create a hosted zone in Route 53.
    - To create a hosted zone in Route 53
      1. Choose **Create hosted zone on Route 53**.

      2. Choose **Configure domain**.

      3. Hosted zone name servers are displayed in the console. Go to your DNS
          provider's website and add the name servers to your DNS settings.

      4. Select **I have added the above name servers to my domain**
         **registry**.

      5. Proceed to step seven.
    - To continue with manual configuration
      1. Choose **Manual configuration**

      2. Choose **Configure domain**.

      3. Proceed to step seven.
07. By default, Amplify automatically creates two subdomain entries for your domain.
     For example, if your domain name is **example.com**, you
     will see the subdomains **https://www.example.com** and
     **https://example.com** with a redirect set up from
     the root domain to the **www** subdomain.

    (Optional) You can modify the default configuration if you want to add subdomains
     only. To change the default configuration, choose **Rewrites and**
    **redirects** from the navigation pane and configure your domain.

08. Choose the SSL/TLS certificate to use. You can either use the default managed
     certificate that Amplify provisions for you, or a custom third-party certificate
     that you have imported into AWS Certificate Manager.
    - Use the default Amplify managed certificate.
      1. Choose **Amplify managed certificate**.
    - Use a custom third-party certificate.
      1. Choose **Custom SSL certificate**.

      2. Select the certificate to use from the list.
09. Choose **Add domain**.

10. If you chose **Create hosted zone on Route 53** in step six, proceed
     to step 15.

    If you chose **Manual configuration**, in step six, you must
     update your DNS records with your third-party domain provider.

    On the **Actions** menu, choose **View DNS**
    **records**. The following screenshot shows the DNS records displayed in
     the console.

11. Do one of the following:

- If you're using GoDaddy, go to [Updating DNS records for a domain managed by GoDaddy](to-add-a-custom-domain-managed-by-godaddy.md).

- If you're using a different third-party DNS provider, go to the next step in
this procedure.

12. Go to your DNS provider's website, log in to your account, and locate the DNS
     management settings for your domain. You will configure two CNAME records.

13. Configure the first CNAME record to point your subdomain to the AWS validation
     server.

    If the Amplify console displays a DNS record for verifying ownership of your
     subdomain such as **\_c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e.example.com**, enter only `
                      _c3e2d7eaf1e656b73f46cd6980fdc0e` for the CNAME record subdomain
     name.

    The following screenshot shows the location of the verification record to
     use.

    If the the Amplify console displays an ACM validation server record such as
     **\_cjhwou20vhu2exampleuw20vuyb2ovb9.j9s73ucn9vy.acm-validations.aws**,
     enter
     `_cjhwou20vhu2exampleuw20vuyb2ovb9.j9s73ucn9vy.acm-validations.aws`
     for the CNAME record value.

    The following screenshot shows the location of the ACM verification record to
     use.

    ![The DNS records in the Amplify console, including the ACM verification record.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/amplify-customdomains-DNS-verification2.png)

    Amplify uses this information to verify ownership of your domain and generate an
     SSL/TLS certificate for your domain. Once Amplify validates ownership of your
     domain, all traffic will be served using HTTPS/2.

    ###### Note

    The default Amplify certificate generated by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is valid for 13
    months and renews automatically as long as your app is hosted with Amplify.
    Amplify can't renew the certificate if the CNAME verification record has been
    modified or deleted. You must delete and add the domain again in the Amplify
    console.

    ###### Important

    It is important that you perform this step soon after adding your custom domain
    in the Amplify console. The AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) immediately starts attempting to
    verify ownership. Over time, the checks become less frequent. If you add or update
    your CNAME records a few hours after you create your app, this can cause your app
    to get stuck in the pending verification state.

14. Configure a second CNAME record to point your subdomains to the Amplify domain.
     For example, if your subdomain is **www.example.com**,
     enter **www** for the subdomain name.

    If the Amplify console displays the domain for your app as **d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net**, enter
     `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net` for the Amplify
     domain.

    If you have production traffic, we recommended you update this CNAME record after
     your domain status shows as **AVAILABLE** in the Amplify
     console.

    The following screenshot shows the location of the domain name record to
     use.

    ![The DNS records in the Amplify console, including the domain name record.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/amplify-customdomains-DNS-verification3.png)

15. Configure the ANAME/ALIAS record to point to the root domain of your app (for
     example **https://example.com**). An ANAME record points
     the root of your domain to a hostname. If you have production traffic, we recommended
     that you update your ANAME record after your domain status shows as
     **AVAILABLE** in the console. For DNS providers that don't have
     ANAME/ALIAS support, we strongly recommend migrating your DNS to Route 53. For more
     information, see [Configuring Amazon Route\
     53 as your DNS service](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/dns-configuring.md).

###### Note

Verification of domain ownership and DNS propagation for third-party domains can take
up to 48 hours. For help resolving errors that occur, see [Troubleshooting custom domains](custom-domain-troubleshoot-guide.md).
