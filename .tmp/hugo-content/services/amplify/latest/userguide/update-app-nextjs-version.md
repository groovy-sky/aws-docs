# Migrating a Next.js 11 SSR app to Amplify Hosting compute

When you deploy a new Next.js app, by default Amplify uses the most recent supported
version of Next.js. Currently, the Amplify Hosting compute SSR provider supports Next.js
version 15.

The Amplify console detects apps in your account that were deployed prior to the November 2022
release of the Amplify Hosting compute service with full support for Next.js versions 12 through 15.
The console displays an information banner identifying apps with branches that are deployed
using Amplify's previous SSR provider, Classic (Next.js 11 only). We strongly recommend that
you migrate your apps to the Amplify Hosting compute SSR provider.

If you are updating your hosted Next.js 11 application to Next.js 12 or later, you might
get a `"target" property is no longer supported` error when a deployment is
triggered. In this case, You must migrate to Amplify Hosting compute.

You must manually migrate the app and all of its production branches at the same time.
An app can't contain both Classic (Next.js 11 only) and Next.js 12 or later branches.

Use the following instructions to migrate an app to the Amplify Hosting compute SSR
provider.

###### To migrate an app to the Amplify Hosting compute SSR provider

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. Choose the Next.js app that you want to migrate.

###### Note

Before you migrate an app in the Amplify console, you must first update the
app's package.json file to use Next.js version 12 or later.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **App settings**,
    **General**.

4. On the app homepage, the console displays a banner if the app has branches deployed
    using the _Classic (Next.js 11 only)_ **SSR provider**. On the banner, choose
    **Migrate**.

5. In the migration confirmation window, select the three statements and choose
    **Migrate**.

6. Amplify will build and redeploy your app to complete the migration.

## Reverting an SSR migration

When you deploy a Next.js app, Amplify Hosting detects the settings in your app and
sets the internal platform value for the app. There are three valid platform values. An
SSG app is set to the platform value `WEB`. An SSR app using Next.js version 11
is set to the platform value `WEB_DYNAMIC`. A Next.js 12 or later SSR app is
set to the platform value `WEB_COMPUTE`.

When you migrate an app using the instructions in the previous section, Amplify
changes the platform value of your app from `WEB_DYNAMIC` to
`WEB_COMPUTE`. After the migration to Amplify Hosting compute is complete,
you can't revert the migration in the console. To revert the migration, you must use the
AWS Command Line Interface to change the app's platform back to `WEB_DYNAMIC`. Open a terminal
window and enter the following command, updating the app ID and Region with your unique
information.

```nohighlight

aws amplify update-app --app-id abcd1234 --platform WEB_DYNAMIC --region us-west-2
```
