# Setting environment variables

Use the following instructions to set environment variables for an application in the Amplify console.

###### Note

**Environment variables** is visible in the Amplify console’s
**App settings** menu only when an app is set up for continuous
deployment and connected to a git repository. For instructions on this type of deployment,
see [Getting started with existing code](getting-started.md).

###### To set environment variables

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. In the Amplify console, choose **Hosting**, and then choose
    **Environment variables**.

3. On the **Environment variables** page, choose **Manage**
**variables**.

4. For **Variable**, enter your key. For **Value**,
    enter your value. By default, Amplify applies the environment variables across all
    branches, so you don’t have to re-enter variables when you connect a new
    branch.

5. (Optional) To customize an environment variable specifically for a branch, add a
    branch override as follows:
1. Choose **Actions** and then choose **Add variable**
      **override**.

2. You now have a set of environment variables specific to your branch.
6. Choose **Save**.

###### To connect a branch to an app

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. The procedure for connecting a branch to an app varies depending on whether you
    are connecting a branch to a new app or an existing app.
   - **Connecting a branch to a new app**
     1. On the **Build settings** page, locate the
         **Select a backend environment to use with this**
        **branch** section. For **Environment**,
         choose **Create new environment**, and enter the name of
         your backend environment. The following screenshot shows the
         **Select a backend environment to use with this**
        **branch** section of the **Build settings**
         page with `backend` entered for the backend
         environment name.

     2. Expand the **Advanced settings** section on the
         **Build settings** page and add environment variables
         for social sign-in keys. For example,
         `AMPLIFY_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET` is a valid
         environment variable. For the list of Amplify system environment
         variables that are available by default, see the table in [Amplify environment variable reference](environment-variables.md#amplify-console-environment-variables).
   - **Connecting a branch to an existing**
     **app**
     1. If you are connecting a new branch to an existing app, set the social
         sign-in environment variables before connecting the branch. In the
         navigation pane, choose **App Settings**,
         **Environment variables**.

     2. In the **Environment variables** section, choose
         **Manage variables**.

     3. In the **Manage variables** section, choose
         **Add variable**.

     4. For **Variable** (key), enter your client ID. For
         **Value**, enter your client secret.

     5. Choose, **Save**.
