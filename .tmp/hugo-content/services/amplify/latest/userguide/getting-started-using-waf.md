# Enabling AWS WAF for an Amplify application in the AWS Management Console

You can enable AWS WAF protections for an Amplify app either in the Amplify console or in
the AWS WAF console.

- **Amplify console** — You can enable the Firewall
capabilities for an existing Amplify app by associating an AWS WAF web ACL to your app in the
Amplify console. Use one-click protection to create a web ACL with pre-configured rules that
we consider as best practice for most apps. You have the option to customize access by IP
address and country. The instructions in this section describe setting up one-click
protections.

- **AWS WAF console**— Use a preconfigured web ACL that you
create in the AWS WAF console or by using the AWS WAF APIs. You must create web ACLs that you want to associate with an Amplify app in the Global
(CloudFront) Region. Regional web ACLs might already exist in your AWS account, but they are not
compatible with Amplify. For getting started instructions, see [Setting up AWS WAF and its components](../../../waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started.md) in the _AWS WAF Developer Guide_.

Use the following procedure to enable AWS WAF for an existing app in the Amplify
console.

###### Enable AWS WAF for an existing Amplify app

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amplify console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. On the **All apps** page, choose the name of the deployed app to enable
    the Firewall feature on.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, and then choose
    **Firewall**.

The following screenshot shows how to navigate to the **Add firewall**
    page in the Amplify console.

4. On the **Add firewall** page, your actions will depend on whether you
    want to create a new AWS WAF configuration or use an existing one.
   - Create a new AWS WAF configuration.

     1. Choose **Create new**.

     2. Optionally, enable any of the following configurations:
        1. Turn on **Enable Amplify-recommended Firewall**
           **protection**.

        2. Turn on **Restrict access to amplifyapp.com** to prevent access to
            your app on the default Amplify domain.

        3. For **IP addresses**, turn on **Enable IP address**
           **protections**.
           1. For **Action**, choose **Allow** if you want to
               specify the IP addresses that will have access and all others will be blocked. Choose
               **Block** if you want to specify the IP addresses that will be
               blocked and all others will have access.

           2. For **IP version**, select either **IPV4** or
               **IPV6**.

           3. In the **IP addresses** text box, enter either your allowed or
               blocked IP addresses, one per line, in CIDR format.
        4. For **Countries**, turn on **Enable country**
           **protection**.
           1. For **Action**, choose **Allow** if you want to
               specify the countries that will have access and all others will be blocked. Choose
               **Block** if you want to specify the countries that will be blocked
               and all others will have access.

           2. For **Countries**, select either your allowed or blocked
               countries from the list.

The following screenshot demonstrates how to enable a new AWS WAF configuration for an
app.

   - Use an existing AWS WAF configuration.
     1. Choose **Use existing AWS WAF configuration**.

     2. Select a saved configuration from the list of web ACLs in AWS WAF in your
         AWS account. The web ACL that you associate with your Amplify app must be created in the Global
         (CloudFront) Region. Regional web ACLs might already exist in your AWS account, but they are not
         compatible with Amplify.
5. Choose **Add firewall**.

6. On the **Firewall** page, the **Associating** status is
    displayed to indicate that the AWS WAF settings are being propagated. When the process is
    complete, the status changes to **Enabled**.

The following screenshots show the firewall progress status in the Amplify console,
    indicating when the AWS WAF configuration is **Associating** and
    **Enabled**.
