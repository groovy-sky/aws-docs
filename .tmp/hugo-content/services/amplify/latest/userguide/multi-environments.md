# Feature branch deployments and team workflows

Amplify Hosting is designed to work with feature branch and GitFlow workflows. Amplify
uses Git branches to create a new deployment each time you connect a new branch in your
repository. After you connect your first branch, you create additional feature
branches.

###### To add a branch to an app

1. Choose the app you want to add a branch to.

2. Choose **App settings**, then **Branch**
**settings**.

3. On the **Branch settings** page, choose **Add**
**branch**.

4. Select a branch from your repository.

5. Choose **Add branch.**

6. Redeploy your app.

After you add a branch, your app has two deployments available at the Amplify default
domains, such as _https://main.appid.amplifyapp.com_
and _https://dev.appid.amplifyapp.com_. This may
vary from team-to-team, but typically the **main branch** tracks
release code and is your production branch. The **develop**
**branch** is used as an integration branch to test new features. This enables beta
testers to test unreleased features on the develop branch deployment, without affecting any of
the production end users on the main branch deployment.
