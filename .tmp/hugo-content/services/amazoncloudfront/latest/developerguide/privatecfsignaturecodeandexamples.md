# Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL

This section includes downloadable application examples that demonstrate how to create
signatures for signed URLs. Examples are available in Perl, PHP, C#, and Java. You can
use any of the examples to create signed URLs. The Perl script runs on Linux and macOS
platforms. The PHP example will work on any server that runs PHP. The C# example uses
the .NET Framework.

The examples in this section use SHA-1 to hash and sign the policy statement. You can also use SHA-256. To use SHA-256, update the hash algorithm in the signing function (for example, replace `sha1` with `sha256` in OpenSSL calls, or use the equivalent SHA-256 constant in your language's cryptographic library). When you use SHA-256, include the `Hash-Algorithm=SHA256` query parameter in the signed URL.

For example code in JavaScript (Node.js), see [Creating Amazon CloudFront Signed URLs in Node.js](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/creating-amazon-cloudfront-signed-urls-in-node-js) on the AWS Developer Blog.

For example code in Python, see [Generate a signed URL for Amazon CloudFront](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/cloudfront.html) in the _AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) API Reference_ and [this\
example code](https://github.com/boto/boto3/blob/develop/boto3/examples/cloudfront.rst) in the Boto3 GitHub repository.
