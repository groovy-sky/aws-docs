New features

CloudFront now supports WebSocket, a TCP-based protocol that is useful when you need
long-lived connections between clients and servers. You can also now set up CloudFront with
origin failover for scenarios that require high availability. For more information, see
[Using WebSocket with\
CloudFront Distributions](distribution-working-with-websockets.md) and [Optimizing High Availability\
with CloudFront Origin Failover](high-availability-origin-failover.md).

New feature

CloudFront now supports detailed error logging for HTTP requests that run Lambda functions.
You can store the logs in CloudWatch and use them to help troubleshoot HTTP 5xx errors when your
function returns an invalid response. For more information, see [CloudWatch Metrics and CloudWatch Logs for\
Lambda Functions](lambda-cloudwatch-metrics-logging.md).

October 8, 2018

New feature

You can now opt to have Lambda@Edge expose the body in a request for writable HTTP
methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, and so on), so that you can access it in your Lambda function.
You can choose read-only access, or you can specify that you'll replace the body. For more
information, see [Accessing the\
Request Body by Choosing the Include Body Option](lambda-include-body-access.md).

New feature

CloudFront now supports serving content compressed by using brotli or other
compression algorithms, in addition to or instead of gzip. For more information, see
[Serving Compressed\
Files](servingcompressedfiles.md).

Reorganization

The Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide has been reorganized to simplify finding related content, and to
improve scanability and navigation.

June 28, 2018

New Feature

Lambda@Edge now enables you to further customize the delivery of content stored in an
Amazon S3 bucket, by allowing you to access additional headers, including custom headers,
within origin-facing events. For more information, see these examples showing
personalization of content based on [viewer\
location](lambda-examples.md#lambda-examples-redirect-based-on-country) and [viewer device\
type](lambda-examples.md#lambda-examples-vary-on-device-type).

March 20, 2018

New Feature

You can now use Amazon CloudFront to negotiate HTTPS connections to origins using Elliptic
Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA uses smaller keys that are faster, yet,
just as secure, as the older RSA algorithm. For more information, see [Supported SSL/TLS Protocols and Ciphers for Communication Between CloudFront and Your\
Origin](secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.md#secure-connections-supported-ciphers-cloudfront-to-origin) and [About RSA and ECDSA Ciphers](using-https-cloudfront-to-custom-origin.md#using-https-cloudfront-to-origin-about-ciphers).

March 15, 2018

New Feature

Lambda@Edge enables you to customize error responses from your origin, by allowing you
to execute Lambda functions in response to HTTP errors that Amazon CloudFrontreceives from your
origin. For more information, see these examples showing [redirects\
to another location](lambda-examples.md#lambda-examples-custom-error-new-site) and [response\
generation with 200 status code (OK)](lambda-examples.md#lambda-examples-custom-error-static-body).

December 21, 2017

New Feature

A new CloudFront capability, field-level encryption, helps you to further enhance the
security of sensitive data, like credit card numbers or personally identifiable
information (PII) like social security numbers. For more information, see [Using\
field-level encryption to help protect sensitive data](field-level-encryption.md).
