# Create a signed URL using a custom policy

To create a signed URL using a custom policy, complete the following procedure.

###### To create a signed URL using a custom policy

1. If you're using .NET or Java to create signed URLs, and if you haven't reformatted the private key for
    your key pair from the default .pem format to a format compatible with .NET or with Java, do so now. For
    more information, see [Reformat the private key (.NET and Java only)](private-content-trusted-signers.md#private-content-reformatting-private-key).

2. Concatenate the following values. You can use the format in this example
    signed URL.

```

Remove all empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters). You might
    have to include escape characters in the string in application code. All
    values have a type of `String`.

**1\. `Base URL for the file`**

The base URL is the CloudFront URL that you would use to access the
file if you were not using signed URLs, including your own query
string parameters, if any. In the preceding example, the base
URL is
`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg`.
For more information about the format of URLs for distributions,
see [Customize the URL format for files in CloudFront](linkformat.md).

The following examples show values that you specify for
distributions.

- The following CloudFront URL is for an image file in a
distribution (using the CloudFront domain name). Note that
`image.jpg` is in an `images`
directory. The path to the file in the URL must match
the path to the file on your HTTP server or in your Amazon S3
bucket.

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg`

- The following CloudFront URL includes a query string:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg?size=large`

- The following CloudFront URLs are for image files in a
distribution. Both use an alternate domain name; the
second one includes a query string:

`https://www.example.com/images/image.jpg`

`https://www.example.com/images/image.jpg?color=red`

- The following CloudFront URL is for an image file in a
distribution that uses an alternate domain name and the
HTTPS protocol:

`https://www.example.com/images/image.jpg`

**2\. `?`**

The `?` indicates that query string parameters
follow the base URL. Include the `?` even if you
don't specify any query parameters.

###### Note

You can specify the following query parameters in any
order.

**3\. `Your query string parameters, if**
**any` `&`**

(Optional) You can enter your own query string parameters. To
do so, add an ampersand (&) between each one, such as
`color=red&size=medium`. You can specify
query string parameters in any order within the URL.

###### Important

Your query string parameters can't be named
`Policy`, `Signature`,
`Key-Pair-Id`, or
`Hash-Algorithm`.

If you add your own parameters, append an `&`
after each one, including the last one.

**4\. `Policy=` `base64 encoded version of**
**policy statement`**

Your policy statement in JSON format, with empty spaces
removed, then base64 encoded. For more information, see [Create a policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-statement).

The policy statement controls the access that a signed URL
grants to a user. It includes the URL of the file, an expiration
date and time, an optional date and time that the URL becomes
valid, and an optional IP address or range of IP addresses that
are allowed to access the file.

**5\. `&Signature=` `hashed and signed**
**version of the policy statement`**

A hashed, signed, and base64-encoded version of the JSON
policy statement. For more information, see [Create a signature for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-creating-signature).

**6\. `&Key-Pair-Id=` `public key ID for**
**the CloudFront public key whose corresponding private key you're using**
**to generate the signature`**

The ID for a CloudFront public key, for example,
`K2JCJMDEHXQW5F`. The public key ID tells CloudFront
which public key to use to validate the signed URL. CloudFront
compares the information in the signature with the information
in the policy statement to verify that the URL has not been
tampered with.

This public key must belong to a key group that is a trusted
signer in the distribution. For more information, see [Specify signers that can create signed URLs and signed cookies](private-content-trusted-signers.md).

**7\. `&Hash-Algorithm=` `SHA1 or SHA256`**

(Optional) The hash algorithm used to create the signature. Supported values are
`SHA1` and `SHA256`. If you don't specify this parameter,
CloudFront defaults to `SHA1`.

## Create a policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy

Complete the following steps to create a policy statement for a signed URL that uses a
custom policy.

For example policy statements that control access to files in a variety of ways, see [Example policy statements for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-examples).

###### To create the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy

1. Construct the policy statement using the following JSON format. Replace the less than
    ( `<`) and greater than ( `>`) symbols, and the
    descriptions within them, with your own values. For more information,
    see [Values that you specify in the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-values).

```nohighlight

{
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Resource": "<Optional but recommended: URL of the file>",
               "Condition": {
                   "DateLessThan": {
   	                "AWS:EpochTime": <Required: ending date and time in Unix time format and UTC>
                   },
                   "DateGreaterThan": {
   	                "AWS:EpochTime": <Optional: beginning date and time in Unix time format and UTC>
                   },
                   "IpAddress": {
   	                "AWS:SourceIp": "<Optional: IP address>"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
}
```

Note the following:

- You can include only one statement in the policy.

- Use UTF-8 character encoding.

- Include all punctuation and parameter names exactly as specified. Abbreviations for
parameter names are not accepted.

- The order of the parameters in the `Condition` section doesn't matter.

- For information about the values for `Resource`, `DateLessThan`,
`DateGreaterThan`, and `IpAddress`, see
[Values that you specify in the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-values).

2. Remove all empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from the policy
    statement. You might have to include escape characters in the string in
    application code.

3. Base64-encode the policy statement using MIME base64 encoding. For more information, see
    [Section\
    6.8, Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) in _RFC 2045,_
_MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of_
_Internet Message Bodies_.

4. Replace characters that are invalid in a URL query string with characters that are valid. The
    following table lists invalid and valid characters.

Replace these invalid charactersWith these valid characters

+

\- (hyphen)

=

\_ (underscore)

/

~ (tilde)

5. Append the resulting value to your signed URL after `Policy=`.

6. Create a signature for the signed URL by hashing, signing, and base64-encoding the
    policy statement. For more information, see [Create a signature for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-creating-signature).

### Values that you specify in the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy

When you create a policy statement for a custom policy, you specify the following values.

**Resource**

The URL, including any query strings, but excluding the CloudFront `Policy`,
`Signature`, `Key-Pair-Id`,
and `Hash-Algorithm` parameters.
For example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/horizon.jpg\?size=large&license=yes`

You can specify only one URL value for
`Resource`.

###### Important

You can omit the `Resource` parameter in a policy, but doing so means that
anyone with the signed URL can access _all_ of the files in _any_ distribution that is associated
with the key pair that you use to create the signed
URL.

Note the following:

- **Protocol** – The value must begin with
`http://`, `https://`, or
`*://`.

- **Query string parameters** – If the URL has
query string parameters, don't use a backslash character
( `\`) to escape the question mark
character ( `?`) that begins the query string.
For example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/horizon.jpg?size=large&license=yes`

- **Wildcard characters** – You can use wildcard
characters in the URL in the policy. The following
wildcard characters are supported:

- asterisk ( `*`), which matches zero
or more characters

- question mark ( `?`), which matches
exactly one character

When CloudFront matches the URL in the policy to the URL in the HTTP request, the URL in
the policy is divided into four sections—protocol,
domain, path, and query string—as follows:

`[protocol]://[domain]/[path]\?[query
											string]`

When you use a wildcard character in the URL in the
policy, the wildcard matching applies only within the
boundaries of the section that contains the wildcard.
For example, consider this URL in a policy:

`https://www.example.com/hello*world`

In this example, the asterisk wildcard ( `*`) only applies within the path
section, so it matches the URLs
`https://www.example.com/helloworld` and
`https://www.example.com/hello-world`, but it
does not match the URL
`https://www.example.net/hello?world`.

The following exceptions apply to the section
boundaries for wildcard matching:

- A trailing asterisk in the path section
implies an asterisk in the query string section.
For example,
`http://example.com/hello*` is
equivalent to
`http://example.com/hello*\?*`.

- A trailing asterisk in the domain section
implies an asterisk in both the path and query
string sections. For example,
`http://example.com*` is equivalent to
`http://example.com*/*\?*`.

- A URL in the policy can omit the protocol section and start with an asterisk in
the domain section. In that case, the protocol
section is implicitly set to an asterisk. For
example, the URL `*example.com` in a
policy is equivalent to
`*://*example.com/`.

- An asterisk by itself ( `"Resource":
  												"*"`) matches any URL.

For example, the value:
`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/*game_download.zip*`
in a policy matches all of the following URLs:

- `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/game_download.zip`

- `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/example_game_download.zip?license=yes`

- `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/test_game_download.zip?license=temp`

- **Alternate domain names** – If you specify an
alternate domain name (CNAME) in the URL in the policy,
the HTTP request must use the alternate domain name in
your webpage or application. Do not specify the Amazon S3 URL
for the file in a policy.

**DateLessThan**

The expiration date and time for the URL in Unix time format (in seconds) and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In the policy, do not enclose
the value in quotation marks. For information about UTC, see
[Date and Time\
on the Internet: Timestamps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).

For example, January 31, 2023 10:00 AM UTC converts to 1675159200 in Unix time
format.

This is the only required parameter in the `Condition` section. CloudFront requires
this value to prevent users from having permanent access to your private content.

For more information, see [When CloudFront checks expiration date and time in a signed URL](private-content-signed-urls.md#private-content-check-expiration)

**DateGreaterThan (Optional)**

An optional start date and time for the URL in Unix time format (in seconds) and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Users are not allowed to
access the file on or before the specified date and time. Do not
enclose the value in quotation marks.

**IpAddress (Optional)**

The IP address of the client making the HTTP request. Note the following:

- To allow any IP address to access the file, omit the `IpAddress`
parameter.

- You can specify either one IP address or one IP address range. You can't use the
policy to allow access if the client's IP address is in
one of two separate ranges.

- To allow access from a single IP address, you specify:

`"` `IPv4 IP address` `/32"`

- You must specify IP address ranges in standard IPv4 CIDR format (for example,
`192.0.2.0/24`). For more information, see
[Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet\
Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632).

###### Important

IP addresses in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334,
are not supported.

If you're using a custom policy that includes `IpAddress`, do not enable
IPv6 for the distribution. If you want to restrict
access to some content by IP address and support IPv6
requests for other content, you can create two
distributions. For more information, see [Enable IPv6 (viewer requests)](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesEnableIPv6) in the topic
[All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

## Example policy statements for a signed URL that uses a custom policy

The following example policy statements show how to control access to a specific file, all of the files in a
directory, or all of the files associated with a key pair ID. The examples also show how to control access
from an individual IP address or a range of IP addresses, and how to prevent users from using the signed URL
after a specified date and time.

If you copy and paste any of these examples, remove any empty spaces (including tabs and
newline characters), replace the values with your own values, and include a
newline character after the closing brace ( `}`).

For more information, see [Values that you specify in the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-values).

- [Example policy statement: Access all files associated with a key pair ID from one IP address](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-example-one-ip)

### Example policy statement: Access one file from a range of IP addresses

The following example custom policy in a signed URL specifies that a user can access the
file `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/game_download.zip` from IP
addresses in the range `192.0.2.0/24` until January 31, 2023
10:00 AM UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/game_download.zip",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "AWS:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
                },
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1675159200
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example policy statement: Access all files in a directory from a range of IP addresses

The following example custom policy allows you to create signed URLs for any file in the
`training` directory, as indicated by the asterisk wildcard
character ( `*`) in the `Resource` parameter. Users can
access the file from an IP address in the range `192.0.2.0/24`
until January 31, 2023 10:00 AM UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/training/*",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "AWS:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
                },
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1675159200
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Each signed URL with which you use this policy has a URL that identifies a specific file,
for example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/training/orientation.pdf`

### Example policy statement: Access all files associated with a key pair ID from one IP address

The following example custom policy allows you to create signed URLs for any file
associated with any distribution, as indicated by the asterisk wildcard
character ( `*`) in the `Resource` parameter. The
signed URL must use the `https://` protocol, not
`http://`. The user must use the IP address
`192.0.2.10/32`. (The value `192.0.2.10/32` in CIDR
notation refers to a single IP address, `192.0.2.10`.) The files
are available only from January 31, 2023 10:00 AM UTC until February 2, 2023
10:00 AM UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
       {
            "Resource": "https://*",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "AWS:SourceIp": "192.0.2.10/32"
                },
                "DateGreaterThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1675159200
                },
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1675332000
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Each signed URL with which you use this policy has a URL that identifies a specific file
in a specific CloudFront distribution, for example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/training/orientation.pdf`

The signed URL also includes a key pair ID, which must be associated with a trusted key
group in the distribution (d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net) that you specify in the
URL.

## Create a signature for a signed URL that uses a custom policy

The signature for a signed URL that uses a custom policy is a hashed, signed, and
base64-encoded version of the policy statement. To create a signature for a
custom policy, complete the following steps.

For additional information and examples of how to hash, sign, and encode the policy statement, see:

- [Linux commands and OpenSSL for base64 encoding and encryption](private-content-linux-openssl.md)

- [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md)

###### Note

The linked examples use SHA-1 by default. To use SHA-256 instead, replace `sha1` with `sha256` in the OpenSSL commands and include the `Hash-Algorithm=SHA256` query parameter in the signed URL.

###### Option 1: To create a signature by using a custom policy

1. Use the SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash function and the generated RSA or ECDSA private key to hash and sign the JSON policy statement that you
    created in the procedure [To create the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-creating-policy-procedure). Use the version of the policy statement that no longer includes
    empty spaces but that has not yet been base64-encoded.

If you use SHA-256, you must include `&Hash-Algorithm=SHA256` in the signed URL.

For the private key that is required by the hash function, use a private key whose
    public key is in an active trusted key group for the
    distribution.

###### Note

The method that you use to hash and sign the policy statement depends on your programming
language and platform. For sample code, see [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md).

2. Remove empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from the hashed and signed
    string.

3. Base64-encode the string using MIME base64 encoding. For more information, see [Section 6.8,\
    Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) in _RFC 2045, MIME_
_(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet_
_Message Bodies_.

4. Replace characters that are invalid in a URL query string with characters that are valid. The
    following table lists invalid and valid characters.

Replace these invalid charactersWith these valid characters

+

\- (hyphen)

=

\_ (underscore)

/

~ (tilde)

5. Append the resulting value to your signed URL after `&Signature=`, and return to
    [To create a signed URL using a custom policy](#private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy-procedure) to finish
    concatenating the parts of your signed URL.
