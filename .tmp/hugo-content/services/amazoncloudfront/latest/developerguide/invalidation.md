# Invalidate files to remove content

If you need to remove a file from CloudFront edge caches before it expires, you can do one
of the following:

- Invalidate the file from edge caches. The next time a viewer requests the
file, CloudFront returns to the origin to fetch the latest version of the file.

- Use file versioning to serve a different version of the file that has a
different name. For more information, see [Update existing files using versioned file names](updatingexistingobjects.md#ReplacingObjects).

## Choose between invalidating files and using versioned file names

To control the versions of files that are served from your distribution, you can
either invalidate files or give them versioned file names. If you want to update
your files frequently, we recommend that you primarily use file versioning for the
following reasons:

- Versioning enables you to control which file a request returns even when
the user has a version cached either locally or behind a corporate caching
proxy. If you invalidate the file, the user might continue to see the old
version until it expires from those caches.

- CloudFront access logs include the names of your files, so versioning makes it
easier to analyze the results of file changes.

- Versioning provides a way to serve different versions of files to
different users.

- Versioning simplifies rolling forward and back between file
revisions.

- Versioning is less expensive. You still have to pay for CloudFront to transfer
new versions of your files to edge locations, but you don't have to pay for
invalidating files.
