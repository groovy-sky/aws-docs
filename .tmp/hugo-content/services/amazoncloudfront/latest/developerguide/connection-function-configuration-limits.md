# Configuration and limits

CloudFront Connection Functions have specific configuration requirements and service limits due to their specialized role in TLS connection validation and the performance requirements of edge computing.

## Function code requirements

Connection functions require JavaScript code that processes TLS connection events.
The function code must:

- Be written in JavaScript

- Process connection events and make allow/deny decisions

- Complete execution within the time limits

- Handle certificate and connection validation logic

## Service limits

Connection functions are subject to the following limits:

- **Function size** – Function code and
configuration are limited in size

- **Execution time** – Functions have strict
execution time limits for TLS connection processing

- **Association limits** – Each distribution
can have only one Connection Function associated

- **Stage restrictions** – Only LIVE stage
functions can be associated with distributions

## Function filtering options

When listing Connection Functions, you can use the following filters:

- **Stage filter** – Filter by DEVELOPMENT or
LIVE stage

- **Association filter** – Filter by
distribution ID or key-value store ID associations

These filters help you organize and manage Connection Functions across different
environments and use cases.
