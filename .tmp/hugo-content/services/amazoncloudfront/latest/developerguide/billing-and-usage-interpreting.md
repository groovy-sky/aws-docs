# Interpret your AWS bill and usage reports for CloudFront

Once you have the [billing report](reports-billing.md#billing-report) and the [usage report](reports-billing.md#usage-report), you can use this topic to understand how
to interpret each CloudFront charge that appears on your bill and the corresponding usage type
for each charge. This topic includes the codes and AWS Region abbreviations that can
appear on both reports.

Most codes in both columns include a two-letter abbreviation that indicates the
location of the activity. In the following table, `region` in a
code is replaced in your AWS bill and in the usage report by one of the following
two-letter abbreviations:

- **AP:** Hong Kong, Philippines, South Korea,
Taiwan, and Singapore (Asia
Pacific)

- **AU:** Australia

- **CA:** Canada

- **EU:** Europe and Israel

- **IN:** India

- **JP:** Japan

- **ME:** Middle East

- **SA:** South America

- **US:** United States

- **ZA:** South Africa

For more information about pricing by AWS Region, see [Amazon CloudFront pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing).

###### Notes

- This table doesn't include charges for transferring your objects from an
Amazon S3 bucket to CloudFront edge locations. These charges, if any, appear in the
**AWS Data Transfer** portion of your AWS
bill.

- The first column lists charges that appear in your AWS bill report and
explains what each means.

- The second column lists items that appear in the AWS usage report and
shows the correlation between bill charges and usage report items.
