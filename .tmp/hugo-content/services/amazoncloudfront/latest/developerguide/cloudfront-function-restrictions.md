## Logs

Function logs in CloudFront Functions are truncated at 10 KB.

## Request body

CloudFront Functions can't access the body of the HTTP request.

## Using temporary credentials with the CloudFront KeyValueStore API

You can use AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials (also
known as _session tokens_). Session tokens allow you to
temporarily assume an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role so that you can access
AWS services.

To call the [CloudFront KeyValueStore API](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-operations-amazon-cloudfront-keyvaluestore.md), use a _Regional_
endpoint in AWS STS to return a _version 2_ session token. If you
use the _global_ endpoint for AWS STS
( `sts.amazonaws.com`), AWS STS will generate a _version_
_1_ session token, which isn't supported by Signature Version 4A
(SigV4A). As a result, you will receive an authentication error.

To call the CloudFront KeyValueStore API, you can use the following options:

**AWS CLI and AWS SDKs**

You can configure the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK to use Regional AWS STS
endpoints. For more information, see [AWS STS Regionalized endpoints](../../../../reference/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-sts-regionalized-endpoints.md) in the
_AWS SDK and Tools Reference Guide_.

For more information about available AWS STS endpoints, see [Regions and endpoints](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-credentials-temp-enable-regions.md#id_credentials_region-endpoints) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

**SAML**

You can configure SAML to use Regional AWS STS endpoints. For more
information, see the [How to use regional SAML endpoints for failover](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-regional-saml-endpoints-for-failover) blog
post.

**`SetSecurityTokenServicePreferences` API**

Instead of using a Regional AWS STS endpoint, you can configure the
global endpoint for AWS STS to return version 2 session tokens. To do so,
use the [SetSecurityTokenServicePreferences](../../../../reference/iam/latest/apireference/api-setsecuritytokenservicepreferences.md) API
operation to configure your AWS account.

###### Example: IAM CLI command

```bash

aws iam set-security-token-service-preferences --global-endpoint-token-version v2Token
```

###### Tip

We recommend that you use the AWS STS Regional endpoints instead
of this option. Regional endpoints provide higher availability
and failover scenarios.

**Custom identity provider**

If you're using a custom identity provider that does the federation
and assumes the role, use one of the previous options for the parent
identity provider system that is responsible for generating the session
token.

## Runtime

The CloudFront Functions runtime environment doesn't support dynamic code evaluation,
and it restricts access to the network, file system, environment variables, and
timers. For more information, see [Restricted features](functions-javascript-runtime-10.md#writing-functions-javascript-features-restricted-features).

###### Note

To use CloudFront KeyValueStore, your CloudFront function must use [JavaScript runtime\
2.0](functions-javascript-runtime-20.md).

## Compute utilization

CloudFront Functions have a limit on the time they can take to run, measured as
_compute utilization_. Compute utilization is a
number between 0 and 100 that indicates the amount of time that the function took to
run as a percentage of the maximum allowed time. For example, a compute utilization
of 35 means that the function completed in 35% of the maximum allowed time.

When you [test a function](test-function.md), you can see the
compute utilization value in the output of the test event. For production functions,
you can view the [compute\
utilization metric](viewing-cloudfront-metrics.md#monitoring-console.cloudfront-functions) on the [Monitoring page in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home?), or in CloudWatch.
