# HTTP 404 status code (Not Found)

CloudFront returns a 404 (Not Found) error when the client attempts to access a resource
that doesn’t exist. If you receive this error with your CloudFront distribution, common
causes include the following:

- Resource doesn't exist.

- URL is incorrect.

- Custom origin returning a 404.

- Custom error pages returning a 404. (Any error code might be translated to
404.) For more information, see [How CloudFront processes errors when you have configured custom error pages](httpstatuscodes.md#HTTPStatusCodes-custom-error-pages).

- Custom error page accidentally deleted, resulting in a 404 because the
request looks for the deleted custom error page. For more information, see
[How CloudFront processes errors if you haven't configured custom error pages](httpstatuscodes.md#HTTPStatusCodes-no-custom-error-pages).

- Incorrect origin path. If the origin path is populated, its value is
appended to the path of each request from the browser before the request is
forwarded to the origin. For more information, see [Origin path](downloaddistvaluesorigin.md#DownloadDistValuesOriginPath).
