# View CloudFront and edge function metrics

You can view operational metrics about your CloudFront distributions and [edge functions](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features) in
the CloudFront console.

###### To view CloudFront and edge function metrics in CloudFront

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Monitoring**.

3. To view graphs about the activity for a specific CloudFront distribution or edge
    function, choose one, and then choose **View distribution**
**metrics** or **View metrics**.

4. You can customize the graphs by doing the following:
1. To change the time range for the information displayed in the graphs,
       choose 1h (1 hour), 3h (3 hours), or another range, or specify a custom
       range.

2. To change how often CloudFront updates the information in the graph, choose
       the down arrow next to the refresh icon, and then choose a refresh rate.
       The default refresh rate is 1 minute, but you can choose other
       options.
5. To view CloudFront graphs in the CloudWatch console, choose **Add to**
**dashboard**. You must use the US East (N. Virginia) Region to view the graphs in
    the CloudWatch console.

## Default CloudFront distribution metrics

The following default metrics are included for all CloudFront distributions, at no
additional cost:

**Requests**

The total number of viewer requests received by CloudFront, for all HTTP
methods and for both HTTP and HTTPS requests.

**Bytes downloaded**

The total number of bytes downloaded by viewers for `GET` and
`HEAD` requests.

**Bytes uploaded**

The total number of bytes that viewers uploaded to CloudFront, using `OPTIONS`,
`POST` and `PUT` requests.

**4xx error rate**

The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response's HTTP
status code is `4xx`.

**5xx error rate**

The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response's HTTP
status code is `5xx`.

**Total error rate**

The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response's HTTP
status code is `4xx` or `5xx`.

These metrics are shown in graphs for each CloudFront distribution on the
**Monitoring** page of the CloudFront console.. On each graph, the
totals are displayed at 1-minute granularity. In addition to viewing the graphs, you
can also [download metrics reports as CSV\
files](cloudwatch-csv.md).

## Turn on additional CloudFront distribution metrics

In addition to the default metrics, you can turn on additional metrics for an
additional cost. For more information about the cost, see [Estimate the cost for the additional CloudFront metrics](#monitoring-console.distributions-additional-pricing).

These additional metrics must be turned on for each distribution
separately:

**Cache hit rate**

The percentage of all cacheable requests for which CloudFront served the
content from its cache. HTTP `POST` and `PUT`
requests, and errors, are not considered cacheable requests.

**Origin latency**

The total time spent from when CloudFront receives a request to when it
starts providing a response to the network (not the viewer), for
requests that are served from the origin, not the CloudFront cache. This is
also known as _first byte latency_, or
_time-to-first-byte_.

**Error rate by status code**

The percentage of all viewer requests for which the response's HTTP
status code is a particular code in the `4xx` or
`5xx` range. This metric is available for all of the
following error codes: `401`, `403`,
`404`, `502`, `503`, and
`504`.

You can turn on additional metrics in the CloudFront console, with CloudFormation, with the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or with the CloudFront API.

Console

###### To turn on additional metrics

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Monitoring**.

3. Choose the distribution to turn on additional metrics for, and
    then choose **View distribution**
**metrics**.

4. Choose **Manage additional metrics**.

5. In the **Manage additional metrics** window,
    turn on **Enabled**. After you turn on the
    additional metrics, you can close the **Manage**
**additional metrics** window.

After you turn on the additional metrics, they are shown in
    graphs. On each graph, the totals are displayed at 1-minute
    granularity. In addition to viewing the graphs, you can also
    [download metrics reports as\
    CSV files](cloudwatch-csv.md).

CloudFormation

To turn on additional metrics with CloudFormation, use the
`AWS::CloudFront::MonitoringSubscription` resource type.
The following example shows the CloudFormation template syntax, in YAML format,
for enabling additional metrics.

```yaml

Type: AWS::CloudFront::MonitoringSubscription
Properties:
  DistributionId: EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE
  MonitoringSubscription:
    RealtimeMetricsSubscriptionConfig:
      RealtimeMetricsSubscriptionStatus: Enabled
```

CLI

To manage additional metrics with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), use one of
the following commands:

###### To turn on additional metrics for a distribution

- Use the **create-monitoring-subscription**
command, as in the following example. Replace
`EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE` with the ID of
the distribution that you're enabling additional metrics
for.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront create-monitoring-subscription --distribution-id EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE --monitoring-subscription RealtimeMetricsSubscriptionConfig={RealtimeMetricsSubscriptionStatus=Enabled}
```

###### To see whether additional metrics are turned on for a distribution

- Use the **get-monitoring-subscription**
command, as in the following example. Replace
`EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE` with the ID of
the distribution that you're checking.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront get-monitoring-subscription --distribution-id EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE
```

###### To turn off additional metrics for a distribution

- Use the **delete-monitoring-subscription**
command, as in the following example. Replace
`EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE` with the ID of
the distribution that you're turning off additional metrics
for.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront delete-monitoring-subscription --distribution-id EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE
```

API

To manage additional metrics with the CloudFront API, use one of the
following API operations.

- To turn on additional metrics for a distribution, use [CreateMonitoringSubscription](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-createmonitoringsubscription.md).

- To see whether additional metrics are turned on for a
distribution, use [GetMonitoringSubscription](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-getmonitoringsubscription.md).

- To turn off additional metrics for a distribution, use [DeleteMonitoringSubscription](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-deletemonitoringsubscription.md).

For more information about these API operations, see the API reference
documentation for your AWS SDK or other API client.

### Estimate the cost for the additional CloudFront metrics

When you turn on additional metrics for a distribution, CloudFront sends up to 8
metrics to CloudWatch in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. CloudWatch charges a low, fixed rate for each
metric. This rate is charged only once per month, per metric (up to 8 metrics
per distribution). This is a fixed rate, so your cost remains the same
regardless of the number of requests or responses that the CloudFront distribution
receives or sends. For the per-metric rate, see the [Amazon CloudWatch pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing) and
the [CloudWatch\
pricing calculator](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing). Additional API charges apply when you retrieve
the metrics with the CloudWatch API.

## Default Lambda@Edge function metrics

You can use CloudWatch metrics to monitor, in real time, problems with your Lambda@Edge
functions. There's no additional charge for these metrics.

When you attach a Lambda@Edge function to a cache behavior in a CloudFront distribution,
Lambda begins sending metrics to CloudWatch automatically. Metrics are available for all
Lambda Regions, but to view metrics in the CloudWatch console or get the metric data from
the CloudWatch API, you must use the US East (N. Virginia) Region ( `us-east-1`). The metric
group name is formatted as:
`AWS/CloudFront/distribution-ID`,
where `distribution-ID` is the ID of the CloudFront distribution
that the Lambda@Edge function is associated with. For more information about CloudWatch
metrics, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring.md).

The following default metrics are shown in graphs for each Lambda@Edge function on
the **Monitoring** page of the CloudFront console:

- `5xx` error rate for Lambda@Edge

- Lambda execution errors

- Lambda invalid responses

- Lambda throttles

The graphs include the number of invocations, errors, throttles, and so on. On
each graph, the totals are displayed at 1-minute granularity, grouped by AWS
Region.

If you see a spike in errors that you want to investigate, you can choose a
function and then view log files by AWS Region, until you determine which function
is causing the problems and in which AWS Region. For more information about
troubleshooting Lambda@Edge errors, see:

- [How to determine the type of failure](lambda-edge-testing-debugging.md#lambda-edge-testing-debugging-failure-type)

- [Four Steps for Debugging your Content Delivery on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/four-steps-for-debugging-your-content-delivery-on-aws)

## Default CloudFront Functions metrics

CloudFront Functions sends operational metrics to Amazon CloudWatch so that you can monitor your
functions. Viewing these metrics can help you troubleshoot, track, and debug issues.
CloudFront Functions publishes the following metrics to CloudWatch:

- **Invocations**
( `FunctionInvocations`) – The number of times the
function was started (invoked) in a given time period.

- **Validation errors**
( `FunctionValidationErrors`) – The number of
validation errors produced by the function in a given time period.
Validation errors occur when the function runs successfully but returns
invalid data (an invalid [event\
object](functions-event-structure.md)).

- **Execution errors**
( `FunctionExecutionErrors`) – The number of execution
errors that occurred in a given time period. Execution errors occur when the
function fails to complete successfully.

- **Compute utilization**
( `FunctionComputeUtilization`) – The amount of time
that the function took to run as a percentage of the maximum allowed time.
For example, a value of 35 means that the function completed in 35%
of the maximum allowed time. This metric is a number between 0 and
100.

If this value reaches or is near 100, the function has used or is close to
using the allowed execution time and subsequent requests might be throttled.
If your function is running at 80% or more utilization, we recommend that
you review your function to reduce the execution time and improve
utilization. For example, you might want to only log errors, simplify any
complex regex expressions, or remove unnecessary parsing of complex JSON
objects.

- **Throttles**
( `FunctionThrottles`) – The number of times that the
function was throttled in a given time period. Functions can be throttled
for the following reasons:

- The function continuously exceeds the maximum time allowed for
execution

- The function results in compilation errors

- There is an unusually high number of requests per second

CloudFront KeyValueStore also sends the following operational metrics to Amazon CloudWatch:

- **Read requests**
( `KvsReadRequests`) – The number of times the function
successfully read from the key value store within a given time period.

- **Read errors** ( `KvsReadErrors`)
– The number of times the function failed to read from the
key value store within a given time period.

All of these metrics are published to CloudWatch in the US East (N. Virginia) Region
( `us-east-1`), in the CloudFront namespace. You can also view these metrics
in the CloudWatch console. In the CloudWatch console, you can view the metrics per function or
per function per distribution.

You can also use CloudWatch to set alarms based on these metrics. For example, you can
set an alarm based on the execution time ( `FunctionComputeUtilization`)
metric, which represents the percentage of available time that your function took to
run. When the execution time reaches a certain value for a certain amount of time.
For example, if you choose greater than 70% of available time for 15
continuous minutes, the alarm is triggered. You specify the alarms value and its
time unit when you create the alarm.

###### Note

CloudFront Functions sends metrics to CloudWatch only for functions in the
`LIVE` stage that run in response to production requests and
responses. When you [test a function](test-function.md), CloudFront
doesn't send any metrics to CloudWatch. The test output contains information about
errors, compute utilization, and function logs ( `console.log()`
statements), but this information isn't sent to CloudWatch.

For information about how to get these metrics with the CloudWatch API, see [Types of metrics for CloudFront](programming-cloudwatch-metrics.md).
