# Associate Connection Functions with distributions

After publishing a Connection Function to the LIVE stage, you must associate it with an mTLS-enabled distribution to handle live connections. Connection functions are associated at the distribution level, unlike viewer request and viewer response functions which are associated with cache behaviors.

## Association requirements

To associate a Connection Function with a distribution:

- The function must be in the LIVE stage

- The distribution must have mTLS enabled

- The distribution must have a valid trust store configured

- You can only associate one Connection Function per distribution

## Organizing functions with filters

CloudFront provides filtering capabilities to help you organize and manage connection
functions:

- **Distribution ID filter** – Find functions
associated with specific distributions

- **Key-value store filter** – Find functions
that use specific key-value stores for data lookup

- **Stage filter** – List functions in
DEVELOPMENT or LIVE stage

Use these filters when managing multiple Connection Functions across different
distributions or development environments.

## Deployment considerations

Consider these factors when deploying Connection Functions:

- **Global deployment** – Connection functions
deploy to all CloudFront edge locations worldwide, which may take several
minutes

- **Version management** – Each published
version creates a new LIVE function that replaces the previous
version

- **Rollback strategy** – Plan for rollback by
keeping previous working versions of your function code

- **Testing in production** – Consider using
separate distributions for staging and production environments
