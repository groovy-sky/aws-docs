# Create CloudFront Connection Functions for mutual TLS (viewer) validation

You create a CloudFront Connection Function in two stages:

1. Create the function code as JavaScript. You can use the default example from the CloudFront console or write your own. For more information, see the following topics:

- Write CloudFront Connection Function code for mTLS validation

- CloudFront Connection Function event structure and response format

- Connection function code examples

2. Use CloudFront to create the Connection Function and include your code. The code exists inside the function (not as a reference).

## CloudFront console

###### To create a Connection Function

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. Choose **Create function**.

3. Enter a function name that is unique within the AWS account, choose
    **Connection function** as the function
    type, and then choose **Continue**.

4. The details page for the new Connection Function appears.

###### Note

Connection functions only support JavaScript runtime 2.0. To use CloudFront
Connection Function KeyValueStore integration in the function, you must
use this runtime version.

5. In the **Function code** section, choose the
    **Build** tab and enter your connection
    function code. The sample code that is included in the Build tab illustrates
    the basic syntax for Connection Function code.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

7. If the Connection Function code uses KeyValueStore for certificate
    revocation checking or device validation, you must associate a
    KeyValueStore.

You can associate the KeyValueStore when you first create the function.
    Or, you can associate it later, by associating Connection Functions.

To associate a KeyValueStore now, follow these steps:

- Go to the **Associate KeyValueStore**
section and choose **Associate existing**
**KeyValueStore**.

- Select the KeyValueStore that contains the certificate data for
your Connection Function, and then choose **Associate KeyValueStore**.

CloudFront immediately associates the store with the function. You don't need to
save the function.

## AWS CLI

If you use the AWS CLI, you typically first create the Connection Function code in a
file, and then create the function with the AWS CLI.

###### To create a Connection Function

1. Create the Connection Function code in a file, and store it in a directory
    that your computer can connect to.

2. Run the command as shown in the example. This example uses the
    `fileb://` notation to pass in the file. It also includes
    line breaks to make the command more readable.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront create-connection-function \
       --name CertificateValidator \
       --connection-function-config '{
           "Comment":"Device certificate validation",
           "Runtime":"cloudfront-js-2.0",
           "KeyValueStoreAssociations":{
               "Quantity":1,
               "Items":[{
                   "KeyValueStoreARN":"arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:key-value-store/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
               }]
           }
       }' \
       --connection-function-code fileb://certificate-validator.js
```

###### Note

- **Runtime** – Connection
functions only support JavaScript runtime 2.0
(cloudfront-js-2.0).

- **KeyValueStoreAssociations** –
If your Connection Function uses KeyValueStore for certificate
validation, you can associate the KeyValueStore when you first
create the function. Or, you can associate it later, by using
update-connection-function. The Quantity is always 1 because
each Connection Function can have only one KeyValueStore
associated with it.

3. When the command is successful, you see output like the following.

```nohighlight

ETag: ETVABCEXAMPLE
ConnectionFunctionSummary:
     ConnectionFunctionConfig:
       Comment: Device certificate validation
       Runtime: cloudfront-js-2.0
       KeyValueStoreAssociations:
         Quantity: 1
         Items:
        - KeyValueStoreARN: arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:key-value-store/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111
ConnectionFunctionMetadata:
    CreatedTime: '2024-09-04T16:32:54.292000+00:00'
    ConnectionFunctionARN: arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:connection-function/CertificateValidator
    LastModifiedTime: '2024-09-04T16:32:54.292000+00:00'
    Stage: DEVELOPMENT
Name: CertificateValidator
Status: UNPUBLISHED
Location: https://cloudfront.amazonaws.com/2020-05-31/connection-function/arn:aws:cloudfront:::connection-function/CertificateValidator
```

Most of the information is repeated from the request. Other information is
added by CloudFront.

###### Note

- **ETag** – This value changes
each time you modify the Connection Function. You need this
value to update or publish the function.

- **Stage** – New connection
functions start in the DEVELOPMENT stage. You must publish the
function to move it to the LIVE stage before associating it with
a distribution.

- **Status** – The function status
is UNPUBLISHED until you publish it to the LIVE stage.
