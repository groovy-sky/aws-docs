# Configure alternate domain names and HTTPS

To use alternate domain names in the URLs for your files and to use HTTPS between
viewers and CloudFront, perform the applicable procedures.

## Get an SSL/TLS certificate

Get an SSL/TLS certificate if you don’t already have one. For more information, see the
applicable documentation:

- To use a certificate provided by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), see the
[AWS Certificate Manager User Guide](../../../acm/latest/userguide.md). Then skip to [Update your CloudFront distribution](#cnames-and-https-updating-cloudfront).

###### Note

We recommend that you use ACM to provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates on
AWS managed resources. You must request an ACM certificate in the
US East (N. Virginia) Region.

- To get a certificate from a third-party certificate authority (CA),
see the documentation provided by the certificate authority. When you
have the certificate, continue with the next procedure.

## Import an SSL/TLS certificate

If you got your certificate from a third-party CA, import the certificate into
ACM or upload it to the IAM certificate store:

**ACM (recommended)**

ACM lets you import third-party certificates from the ACM console, as well as
programmatically. For information about importing a certificate to
ACM, see [Importing Certificates into AWS Certificate Manager](../../../acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.md) in the
_AWS Certificate Manager User Guide_. You must import the certificate
in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

**IAM certificate store**

(Not recommended) Use the following AWS CLI command to upload your third-party
certificate to the IAM certificate store.

```nohighlight

aws iam upload-server-certificate \
        --server-certificate-name CertificateName \
        --certificate-body file://public_key_certificate_file \
        --private-key file://privatekey.pem \
        --certificate-chain file://certificate_chain_file \
        --path /cloudfront/path/
```

Note the following:

- **AWS account** – You must upload the certificate
to the IAM certificate store using the same AWS account
that you used to create your CloudFront distribution.

- **--path parameter** – When you upload the
certificate to IAM, the value of the `--path`
parameter (certificate path) must start with
`/cloudfront/`, for example,
`/cloudfront/production/` or
`/cloudfront/test/`. The path must end with a
/.

- **Existing certificates**
– You must specify values for the
`--server-certificate-name` and
`--path` parameters that are different from the
values that are associated with existing
certificates.

- **Using the CloudFront console** – The value that you
specify for the `--server-certificate-name`
parameter in the AWS CLI, for example,
`myServerCertificate`, appears in the
**SSL Certificate** list in the CloudFront
console.

- **Using the CloudFront API**
– Make note of the alphanumeric string that the
AWS CLI returns, for example,
`AS1A2M3P4L5E67SIIXR3J`. This is the value that
you will specify in the `IAMCertificateId`
element. You don't need the IAM ARN, which is also
returned by the CLI.

For more information about the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.md) and
the [AWS CLI Command Reference](../../../cli/latest/reference.md).

## Update your CloudFront distribution

To update settings for your distribution, perform the following
procedure:

###### To configure your CloudFront distribution for alternate domain names

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. Choose the ID for the distribution that you want to update.

3. On the **General** tab, choose
    **Edit**.

4. Update the following values:

**Alternate domain name (CNAME)**

Choose **Add item** to add the applicable alternate domain names. Separate domain
names with commas, or type each domain name on a new
line.

**Custom SSL certificate**

Select a certificate from the dropdown list.

Up to 100 certificates are listed here. If you have more
than 100 certificates and you don't see the certificate that
you want to add, you can type a certificate ARN in the field
to choose it.

If you uploaded a certificate to the IAM certificate store
but it's not listed, and you can't choose it by typing the
name in the field, review the procedure [Import an SSL/TLS certificate](#cnames-and-https-uploading-certificates) to
confirm that you correctly uploaded the certificate.

###### Important

After you associate your SSL/TLS certificate with your
CloudFront distribution, do not delete the certificate from
ACM or the IAM certificate store until you remove
the certificate from all distributions and all the distributions are deployed.

5. Choose **Save changes**.

6. Configure CloudFront to require HTTPS between viewers and CloudFront:
1. On the **Behaviors** tab, choose the cache
       behavior that you want to update, and choose
       **Edit**.

2. Specify one of the following values for **Viewer**
      **Protocol Policy**:

      **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**

      Viewers can use both protocols, but HTTP requests
      are automatically redirected to HTTPS requests. CloudFront
      returns HTTP status code `301 (Moved
      												Permanently)` along with the new HTTPS URL.
      The viewer then resubmits the request to CloudFront using
      the HTTPS URL.

      ###### Important

      CloudFront doesn't redirect `DELETE`,
      `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`,
      `POST`, or `PUT` requests
      from HTTP to HTTPS. If you configure a cache
      behavior to redirect to HTTPS, CloudFront responds to
      HTTP `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`,
      `PATCH`, `POST`, or
      `PUT` requests for that cache behavior
      with HTTP status code `403
      												(Forbidden)`.

      When a viewer makes an HTTP request that is
      redirected to an HTTPS request, CloudFront charges for
      both requests. For the HTTP request, the charge is
      only for the request and for the headers that CloudFront
      returns to the viewer. For the HTTPS request, the
      charge is for the request, and for the headers and
      the file returned by your origin.

      **HTTPS Only**

      Viewers can access your content only if they're
      using HTTPS. If a viewer sends an HTTP request
      instead of an HTTPS request, CloudFront returns HTTP
      status code `403 (Forbidden)` and does
      not return the file.

3. Choose **Yes, Edit**.

4. Repeat steps a through c for each additional cache behavior
       that you want to require HTTPS for between viewers and
       CloudFront.
7. Confirm the following before you use the updated configuration in a
    production environment:

- The path pattern in each cache behavior applies only to the
requests that you want viewers to use HTTPS for.

- The cache behaviors are listed in the order that you want CloudFront
to evaluate them in. For more information, see [Path pattern](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern).

- The cache behaviors are routing requests to the correct
origins.
