# Linux commands and OpenSSL for base64 encoding and encryption

You can use the following Linux command-line command and OpenSSL to hash and sign the policy statement,
base64-encode the signature, and replace characters that are not valid in URL query string parameters with characters
that are valid.

For information about OpenSSL, go to [https://www.openssl.org](https://www.openssl.org/).

SHA-1 (default):

```nohighlight

cat policy | tr -d "\n" | tr -d " \t\n\r" | openssl sha1 -sign private_key.pem | openssl base64 -A | tr -- '+=/' '-_~'
```

SHA-256:

```nohighlight

cat policy | tr -d "\n" | tr -d " \t\n\r" | openssl sha256 -sign private_key.pem | openssl base64 -A | tr -- '+=/' '-_~'
```

In the preceding command:

- `cat` reads the `policy` file.

- `tr -d "\n" | tr -d " \t\n\r"` removes the empty spaces and newline character that were added by
`cat`.

- OpenSSL hashes the file using SHA-1 (or SHA-256) and signs it using the
private key file `private_key.pem`. The private key signature can be either RSA 2048 or ECDSA 256. If you use SHA-256, include the `Hash-Algorithm=SHA256` query parameter in the signed URL, or the `CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm=SHA256` cookie for signed cookies.

- OpenSSL base64-encodes the hashed and signed policy statement.

- `tr` replaces characters that are not valid in URL query string parameters with characters that are
valid.
