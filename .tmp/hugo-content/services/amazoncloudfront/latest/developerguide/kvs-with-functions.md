# Amazon CloudFront KeyValueStore

CloudFront KeyValueStore is a secure, global, low-latency key value datastore that allows read access from
within [CloudFront Functions](cloudfront-functions.md), enabling advanced
customizable logic at the CloudFront edge locations.

With CloudFront KeyValueStore, you make updates to function code and updates to the data associated with a
function independently of each other. This separation simplifies function code and makes it
easy to update data without the need to deploy code changes.

###### Note

To use CloudFront KeyValueStore, your CloudFront function must use [JavaScript runtime 2.0](functions-javascript-runtime-20.md).

The following is the general procedure for using key-value pairs:

- Create key value stores, and populate it with a set of key-value pairs. You can add
your key value stores to an Amazon S3 bucket or enter them manually.

- Associate the key value stores with your CloudFront function.

- Within your function code, use the name of the key to either retrieve the value
associated with the key or to evaluate if a key exists. For more information about
using key-value pairs in function code, and about helper methods, see [Helper methods for key value stores](functions-custom-methods.md).

## Use cases

You can use key-value pairs for the following examples:

- **URL rewrites or redirects**– The key-value pair can
hold the rewritten URLs or the redirect URLs.

- **A/B testing and feature flags**– You can create a
function to run experiments by assigning a percentage of traffic to a specific
version of your website.

- **Access authorization** – You can implement access
control to allow or deny requests based on criteria defined by you and the data
stored in a key value store.

## Supported formats for values

You can store the value in a key-value pair in any of the following formats:

- String

- Byte-encoded string

- JSON

## Security

The CloudFront function and all its key value stores data are handled securely, as
follows:

- CloudFront encrypts each key value stores at rest and during transit (when reading or
writing to the key value stores) when you call the [CloudFront KeyValueStore](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-operations-amazon-cloudfront-keyvaluestore.md) API operations.

- When the function is run, CloudFront decrypts each key-value pair in memory at the
CloudFront edge locations.
