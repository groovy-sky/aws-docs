# Use various origins with CloudFront distributions

When you create a distribution, you specify the _origin_
where CloudFront sends requests for the files. You can use several different kinds of origins
with CloudFront. For example, you can use an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaStore container, a MediaPackage channel,
an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS Lambda function URL. When you create your CloudFront distribution, CloudFront automatically configures most distribution settings for you, based on your content origin type. For more information, see [Preconfigured distribution settings reference](template-preconfigured-origin-settings.md).

If you have an Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or EC2 instance in a private subnet, you can use it as a VPC origin. With VPC origins, your applications can be accessed only in a private subnet with a CloudFront distribution, which prevents your application from being accessible on the public internet. For more information, see [Restrict access with VPC origins](private-content-vpc-origins.md).

###### Note

You can use edge functions to dynamically select the appropriate origin for each request.
By using CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge, you can route requests to different origins
based on factors such as the viewer's geographic location, the request headers, or
query string parameters. For more information, see [Customize at the edge with functions](edge-functions.md).

## Use an Amazon S3 bucket

The following topics describe the different ways that you can use an Amazon S3 bucket
as the origin for a CloudFront distribution.

###### Topics

- [Use a standard Amazon S3 bucket](#concept_S3Origin)

- [Use Amazon S3 Object Lambda](#using-S3-Object-Lambda)

- [Use Amazon S3 Access Point](#using-S3-Access-Point)

- [Use an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint](#concept_S3Origin_website)

- [Add CloudFront to an existing Amazon S3 bucket](#adding-cloudfront-to-s3)

- [Move an Amazon S3 bucket to a different AWS Region](#move-s3-bucket-different-region)

### Use a standard Amazon S3 bucket

When you use Amazon S3 as an origin for your distribution, you place the objects
that you want CloudFront to deliver in an Amazon S3 bucket. You can use any method that is
supported by Amazon S3 to get your objects into Amazon S3. For example, you can use the
Amazon S3 console or API, or a third-party tool. You can create a hierarchy in your
bucket to store the objects, just as you would with any other standard Amazon S3
bucket.

Using an existing Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn't change the
bucket in any way; you can still use it as you normally would to store and
access Amazon S3 objects at the standard Amazon S3 price. You incur regular Amazon S3 charges
for storing the objects in the bucket. For more information about the charges to
use CloudFront, see [Amazon CloudFront\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing). For more information about using CloudFront with an existing S3
bucket, see [Add CloudFront to an existing Amazon S3 bucket](#adding-cloudfront-to-s3).

###### Important

For your bucket to work with CloudFront, the name must conform to DNS naming
requirements. For more information, go to [Bucket naming\
rules](../../../s3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

When you specify an Amazon S3 bucket as an origin for CloudFront, we recommend that you use the
following format:

`bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com`

When you specify the bucket name in this format, you can use the following
CloudFront features:

- Configure CloudFront to communicate with your Amazon S3 bucket using SSL/TLS. For more information,
see [Use HTTPS with CloudFront](using-https.md).

- Use an origin access control to require that viewers access your content using CloudFront
URLs, not by using Amazon S3 URLs. For more information, see [Restrict access to an Amazon S3 origin](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

- Update the content of your bucket by submitting `POST` and `PUT`
requests to CloudFront. For more information, see [HTTP methods](requestandresponsebehaviors3origin.md#RequestS3HTTPMethods) in the topic [How CloudFront processes and forwards requests to your Amazon S3 origin](requestandresponsebehaviors3origin.md#RequestBehaviorS3Origin).

Don't specify the bucket using the following formats:

- The Amazon S3 path style:
`s3.amazonaws.com/bucket-name`

- The Amazon S3 CNAME

###### Note

CloudFront supports S3 origins using any storage class, including S3
Intelligent-Tiering. When CloudFront requests objects from an S3 origin, the objects
are retrieved regardless of the storage tier they currently reside in. Using
CloudFront with S3 Intelligent-Tiering doesn't impact the performance or functionality
of your distribution. For more information, see [Managing storage\
costs with Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering](../../../s3/latest/userguide/intelligent-tiering.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

### Use Amazon S3 Object Lambda

When you [create an Object Lambda\
Access Point](../../../s3/latest/userguide/olap-create.md), Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique alias for your
Object Lambda Access Point. You can [use this alias](../../../s3/latest/userguide/olap-use.md#ol-access-points-alias) instead of an Amazon S3 bucket name
as an origin for your CloudFront distribution.

When you use an Object Lambda Access Point alias as an origin for CloudFront, we
recommend that you use the following format:

`alias.s3.region.amazonaws.com`

For more information about finding the
`alias`, see [How to use a bucket-style alias for your S3 bucket\
Object Lambda Access Point](../../../s3/latest/userguide/olap-use.md#ol-access-points-alias) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Important

When you use an Object Lambda Access Point as an origin for CloudFront, you must
use [origin access\
control](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

For an example use case, see [Use Amazon S3 Object Lambda with Amazon CloudFront to Tailor Content for End\
Users](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-amazon-s3-object-lambda-with-amazon-cloudfront-to-tailor-content-for-end-users).

CloudFront treats an Object Lambda Access Point origin the same as [a standard Amazon S3 bucket origin](#concept_S3Origin).

If you're using Amazon S3 Object Lambda as an origin for your distribution, you must configure
the following four permissions.

Object Lambda Access Point

###### To add permissions for the Object Lambda Access Point

### Use Amazon S3 Access Point

When you [use an S3 Access\
Point](../../../s3/latest/userguide/creating-access-points.md), Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique alias for you. You can
use this alias instead of an Amazon S3 bucket name as an origin for your CloudFront
distribution.

When you use an Amazon S3 Access Point alias as an origin for CloudFront, we
recommend that you use the following format:

`alias.s3.region.amazonaws.com`

For more information about finding the
`alias`, see [Using a bucket-style alias for your S3 bucket access point](../../../s3/latest/userguide/access-points-alias.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Important

When you use an Amazon S3 Access Point as an origin for CloudFront, you must
use [origin access\
control](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

CloudFront treats an Amazon S3 Access Point origin the same as [a standard Amazon S3 bucket origin](#concept_S3Origin).

If you're using Amazon S3 Object Lambda as an origin for your distribution, you must configure
the following two permissions.

Amazon S3 Access Point

###### To add permissions for the Amazon S3 Access Point

### Use an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint

You can use an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint as a custom origin with
CloudFront. When you configure your CloudFront distribution, for the origin, enter the Amazon S3
static website hosting endpoint for your bucket. This value appears in the
[Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3), on the
**Properties** tab, in the **Static website**
**hosting** pane. For example:

`http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`

For more information about specifying Amazon S3 static website endpoints, see [Website endpoints](../../../s3/latest/userguide/websiteendpoints.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

When you specify the bucket name in this format as your origin, you can use Amazon S3 redirects
and Amazon S3 custom error documents. For more information, see [Configuring a custom error document](../../../s3/latest/userguide/customerrordocsupport.md) and [Configuring a\
redirect](../../../s3/latest/userguide/how-to-page-redirect.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_. (CloudFront
also provides custom error pages. For more information, see [Create a custom error page for specific HTTP status codes](creating-custom-error-pages.md).)

Using an Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn't change the bucket in any way. You
can still use it as you normally would and you incur regular Amazon S3 charges. For
more information about the charges to use CloudFront, see [Amazon CloudFront Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing).

###### Note

If you use the CloudFront API to create your distribution with an Amazon S3 bucket
that is configured as a website endpoint, you must configure it by using
`CustomOriginConfig`, even though the website is hosted in an
Amazon S3 bucket. For more information about creating distributions by using the
CloudFront API, see [CreateDistribution](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-createdistribution.md) in the
_Amazon CloudFront API Reference_.

### Add CloudFront to an existing Amazon S3 bucket

If you store your objects in an Amazon S3 bucket, you can either have users get
your objects directly from S3, or you can configure CloudFront to get your objects
from S3 and then distribute them to your users. Using CloudFront can be more cost
effective if your users access your objects frequently because, at higher usage,
the price for CloudFront data transfer is lower than the price for Amazon S3 data transfer.
In addition, downloads are faster with CloudFront than with Amazon S3 alone because your
objects are stored closer to your users.

###### Note

If you want CloudFront to respect Amazon S3 cross-origin resource sharing settings,
configure CloudFront to forward the `Origin` header to Amazon S3. For more
information, see [Cache content based on request headers](header-caching.md).

If you currently distribute content directly from your Amazon S3 bucket using your
own domain name (such as example.com) instead of the domain name of your Amazon S3
bucket (such as amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com), you can add CloudFront
with no disruption by using the following procedure.

###### To add CloudFront when you're already distributing your content from Amazon S3

1. Create a CloudFront distribution. For more information, see [Create a distribution](distribution-web-creating-console.md).

When you create the distribution, specify the name of your Amazon S3 bucket
    as the origin server.

###### Important

For your bucket to work with CloudFront, the name must conform to DNS
naming requirements. For more information, go to [Bucket naming\
rules](../../../s3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

If you're using a CNAME with Amazon S3, specify the CNAME for your
    distribution, too.

2. Create a test webpage that contains links to publicly readable objects
    in your Amazon S3 bucket, and test the links. For this initial test, use the
    CloudFront domain name of your distribution in the object URLs, for example,
    `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg`.

For more information about the format of CloudFront URLs, see [Customize the URL format for files in CloudFront](linkformat.md).

3. If you're using Amazon S3 CNAMEs, your application uses your domain name
    (for example, example.com) to reference the objects in your Amazon S3 bucket
    instead of using the name of your bucket (for example,
    amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com). To continue using your domain
    name to reference objects instead of using the CloudFront domain name for your
    distribution (for example, d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net), you need to update
    your settings with your DNS service provider.

For Amazon S3 CNAMEs to work, your DNS service provider must have a CNAME
    resource record set for your domain that currently routes queries for
    the domain to your Amazon S3 bucket. For example, if a user requests this
    object:

`https://example.com/images/image.jpg`

The request is automatically rerouted, and the user sees this
    object:

`https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/image.jpg`

To route queries to your CloudFront distribution instead of your Amazon S3 bucket, you need to use
    the method provided by your DNS service provider to update the CNAME
    resource record set for your domain. This updated CNAME record redirects
    DNS queries from your domain to the CloudFront domain name for your
    distribution. For more information, see the documentation provided by
    your DNS service provider.

###### Note

If you're using Route 53 as your DNS service, you can use either a CNAME resource record
set or an alias resource record set. For information about editing
resource record sets, see [Editing records](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/resource-record-sets-editing.md). For information about
alias resource record sets, see [Choosing between alias and non-alias\
records](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.md). Both topics are in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

For more information about using CNAMEs with CloudFront, see [Use custom URLs by adding alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](cnames.md).

After you update the CNAME resource record set, it can take up to 72 hours for the
    change to propagate throughout the DNS system, although it usually
    happens faster. During this time, some requests for your content will
    continue to be routed to your Amazon S3 bucket, and others will be routed to
    CloudFront.

### Move an Amazon S3 bucket to a different AWS Region

If you're using Amazon S3 as the origin for a CloudFront distribution and you move the
bucket to a different AWS Region, CloudFront can take up to an hour to update its
records to use the new Region when both of the following are true:

- You're using a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI) to restrict access to
the bucket.

- You move the bucket to an Amazon S3 Region that requires Signature Version
4 for authentication.

When you're using OAIs, CloudFront uses the Region (among other values) to calculate the
signature that it uses to request objects from your bucket. For more information
about OAIs, see [Use an origin access identity (legacy, not recommended)](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md#private-content-restricting-access-to-s3-oai).
For a list of AWS Regions that support Signature Version 2, see [Signature\
Version 2 signing process](../../../../general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.md) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

To force a faster update to CloudFront's records, you can update your CloudFront
distribution, for example, by updating the **Description**
field on the **General** tab in the CloudFront console. When you
update a distribution, CloudFront immediately checks the Region that your bucket is
in. Propagation of the change to all edge locations should take only a few
minutes.

## Use a MediaStore container or a MediaPackage channel

To stream video using CloudFront, you can set up an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a MediaStore
container, or create a channel and endpoints with MediaPackage. Then you create and
configure a distribution in CloudFront to stream the video.

For more information and step-by-step instructions, see the following topics:

- [Serve video by using AWS Elemental MediaStore as the origin](live-streaming.md#video-streaming-mediastore)

- [Serve live video formatted with AWS Elemental MediaPackage](live-streaming.md#live-streaming-with-mediapackage)

## Use an Application Load Balancer

You can use CloudFront to route traffic to both internal and internet-facing Application Load Balancers.

If your origin is one or more HTTP(S) servers (web servers) hosted on one or more
Amazon EC2 instances, you can choose to use an internet-facing Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the instances. An internet-facing load balancer has a publicly resolvable DNS name and routes requests from clients to targets over the internet.

For
more information about using an internet-facing Application Load Balancer as your origin for CloudFront, including how to make
sure that viewers can only access your web servers through CloudFront and not by accessing
the load balancer directly, see [Restrict access to Application Load Balancers](restrict-access-to-load-balancer.md).

Alternatively, you can use VPC origins to deliver content from applications that are hosted with an internal Application Load Balancer in your virtual private cloud (VPC) private subnets. VPC origins prevents your application from being accessible on the public internet. For more information, see [Restrict access with VPC origins](private-content-vpc-origins.md).

## Use a Network Load Balancer

You can use both internal and internet-facing Network Load Balancers with Amazon CloudFront. You can use internal Network Load Balancers inside private subnets with CloudFront by using VPC origins. CloudFront VPC origins allow you to serve content from applications hosted in private VPC subnets without exposing them to the public internet. For more information, see [Restrict access with VPC origins](private-content-vpc-origins.md).

Alternatively, you can also use CloudFront for delivering traffic from internet-facing Network Load Balancers. An internet-facing load balancer has a publicly resolvable DNS name and can receive requests from both clients on the internet and CloudFront distributions.

## Use a Lambda function URL

A [Lambda\
function URL](../../../lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.md) is a dedicated HTTPS endpoint for a Lambda function. You can
use a Lambda function URL to build a serverless web application entirely within
Lambda. You can invoke the Lambda web application directly through the function URL,
with no need to integrate with API Gateway or an Application Load Balancer.

If you build a serverless web application by using Lambda functions with function
URLs, you can add CloudFront to get the following benefits:

- Speed up your application by caching content closer to viewers

- Use a custom domain name for your web application

- Route different URL paths to different Lambda functions using CloudFront cache
behaviors

- Block specific requests using CloudFront geographic restrictions or AWS WAF
(or both)

- Use AWS WAF with CloudFront to help protect your application from malicious bots,
help prevent common application exploits, and enhance protection from DDoS
attacks

To use a Lambda function URL as the origin for a CloudFront distribution, specify the
full domain name of the Lambda function URL as the origin domain. A Lambda function
URL domain name uses the following format:

`function-URL-ID.lambda-url.AWS-Region.on.aws`

When you use a Lambda function URL as the origin for a CloudFront distribution, the
function URL must be publicly accessible. To do so, use one of the following
options:

- If you use origin access control (OAC), the `AuthType` parameter of the Lambda
function URL must use the `AWS_IAM` value and allow the
`lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl` and `lambda:InvokeFunction`
permissions in a resource-based policy. For more information about using Lambda
function URLs for OAC, see [Restrict access to an AWS Lambda function URL origin](private-content-restricting-access-to-lambda.md).

- If you don't use OAC, you can set the `AuthType` parameter of
the function URL to `NONE` and allow the
`lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl` permission in a resource-based
policy.

You can also [add a custom origin\
header](add-origin-custom-headers.md) to the requests that CloudFront sends to the origin, and write function
code to return an error response if the header isn't present in the request. This
helps to make sure that users can only access your web application through CloudFront, not
directly using the Lambda function URL.

For more information about Lambda function URLs, see the following topics in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_:

## Use Amazon EC2 (or another custom origin)

You can use both internal and internet-facing EC2 instances with Amazon CloudFront. You can use internal EC2 instances inside private subnets with CloudFront by using VPC origins. CloudFront VPC origins allow you to serve content from applications hosted in private VPC subnets without exposing them to the public internet. For more information, see [Restrict access with VPC origins](private-content-vpc-origins.md).

A custom origin is an HTTP(S) web server with a publicly resolvable DNS name that routes requests from clients to targets over the internet. The HTTP(S) server can be hosted on AWS–for example, an Amazon EC2 instance–or hosted somewhere else. An Amazon S3 origin
configured as a website endpoint is also considered a custom origin. For more information, see [Use an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint](#concept_S3Origin_website).

When you use your own HTTP server as a custom origin, you specify the DNS name of the
server, along with the HTTP and HTTPS ports and the protocol that you want CloudFront to
use when fetching objects from your origin.

Most CloudFront features are supported when you use a custom origin with the exception of private
content. Although you can use a signed URL to distribute content from a custom
origin, for CloudFront to access the custom origin, the origin must remain publicly
accessible. For more information, see [Serve private content with signed URLs and signed cookies](privatecontent.md).

Follow these guidelines for using Amazon EC2 instances and other custom origins with
CloudFront.

- Host and serve the same content on all servers that are serving content for the same CloudFront
origin. For more information, see [Origin settings](downloaddistvaluesorigin.md)
in the [All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md) topic.

- Log the `X-Amz-Cf-Id` header entries on all servers in case you need Support or
CloudFront to use this value for debugging.

- Restrict requests to the HTTP and HTTPS ports that your custom origin listens on.

- Synchronize the clocks of all servers in your implementation. Note that CloudFront uses
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for signed URLs and signed cookies, for
logs, and reports. In addition, if you monitor CloudFront activity using CloudWatch
metrics, note that CloudWatch also uses UTC.

- Use redundant servers to handle failures.

- For information about using a custom origin to serve private content, see [Restrict access to files on custom origins](private-content-overview.md#forward-custom-headers-restrict-access).

- For information about request and response behavior and about supported HTTP status
codes, see [Request and response behavior](requestandresponsebehavior.md).

If you use Amazon EC2 for a custom origin, we recommend that you do the following:

- Use an Amazon Machine Image that automatically installs the software for a
web server. For more information, see the [Amazon EC2 documentation](../../../ec2/index.md).

- Use an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to handle traffic across multiple Amazon EC2
instances and to isolate your application from changes to Amazon EC2 instances.
For example, if you use a load balancer, you can add and delete Amazon EC2
instances without changing your application. For more information, see the
[Elastic Load Balancing\
documentation](../../../elasticloadbalancing/index.md).

- When you create your CloudFront distribution, specify the URL of the load
balancer for the domain name of your origin server. For more information,
see [Create a distribution](distribution-web-creating-console.md).

## Use CloudFront origin groups

You can specify an origin group for your CloudFront origin if, for example, you want to configure
origin failover for scenarios when you need high availability. Use origin failover
to designate a primary origin for CloudFront plus a second origin that CloudFront automatically
switches to when the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code failure
responses.

For more information, including the steps for setting up an origin group, see [Optimize high availability with CloudFront origin failover](high-availability-origin-failover.md).

## Use Amazon API Gateway

You can use API Gateway as a custom origin for your CloudFront distribution. For more information,
see the following topics:
