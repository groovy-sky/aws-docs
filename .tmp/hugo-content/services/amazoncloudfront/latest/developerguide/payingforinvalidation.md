# Pay for file invalidation

The first 1,000 invalidation paths that you submit per month are free; you pay for
each invalidation path over 1,000 in a month. An invalidation path can be for a
single file (such as `/images/logo.jpg`) or for multiple files (such as
`/images/*`). A path that includes the `*` wildcard counts
as one path even if it causes CloudFront to invalidate thousands of files.

The maximum of 1,000 free invalidation paths per month applies to the total number of
invalidation paths across all of the distributions that you create with one
AWS account. For example, if you use the AWS account
`john@example.com` to create three distributions, and you submit 600
invalidation paths for _each distribution_ in a given month (for
a total of 1,800 invalidation paths), AWS will charge you for the difference
between the total invalidation paths and the 1000 free limit. In this example, AWS
would charge you for 800 invalidation paths in that month.

The charge to submit an invalidation path is the same regardless of the number of
files you’re invalidating: a single file ( `/images/logo.jpg`) or all of
the files that are associated with a distribution ( `/*`). Because you're
charged per path in your invalidation request, even if you bundle multiple paths
into a single request, each path is still counted individually for billing purposes.
