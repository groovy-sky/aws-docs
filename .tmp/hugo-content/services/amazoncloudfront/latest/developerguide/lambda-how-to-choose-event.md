# Choose the event to trigger the function

When you're deciding which CloudFront event you want to use to trigger a Lambda function,
consider the following:

**I want CloudFront to cache objects that are changed by a Lambda function**

To cache an object that was modified by a Lambda function so that CloudFront
can serve the object from the edge location the next time it's
requested, use the _origin request_ or
_origin response_ event.

This reduces the load on the origin, reduces latency for subsequent
requests, and reduces the cost of invoking Lambda@Edge on subsequent
requests.

For example, if you want to add, remove, or change headers for objects
that are returned by the origin and you want CloudFront to cache the result,
use the origin response event.

**I want the function to execute for every request**

To execute the function for every request that CloudFront receives for the
distribution, use the _viewer request_ or
_viewer response_ events.

Origin request and origin response events occur only when a requested
object isn't cached in an edge location and CloudFront forwards a request to
the origin.

**I want the function to change the cache key**

To change a value that you're using as a basis for caching, use the
_viewer request_ event.

For example, if a function changes the URL to include a language
abbreviation in the path (for example, because the user chose their
language from a dropdown list), use the viewer request event:

- **URL in the viewer request**
– https://example.com/en/index.html

- **URL when the request comes from an IP**
**address in Germany** –
https://example.com/de/index.html

You also use the viewer request event if you're caching based on
cookies or request headers.

###### Note

If the function changes cookies or headers, configure CloudFront to
forward the applicable part of the request to the origin. For more
information, see the following topics:

- [Cache content based on cookies](cookies.md)

- [Cache content based on request headers](header-caching.md)

**The function affects the response from the origin**

To change the request in a way that affects the response from the
origin, use the _origin request_ event.

Typically, most viewer request events aren't forwarded to the origin.
CloudFront responds to a request with an object that's already in the edge
cache. If the function changes the request based on an origin request
event, CloudFront caches the response to the changed origin request.
