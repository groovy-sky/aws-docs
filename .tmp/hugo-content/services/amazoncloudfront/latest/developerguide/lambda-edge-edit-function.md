# Edit a Lambda function

After you create a Lambda@Edge function, you can use the Lambda console to edit
it.

###### Notes

- The original version is labeled $LATEST.

- You can edit only the $LATEST version.

- Each time you edit the $LATEST version, you must publish a new
numbered version.

- You can't create triggers for $LATEST.

- When you publish a new version of a function, Lambda doesn't
automatically copy triggers from the previous version to the new
version. You must reproduce the triggers for the new version.

- When you add a trigger for a CloudFront event to a function, if there's
already a trigger for the same distribution, cache behavior, and event
for an earlier version of the same function, Lambda deletes the trigger
from the earlier version.

- After you make updates to a CloudFront distribution, like adding triggers,
you must wait for the changes to propagate to edge locations before the
functions you've specified in the triggers will work.

###### To edit a Lambda function

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).

02. In the Region list at the top of the page, choose
     **US East (N. Virginia)**.

03. In the list of functions, choose the name of the function.

    By default, the console displays the $LATEST version. You can view earlier
     versions (choose **Qualifiers**), but you can only edit
     $LATEST.

04. On the **Code** tab, for **Code entry**
    **type**, choose to edit the code in the browser, upload a .zip
     file, or upload a file from Amazon S3.

05. Choose either **Save** or **Save and**
    **test**.

06. Choose **Actions**, and choose **Publish new**
    **version**.

07. In the **Publish new version from $LATEST** dialog box,
     enter a description of the new version. This description appears in the list
     of versions, along with an automatically generated version number.

08. Choose **Publish**.

    The new version automatically becomes the latest version. The version
     number appears on the **Version** in the upper-left corner
     of the page.

    ###### Note

    If you haven't added triggers for your function yet, see [Add triggers for a Lambda@Edge function](lambda-edge-add-triggers.md).

09. Choose the **Triggers** tab.

10. Choose **Add trigger**.

11. In the **Add trigger** dialog box, choose the dotted box,
     and then choose **CloudFront**.

    ###### Note

    If you've already created one or more triggers for a function, CloudFront is
    the default service.

12. Specify the following values to indicate when you want the Lambda function
     to execute.
    1. **Distribution ID**– Choose the ID of the
        distribution that you want to add the trigger to.

    2. **Cache behavior** – Choose the cache
        behavior that specifies the objects that you want to execute the
        function on.

    3. **CloudFront event** – Choose the CloudFront event
        that causes the function to execute.

    4. **Enable trigger and replicate** – Select
        this check box so Lambda replicates the function to AWS Regions
        globally.
13. Choose **Submit**.

14. To add more triggers for this function, repeat steps 10 through 13.

For more information about testing and debugging the function in the Lambda
console, see [Invoke\
a Lambda function using the console](../../../lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.md#get-started-invoke-manually) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

When you're ready to have the function execute for CloudFront events, publish another
version and edit the function to add triggers. For more information, see [Add triggers for a Lambda@Edge function](lambda-edge-add-triggers.md).
