and reserved capacity that you have in your account at the requested date and
time.

instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized
instance.

Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch
instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to `expired` when
it reaches its end date and time.

Required: No

**endDateType**

Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can
have one of the following end types:

Required: No

**instanceMatchCriteria**

Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The
options include:

matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances
that have matching attributes launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically
without specifying any additional parameters.

- `targeted` \- The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that
have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and
explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted
instances can use the reserved capacity.
