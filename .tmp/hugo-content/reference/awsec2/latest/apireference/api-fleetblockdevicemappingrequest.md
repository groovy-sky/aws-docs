# FleetBlockDeviceMappingRequest

Describes a block device mapping, which defines the EBS volumes and instance store
volumes to attach to an instance at launch.

To override a block device mapping specified in the launch template:

- Specify the exact same `DeviceName` here as specified in the launch
template.

- Only specify the parameters you want to change.

- Any parameters you don't specify here will keep their original launch template
values.

To add a new block device mapping:

- Specify a `DeviceName` that doesn't exist in the launch
template.

- Specify all desired parameters here.

## Contents

**DeviceName**

The device name (for example, `/dev/sdh` or `xvdh`).

Type: String

Required: No

**Ebs**

Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is
launched.

Type: [FleetEbsBlockDeviceRequest](api-fleetebsblockdevicerequest.md) object

Required: No

**NoDevice**

To omit the device from the block device mapping, specify an empty string. When this
property is specified, the device is removed from the block device mapping regardless of
the assigned value.

Type: String

Required: No

**VirtualName**

The virtual device name ( `ephemeralN`). Instance store volumes are numbered
starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify
mappings for `ephemeral0` and `ephemeral1`. The number of available
instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you
must mount the volume.

NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name.
Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block
device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance
store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

Type: String

Required: No
