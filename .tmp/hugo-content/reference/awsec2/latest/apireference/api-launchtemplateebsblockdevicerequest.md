# LaunchTemplateEbsBlockDeviceRequest

The parameters for a block device for an EBS volume.

## Contents

**DeleteOnTermination**

Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**EbsCardIndex**

The index of the EBS card. Some instance types support multiple EBS cards. The default EBS card index is 0.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**Encrypted**

Indicates whether the EBS volume is encrypted. Encrypted volumes can only be attached
to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. If you are creating a volume from a
snapshot, you can't specify an encryption value.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Iops**

The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For `gp3`,
`io1`, and `io2` volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that
are provisioned for the volume. For `gp2` volumes, this represents the
baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O
credits for bursting.

The following are the supported values for each volume type:

- `gp3`: 3,000 - 80,000 IOPS

- `io1`: 100 - 64,000 IOPS

- `io2`: 100 - 256,000 IOPS

For `io2` volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on
[instances \
built on the Nitro System](../../../../services/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.md). On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

This parameter is supported for `io1`, `io2`, and `gp3` volumes only.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**KmsKeyId**

Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key to use for EBS encryption.

Type: String

Required: No

**SnapshotId**

The ID of the snapshot.

Type: String

Required: No

**Throughput**

The throughput to provision for a `gp3` volume, with a maximum of 2,000
MiB/s.

Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 2,000.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**VolumeInitializationRate**

Specifies the Amazon EBS Provisioned Rate for Volume Initialization (volume initialization rate), in MiB/s, at which to download
the snapshot blocks from Amazon S3 to the volume. This is also known as _volume_
_initialization_. Specifying a volume initialization rate ensures that the volume is
initialized at a predictable and consistent rate after creation.

This parameter is supported only for volumes created from snapshots. Omit this parameter
if:

- You want to create the volume using fast snapshot restore. You must specify a snapshot
that is enabled for fast snapshot restore. In this case, the volume is fully initialized
at creation.

###### Note

If you specify a snapshot that is enabled for fast snapshot restore and a volume initialization rate,
the volume will be initialized at the specified rate instead of fast snapshot restore.

- You want to create a volume that is initialized at the default rate.

For more information, see [Initialize Amazon EBS volumes](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/initalize-volume.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Valid range: 100 - 300 MiB/s

Type: Integer

Required: No

**VolumeSize**

The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume
size. The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

- `gp2`: 1 - 16,384 GiB

- `gp3`: 1 - 65,536 GiB

- `io1`: 4 - 16,384 GiB

- `io2`: 4 - 65,536 GiB

- `st1` and `sc1`: 125 - 16,384 GiB

- `standard`: 1 - 1024 GiB

Type: Integer

Required: No

**VolumeType**

The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `standard | io1 | io2 | gp2 | sc1 | st1 | gp3`

Required: No
