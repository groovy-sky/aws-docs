# CapacityReservationOptions

Describes the strategy for using unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand
capacity.

###### Note

This strategy can only be used if the EC2 Fleet is of type
`instant`.

For more information about Capacity Reservations, see [On-Demand Capacity\

## Contents

**usageStrategy**

Indicates whether to use unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

If you specify `use-capacity-reservations-first`, the fleet uses unused
Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If
multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation
strategy ( `lowest-price` or `prioritized`) is applied. If the number
of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining
On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy
( `lowest-price` or `prioritized`).

If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfils the On-Demand capacity according to the
chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.

Type: String

Valid Values: `use-capacity-reservations-first`
