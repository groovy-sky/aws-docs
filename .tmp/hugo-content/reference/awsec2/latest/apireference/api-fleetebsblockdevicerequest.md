# FleetEbsBlockDeviceRequest

Describes a block device for an EBS volume.

## Contents

**DeleteOnTermination**

Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more
information, see [Preserve data when\
an instance is terminated](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/preserving-volumes-on-termination.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Encrypted**

Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored
from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to `true`
depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state,
ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS\
encryption](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.md) in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For
more information, see [Supported instance types](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption-requirements.md#ebs-encryption_supported_instances).

This parameter is not returned by [DescribeImageAttribute](api-describeimageattribute.md).

For [CreateImage](api-createimage.md) and [RegisterImage](api-registerimage.md), whether you
can include this parameter, and the allowed values differ depending on the type of block
device mapping you are creating.

- If you are creating a block device mapping for a **new (empty)**
**volume**, you can include this parameter, and specify either
`true` for an encrypted volume, or `false` for an
unencrypted volume. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to `false`
(unencrypted).

- If you are creating a block device mapping from an **existing encrypted or**
**unencrypted snapshot**, you must omit this parameter. If you include this
parameter, the request will fail, regardless of the value that you specify.

- If you are creating a block device mapping from an **existing unencrypted**
**volume**, you can include this parameter, but you must specify
`false`. If you specify `true`, the request will fail. In
this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter.

- If you are creating a block device mapping from an **existing encrypted**
**volume**, you can include this parameter, and specify either
`true` or `false`. However, if you specify
`false`, the parameter is ignored and the block device mapping is
always encrypted. In this case, we recommend that you omit the parameter.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Iops**

The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For `gp3`, `io1`, and `io2` volumes,
this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For `gp2`
volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which
the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

The following are the supported values for each volume type:

- `gp3`: 3,000 - 80,000 IOPS

- `io1`: 100 - 64,000 IOPS

- `io2`: 100 - 256,000 IOPS

For `io2` volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on
[instances \
built on the Nitro System](../../../../services/ec2/latest/userguide/instance-types.md#ec2-nitro-instances). On other instances, you can achieve performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

This parameter is required for `io1` and `io2` volumes. The default for `gp3` volumes
is 3,000 IOPS.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**KmsKeyId**

Identifier (key ID, key alias, key ARN, or alias ARN) of the customer managed KMS key
to use for EBS encryption.

This parameter is only supported on `BlockDeviceMapping` objects called by
[CreateFleet](api-createfleet.md), [RequestSpotInstances](api-requestspotinstances.md), and [RunInstances](api-runinstances.md).

Type: String

Required: No

**SnapshotId**

The ID of the snapshot.

Type: String

Required: No

**Throughput**

The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

This parameter is valid only for `gp3` volumes.

Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 2,000.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**VolumeSize**

The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume
size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a
volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

The following are the supported sizes for each volume type:

- `gp2`: 1 - 16,384 GiB

- `gp3`: 1 - 65,536 GiB

- `io1`: 4 - 16,384 GiB

- `io2`: 4 - 65,536 GiB

- `st1` and `sc1`: 125 - 16,384 GiB

- `standard`: 1 - 1024 GiB

Type: Integer

Required: No

**VolumeType**

The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](../../../../services/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `standard | io1 | io2 | gp2 | sc1 | st1 | gp3`

Required: No
