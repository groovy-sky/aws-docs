# IpamPrefixListResolverRuleCondition

Describes a condition within a CIDR selection rule. Conditions define the criteria for selecting CIDRs from IPAM's database based on resource attributes.

CIDR selection rules define the business logic for selecting CIDRs from IPAM. If a CIDR matches any of the rules, it will be included. If a rule has multiple conditions, the CIDR has to match every condition of that rule. You can create a prefix list resolver without any CIDR selection rules, but it will generate empty versions (containing no CIDRs) until you add rules.

There are three rule types. Only 2 of the 3 rule types support conditions - **IPAM pool CIDR** and **Scope resource CIDR**. **Static CIDR** rules cannot have conditions.

- **Static CIDR**: A fixed list of CIDRs that do not change (like a manual list replicated across Regions)

- **IPAM pool CIDR**: CIDRs from specific IPAM pools (like all CIDRs from your IPAM production pool)

If you choose this option, choose the following:

- **IPAM scope**: Select the IPAM scope to search for resources

- **Conditions:**

- **Property**

- **IPAM pool ID**: Select an IPAM pool that contains the resources

- **CIDR** (like 10.24.34.0/23)

- **Operation**: Equals/Not equals

- **Value**: The value on which to match the condition

- **Scope resource CIDR**: CIDRs from AWS resources like VPCs, subnets, EIPs within an IPAM scope

If you choose this option, choose the following:

- **IPAM scope**: Select the IPAM scope to search for resources

- **Resource type**: Select a resource, like a VPC or subnet.

- **Conditions**:

- **Property**:

- Resource ID: The unique ID of a resource (like vpc-1234567890abcdef0)

- Resource owner (like 111122223333)

- Resource region (like us-east-1)

- Resource tag (like key: name, value: dev-vpc-1)

- CIDR (like 10.24.34.0/23)

- **Operation**: Equals/Not equals

- **Value**: The value on which to match the condition
