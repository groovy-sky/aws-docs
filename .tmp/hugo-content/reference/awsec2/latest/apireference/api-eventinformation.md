Describes an EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet event.

## Contents

**eventDescription**

The description of the event.

Type: String

Required: No

**eventSubType**

The event.

`error` events:

- `iamFleetRoleInvalid` \- The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet does not have the required
permissions either to launch or terminate an instance.

- `allLaunchSpecsTemporarilyBlacklisted` \- None of the configurations
are valid, and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For more
information, see the description of the event.

- `spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded` \- You've reached the limit on the
number of Spot Instances that you can launch.

- `spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid` \- The configuration is not
valid. For more information, see the description of the event.

`fleetRequestChange` events:

- `active` \- The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has been validated and Amazon EC2 is
attempting to maintain the target number of running instances.

- `deleted` (EC2 Fleet) / `cancelled` (Spot Fleet) - The EC2 Fleet is deleted or the Spot Fleet request is canceled and has no running
instances. The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet will be deleted two days after its instances are
terminated.

- `deleted_running` (EC2 Fleet) / `cancelled_running` (Spot Fleet) - The EC2 Fleet is deleted or the Spot Fleet request is canceled and does
not launch additional instances. Its existing instances continue to run until
they are interrupted or terminated. The request remains in this state until all
instances are interrupted or terminated.

- `deleted_terminating` (EC2 Fleet) / `cancelled_terminating` (Spot Fleet) - The EC2 Fleet is deleted or the Spot Fleet request is canceled and
its instances are terminating. The request remains in this state until all
instances are terminated.

- `expired` \- The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has expired. If the request was
created with `TerminateInstancesWithExpiration` set, a subsequent
`terminated` event indicates that the instances are
terminated.

- `modify_in_progress` \- The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is being modified.
The request remains in this state until the modification is fully
processed.

- `modify_succeeded` \- The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request was modified.

- `submitted` \- The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is being evaluated and Amazon EC2
is preparing to launch the target number of instances.

- `progress` \- The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is in the process of being fulfilled.

`instanceChange` events:

- `launched` \- A new instance was launched.

- `terminated` \- An instance was terminated by the user.

- `termination_notified` \- An instance termination notification was
sent when a Spot Instance was terminated by Amazon EC2 during scale-down, when the target
capacity of the fleet was modified down, for example, from a target capacity of
4 to a target capacity of 3.

`Information` events:

- `fleetProgressHalted` \- The price in every launch specification is
not valid because it is below the Spot price (all the launch specifications have
produced `launchSpecUnusable` events). A launch specification might
become valid if the Spot price changes.

- `launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted` \- The configuration is not valid
and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For more information, see
the description of the event.

- `launchSpecUnusable` \- The price specified in a launch specification
is not valid because it is below the Spot price for the requested Spot pools.

Note: Even if a fleet with the `maintain` request type is in the process
of being canceled, it may still publish a `launchSpecUnusable` event. This
does not mean that the canceled fleet is attempting to launch a new instance.

- `registerWithLoadBalancersFailed` \- An attempt to register
instances with load balancers failed. For more information, see the description
of the event.
