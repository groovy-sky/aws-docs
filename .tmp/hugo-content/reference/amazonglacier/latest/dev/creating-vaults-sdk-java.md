**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Creating a Vault in Amazon Glacier Using the AWS SDK for Java

The low-level API provides methods for all the vault operations, including creating and
deleting vaults, getting a vault description, and getting a list of vaults created in a
specific AWS Region. The following are the steps to create a vault using the AWS SDK for Java.

1. Create an instance of the `AmazonGlacierClient` class (the client).

You need to specify an AWS Region in which you want to create a vault.
    All operations you perform using this client apply to that AWS Region.

2. Provide request information by creating an instance of the
    `CreateVaultRequest` class.

Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) requires you to provide a vault name and your account ID. If you don't
    provide an account ID, then the account ID associated with the credentials you
    provide to sign the request is used. For more information, see [Using the AWS SDK for Java with Amazon Glacier](using-aws-sdk-for-java.md).

3. Run the `createVault` method by providing the request object as a
    parameter.

The response Amazon Glacier returns is available in the `CreateVaultResult`
    object.

The following Java code snippet illustrates the preceding steps. The snippet creates a vault
in the `us-west-2` Region. The `Location` it prints is the relative
URI of the vault that includes your account ID, the AWS Region, and the vault name.

```

AmazonGlacierClient client = new AmazonGlacierClient(credentials);
client.setEndpoint("https://glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com");

CreateVaultRequest request = new CreateVaultRequest()
    .withVaultName("*** provide vault name ***");
CreateVaultResult result = client.createVault(request);

System.out.println("Created vault successfully: " + result.getLocation());
```

###### Note

For information about the underlying REST API, see [Create Vault (PUT vault)](../../../../services/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-vault-put.md).

## Example: Creating a Vault Using the AWS SDK for Java

The following Java code example creates a vault in the `us-west-2` Region (for more information on AWS Regions, see
[Accessing Amazon Glacier](../../../../services/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-accessing.md)). In addition, the code example retrieves the vault information, lists all vaults in
the same AWS Region, and then deletes the vault created.

For step-by-step instructions on how to run the following example, see [Running Java Examples for Amazon Glacier Using Eclipse](using-aws-sdk-for-java.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java).
