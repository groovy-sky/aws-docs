# ExecuteTransaction

This operation allows you to perform transactional reads or writes on data stored in
DynamoDB, using PartiQL.

###### Note

The entire transaction must consist of either read statements or write statements,
you cannot mix both in one transaction. The EXISTS function is an exception and can
be used to check the condition of specific attributes of the item in a similar
manner to `ConditionCheck` in the [TransactWriteItems](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/transaction-apis.md#transaction-apis-txwriteitems) API.

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**IdempotentParameterMismatchException**

DynamoDB rejected the request because you retried a request with a
different payload but with an idempotent token that was already used.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**InternalServerError**

An error occurred on the server side.

**message**

The server encountered an internal error trying to fulfill the request.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**ProvisionedThroughputExceededException**

The request was denied due to request throttling. For detailed information about
why the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource, find the [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) field in the returned exception. The AWS
SDKs for DynamoDB automatically retry requests that receive this exception.
Your request is eventually successful, unless your retry queue is too large to finish.
Reduce the frequency of requests and use exponential backoff. For more information, go
to [Error Retries and Exponential Backoff](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/programming-errors.md#Programming.Errors.RetryAndBackoff) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.

**message**

You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput.

**ThrottlingReasons**

A list of [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) that
provide detailed diagnostic information about why the request was throttled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**RequestLimitExceeded**

Throughput exceeds the current throughput quota for your account. For detailed
information about why the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource,
find the [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) field in the returned exception. Contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/support) to request a quota
increase.

**ThrottlingReasons**

A list of [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) that
provide detailed diagnostic information about why the request was throttled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ResourceNotFoundException**

The operation tried to access a nonexistent table or index. The resource might not
be specified correctly, or its status might not be `ACTIVE`.

**message**

The resource which is being requested does not exist.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**ThrottlingException**

The request was denied due to request throttling. For detailed information about why
the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted resource, find the [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) field in the returned exception.

**throttlingReasons**

A list of [ThrottlingReason](api-throttlingreason.md) that
provide detailed diagnostic information about why the request was throttled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**TransactionCanceledException**

The entire transaction request was canceled.

DynamoDB cancels a `TransactWriteItems` request under the following
circumstances:

- A condition in one of the condition expressions is not met.

- A table in the `TransactWriteItems` request is in a different
account or region.

- More than one action in the `TransactWriteItems` operation
targets the same item.

- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
completed.

- An item size becomes too large (larger than 400 KB), or a local secondary
index (LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error occurs because of
changes made by the transaction.

- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

- There is an ongoing `TransactWriteItems` operation that
conflicts with a concurrent `TransactWriteItems` request. In this
case the `TransactWriteItems` operation fails with a
`TransactionCanceledException`.

DynamoDB cancels a `TransactGetItems` request under the
following circumstances:

- There is an ongoing `TransactGetItems` operation that conflicts
with a concurrent `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`,
`DeleteItem` or `TransactWriteItems` request. In this
case the `TransactGetItems` operation fails with a
`TransactionCanceledException`.

- A table in the `TransactGetItems` request is in a different
account or region.

- There is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
completed.

- There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

###### Note

DynamoDB lists the cancellation reasons on the
`CancellationReasons` property. Transaction cancellation reasons are ordered in the order of requested
items, if an item has no error it will have `None` code and
`Null` message.

Cancellation reason codes and possible error messages:

- No Errors:

- Code: `None`

- Message: `null`

- Conditional Check Failed:

- Code: `ConditionalCheckFailed`

- Message: The conditional request failed.

- Item Collection Size Limit Exceeded:

- Code: `ItemCollectionSizeLimitExceeded`

- Message: Collection size exceeded.

- Transaction Conflict:

- Code: `TransactionConflict`

- Message: Transaction is ongoing for the item.

- Provisioned Throughput Exceeded:

- Code: `ProvisionedThroughputExceeded`

- Messages:

- The level of configured provisioned throughput for the
table was exceeded. Consider increasing your provisioning level
with the UpdateTable API.

###### Note

This Message is received when provisioned throughput is
exceeded is on a provisioned DynamoDB
table.

- The level of configured provisioned throughput for one or
more global secondary indexes of the table was exceeded.
Consider increasing your provisioning level for the
under-provisioned global secondary indexes with the UpdateTable
API.

###### Note

This message is returned when provisioned throughput is
exceeded is on a provisioned GSI.

- Throttling Error:

- Code: `ThrottlingError`

- Messages:

- Throughput exceeds the current capacity of your table or
index. DynamoDB is automatically scaling your table or
index so please try again shortly. If exceptions persist, check
if you have a hot key:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html.

###### Note

This message is returned when writes get throttled on an
On-Demand table as DynamoDB is automatically
scaling the table.

- Throughput exceeds the current capacity for one or more
global secondary indexes. DynamoDB is automatically
scaling your index so please try again shortly.

###### Note

This message is returned when writes get throttled on an
On-Demand GSI as DynamoDB is automatically scaling
the GSI.

- Validation Error:

- Code: `ValidationError`

- Messages:

- One or more parameter values were invalid.

- The update expression attempted to update the secondary
index key beyond allowed size limits.

- The update expression attempted to update the secondary
index key to unsupported type.

- An operand in the update expression has an incorrect data
type.

- Item size to update has exceeded the maximum allowed
size.

- Number overflow. Attempting to store a number with
magnitude larger than supported range.

- Type mismatch for attribute to update.

- Nesting Levels have exceeded supported limits.

- The document path provided in the update expression is
invalid for update.

- The provided expression refers to an attribute that does
not exist in the item.

**CancellationReasons**

A list of cancellation reasons.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**TransactionInProgressException**

The transaction with the given request token is already in progress.

Recommended Settings

###### Note

This is a general recommendation for handling the
`TransactionInProgressException`. These settings help ensure that the
client retries will trigger completion of the ongoing
`TransactWriteItems` request.

- Set `clientExecutionTimeout` to a value that allows at least one
retry to be processed after 5 seconds have elapsed since the first attempt for
the `TransactWriteItems` operation.

- Set `socketTimeout` to a value a little lower than the
`requestTimeout` setting.

- `requestTimeout` should be set based on the time taken for the
individual retries of a single HTTP request for your use case, but setting it to
1 second or higher should work well to reduce chances of retries and
`TransactionInProgressException` errors.

- Use exponential backoff when retrying and tune backoff if needed.

Assuming [default retry policy](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/fd409dee8ae23fb8953e0bb4dbde65536a7e0514/aws-java-sdk-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/retry/PredefinedRetryPolicies.java), example timeout settings based on the guidelines
above are as follows:

Example timeline:

- 0-1000 first attempt

- 1000-1500 first sleep/delay (default retry policy uses 500 ms as base delay
for 4xx errors)

- 1500-2500 second attempt

- 2500-3500 second sleep/delay (500 \* 2, exponential backoff)

- 3500-4500 third attempt

- 4500-6500 third sleep/delay (500 \* 2^2)

- 6500-7500 fourth attempt (this can trigger inline recovery since 5 seconds
have elapsed since the first attempt reached TC)

HTTP Status Code: 400
