# BatchGetItem

The `BatchGetItem` operation returns the attributes of one or more items
from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key.

A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100
items. `BatchGetItem` returns a partial result if the response size limit is
exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, more than 1MB per partition is
requested, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned,
the operation returns a value for `UnprocessedKeys`. You can use this value
to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.

###### Important

If you request more than 100 items, `BatchGetItem` returns a
`ValidationException` with the message "Too many items requested for
the BatchGetItem call."

For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in
size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns
an appropriate `UnprocessedKeys` value so you can get the next page of
results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of
results into one dataset.

If _none_ of the items can be processed due to insufficient
provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then
`BatchGetItem` returns a
`ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If _at least_
_one_ of the items is successfully processed, then
`BatchGetItem` completes successfully, while returning the keys of the
unread items in `UnprocessedKeys`.

###### Important

If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on
those items. However, _we strongly recommend that you use an exponential_
_backoff algorithm_. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the
underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual
tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual
requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.

For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/errorhandling.md#BatchOperations) in the _Amazon DynamoDB_
_Developer Guide_.

By default, `BatchGetItem` performs eventually consistent reads on every
table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set
`ConsistentRead` to `true` for any or all tables.

In order to minimize response latency, `BatchGetItem` may retrieve items in
parallel.

When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in
any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values
for the items in your request in the `ProjectionExpression` parameter.

If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for
nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.
For more information, see [Working with Tables](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/workingwithtables.md#CapacityUnitCalculations) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Note

`BatchGetItem` will result in a `ValidationException` if the
same key is specified multiple times.

## Request Parameters

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

###### Note

In the following list, the required parameters are described first.

**[RequestItems](#API_BatchGetItem_RequestSyntax)**

A map of one or more table names or table ARNs and, for each table, a map that
describes one or more items to retrieve from that table. Each table name or ARN can be
used only once per `BatchGetItem` request.

Each element in the map of items to retrieve consists of the following:

- `ConsistentRead` \- If `true`, a strongly consistent read
is used; if `false` (the default), an eventually consistent read is
used.

- `ExpressionAttributeNames` \- One or more substitution tokens for
attribute names in the `ProjectionExpression` parameter. The
following are some use cases for using
`ExpressionAttributeNames`:

- To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved
word.

- To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name
in an expression.

- To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being
misinterpreted in an expression.

Use the **#** character in an expression to
dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute
name:

- `Percentile`

The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be
used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see
[Reserved\
Words](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/reservedwords.md) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_).
To work around this, you could specify the following for
`ExpressionAttributeNames`:

- `{"#P":"Percentile"}`

You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this
example:

- `#P = :val`

###### Note

Tokens that begin with the **:** character
are _expression attribute values_, which are placeholders
for the actual value at runtime.

For more information about expression attribute names, see [Accessing Item Attributes](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/expressions-accessingitemattributes.md) in the _Amazon DynamoDB_
_Developer Guide_.

- `Keys` \- An array of primary key attribute values that define
specific items in the table. For each primary key, you must provide
_all_ of the key attributes. For example, with a simple
primary key, you only need to provide the partition key value. For a composite
key, you must provide _both_ the partition key value and the
sort key value.

- `ProjectionExpression` \- A string that identifies one or more
attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars,
sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be
separated by commas.

If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are returned. If any
of the requested attributes are not found, they do not appear in the
result.

For more information, see [Accessing Item Attributes](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/expressions-accessingitemattributes.md) in the _Amazon DynamoDB_
_Developer Guide_.

- `AttributesToGet` \- This is a legacy parameter. Use
`ProjectionExpression` instead. For more information, see [AttributesToGet](../../../../services/dynamodb/latest/developerguide/legacyconditionalparameters-attributestoget.md) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer_
_Guide_.

Type: String to [KeysAndAttributes](api-keysandattributes.md) object map

Map Entries: Maximum number of 100 items.

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: Yes

**[ReturnConsumedCapacity](#API_BatchGetItem_RequestSyntax)**

Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput
consumption that is returned in the response:

- `INDEXES` \- The response includes the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation, together with
`ConsumedCapacity` for each table and secondary index that was
accessed.

Note that some operations, such as `GetItem` and
`BatchGetItem`, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases,
specifying `INDEXES` will only return `ConsumedCapacity`
information for table(s).

- `TOTAL` \- The response includes only the aggregate
`ConsumedCapacity` for the operation.

- `NONE` \- No `ConsumedCapacity` details are included in the
response.

Type: String

Valid Values: `INDEXES | TOTAL | NONE`

Required: No

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[ConsumedCapacity](#API_BatchGetItem_ResponseSyntax)**

The read capacity units consumed by the entire `BatchGetItem`
operation.

Each element consists of:

- `TableName` \- The table that consumed the provisioned
throughput.

- `CapacityUnits` \- The total number of capacity units consumed.

Type: Array of [ConsumedCapacity](api-consumedcapacity.md) objects

**[Responses](#API_BatchGetItem_ResponseSyntax)**

A map of table name or table ARN to a list of items. Each object in
`Responses` consists of a table name or ARN, along with a map of
attribute data consisting of the data type and attribute value.

Type: String to array of string to [AttributeValue](api-attributevalue.md) object maps map

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Key Length Constraints: Maximum length of 65535.

**[UnprocessedKeys](#API_BatchGetItem_ResponseSyntax)**

A map of tables and their respective keys that were not processed with the current
response. The `UnprocessedKeys` value is in the same form as
`RequestItems`, so the value can be provided directly to a subsequent
`BatchGetItem` operation. For more information, see
`RequestItems` in the Request Parameters section.

Each element consists of:

- `Keys` \- An array of primary key attribute values that define
specific items in the table.

- `ProjectionExpression` \- One or more attributes to be retrieved from
the table or index. By default, all attributes are returned. If a requested
attribute is not found, it does not appear in the result.

- `ConsistentRead` \- The consistency of a read operation. If set to
`true`, then a strongly consistent read is used; otherwise, an
eventually consistent read is used.

If there are no unprocessed keys remaining, the response contains an empty
`UnprocessedKeys` map.

Type: String to [KeysAndAttributes](api-keysandattributes.md) object map

Map Entries: Maximum number of 100 items.

Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**InternalServerError**

An error occurred on the server side.

**message**

The server encountered an internal error trying to fulfill the request.
