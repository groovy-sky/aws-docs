# CompleteLayerUpload

Informs Amazon ECR that the image layer upload has completed for a specified registry,
repository name, and upload ID. You can optionally provide a `sha256` digest
of the image layer for data validation purposes.

When an image is pushed, the CompleteLayerUpload API is called once per each new image
layer to verify that the upload has completed.

###### Note

This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used by
customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should use the `docker` CLI to pull, tag, and push images.
