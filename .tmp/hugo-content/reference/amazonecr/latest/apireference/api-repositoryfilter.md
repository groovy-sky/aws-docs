# RepositoryFilter

The filter settings used with image replication. Specifying a repository filter to a
replication rule provides a method for controlling which repositories in a private
registry are replicated. If no filters are added, the contents of all repositories are
replicated.

The repository filter details. When the `PREFIX_MATCH` filter type is
specified, this value is required and should be the repository name prefix to configure
replication for.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 2. Maximum length of 256.

Pattern: `^(?:[a-z0-9]+(?:[._-][a-z0-9]*)*/)*[a-z0-9]*(?:[._-][a-z0-9]*)*$`

**filterType**

The repository filter type. The only supported value is `PREFIX_MATCH`,
which is a repository name prefix specified with the `filter`
