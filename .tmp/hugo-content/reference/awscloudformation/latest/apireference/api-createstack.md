# CreateStack

Creates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the
stack creation starts. You can check the status of the stack through the [DescribeStacks](api-describestacks.md) operation.

For more information about creating a stack and monitoring stack progress, see [Managing AWS\
resources as a single unit with CloudFormation stacks](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacks.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**Capabilities.member.N**

In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain
capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.

- `CAPABILITY_IAM` and `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`

Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your
AWS account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must
explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.

The following IAM resources require you to specify either the
`CAPABILITY_IAM` or `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` capability.

- If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

- If you have IAM resources with custom names, you _must_
specify `CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM`.

- If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an
`InsufficientCapabilities` error.

If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all
permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

- [AWS::IAM::AccessKey](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-accesskey.md)

- [AWS::IAM::Group](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-group.md)

- [AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-instanceprofile.md)

- [AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.md)

- [AWS::IAM::Policy](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-policy.md)

- [AWS::IAM::Role](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-role.md)

- [AWS::IAM::User](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-user.md)

- [AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/templatereference/aws-resource-iam-usertogroupaddition.md)

For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

- `CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can
include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set
from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros
before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros,
and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability.
This includes the [AWS::Include](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/transform-aws-include.md)
and [AWS::Serverless](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/transform-aws-serverless.md) transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros
_and_ nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the
template using this capability.

###### Important

You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if
you know what processing the macro performs.

Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack
templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation
without CloudFormation being notified.

For more information, see [Perform custom processing\
on CloudFormation templates with template macros](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/template-macros.md).

###### Note

Only one of the `Capabilities` and `ResourceType` parameters can
be specified.

Type: Array of strings

Valid Values: `CAPABILITY_IAM | CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM | CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND`

Required: No

**ClientRequestToken**

A unique identifier for this `CreateStack` request. Specify this token if you
plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack
with the same name. You might retry `CreateStack` requests to ensure that
CloudFormation successfully received them.

All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request
token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a
`CreateStack` operation with the token `token1`, then all the
`StackEvents` generated by that operation will have
`ClientRequestToken` set as `token1`.

In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack
operations that are initiated from the console use the token format
_Console-StackOperation-ID_, which helps you easily identify the stack
operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be
assigned the same token in the following format:
`Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**DisableRollback**

Set to `true` to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You
can specify either `DisableRollback` or `OnFailure`, but not
both.

Default: `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**EnableTerminationProtection**

Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack. If a user attempts to
delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains
unchanged. For more information, see [Protect CloudFormation\
stacks from being deleted](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_. Termination
protection is deactivated on stacks by default.

For [nested stacks](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.md),
termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested
stack.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**NotificationARNs.member.N**

The Amazon SNS topic ARNs to publish stack related events. You can find your Amazon SNS topic ARNs
using the Amazon SNS console or your Command Line Interface (CLI).

Type: Array of strings

Array Members: Maximum number of 5 items.

Required: No

**OnFailure**

Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of:
`DO_NOTHING`, `ROLLBACK`, or `DELETE`. You can specify
either `OnFailure` or `DisableRollback`, but not both.

###### Note

Although the default setting is `ROLLBACK`, there is one exception. This
exception occurs when a StackSet attempts to deploy a stack instance and the stack instance
fails to create successfully. In this case, the `CreateStack` call overrides the
default setting and sets the value of `OnFailure` to `DELETE`.

Default: `ROLLBACK`

Type: String

Valid Values: `DO_NOTHING | ROLLBACK | DELETE`

Required: No

**Parameters.member.N**

A list of `Parameter` structures that specify input parameters for the stack.
For more information, see the [Parameter](api-parameter.md) data
type.

Type: Array of [Parameter](api-parameter.md) objects

Required: No

**ResourceTypes.member.N**

Specifies which resource types you can work with, such as `AWS::EC2::Instance`
or `Custom::MyCustomInstance`.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack
creation fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. IAM uses
this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information,
see [Control CloudFormation\
access with AWS Identity and Access Management](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/control-access-with-iam.md).

###### Note

Only one of the `Capabilities` and `ResourceType` parameters can
be specified.

Type: Array of strings

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 256.

Required: No

**RetainExceptOnCreate**

When set to `true`, newly created resources are deleted when the operation
rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with a deletion policy of
`Retain`.

Default: `false`

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**RoleARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes to create the
stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always
uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to
operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to
pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with
the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from
your user credentials.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**RollbackConfiguration**

The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating
operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.

Type: [RollbackConfiguration](api-rollbackconfiguration.md) object

Required: No

**StackName**

The name that's associated with the stack. The name must be unique in the Region in which
you are creating the stack.

###### Note

A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sensitive) and hyphens. It
must start with an alphabetical character and can't be longer than 128 characters.

Required: Yes

**StackPolicyBody**

Structure that contains the stack policy body. For more information, see [Prevent updates to stack resources](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/protect-stack-resources.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.
You can specify either the `StackPolicyBody` or the `StackPolicyURL`
parameter, but not both.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 16384.

Required: No

**StackPolicyURL**

Location of a file that contains the stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (maximum
size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. The location for an Amazon S3
bucket must start with `https://`. URLs from S3 static websites are not
supported.

You can specify either the `StackPolicyBody` or the `StackPolicyURL`
parameter, but not both.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 5120.

Required: No

**Tags.member.N**

Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to the
resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) objects

Array Members: Maximum number of 50 items.

Required: No

**TemplateBody**

Structure that contains the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum
