# ContinueUpdateRollback

Continues rolling back a stack from `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` to
`UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can
manually fix the error and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return
your stack to a working state (the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state) and then try
to update the stack again.

A stack enters the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state when CloudFormation can't roll
back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, this might occur when a stack
attempts to roll back to an old database that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because
CloudFormation doesn't know the instance was deleted, it assumes the instance still exists and
attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

For more information, see [Continue rolling back an update](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_. For
information for troubleshooting a failed update rollback, see [Update rollback failed](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed).

## Request Parameters

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](commonparameters.md).

**ClientRequestToken**

A unique identifier for this `ContinueUpdateRollback` request. Specify this
token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to
continue the rollback to a stack with the same name. You might retry
`ContinueUpdateRollback` requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received
them.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9]*`

Required: No

**ResourcesToSkip.member.N**

A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips during the continue
update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in the
`UPDATE_FAILED` state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that
are in the `UPDATE_FAILED` state for other reasons, for example, because an update
was canceled. To check why a resource update failed, use the [DescribeStackResources](api-describestackresources.md) action, and view the resource status reason.

###### Important

Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that CloudFormation can't successfully
roll back. We recommend that you [troubleshoot](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed) resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets the status of the
specified resources to `UPDATE_COMPLETE` and continues to roll back the stack.
After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with
the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update,
you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't,
subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.

Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For
example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it
might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.

To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format:
`NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID`. If you want to specify the logical ID of a
stack resource ( `Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`) in the
`ResourcesToSkip` list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of
the following states: `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`, `DELETE_COMPLETE`, or
`DELETE_FAILED`.

###### Note

Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the
parent stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with nested stacks, see
[Continue rolling back from failed nested stack updates](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.md#nested-stacks).

Type: Array of strings

Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9]+|[a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+`

Required: No

**RoleARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes to roll back the
stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always
uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to
operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to
pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with
the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from
your user credentials.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 20. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**StackName**

The name or the unique ID of the stack that you want to continue rolling back.

###### Note

Don't specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was created by using the
`AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource). Instead, use this operation on the
parent stack (the stack that contains the `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack`
resource).

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Pattern: `([a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*)|(arn:\b(aws|aws-us-gov|aws-cn)\b:[-a-zA-Z0-9:/._+]*)`

Required: Yes

## Errors

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](commonerrors.md).

**TokenAlreadyExists**

A client request token already exists.

HTTP Status Code: 400
