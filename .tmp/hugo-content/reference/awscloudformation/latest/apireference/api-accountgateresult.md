# AccountGateResult

Structure that contains the results of the account gate function which CloudFormation invokes,
if present, before proceeding with a StackSet operation in an account and Region.

For each account and Region, CloudFormation lets you specify a Lambda function that encapsulates
any requirements that must be met before CloudFormation can proceed with a StackSet operation in that
account and Region. CloudFormation invokes the function each time a StackSet operation is requested
for that account and Region; if the function returns `FAILED`, CloudFormation cancels the
operation in that account and Region, and sets the StackSet operation result status for that
account and Region to `FAILED`.

For more information, see [Prevent failed StackSets\
deployments using target account gates](../../../../services/cloudformation/latest/userguide/stacksets-account-gating.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Contents

**Status**

The status of the account gate function.

- `SUCCEEDED`: The account gate function has determined that the account and
Region passes any requirements for a StackSet operation to occur. CloudFormation proceeds with the
stack operation in that account and Region.

- `FAILED`: The account gate function has determined that the account and Region
doesn't meet the requirements for a StackSet operation to occur. CloudFormation cancels the
StackSet operation in that account and Region, and sets the StackSet operation result status
for that account and Region to `FAILED`.

- `SKIPPED`: CloudFormation has skipped calling the account gate function for this
account and Region, for one of the following reasons:

- An account gate function hasn't been specified for the account and Region. CloudFormation
proceeds with the StackSet operation in this account and Region.

- The `AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole` of the administration account
lacks permissions to invoke the function. CloudFormation proceeds with the StackSet operation in
this account and Region.

- Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the stack. CloudFormation skips
the StackSet operation in this account and Region.
