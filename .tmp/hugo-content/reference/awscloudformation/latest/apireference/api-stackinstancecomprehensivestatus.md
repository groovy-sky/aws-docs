# StackInstanceComprehensiveStatus

The detailed status of the stack instance.

## Contents

**DetailedStatus**

- `CANCELLED`: The operation in the specified account and Region has been
canceled. This is either because a user has stopped the StackSet operation, or because the
failure tolerance of the StackSet operation has been exceeded.

- `FAILED`: The operation in the specified account and Region failed. If the
StackSet operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the
StackSet operation as a whole might be exceeded.

- `FAILED_IMPORT`: The import of the stack instance in the specified account and
Region failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Once the issues causing the failure are
fixed, the import operation can be retried. If enough StackSet operations fail in enough
accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the StackSet operation as a whole might be
exceeded.

- `INOPERABLE`: A `DeleteStackInstances` operation has failed and left
the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from further
`UpdateStackSet` operations. You might need to perform a
`DeleteStackInstances` operation, with `RetainStacks` set to
`true`, to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.

- `PENDING`: The operation in the specified account and Region has yet to
start.

- `RUNNING`: The operation in the specified account and Region is currently in
progress.

- `SKIPPED_SUSPENDED_ACCOUNT`: The operation in the specified account and Region
has been skipped because the account was suspended at the time of the operation.

- `SUCCEEDED`: The operation in the specified account and Region completed
successfully.

Type: String
