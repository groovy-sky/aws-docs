# ManagedExecution

Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and queues
conflicting operations.

## Contents

**Active**

When `true`, CloudFormation performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and
queues conflicting operations. After conflicting operations finish, CloudFormation starts queued
operations in request order.

###### Note

If there are already running or queued operations, CloudFormation queues all incoming
operations even if they are non-conflicting.

You can't modify your StackSet's execution configuration while there are running or queued
operations for that StackSet.

When `false` (default), StackSets performs one operation at a time in request
order.

Type: Boolean

Required: No
