# Monitor and apply a new firmware update for AWS IoT ExpressLink

After you create a firmware update job as described in the previous section, the ExpressLink
module polls for firmware update jobs, receives and validates a job, and enters a state waiting
for the update to be accepted. The host application receives an OTA event that indicates a new
firmware image is available for the ExpressLink module.

1. Use the host terminal application to query the state of the job. Enter the command:

```nohighlight

AT+OTA?
```

You should see the module respond with 'OK 1 `version`'
    to verify that a module OTA firmware update was proposed.

2. To accept the new firmware update, use the host terminal application to issue the
    command:

```nohighlight

AT+OTA ACCEPT
```

3. The ExpressLink module should now start downloading the firmware update from
    the cloud. You can monitor the state of the job using the 'AT+OTA?' command.

When the download is complete and the image signature validation is successful,
    the host terminal application receives an event that indicates the module is ready
    to apply the new image.

4. Direct the module to apply the new image by issuing the command:

```nohighlight

AT+OTA APPLY
```

5. The ExpressLink module now reboots and boots up with the new image. The host
    terminal application receives a 'STARTUP' event indicating the new image is
    booted. To see the event, issue the command:

```nohighlight

AT+EVENT?
```

Note: the event queue is shown in FIFO order, so you may have to issue the
    'AT+EVENT?' command multiple times, depending on how many events are in the queue.

6. Use the host terminal application to direct the module to reconnect to AWS IoT by
    issuing the command:

```nohighlight

AT+CONNECT
```

The ExpressLink module should now connect to AWS IoT, complete the self-test
    and mark the image as valid (preventing any further rollback to the old image).

7. Return to the AWS IoT console and verify that the job status is marked as completed
    and succeeded.
