# 13 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

ExpressLink modules can take advantage of additional (local) connectivity capabilities, optionally
available on selected SoCs. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one prominent example of such
capabilities used to communicate with accessories and other modules or gateways over a
local (personal) area network.

BLE interfaces can be configured by means of _profiles_ which describe a
collection of _attributes_ used to transfer individual pieces of information
between two devices. Devices can assume one of two roles:

1. Central – a BLE device which initiates an outgoing connection request
    to an advertising peripheral device.

2. Peripheral - the BLE device which accepts an incoming connection request
    after advertising its presence and capabilities.

A host processor can access BLE features of a capable ExpressLink module through the
set of commands described in this chapter. Additionally, a set of events is available
to support asynchronous communication with the host (see the BLE specific events in
[Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes](elpg-event-handling.md#elpg-table4)) and the configuration
parameters in the ExpressLink configuration dictionary (see [Table 3 - Configuration dictionary non-persistent keys](elpg-configuration-dictionary.md#elpg-table3)).

**BLE Central Device Configuration**

In particular, BLE devices that adopt a central role require the host to initialize
common configuration using the **BLECentral** parameter, and
one or more **BLECentral#** parameters in order to describe the (peripheral) devices they
wish to connect to. The numerical suffix # is an integer between 1 and MaxBLECentral -
a value dependent on the module capabilities. (Manufacturers of ExpressLink modules
are required to publish the MaxBLECentral value in the module datasheet).

BLECentral configuration parameters use JSON notation and expect the following keys:

- **filterDups** (1/0) – filters duplicate broadcasts
by the same device.

- **address** is specified as:

**"address"**:
{" **type**": _type_, " **BDAddress**":"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"}

Where _type_ is:

- **"Public"**: Public Address (Fixed IEEE MAC address assigned by vendor - default).

- **"Random"**: Static Random Address (Manually configured static/random address).

- **"RPAPublic"**: Public Identity Address (Public address but used with identity resolution).

- **"RPARandom”**: Random Identity Address (Automatically generated random static address with identity resolution).

**BDAddress** is specified only when type is Random or RPARandom.

- **IOCapabilities**:
Specifies I/O Capability of the host, used during pairing (see [13.4 Pairing, Bonding and Filtering](#elpg-pairing-bonding-filtering)).

- Setting "IOCapability":{"display":0,"keyboard": 0,"YesNo": 0} implies Just Works method.

- **customFilters** (JSON object) – additional
vendor-defined filtering options (must be documented by the vendor on the module's
datasheet).

Individual BLECentral# configuration parameters use JSON notation and expect the following keys:

- **peer** mac address of a target peripheral device is specified as:

" **peer**": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"

Where the address type is “Public” by default, or:

" **peer**": _type_, " **BDAddress**":"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"}

Where _type_ is:

- **"Public"**: Public Address (Fixed IEEE MAC address assigned by vendor - default).

- **"Random"**: Static Random Address (Manually configured static/random address).

- **"RPAPublic"**: Public Identity Address (Public address but used with identity resolution).

- **"RPARandom”**: Random Identity Address (Automatically generated random static address with identity resolution).

###### Note

If the peer address was found using AT+BLE GET DISCOVER (see [13.2.2 BLE GET DISCOVER   »Retrieve the collected advertising information«](#elpg-ble-get-discover-command)), the address
type should match the type reported as the last response item..

- **customFilters** (JSON object) – additional
vendor-defined filtering options (must be documented by the vendor on the module's
datasheet).

**BLE Peripheral Device Configuration**

BLE devices adopting a peripheral role require the host to initialize the BLEPeripheral
(single) configuration parameter in order to describe the device's connection requirements.
BLEPeripheral configuration parameters use JSON notation and expect the following keys:

- **mode**: Indicates advertising mode. Possible values are:

- " **LEGACY**": refers to BLE specifications before 5.0. (default).

- " **EXTENDED**": refers to the extended advertising as define in BLE specification 5.0 and later.

- **IOCapability**:
Specifies I/O Capability of the peripheral, used during pairing (see [13.4 Pairing, Bonding and Filtering](#elpg-pairing-bonding-filtering)), possible values are:

- " **display**": 0/1 the device can interact with a user via a display (default 0)

- " **keyboard**": 0/1 the device can interact with the user via a keyboard to enter numerical values (default 0)

- " **YesNo**": 0/1 the device has buttons for the user to accept or reject a connection (default 0)

###### Note

"IOCapability": {"display":0,"keyboard": 0,"YesNo": 0} implies “Just Works” pairing method.

- **filterPolicy**:
Used to apply a filter policy using the following keys:

- " **ALLOW\_LIST\_SCAN**": to grant scan requests to devices in the AllowList.

- " **ALLOW\_LIST\_CONNECT**": to grant connection requests to devices in the AllowList.

- **address**: is specified as:

**"address"**:
{" **type**": _type_, " **BDAddress**":"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"}

Where _type_ is:

- **"Public"**: Public Address (Fixed IEEE MAC address assigned by vendor - default).

- **"Random"**: Static Random Address (Manually configured static/random address).

- **"RPAPublic"**: Public Identity Address (Public address but used with identity resolution).

- **"RPARandom”**: Random Identity Address (Automatically generated random static address with identity resolution).

**BDAddress** is specified only when type is Random or RPARandom.

###### Note

While it is possible to cancel an ongoing advertisement,
by editing the advertisement configuration filterPolicy and re-advertising,
it is not possible to do the same with the address type.
For address type changes to take effect, you need to AT+RESET the device.

- **raw** is used to assign pre-encoded complete (hex) strings
for the advertisement and response.
(The raw data is expected as per the BLE link layer specification.
It is directly sent in the same form over the air without any further processing.
Thus, certain multi-octet fields need to be reversed.
Please refer to the Bluetooth Core Specification: Vol 6, Part B, § 1.2 “Bit ordering”
and Vol 1, Part E, § 2.9 “Type Names”).

- **appearance** (string) – a 4 digit hex number that
represents the type of device. (See page 28 of the
[Bluetooth \
Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers)).

Example 1

```bash

AT+CONF BLEPeripheral={"mode": "LEGACY",
    "IOCapability":{"display":0,"keyboard":0,"YesNo": 0},
    "filterPolicy": {"ALLOW_LIST_SCAN":0,"ALLOW_LIST_CONNECT": 0},
    "raw":{"advertisement":"02010603030F18",
        "response":"0C09457870726573734C696E6B"},
     "address":{"type":"RPARandom"}
}
```

###### Note

Basic parsing of the JSON string happens when the CONF command is executed,
hence formatting errors (ERR 4 – PARAMETER ERROR) can be immediately reported.
Configuration keys/values are validated only at connection time,
when a BLE peripheral initialization is attempted, and may cause it to fail
(ERR27 – BLE ERROR or ERR28 – CONFIGURATION ERROR).

**BLE Characteristics Configuration**

Both Central and Peripheral devices require the host to initialize one or more BLEGATT#
parameters in order to describe individual characteristics they wish to publish or access.
The numerical suffix # is an integer between 1 and MaxBLEGATT - a value dependent on the
module's capabilities. (Manufacturers of ExpressLink modules are required to publish the
MaxBLEGATT value in the module datasheet).

BLEGATT# configuration parameters use JSON notation and expect the following keys:

- **service** (UUID string) – the UUID of a BLE
service.

- **chr** (UUID string) – the UUID of a BLE
characteristic.

- **write** (permission bitmask in decimal) – optional

- **read** (permission bitmask in decimal) – optional

- **indicate** (permission bitmask in decimal) – optional

- **notify** (permission bitmask in decimal) – optional

**UUID strings** can be in short form 4 hex-digits (for
example, "20AD") for short 16-bit services and characteristics, or long form 128-bit for
custom service and characteristic identifiers (for example, "00000000-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB").
Long form UUID separators ("-") can be omitted. The default value for optional keys is 0.
The maximum size of a characteristic value is MaxBLECharLen bytes, where _MaxBLECharLen_
is a value (>=31) defined by the vendor and documented in the module datasheet.

Example 2: Two services composed of one characteristic each

```nohighlight

AT+CONF BLEGATT1={"service": "1809", "chr": "2A1C" }
    # Thermometer service, Temperature characteristic.

AT+CONF BLEGATT2={"service": "180F", "chr": "2A19" }
    # Battery Level service and level(%) characteristic.
```

Since BLEGATT# configuration parameters describe only one characteristic each, multiple
parameters are required to describe a complex service composed of a number of
characteristics.

Example 3: A service composed of two characteristics.

```nohighlight

AT+CONF BLEGATT1={"service": "180D", "chr": "2A37" }
    # Heart rate service, heart rate measurement characteristic.

AT+CONF BLEGATT2={"service": "180D", "chr": "2A38" }
    # Heart rate service, body sensor location characteristic
```

_Permission bitmasks_ are defined as decimal values computed as follows:

Permission

0

On / Enabled

1

Encrypt

2

Authenticate

3

Authorize

4

Write-Without-Response

5 and higher

Reserved (must be 0)

Details:

- **Encrypted**: If set, the link will be required to be encrypted.

- **Athenticate**:
If set, implies that Man-In-the-Middle (MITM) protection must be enabled.
If the _Just Works_ pairing method is used,
any attempt to use a characteristic that sets this flag
will be rejected since this pairing method does not provide MITM protection.

- **Authorize**:
If set, will generate an Authorize event (see [Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes](elpg-event-handling.md#elpg-table4) \- ExpressLink event codes).
The host is required to approve or deny access to the characteristic (see [13.3.6 BLE AUTH\[#\] \[0/1\]   »Authorize access to a characteristic«](#elpg-ble-auth-command))

- **Write-Without-Response**:
(this applies only to the write property) If set,
a write command will not generate a response (shortening the transaction).

When a module is acting as a Central, if the Peripheral on the other side has both
Write and Write-Without- Response flag set on a characteristic,
the module acting as BLE Central will carry out the full 'write' operation,
overriding the 'write-without-response' option.
Only if the peripheral has exclusively set the Write-Without-Response flag, a
'write-without-response' operation is carried out.

**BLE Descriptors Configuration**

BLE descriptors are attributes that provide additional information about a BLE characteristic,
helping to describe its value and how it should be used.
They essentially act as metadata for characteristics,
offering details about their format, meaning, and how they can be interacted with.
BLE descriptors can be configured using the same BLEGATT# configuration
dictionary entries used for normal characteristics but with the following distinctions:

- A **desc** key is added to
provide the descriptor’s uuid-string

- No **notify, indicate** or
**write-without-response** (permission bitmask) are allowed

**Example**:
Define the Environmental Sensing Service (0x181A) with Temperature characteristic (0x2F6A),
and Presentation Format Descriptor (0x2904). Then assign a value like below to the descriptor:

- Flags: sint16 (0x00 0x00)

- Sampling Function: uint8 (0x02) Arithmetic Mean

- Measurement Period: uint24 (0x000096) -> Little endian (0x96 0x00 0x00) = 150s

- Update Interval: uint24(0x000384) -> (0x84 0x03, 0x00) = 900s

- Application: uint8(0x04) = soil

- Measurement Uncertainty: uint8(0xFF) = Unknown uncertainty

```bash

AT+CONF BLEGATT1={"service":"181A", "chr":"2A6E", "read":"1"}
AT+CONF BLEGATT2={"service":"181A", "chr":"2A6E", "desc":"290C", "read":"1"}
AT+BLE SET1 6009Big endian: 0x0960, Actual: 2400 in C/100 = 24 C)
AT+BLE SET2 00000296000084030004FF
```

## Complete Peripheral Configuration Examples

###### Example

**Example 1:**

1\. Configure BLE in Peripheral mode:

```bash

AT+CONF BLEPeripheral={
 "mode": "LEGACY",
 "IOCapability":{"display":0,"keyboard":0,"YesNo": 0},
 "filterPolicy":{"ALLOW_LIST_SCAN":0,"ALLOW_LIST_CONNECT":0},
 "raw":{"advertisement":"02010603030F18","response":"0C09457870726573734C696E6B"},
 "address":{"type":"RPARandom"}
}
```

Where:

- **"mode": "LEGACY"** implies legacy advertisement mode (before BLE spec 5.0).

- **"IOCapability":{"display":0,"keyboard": 0,"YesNo": 0}** the host has no special I/O
capability but can perform "Just Works" pairing.

- **"filterPolicy": {"ALLOW\_LIST\_SCAN":0,"ALLOW\_LIST\_CONNECT": 0}** allow both scan and
connection requests from anyone

- **"raw"** allows full configurability of the advertisement and response data.

- **"address":{"type":"RPARandom"}** Random Identity Address (automatically generated random
static address) with identity resolution.

2\. Define service 180D, characteristic 2A37:

```bash

AT+CONF BLEGATT1={"service":"180D", "chr":"2A37", "write":18, "read":3}
```

The write bitmask (18) enables write operations but allows only write-without-response operations. The read bitmask (3) enables
read operations but requires an encrypted link.

3\. Define service 180D, characteristic 2A38:

```bash

AT+CONF BLEGATT2={"service":"180D", "chr":"2A38", "write":3, "read":1,"indicate":1, "notify":1}
```

The write bitmask (3) enables write (with response) operations but requires an encrypted link. The read bitmask (1) enables read
operations and does not require an encrypted link. The indicate bitmask (1) enables indicate operations and does not require an
encrypted link. The notify bitmask (1) enables notify operations and does not require an encrypted link.

4\. Initialize the peripheral:

```bash

AT+BLE INIT PERIPHERAL
```

5\. Advertise the peripheral:

```bash

AT+BLE ADVERTISE
```

After successful connection, you receive the event: **40 0 BLE CONNECTED**. Any Central device (for
example, smartphone) can now see the device and connect to it.

###### Example

**Example 2:** Configuring a device as peripheral and retrieve its BDAddress.

1\. Configure the device as a peripheral with automatically assigned address and identity resolution:

```bash

AT+CONF BLEPeripheral = {"address": {"type":"RPARandom"}}
OK
```

2\. Configure characteristics and descriptors:

```bash

AT+CONF BLEGATT1={"service":"180D", "chr":"2A37", "write":1, "read":1, "indicate":1}
OK
AT+CONF BLEGATT2={"service":"180D", "chr":"FFF1", "write":1, "read":1, "notify":1}
OK
AT+CONF BLEGATT3={"service":"180D", "desc":"FFF2", "write":1, "read":1}
OK
```

3\. Initialize the peripheral:

```bash

AT+BLE INIT PERIPHERAL
OK
```

4\. Retrieve the automatically assigned address:

```bash

AT+CONF? BLEPeripheral
OK
{"mode":"LEGACY", "address": {"type":"RPARandom","BDAddress":"FD:15:18:24:FC:6D"}}
```

## 13.1 BLE initialization

### 13.1.1 BLE INIT _\[_ CENTRAL\|PERIPHERAL _\]_   »Initializing the device role«

Initialize the BLE interface to operate in the selected (GAP) role. Note how this
version of the ExpressLink specification allows a device to be configured as Central
or Peripheral but not both. Once a BLE interface is initialized, the only way to
terminate it or change its mode of operation is to use the RESET command. However,
doing so will disconnect the device (if it is connected) and will reset all internal
state. Non-persistent configuration parameters (see [Table 3 - Configuration dictionary non-persistent keys](elpg-configuration-dictionary.md#elpg-table3)) will be reinitialized, all subscriptions will be
terminated, and the message queues will also be emptied.

_For Central Mode:_

Issuing the INIT CENTRAL command does not require (yet) any of the BLE configuration
parameters to be set. One or more BLECentral# and BLEGATT# configuration parameters
will be required later, before issuing an actual connection request (see the
[BLE CONNECT command](#elpg-ble-connect-command)). BLECentral# and
BLEGATT# parameters are used in central mode to act as filters to identify suitable
connection target devices.

_For Peripheral Mode:_

Issuing the INIT PERIPHERAL command requires the BLEPeripheral and one (or more)
BLEGATT# configuration parameters to be set. BLEGATT keys do not need to be set in
numerical order. All BLE parameters found (initialized) in the configuration dictionary
will be used to define the peripheral’s GATT service. After initialization, the host
may not change the BLEGATT# service composition (characteristics) without first resetting
the device. The host can instead update or retrieve the latest characteristic values
using the appropriate SET/GET commands (see [BLE SET](#elpg-ble-set-command)
and [BLE GET](#elpg-ble-get-command) commands).

###### Returns:

`13.1.1.1` `OK{EOL}`

If the command was accepted and the requested central or peripheral role is set.

`13.1.1.2` `ERR4 PARAMETER ERROR{EOL}`

If the role parameter was not CENTRAL or PERIPHERAL.

`13.1.1.3` `ERR28 CONFIGURATION ERROR{EOL}`

If the peripheral role was selected and the configuration dictionary
does not contain the BLEPeripheral and at least one BLEGATT# parameter.

`13.1.1.4` `ERR25 NOT ALLOWED{EOL}`

If the BLE role was already initialized.

`13.1.1.5` `ERR27 BLE ERROR{EOL}`

Failed to initialize the BLE Stack.

`13.1.1.6`

filterDups is 0 by default.

Example 1:

```nohighlight

AT+BLE INIT CENTRAL{EOL}
OK
AT+CONF BLECENTRAL1={"peer": "a4:c1:38:12:56:5d"}{EOL}
OK
```

Example 2:

```nohighlight

AT+CONF BLEPeripheral={"appearance": "4142"}{EOL}
OK
AT+CONF BLEGATT2={"service": "1809" ,"chr": "2A1C" }{EOL}
OK
AT+BLE INIT PERIPHERAL{EOL}
OK
```

## 13.2 BLE CENTRAL role commands

### 13.2.1 BLE _\[\#\]_ DISCOVER _\[duration\|_ CANCEL _\]_   »Scanning and Advertisement«

BLE capable devices can communicate with accessories without establishing permanent
connections by means of a scanning and advertising protocol. This protocol is commonly
used for characteristics whose value is required infrequently (device battery level,
or ambient temperature sensors).

![Figure 7 - BLE scanning for devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/iot-expresslink/latest/programmersguide/images/ble-scanning-for-devices.png)

Figure 7 - BLE scanning for devices

The ExpressLink module scans for advertisements from peripherals that match criteria
defined in the corresponding configuration string BLECentral#. This is an asynchronous
command. It returns an immediate response to confirm the process has started (or an
error prevented it). During the scanning time, any advertised data received will be
queued. The scanning process will stop after a set amount of time optionally configured
by the duration parameter (30 seconds by default), and a BLE DISCOVER COMPLETE event
(see [Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes](elpg-event-handling.md#elpg-table4)) will be produced.
Queued data can then be retrieved using the [BLE GET DISCOVER](#elpg-ble-get-discover-command) command.

The CANCEL parameter is used to terminate an ongoing scanning process.

`13.2.1.1`   Scans for all the nearby devices if
BLECentral# is set to {} (an empty JSON object).

`13.2.1.2`   If the command is issued while a
scanning process is in progress, any queued data is discarded and a new scanning
process is started.

`13.2.1.3`   If _{duration}_
is provided, only devices found within _{duration}_ seconds
will be captured.

`13.2.1.4`   Enqueues a BLE DISCOVER COMPLETE
event on successful Discover complete or cancellation (see [Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes](elpg-event-handling.md#elpg-table4)).

`13.2.1.5`   Enqueues a BLE DISCOVER ERROR event
when the discovery fails for any reason. Hint codes can be defined by the vendor to
provide additional insight on the reason for the failure. (Hint codes must be documented
in the module datasheet).

###### Returns:

`13.2.1.6` `OK{EOL}`

If the command was accepted and the scanning sequence started.

`13.2.1.7` `OK{EOL}`

If the CANCEL parameter is given and the cancellation request was
successfully submitted. CANCEL will terminate any scanning activity in
progress regardless of the # index given. However, a suffix index is
required for the command to execute.

`13.2.1.8` `ERR4 PARAMETER ERROR{EOL}`

If the parameter is 0 seconds.

`13.2.1.9` `ERR4 PARAMETER ERROR{EOL}`

If the numerical suffix # is omitted.

`13.2.1.10` `ERR7 OUT OF RANGE{EOL}`

If the numerical suffix # is out of bounds (0 or greater than MaxBLECentral).

`13.2.1.11` `ERR8 PARAMETER UNDEFINED{EOL}`

If the numerical suffix # points to an empty BLECentral# string.

`13.2.1.12` `ERR25 NOT ALLOWED{EOL}`

If Central role is not initialized or if the message queue is full.

Example 1 - Scan for any advertising device in range for a default timeout of 30
seconds:

```nohighlight

AT+BLE DISCOVER{EOL}

   ...a BLE DISCOVER COMPLETE event occurs (see Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes)...

AT+EVENT?{EOL}				# check the event queue
OK 31 0 DISCOVER COMPLETE{EOL}		# a BLE DISCOVER event was received
```

Example 2 - Scan for a specific peripheral UUID and timeout after 20 seconds:

```nohighlight

AT+CONF BLECentral1={ "peer": "a4:c1:38:12:56:5d", "filterDups": 1}{EOL}

AT+BLE1 DISCOVER 20{EOL}

   ...20 seconds later a BLE DISCOVER COMPLETE event occurs (see Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes...
```

Example 3 - Discover until cancelled:

```nohighlight

AT+BLE DISCOVER{EOL}
OK

   ...a few seconds later...

AT+BLE DISCOVER CANCEL{EOL}
OK

   ...a BLE DISCOVER COMPLETE event occurs (see Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes...
```

### 13.2.2 BLE GET DISCOVER   »Retrieve the collected advertising information«

Retrieve the advertising information collected during the last discovery process.

Advertising information is stored in memory shared with MQTT messages. Collected
information is also cleared when a new discovery is started. Hence, GET DISCOVER
only fetches information for the devices that match the filter defined when the last
DISCOVER command was issued.

###### Returns:

`13.2.2.1` `OK{EOL}`

No new advertising information was collected.

`13.2.2.2` `OK {collected information}{EOL}`

Discovered information was collected and is presented following the 'OK'.

`13.2.2.3` `ERR25 NOT ALLOWED{EOL}`

If the BLE Central role is not initialized.

Collected information is fetched from the queue and returned as a record containing
the following space-separated fields:

```nohighlight

<peer> <connectable> <Scannable> <rssi> <advertisedData> <type>{EOL}
mac address    0/1          0/1       int     hex string   string
```

Example 1 - Check the BLE receive queue for any advertising data received,
returning two records:

```nohighlight

AT+BLE GET DISCOVER{EOL}
OK 3a:1a:f7:e4:11:38 0 1 -30 02011A0BFF4C00090603420A3F588B Public{EOL}
```

Example 2 - Repeat the GET DISCOVER request until the message queue is empty:

```nohighlight

AT+BLE GET DISCOVER{EOL}
OK{EOL}
```

### 13.2.3 BLE _\[\#\]_ CONNECT   »Connect to a peripheral«

In some use cases, instead of just reading sensor data provided in the advertisement
message, the host may want to inspect what type of services and characteristics a
peripheral exposes. To do this, the ExpressLink module must first establish a direct
connection to the BLE peripheral device (using the BLE GAP protocol).

![Figure 8 - Connecting to a BLE device](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/iot-expresslink/latest/programmersguide/images/connecting-to-ble-device.png)

Figure 8 - Connecting to a BLE device

When you use the BLE{#} CONNECT command, the ExpressLink module attempts to connect
to a peripheral based on a specific configuration defined int the BLECentral# parameter.

###### Returns:

`13.2.3.1` `OK{EOL}`

If the command was accepted and the connection request was successful.

`13.2.3.2` `ERR7 OUT OF RANGE{EOL}`

The numerical suffix is out of bounds (0 or greater than MaxBLECentral index).

`13.2.3.3` `ERR28 CONFIGURATION ERROR{EOL}`

The numerical suffix points to a {}, or is missing the "peer" key.

`13.2.3.4` `ERR8 PARAMETER UNDEFINED{EOL}`

The numerical suffix points to an empty BLECentral# string or {}.

`13.2.3.5` `ERR25 NOT ALLOWED{EOL}`

If already connected to a device.

`13.2.3.6` `ERR25 NOT ALLOWED{EOL}`

If BLE INIT is not set to CENTRAL mode.

`13.2.3.7` `ERR14 UNABLE TO CONNECT{EOL}`

Discovery attempted for 30 seconds before timing out and returning
error.

Example 1 - Connect to a specific peripheral according to the configuration. The
attempt will stop if the timeout of 30 seconds is reached. The configuration
information included in this example is for demonstration purposes only:

```nohighlight

AT+CONF BLECENTRAL1={"peer": "a4:c1:38:12:56:5d", "filterDups": 1 }{EOL}
OK{EOL}
AT+BLE INIT CENTRAL{EOL}
OK{EOL}
AT+BLE1 CONNECT{EOL}
OK{EOL}

   ...a BLE CONNECTED event occurs...
```

Example 2 - Connect to a second peripheral according to the configuration. The
attempt will stop if the timeout of 30 seconds is reached. The configuration
information included in this example is for demonstration purposes only:

```nohighlight

AT+CONF BLECENTRAL2={"peer": "a4:c1:38:12:56:5d", "filterDups":1}{EOL}
OK{EOL}
AT+BLE2 CONNECT{EOL}
OK{EOL}

   ...a BLE CONNECTED event occurs...
```

### 13.2.4 BLE _\[\#\]_ CONNECT?   »Connection status query«

This query command allows the host device to check if the status of the specified
connection is still active. This command can also be used to confirm a successful
connection after the AT+CONNECT command. Note that if the numerical suffix is not
specified then the Peripheral command [13.3.1 BLE CONNECT?   »Connection status query«](#elpg-ble-connectq-command) is invoked.

###### Returns:

`13.2.4.1` `OK 1 CONNECTED{EOL}`

When connected to a Peripheral.

`13.2.4.2` `OK 0 DISCONNECTED{EOL}`

When disconnected from a Peripheral.

## 13.4 Pairing, Bonding and Filtering

### 13.4.1 AT+BLE PAIR   »Initiate pairing as peripheral«

Pairing can be initiated from either end, peripheral and/or central. This command initiates
the pairing from the ExpressLink device when configured in Peripheral mode. Successful connection
with the central is a pre-requisite. This adds the device to the module's Bond list, i.e. bonding
(saving the BLE pairing information) happens automatically after pairing. Setting the correct
peripheral advertising configuration before issuing a BLE INIT PERIPHERAL command, is essential.
(See BLEPeripheral configuration in Paragraph 13 introduction).

###### Returns:

`13.4.1.1` `OK{EOL}`

Pairing was successful, the central device was added to the Bond list.

`13.4.1.2` `ERR6 NO CONNECTION{EOL}`

`13.4.1.3` `ERR27 BLE ERROR{EOL}`

Pairing failed, device could not be paired.

### 13.4.2 AT+BLE _\[\#\]_ PAIR   »Initiate pairing as central«

Pairing can be initiated from either end, peripheral and/or central. This command initiates
the pairing from the ExpressLink device when configured in Central mode. Successful connection
with a peripheral device identified by the numerical parameter (#) is a pre-requisite. This adds
the device to the module's Bond list, i.e. bonding (saving the BLE pairing information) happens
automatically after pairing.

Pairing is a process that can require several steps optionally including user input over a long
period of time. Once initiated using the AT+PAIR{#} commands, it continues asynchronously. The host
is notified of progress via the BLE PAIR event (see [Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes](elpg-event-handling.md#elpg-table4)). The pairing process is aborted if no
response is received within 30 seconds. A BLE PAIR event with a PAIR\_FAIL code followed by a BLE
DISCONNECT event will be generated.

###### Returns:

`13.4.2.1` `OK{EOL}`

Pairing was successful, the peripheral device was added to the Allow list and Bond list.

###### Note

The state of the BLE Allow and Bond lists can be queried at any time using the AT CONF? command,
and respectively the **>BLEBondList** and **BLEAllowList** configuration parameters.

#### Querying BLE Lists

You can query the state of the BLE Allow and Bond lists at any time using the AT CONF? command and the BLEBondList and BLEAllowList configuration parameters.

Example 1 - Query Bond List:

```nohighlight

AT+CONF? BLEBondList{EOL}

Returns:
OK [{"type":"Public","address":"CC:F9:F0:54:11:3F"}, {"type":"Public","address":"06:05:04:03:02:01"}]{EOL}
# The BLEBondList contains two Public items.

OK []{EOL}
# The BLEBondList is empty.

ERR25 NOT ALLOWED{EOL}
# The BLE functionality has not been initialized.
```

Example 2 - Query Allow List:

```nohighlight

AT+CONF? BLEAllowList{EOL}

Returns:
OK [{"type":"Public","address":"CC:F9:F0:54:11:3F"}, {"type":"Public","address":"06:05:04:03:02:01"}]{EOL}
# The BLEAllowList contains two public items.

OK []{EOL}
# The BLEAllowList is empty.

ERR25 NOT ALLOWED{EOL}
# The BLE functionality has not been initialized.
```
