# 10 AWS IoT Services

## 10.1 AWS IoT Device Defender

_(Support for this feature is required and tested for as of v1.1.1.)_

ExpressLink devices support the [AWS IoT Device \
Defender](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender.html) service. They can publish a basic set of metrics to AWS IoT Core at
a configurable interval, including the table below:

Table 7 - ExpressLink Defender metrics

ExpressLink Custom Metric

Type

Description

Bytes Out

Count

Number of bytes sent since last update.

Messages sent

Count

Number of messages sent since last update.

Messages received

Count

Number of messages received since last update.

Hard Reset Event

Flag

Set to 1 if a hardware reset occurred since last update.

Reconnect Events

Flag

Set to 1 if a reconnect occurred since last update.

Flash Memory Writes

Count

Number of writes to flash memory since last update.

<Module-Name Prefix> Custom Metric(s)

One or more manufacturer/module specific custom metrics...

All ExpressLink custom metrics are volatile in nature, as their values are reset
to 0 after each periodic update (or set to 1 upon a device reset/reboot for the
corresponding events).

The device defender feature is activated by setting the _DefenderPeriod_
configuration parameter (see [Table 2 - Configuration Dictionary Persistent Keys](elpg-configuration-dictionary.md#elpg-table2))
to a value greater than 0 in the configuration dictionary (using the AT+CONF command).

The _DefenderPeriod_ configuration parameter value indicates the
_number of seconds_ between successive updates of the Device Defender
metrics. The maximum period value is an implementation detail that must be documented by
the module manufacturer in the device data sheet. Note that the Device Defender service
may choose to throttle down (reject) metric updates if they are too frequent.

The latest metrics collected are sent to the Device Defender service as soon as the
device connects and at each successive interval. The internal timer continues counting
even when the device is disconnected. The internal timer is reset when the Device Defender
feature is turned off (when the _DefenderPeriod_ configuration parameter
is set to 0).

The _DefenderPeriod_ parameter is non-volatile, so an ExpressLink
device automatically resumes sending Device Defender metrics after a reset (using a RESET
command, power cycle or the RST pin).

Module manufacturers can offer additional custom metrics specific to their model.
They must prefix the metric with the distinctive **Model**
name and document the feature in the device datasheet. (See the "About" Configuration
parameter in [Table 2 - Configuration Dictionary Persistent Keys](elpg-configuration-dictionary.md#elpg-table2).

###### Note

Access to the AWS IoT Device Defender service is available only when the device
is in the _onboarded_ state (see
[21.3.2 ExpressLink onboarding states and transitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink/latest/programmersguide/elpg-provisioning.html#elpg-provisioning-onboarding-states)) and the customer/OEM AWS IoT account
is properly configured.

Examples:

```nohighlight

AT+CONF DefenderPeriod=0     # Device Defender metrics are disabled
                             # NOTE: this is the initialized value after a factory reset (see Table 2 - Configuration Dictionary Persistent Keys

AT+CONF DefenderPeriod=60    # Device Defender metrics are updated every minute

AT+CONF DefenderPeriod=3600  # Device Defender metrics are updated every hour
```

## 10.2 AWS IoT Device Shadow

SHADOW commands are provided to facilitate use of the [AWS IoT Device \
Shadow service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html). Set the **EnableShadow** configuration
parameter to 1 to enable support for these commands. (See [Table 3 - Configuration dictionary non-persistent keys](elpg-configuration-dictionary.md#elpg-table3).) To provide Shadow support, a module automatically handles
subscriptions to the various Device Shadow MQTT topics, and parses and reports
the responses provided by the service to the device in the form of SHADOW events.

###### Note

Access to the AWS IoT Device Shadow service is allowed only when the module
is in the _onboarded_ state (see
[21.3.2 ExpressLink onboarding states and transitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink/latest/programmersguide/elpg-provisioning.html#elpg-provisioning-onboarding-states)), that is, when the module is
connected to the customer's AWS account.

The SHADOW INIT# command manages subscriptions to Shadow topics. It must be invoked,
and its actions completed, before you invoke any of the other SHADOW commands.

As the interaction with the Device Shadow service often requires a long
messaging round trip, the module implements an asynchronous API to avoid blocking
the host. SHADOW commands generate requests to the Device Shadow service and return
immediately, while SHADOW GET commands can be used later to poll, and eventually
retrieve, the responses of the service.

`10.2.1.1`

Each ExpressLink manufacturer can choose
to simultaneously support a maximum number of named shadow documents
( **MaxShadow** ≥ 1). The chosen MaxShadow value will be
documented in the manufacturer's module datasheet.

The corresponding list of non-persistent parameters,
**Shadow1 .. Shadow** _{MaxShadow}_,
will be pre-populated in the Configuration Dictionary and initialized to empty strings.
(See [Table 3 - Configuration dictionary non-persistent keys](elpg-configuration-dictionary.md#elpg-table3).)

Device Shadow support requires a continuous connection with the AWS IoT Core Service.
Such a connection must be established before any SHADOW commands are issued and must
be maintained uninterrupted until the completion of any of the requests. If the
connection is lost at any point, the host has responsibility to re-initialize the
SHADOW interface, re-issue any interrupted commands and, eventually, re-subscribe to
shadows for which delta update notifications are expected.

`10.2.1.2`

All SHADOW commands use a
_client-token_ defined by the non-volatile configuration parameter
_ShadowToken_ (factory default: "ExpressLink") to identify and
manage requests and responses received on the relevant Device Shadow service topics.
Any notifications received that do not match the client-token used in the request,
and not generated by the SHADOW commands, are discarded.

`10.2.1.3`

If the _ShadowToken_
configuration parameter is set to an empty string, ANY subsequent notifications
received from the Shadow service will NOT be managed by the module but will be added
to the messaging queue for the host to handle with the GET0 command (see
[5.1.5 GET0   »Request next message pending on an unassigned topic«](elpg-messaging.md#elpg-get0-command)).

### 10.2.2 SHADOW _\[\#\]_ INIT   »Initialize communication with the Device Shadow service«

Initialize the Device Shadow service communication interface for the specified
shadow. This subscribes to various topics that are managed by other SHADOW commands
such as SHADOW DOC, SHADOW UPDATE and SHADOW DELETE. Note that subscriptions to
Shadow Deltas are controlled separately by the
[SHADOW SUBSCRIBE](#elpg-shadow-subscribe-command) and
[SHADOW UNSUBSCRIBE](#elpg-shadow-unsubscribe-command)
commands.

`10.2.2.1`   When the INIT process is completed
successfully, a SHADOW INIT event is generated (see [Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes](elpg-event-handling.md#elpg-table4)) and further SHADOW commands can be issued.

`10.2.2.2`   If the numerical shadow parameter
( _\[#\]_) is not provided, the Unnamed Shadow interface is initialized.

`10.2.2.3`   Otherwise, the corresponding Shadow#
entry in the Configuration Dictionary is used to specify one of the object's
Named Shadows.

`10.2.2.4`   If a Shadow# entry is modified (AT+CONF)
before the corresponding SHADOW# INIT process is completed, the initialization is
aborted and no Shadow INIT event will be generated.

###### Returns:

`10.2.2.5` `OK`

The Device Shadow service initialization process has started.

`10.2.2.6` `ERR7 OUT OF RANGE`

The specified shadow ( _\[#\]_) exceeds the maximum
number of shadows supported by this module.

### 10.2.13 SHADOW EVENTS

When subscribing to shadow document messages, retrieving a shadow document, or
requesting updates, the module communicates with the Device Shadow service using
various MQTT topics. When it receives a response to a request or a shadow Delta
update to which it has subscribed, the module reports this to the host
_asynchronously_ by generating a Shadow event (see
[Table 4 - ExpressLink event codes](elpg-event-handling.md#elpg-table4)). Each Shadow event
carries the _Shadow-Index_ parameter:

- **0**  indicates the unnamed
Shadow

- **1..MaxShadow**  indicates
the corresponding Shadow# entry in the configuration table

Example 1:

```nohighlight

AT+EVENT?{EOL}                # Query events pending.
OK 24 1{EOL}                  # A SHADOW DELTA event was received for the Shadow1.
AT+SHADOW1 GET DELTA{EOL}     # Fetch the delta message.
OK {delta document}{EOL}      # Returns the delta document received.
```

Example 2:

```nohighlight

AT+SHADOW SUBSCRIBE{EOL}      # Request a subscription to DELTA updates for the unnamed Shadow
OK{EOL}                       # Request sent successfully.

 ...later...
