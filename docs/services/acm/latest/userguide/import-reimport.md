# Reimport a certificate

If you imported a certificate and associated it with other AWS services, you can
reimport that certificate before it expires while preserving the AWS service
associations of the original certificate. For more information about AWS services
integrated with ACM, see [Services integrated with ACM](acm-services.md).

The following conditions apply when you reimport a certificate:

- You can add or remove domain names.

- You cannot remove all of the domain names from a certificate.

- If **Key Usage** extensions are present in the
originally imported certificate, you can add new extension values, but you
cannot remove existing values.

- If **Extended Key Usage** extensions are present
in the originally imported certificate, you can add new extension values, but
you cannot remove existing values.

**Exception:** You can remove the Client
Authentication Extended Key Usage. This accommodates industry changes where
certificate authorities no longer issue certificates with ClientAuth EKU to
comply with Chrome's root program requirements.

###### Important

If you require Client Authentication functionality, you must implement
additional validations on your side, as ACM does not support rollback to
previously imported certificates.

- The key type and size cannot be changed.

- You cannot apply resource tags when reimporting a certificate.

## Reimport (console)

The following example shows how to reimport a certificate using the
AWS Management Console.

1. Open the ACM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home).

2. Select or expand the certificate to reimport.

3. Open the details pane of the certificate and choose the **Reimport**
**certificate** button. If you selected the certificate by
    checking the box beside its name, choose **Reimport**
**certificate** on the **Actions** menu.

4. For **Certificate body**, paste the PEM-encoded
    end-entity certificate.

5. For **Certificate private key**, paste the unencrypted
    PEM-encoded private key associated with the certificate's public key.

6. (Optional) For **Certificate chain**, paste the
    PEM-encoded certificate chain. The certificate chain includes one or more
    certificates for all intermediate issuing certification authorities, and the
    root certificate. If the certificate to be imported is self-assigned, no
    certificate chain is necessary.

7. Review the information about your certificate. If there are no errors,
    choose **Reimport**.

## Reimport (AWS CLI)

The following example shows how to reimport a certificate using the [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli). The example assumes the
following:

- The PEM-encoded certificate is stored in a file named
`Certificate.pem`.

- The PEM-encoded certificate chain is stored in a file named
`CertificateChain.pem`.

- (Private certificates only) The PEM-encoded, unencrypted private key is
stored in a file named `PrivateKey.pem`.

- You have the ARN of the certificate you want to reimport.

To use the following example, replace the file names and the ARN with your own and
type the command on one continuous line. The following example includes line breaks
and extra spaces to make it easier to read.

###### Note

To reimport a certificate, you must specify the certificate ARN.

```nohighlight

$ aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb://Certificate.pem \
      --certificate-chain fileb://CertificateChain.pem \
      --private-key fileb://PrivateKey.pem \
      --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678901
```

If the `import-certificate` command is successful, it returns the
[Amazon Resource Name\
(ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the certificate.
