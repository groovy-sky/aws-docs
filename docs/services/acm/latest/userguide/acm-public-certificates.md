# Request a public certificate in AWS Certificate Manager

You can request AWS Certificate Manager public certificates from the ACM console, AWS CLI, or API.
You can use these certificates with integrated AWS services or export them for use
outside of AWS Cloud.

The following list describes the differences between public certificates and
exportable public certificates.

**Public certificates**

Use ACM public certificates with integrated AWS services like Elastic Load Balancing,
Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon API Gateway. For more information, see [Services integrated with ACM](acm-services.md).

###### Note

ACM public certificates created prior to June 17, 2025 cannot be exported.

**Exportable public certificates**

Exportable public certificates work with integrated AWS services and can also be
used outside AWS Cloud. For more information, see [AWS Certificate Manager exportable public certificates](acm-exportable-certificates.md) and [Services integrated with ACM](acm-services.md). You must create a
new ACM public certificate and enable exportable to be able to export the
public certificate.

The following sections discuss how to request, export, and revoke a public ACM
certificate.

## Request a public certificate using the console

###### To request an ACM public certificate (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ACM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home).

Choose **Request a certificate**.

2. In the **Domain names** section, type your domain name.

You can use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as
    `www.example.com`, or a bare or apex domain name
    such as `example.com`. You can also use an asterisk
    ( `*`) as a wild card in the leftmost position to
    protect several site names in the same domain. For example,
    `*.example.com` protects
    `corp.example.com`, and
    `images.example.com`. The wildcard name will appear
    in the **Subject** field and in the **Subject**
**Alternative Name** extension of the ACM certificate.

When you request a wildcard certificate, the asterisk
    ( `*`) must be in the leftmost position of the
    domain name and can protect only one subdomain level. For example,
    `*.example.com` can protect
    `login.example.com`, and
    `test.example.com`, but it cannot protect
    `test.login.example.com`. Also note that
    `*.example.com` protects _only_
    the subdomains of `example.com`, it does not protect
    the bare or apex domain ( `example.com`). To protect
    both, see the next step.

###### Note

In compliance with [RFC\
5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), the length of the domain name (technically, the Common
Name) that you enter in this step cannot exceed 64 octets (characters),
including periods. Each subsequent Subject Alternative Name (SAN) that
you provide, as in the next step, can be up to 253 octets in length.

1. To add another name, choose **Add another name to this**
      **certificate** and type the name in the text box. This
       is useful for protecting both a bare or apex domain (such as
       `example.com`) and its subdomains such as
       `*.example.com`).
3. If you want to create an ACM exportable public certificates, select the **Enable**
**export** option. You'll be able to access the certificate's
    private keys and use it outside AWS Cloud. For more information, see [AWS Certificate Manager exportable public certificates](acm-exportable-certificates.md).

4. In the **Validation method** section, choose either
    **DNS validation – recommended** or
    **Email validation**, depending on your needs.

###### Note

If you are able to edit your DNS configuration, we recommend that you
use DNS domain validation rather than email validation. DNS validation
has multiple benefits over email validation. See [AWS Certificate Manager DNS validation](dns-validation.md).

Before ACM issues a certificate, it validates that you own or control
    the domain names in your certificate request. You can use either email
    validation or DNS validation.
1. If you choose email validation, ACM sends validation email to
       the domain that you specify in the domain name field. If you specify
       a validation domain, ACM sends the email to that validation domain
       instead. For more information about email validation, see [AWS Certificate Manager email validation](email-validation.md).

2. If you use DNS validation, you simply add a CNAME record provided
       by ACM to your DNS configuration. For more information about DNS
       validation, see [AWS Certificate Manager DNS validation](dns-validation.md).
5. In the **Key algorithm** section, choose an
    algorithm.

6. In the **Tags** page, you can optionally tag your
    certificate. Tags are key-value pairs that serve as metadata for identifying
    and organizing AWS resources. For a list of ACM tag parameters and for
    instructions on how to add tags to certificates after creation, see [Tag AWS Certificate Manager resources](tags.md).

When you finish adding tags, choose **Request**.

7. After the request is processed, the console returns you to your
    certificate list, where information about the new certificate is
    displayed.

A certificate enters status **Pending validation** upon
    being requested, unless it fails for any of the reasons given in the
    troubleshooting topic [Certificate request fails](troubleshooting-cert-requests.md#troubleshooting-failed). ACM makes repeated attempts to
    validate a certificate for 72 hours and then times out. If a certificate
    shows status **Failed** or **Validation timed**
**out**, delete the request, correct the issue with [DNS validation](dns-validation.md) or [Email validation](email-validation.md), and
    try again. If validation succeeds, the certificate enters status
    **Issued**.

###### Note

Depending on how you have ordered the list, a certificate you are
looking for might not be immediately visible. You can click the
black triangle at right to change the ordering. You can also navigate
through multiple pages of certificates using the page numbers at
upper-right.

## Request a public certificate using the CLI

Use the [request-certificate](../../../cli/latest/reference/acm/request-certificate.md) command to request a new public ACM certificate
on the command line. Optional values for the validation method are DNS and EMAIL.
Optional values for the key algorithm are RSA\_2048 (the default if the parameter is
not explicitly provided), EC\_prime256v1, and EC\_secp384r1.

```bash

aws acm request-certificate \
--domain-name www.example.com \
--key-algorithm EC_Prime256v1 \
--validation-method DNS \
--idempotency-token 1234 \
--options CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference=DISABLED,Export=ENABLED
```

This command outputs the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your new public
certificate.

```json

{
    "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:Region:444455556666:certificate/certificate_ID"
}
```
