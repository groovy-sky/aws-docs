# Certificate import problems

You can import third-party certificates into ACM and associate them with [integrated services](acm-services.md). If you encounter
problems, review the [prerequisites](import-certificate-prerequisites.md) and [certificate format](import-certificate-format.md) topics. In particular, note the following:

- You can import only X.509 version 3 SSL/TLS certificates.

- Your certificate can be self–signed or it can be signed by a certificate
authority (CA).

- If your certificate is signed by a CA, you must include an intermediate certificate
chain that provides a path to the root of authority.

- If your certificate is self-signed, you must include the private key in
plaintext.

- Each certificate in the chain must directly certify the one preceding.

- Do not include your end-entity certificate in the intermediate certificate
chain.

- Your certificate, certificate chain, and private key (if any) must be
PEM–encoded. In general, PEM encoding consists of blocks of Base64-encoded ASCII
text that begin and end with plaintext header and footer lines. You must not add lines
or spaces or make any other changes to a PEM file while copying or uploading it. You can
verify certificate chains using the [OpenSSL verify\
utility](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-verify.html).

- Your private key (if any) must not be encrypted. (Tip: if it has a passphrase, it's
encrypted.)

- Services [integrated](acm-services.md) with ACM
must use ACM-supported algorithms and key sizes. See the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide and the
documentation for each service to make sure that your certificate will work.

- Certificate support by integrated services might differ depending on whether the
certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM.

- The certificate must be valid when it is imported.

- Detail information for all of your certificates is displayed in the console. By
default, however, if you call the [ListCertificates](../../../../reference/acm/latest/apireference/api-listcertificates.md) API or the [list-certificates](../../../cli/latest/reference/acm/list-certificates.md) AWS CLI command without specifying the `keyTypes`
filter, only `RSA_1024` or `RSA_2048` certificates are displayed.
