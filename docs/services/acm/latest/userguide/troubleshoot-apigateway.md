# API Gateway problems

When you deploy an _edge-optimized_ API endpoint, API Gateway sets up a
CloudFront distribution for you. The CloudFront distribution is owned by API Gateway, not by your account. The
distribution is bound to the ACM certificate that you used when deploying your API. To
remove the binding and allow ACM to delete your certificate, you must remove the API Gateway
custom domain that is associated with the certificate.

When you deploy a _regional_ API endpoint, API Gateway creates an
application load balancer (ALB) on your behalf. The load balancer is owned by API Gateway and is
not visible to you. The ALB is bound to the ACM certificate that you used when deploying
your API. To remove the binding and allow ACM to delete your certificate, you must remove
the API Gateway custom domain that is associated with the certificate.
