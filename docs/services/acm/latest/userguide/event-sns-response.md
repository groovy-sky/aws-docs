# Responding to an event with Amazon SNS

This section shows how to configure Amazon SNS to send a text notification whenever
ACM generates a health event.

Complete the following procedure to configure a response.

###### To create a Amazon EventBridge rule and trigger an action

1. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule. For more information, see [Creating Amazon EventBridge\
    rules that react to events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.md).

1. In the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events), navigate to the
       **Events** \> **Rules**
       page and choose **Create rule**.

2. On the **Create rule** page, select
       **Event Pattern**.

3. For **Service Name**, choose
       **Health** from the menu.

4. For **Event Type**, choose **Specific**
      **Health events**.

5. Select **Specific service(s)** and choose
       **ACM** from the menu.

6. Select **Specific event type category(s)**
       and choose **accountNotification**.

7. Choose **Any event type code**.

8. Choose **Any resource**.

9. In the **Event pattern preview** editor,
       paste the JSON pattern emitted by the event. This example uses
       the pattern from the [AWS health events](supported-events.md#health-event) section.

```

{
   "source":[
      "aws.health"
   ],
   "detail-type":[
      "AWS Health Event"
   ],
   "detail":{
      "service":[
         "ACM"
      ],
      "eventTypeCategory":[
         "scheduledChange"
      ],
      "eventTypeCode":[
         "AWS_ACM_RENEWAL_STATE_CHANGE"
      ]
   }
}
```

2. Configure an action.

In the **Targets** section, you can choose from among
    many services that can immediately consume your event, such as Amazon Simple Notification Service
    (SNS), or you can choose **Lambda function** to pass
    the event to customized executable code. For an example of an AWS Lambda
    implementation, see [Responding to an event with a Lambda function](event-lambda-response.md).
