# Data protection in AWS Certificate Manager

The AWS [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model)
applies to data protection in AWS Certificate Manager. As described in this model, AWS is
responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS Cloud. You are
responsible for maintaining control over your content that is hosted on this infrastructure.
You are also responsible for the security configuration and management tasks for the AWS services
that you use. For more information about data privacy, see the [Data Privacy FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq). For information about data protection in Europe, see the [AWS Shared\
Responsibility Model and GDPR](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr) blog post on the _AWS Security_
_Blog_.

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account
credentials and set up individual users with AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). That way, each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.

- Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail. For information about using CloudTrail trails to capture AWS activities, see [Working with CloudTrail trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-trails.html) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

- Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services.

- Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering
and securing sensitive data that is stored in Amazon S3.

- If you require FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through
a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. For more information about the
available FIPS endpoints, see [Federal\
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips).

We strongly recommend that you never put confidential or sensitive information, such as your
customers' email addresses, into tags or free-form text fields such as a **Name** field. This includes when you work with ACM or other AWS services
using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Any data that you enter into
tags or free-form text fields used for names may be used for billing or diagnostic logs. If you
provide a URL to an external server, we strongly recommend that you do not include credentials
information in the URL to validate your request to that server.

## Security for certificate private keys

When you [request a public\
certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html), AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) generates a public/private key pair. For [imported certificates](import-certificate.md), you generate the key
pair. The public key becomes part of the certificate. ACM stores the certificate
and its corresponding private key, and uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to help protect the
private key. The process works like this:

1. The first time you request or import a certificate in an AWS Region,
    ACM creates a managed AWS KMS key with the alias **aws/acm**. This KMS key is unique in each AWS account and
    each AWS Region.

2. ACM uses this KMS key to encrypt the certificate's private key. ACM
    stores only an encrypted version of the private key; ACM does not store
    the private key in plaintext form. ACM uses the same KMS key to encrypt
    the private keys for all certificates in a specific AWS account and a
    specific AWS Region.

3. When you associate the certificate with a service that is integrated with
    AWS Certificate Manager, ACM sends the certificate and the encrypted private key to the
    service. A grant is also created in AWS KMS that allows the service to use the
    KMS key to decrypt the certificate's private key. For more information
    about grants, see [Using Grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_. For more information
    about services supported by ACM, see [Services integrated with ACM](acm-services.md).

###### Note

You have control over the automatically created AWS KMS grant. If you
delete this grant for any reason, you lose ACM functionality for the
integrated service.

4. Integrated services use the KMS key to decrypt the private key. Then the
    service uses the certificate and the decrypted (plaintext) private key to
    establish secure communication channels (SSL/TLS sessions) with its
    clients.

5. When the certificate is disassociated from an integrated service, the
    grant created in step 3 is retired. This means the service can no longer use
    the KMS key to decrypt the certificate's private key.
