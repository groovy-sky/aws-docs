# Using CloudTrail with AWS Certificate Manager

AWS Certificate Manager is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions
taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in ACM. CloudTrail is enabled by default on your
AWS account. CloudTrail captures API calls for ACM as events, including calls from the
ACM console and code calls to the ACM API operations. If you configure a _trail_, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to
an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for ACM. If you don't configure a trail, you can
still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event**
**history**.

Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made
to ACM, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it
was made, and additional details. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event\
History](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md). When supported event activity occurs in ACM, that activity is
recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in **Event**
**history**. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS
account.

Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon
the event data collected in CloudTrail logs.
