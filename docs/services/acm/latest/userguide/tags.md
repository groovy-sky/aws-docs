# Tag AWS Certificate Manager resources

A _tag_ is a label that you can assign to an ACM certificate. Each
tag consists of a _key_ and a _value_. You can use the
AWS Certificate Manager console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or ACM API to add, view, or remove tags for ACM
certificates. You can choose which tags to display in the ACM console.

You can create custom tags that suit your needs. For example, you could tag multiple ACM
certificates with an `Environment = Prod` or `Environment = Beta` tag
to identify which environment each ACM certificate is intended for. The following list
includes a few additional examples of other custom tags:

- `Admin = Alice`

- `Purpose = Website`

- `Protocol = TLS`

- `Registrar = Route53`

Other AWS resources also support tagging. You can, therefore, assign the same tag to
different resources to indicate whether those resources are related. For example, you can
assign a tag such as `Website = example.com` to the ACM certificate, the load
balancer, and other resources used for your example.com website.
