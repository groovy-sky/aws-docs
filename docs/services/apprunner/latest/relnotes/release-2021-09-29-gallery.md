# Release: Direct container launch from Amazon ECR Public Gallery on September 29, 2021

Amazon ECR Public added the ability to launch containers directly to AWS App Runner.

**Release date:** September 29, 2021

## Changes

You can now test popular web frameworks and applications hosted on the [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/). When
browsing the gallery, look for **Launch with App Runner** on the gallery page for an image. Choose it to open the App Runner console with most
details pre-filled. Add the port number for the application and launch a new service.

from Amazon ECR Public](../dg/service-source-image.md#service-source-image.providers.ecrpublic.direct) in the _AWS App Runner Developer Guide_.
