# Release: App Runner adds support for redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS endpoints on February 22, 2023

**Release date:** February 22, 2023

## Changes

App Runner now supports automatic redirection of incoming HTTP web requests to their corresponding HTTPS App Runner endpoints. Previously, only incoming
HTTPS web requests were supported. All incoming HTTP web requests to your App Runner service failed with a timeout status response.
With this release, you receive the flexibility to use both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints to access the applications on your App Runner service.

For more information, see [Developing application code for App Runner](../dg/develop.md) in the
_AWS App Runner Developer Guide_.
