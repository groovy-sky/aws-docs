# Release: App Runner now supports privately accessible services within Amazon VPC on October 31, 2022

AWS App Runner now supports private services which enables access to App Runner services from within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

**Release date:** October 31, 2022

## Changes

AWS App Runner now
supports private services. By default, App Runner services are accessible publicly over the
internet. Now, with private
services,
you can restrict network access to your internal websites, APIs, and applications to originate
from within your VPC.

Private services in App Runner leverages AWS PrivateLink Interface VPC Endpoints, which provides highly available and scalable networking technology. You can
specify which Amazon VPC you want your App Runner service to be accessible in by passing an Interface VPC Endpoint. You can also add security groups that function as
a virtual firewall to your Interface VPC Endpoints to further restrict network traffic.

For more information, see [Enabling Private endpoint for incoming traffic](../dg/network-pl.md) in the
_AWS App Runner Developer Guide_.
