# Setting App Runner service options using a configuration file

###### Note

Configuration files are applicable only to [services that are based on source code](service-source-code.md). You can't use
configuration files with [image-based services](service-source-image.md).

When you create an AWS App Runner service using a source code repository, AWS App Runner requires information about building and starting your service. You can
provide this information each time you create a service using the App Runner console or API. Alternatively, you can set service options by using a
_configuration file_. The options that you specify in a file become part of your source repository, and any changes to these options
are tracked similarly to how changes to the source code are tracked. You can use the App Runner configuration file to specify more options than the API supports.
You don't need to provide a configuration file if you only need the basic options that the API supports.

The App Runner configuration file is a YAML file that's named `apprunner.yaml` in the [source directory](service-source-code.md#service-source-code.source-directory) of your application’s repository. It provides build and runtime options for your
service. Values in this file instruct App Runner how to build and start your service, and provide runtime context such as network settings and environment
variables.

The App Runner configuration file doesn’t include operational settings, such as CPU and memory.

For examples of App Runner configuration files, see [App Runner configuration file examples](config-file-examples.md). For a complete reference guide, see [App Runner configuration file reference](config-file-ref.md).
