AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting April 30, 2026. If you would like to use
App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS App Runner availability\
change](apprunner-availability-change.md).

# Protecting data using encryption

AWS App Runner reads your application source (source image or source code) from a repository that you specify and stores it for deployment to your service.
For more information, see [App Runner architecture and concepts](architecture.md).

Data protection refers to protecting data while _in transit_ (as it travels to and from App Runner) and _at_
_rest_ (while it is stored in AWS data centers).

For more information about data protection, see [Data protection in App Runner](security-data-protection.md).

For other App Runner security topics, see [Security in App Runner](security.md).

## Encryption in transit

You can achieve data protection in transit in two ways: encrypt the connection using Transport Layer Security (TLS), or use client-side encryption
(where the object is encrypted before it is sent). Both methods are valid for protecting your application data. To secure the connection, encrypt it
using TLS whenever your application, its developers and administrators, and its end users send or receive any objects. App Runner sets up your application to
receive traffic over TLS.

Client-side encryption isn't a valid method for protecting the source image or code that you provide to App Runner for deployment. App Runner needs access to
your application source, so it can't be encrypted. Therefore, be sure to secure the connection between your development or deployment environment and
App Runner.

## Encryption at rest and key management

To protect your application's data at rest, App Runner encrypts all stored copies of your application source image or source bundle. When you create an
App Runner service, you can provide an AWS KMS key. If you provide one, App Runner uses your provided key to encrypt your source. If you don't provide one, App Runner
uses an AWS managed key instead.

For details about App Runner service creation parameters, see [CreateService](../api/api-createservice.md). For information about
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), see the [AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide](../../../kms/latest/developerguide.md).
