AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting April 30, 2026. If you would like to use
App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see

# Configuring service settings using sharable resources

For some features, it makes sense to share configuration across AWS App Runner services. For example, you might want a set of services to have the same auto
scaling behavior. Or you might want identical observability settings for all of your services. App Runner lets you share settings by using separate sharable
resources. You create a resource that defines a set of configuration settings for a feature, and then you provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this
configuration resource to one or more App Runner services.

App Runner implements sharable configuration resources for the following features:

- [Auto scaling](manage-autoscaling.md)

- [Observability](manage-configure-observability.md)

- [VPC access](network-vpc.md)

The document page for each of these features provides information about the available settings and the management procedures.

Features using separate configuration resources share some design traits and considerations.

- Revisions – Some configuration resources can have revisions. Auto scaling and observability are examples of two
configuration resources that use revisions. In these cases, each configuration has a _name_ and a numeric
_revision_. Multiple revisions of a configuration have the same name and different revision numbers. You can use different
configuration names for different scenarios. For each name, you can add multiple revisions to fine-tune the settings for a specific scenario.

The first configuration that you create with a name gets the revision number 1. Subsequent configurations with the same name get consecutive
revision numbers (starting with 2). You can associate your App Runner service with a specific configuration revision or with the latest revision of
configuration.

- Shared – You can share a single configuration resource across multiple App Runner services. This is useful if you
want to maintain identical configurations across these services. In particular, if your resources support revisions, you can configure multiple services
to use the latest revision of a configuration. You can do so by specifying only the configuration name, but not a revision. Any of the services that
you configured this way receives configuration updates when you update the service. For more information about configuration changes, see [Configuring an App Runner service](manage-configure.md).

- Resource management – You can use App Runner to create and delete configurations. You can't directly update a
configuration. Instead, for resources that support revisions, you can create a new revision to an existing configuration name to effectively update the
configuration.

###### Note

For auto scaling, you can create configurations and _multiple_ revisions with both the App Runner console and the App Runner
API. Both the App Runner console and the App Runner API can also delete configurations and revisions. For more details, see [Managing App Runner automatic scaling](manage-autoscaling.md).

For other configuration types, like observability configurations, you can only create a configuration with a _single_ revision with the App Runner console. To create more revisions, and to delete configurations, you must use the App Runner API.

- Resource quota – There are set quotas for the number of unique configuration names and revisions that you can
have for your configuration resources in each AWS Region. If you reach these quotas, you must either delete a configuration name or at least some of
its revisions before you can create more. For auto scaling configurations revisions, you can use the App Runner console or the App Runner API to delete them.
For more details, see [Managing App Runner automatic scaling](manage-autoscaling.md).
You must use the App Runner API to delete other resources. For more information about quotas, see [App Runner resource quotas](architecture.md#architecture.quotas).

- No resource cost – You don't incur additional cost for creating a configuration resource. You might incur cost
for the feature itself (for example, you are charged for normal AWS X-Ray cost when you turn on X-Ray tracing), but not for the App Runner configuration
resource that configures the feature for your App Runner service.
