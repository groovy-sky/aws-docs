AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting April 30, 2026. If you would like to use
App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS App Runner availability\
change](apprunner-availability-change.md).

# Managing App Runner automatic scaling

AWS App Runner automatically scales compute resources, specifically instances, up or down for your App Runner application. Automatic scaling provides adequate
request handling when traffic is heavy, and reduces your cost when traffic slows down.

###### Auto scaling configuration

You can configure a few parameters to adjust auto scaling behavior for your service. App Runner maintains auto scaling settings in a sharable resource
that's called _AutoScalingConfiguration_. You can create and maintain stand-alone auto scaling configurations, before you assign them
to services. After they've been associated to a service, you can continue to maintain the configurations. You can also choose to create a new auto scaling
configuration while you're in the process of creating a new service or configuring an existing one. Once the new auto scaling configuration is created,
you can associate it to the service and continue on with the process of creating or configuring your service.

###### Naming and revisions

An auto scaling configuration has a _name_ and a numeric _revision_. Multiple revisions of a configuration have
the same name and different revision numbers. You can use different configuration names for different auto scaling scenarios, such as _high availability_ or _low cost_. For each name, you can add multiple revisions to fine-tune
the settings for a specific scenario. You can have up to 10 unique auto scaling configuration names and up to 5
revisions for each configuration. If you reach the limit and need to create more, you can delete one and then create another one. App Runner will not allow you
to delete a configuration that's set as the default or in use by an active service. For more information about quotas, see [App Runner resource quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/architecture.html#architecture.quotas).

###### Setting a default configuration

When you create or update an App Runner service, you can provide an auto scaling configuration resource.
Providing an auto scaling configuration is optional. If you don't provide one, App Runner provides a default auto scaling
configuration with recommended values. The auto scaling configuration feature provides you the option to set your own default auto scaling configuration
instead of using the default that App Runner provides. Once you specify another auto scaling configuration as a default, that configuration is automatically
assigned as the default to the new services you create in the future. The new default designation doesn't affect the associations that were previously set
for existing services.

###### Configuring services with auto scaling

You can share a single auto scaling configuration across multiple App Runner services to ensure the services have the same auto scaling behavior. For more
information about configuring auto scaling configurations with the App Runner console or the App Runner API, see the sections that follow in this topic.
For more general information about shareable resources, see [Configuring service settings using sharable resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/manage-configure-resources.html).

###### Configurable settings

You can configure the following auto scaling settings:

- _Max concurrency_ – The maximum number of concurrent _requests_ that an instance
processes. When the number of concurrent requests exceeds this quota, App Runner scales up the service.

- _Max size_ – The maximum number of _instances_ that your service can scale up to. This is
the highest number of instances that can concurrently handle your service's traffic.

- _Min size_ – The minimum number of _instances_ that App Runner can provision for your service.
The service always has at least this number of provisioned instances. Some of these instances actively handle traffic. The remainder of them are part of
the cost-effective compute capacity reserve, which is ready to be quickly activated. You pay for the memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You
pay for the CPU usage of only the active subset.

###### Note

The vCPU resource count determines the number of instances that App Runner can provide to your service. This is an adjustable quota value for the
_Fargate On-Demand_ vCPU resource count that resides in the AWS Fargate service. To view the vCPU quota settings for your account or
to request a quota increase, use the Service Quotas console in the AWS Management Console. For more information, see [AWS Fargate service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-quotas.html#service-quotas-fargate) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

## Manage auto scaling for a service

Manage auto scaling for your App Runner services using one of the following methods:

App Runner console

When you [create a service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/manage-create.html) using the App Runner console or [update a service\
configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/manage-configure.html), you can specify an auto scaling configuration.

###### Note

When you change the auto scaling configuration or revision that's associated to a service, your service is re-deployed.

The **Auto scaling** configuration page offers several options to configure auto scaling for your service.

- To assign an existing configuration and revision – Choose a value from the **Existing**
**configurations** drop-down. The latest revision version will default in the adjacent drop-down. If a different revision exists that
you would prefer to select, do so from the revision drop-down. The configuration values for the revision version display.

- To create and assign a new auto scaling configuration – Select **Create new ASC** from
the **Create** menu. This launches the **Add custom auto scaling configuration** page. Enter a
**Configuration name** and values for the auto scaling parameters. Then select **Add**. App Runner creates the new
auto scaling configuration resource for you and returns you to **Auto scaling** section with the new configuration selected and
displayed.

- To create and assign a new revision – First select the configuration name from the **Existing**
**configurations** drop-down. Then select **Create ASC revision** from the **Create** menu. This
launches the **Add custom auto scaling configuration** page. Enter values for the auto scaling parameters. Then select
**Add**. App Runner creates a new auto scaling configuration revision for you and returns you to **Auto scaling**
section with the new revision selected and displayed.

![App Runner console configuration page showing auto scaling options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/apprunner/latest/dg/images/console-autoscaling.png)

App Runner API or AWS CLI

When you call the [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_CreateService.html) or [UpdateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_UpdateService.html) App Runner API actions, you can use the `AutoScalingConfigurationArn` parameter to specify an auto scaling
configuration resource for your service.

The next section provides guidance to manage your auto scaling configuration resources.
