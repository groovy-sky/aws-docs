# Tracking App Runner service activity

AWS App Runner uses a list of operations to keep track of activity in your App Runner service. An operation represents an asynchronous call to an API action, such
as creating a service, updating a configuration, and deploying a service. The following sections show you how to track activity in the App Runner console and
using the API.

## Track App Runner service activity

Track your App Runner service activity using one of the following methods:

App Runner console

The App Runner console displays your App Runner service activity and provides more ways to explore operations.
