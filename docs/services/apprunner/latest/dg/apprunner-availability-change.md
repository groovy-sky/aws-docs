AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting April 30, 2026. If you would like to use
App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS App Runner availability\
change](apprunner-availability-change.md).

# AWS App Runner availability change

After careful consideration, we decided to close AWS App Runner to new customers starting April 30, 2026. Existing AWS App Runner
customers can continue to use the service as normal, including creating new resources and services. AWS continues to invest
in security and availability for AWS App Runner, but we do not plan to introduce new features.

We recommend that customers explore Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Express Mode when migrating from AWS App Runner. Amazon ECS Express Mode preserves
App Runner's operating simplicity while providing access to the broader Amazon ECS feature set. With a single API call, you provide
a container image and two IAM roles, and Amazon ECS provisions a complete application stack in your AWS account, including an
ECS service on Fargate, an Application Load Balancer, auto scaling, and networking. There is no additional charge for using
Amazon ECS Express Mode. You pay only for the underlying AWS resources created to run your application.

This guide describes how to migrate an existing App Runner service to ECS Express Mode and gradually shift traffic using
DNS routing.

## Migration overview

This guide uses a blue/green deployment approach with DNS weighted routing to migrate traffic from App Runner to ECS Express
Mode. Both services run simultaneously during the migration. You use Amazon Route 53 (or your DNS provider) to gradually shift
traffic from the App Runner service to the ECS Express Mode service, starting with a small percentage and increasing over time.
This approach minimizes downtime and allows you to roll back by adjusting DNS weights if issues arise.

A typical migration includes the following steps:

1. Review the configuration of the existing App Runner service

2. Create an ECS Express Mode service using the same container image

3. Configure the same custom domain for the ECS Express Mode service, if you use a custom domain

4. Shift traffic from App Runner to ECS Express Mode using DNS routing

5. Complete the migration and delete the App Runner service when it is no longer needed

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate AWS Identity and Access Management permissions to create and manage Amazon ECS, AWS App Runner,
Amazon Route 53, and Application Load Balancer resources

- AWS CLI installed and configured with credentials for your AWS account

- A container image stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (or another container registry) to deploy to ECS Express Mode

- The IAM roles required by ECS Express Mode:
`ecsTaskExecutionRole` for [Amazon ECS task execution](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/task-execution-iam-role.md) and
`ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices` for [ECS\
Express Mode infrastructure provisioning](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/express-service-getting-started.md#express-service-create-execution-role)

If you want to preserve an existing custom domain during migration, you also need:

- A registered domain name that you control, such as `app.example.com`, using either Amazon Route 53
or a third-party domain registrar

- An SSL/TLS certificate in [AWS Certificate Manager](../../../acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.md) (ACM) that matches your custom domain. [Request a public ACM certificate](../../../acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.md)
in the same AWS Region where you're deploying your resources. Both App Runner and Amazon ECS Express Mode require an ACM
certificate to enable HTTPS access with custom domains.

## Before you begin

- **Container image requirement** — ECS Express Mode deploys a container image.
If your App Runner service is deployed from source code, first add a build step that creates a container image and pushes it
to a registry such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry. Then deploy that image to ECS Express Mode. See [Migrating source-based deployments](#migration-source-based) for details on migrating source-based deployments.

- **Domain behavior** — If your App Runner service already uses a custom domain, such
as `app.example.com`, you can reuse that same hostname during migration and gradually shift traffic between
App Runner and ECS Express Mode by updating DNS.

If your App Runner service uses only the default App Runner service URL, the ECS Express Mode service will have a different
endpoint. In this case there is no shared hostname that can be used for gradual traffic shifting. You should create and
validate the ECS Express Mode service and then update clients or DNS to use the new endpoint.

## Migration walkthrough

The following diagram shows how the migration works using Route 53 to shift DNS records between your App Runner service
and your ECS Express Mode service.

![Architecture diagram showing migration from App Runner to ECS Express Mode using Route 53 weighted routing for gradual traffic shifting between the two services.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/apprunner/latest/dg/images/migration-image-based.png)

### Step 1: Review the existing App Runner configuration

In the App Runner console, review your existing service and note the values that you want to carry forward.
At a minimum, note the following:

- Container image

- Application port

- Environment variables

- Custom domain name, if configured

- ACM certificate associated with the custom domain, if configured

You can also review any other runtime settings that you want to carry forward into the new service.

For custom domain details, see [Managing custom domain names for an App Runner service](manage-custom-domains.md).

### Step 2: Create the ECS Express Mode service

Create an ECS Express Mode service using the same container image used by your App Runner service. You can create the
service using either the [AWS Management Console](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/express-service-first-run.md) or the [AWS CLI](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/express-service-getting-started.md).

**Example CLI command:**

```bash

aws ecs create-express-gateway-service \
    --execution-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole \
    --infrastructure-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ecsInfrastructureRoleForExpressServices \
    --primary-container '{
        "image": "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest",
        "containerPort": 8080,
        "environment": [{
            "name": "ENV_VAR_NAME",
            "value": "value"
        }]
    }' \
    --service-name "my-application" \
    --health-check-path "/" \
    --scaling-target '{"minTaskCount":1,"maxTaskCount":4}' \
    --monitor-resources
```

Replace the image, port, environment variables, and scaling values with those from your App Runner service.

This command provisions a complete application stack in your AWS account, including an ECS service on Fargate,
an Application Load Balancer with target groups and health checks, auto-scaling policies, security groups and networking
configuration, and a default URL.

Provisioning typically takes 3–5 minutes. You can track progress in the Amazon ECS console under the
Resources tab.

Once complete, test your ECS Express Mode service using the default URL shown in the console. Verify that your
application works correctly before proceeding with the traffic shift.

### Step 3: Configure the custom domain for ECS Express Mode

If your App Runner service uses a custom domain, configure the same custom domain for the ECS Express Mode service before
shifting traffic. This step configures the Application Load Balancer created for the ECS Express Mode service so that it
accepts traffic for your domain and uses the ACM certificate for HTTPS.

- **Add your custom domain as a host header condition** in the Application
Load Balancer listener rule. Use the same domain name you associated with your App Runner service (for example,
`app.example.com`). This tells the Application Load Balancer to route traffic from your domain to the ECS
Express Mode target group.

- **Add the SSL certificate** to the Application Load Balancer HTTPS
listener. Add the ACM certificate noted in Step 1 to the HTTPS listener.

For detailed instructions, see
[Adding a custom domain to\
your service](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/express-custom-domain.md) in the _Amazon ECS Developer Guide_.

The following image shows an example of configuring the host header condition in the Application Load Balancer
listener rule.

![Console screenshot showing the Application Load Balancer listener rule with host header conditions configured for the ECS Express Mode service endpoint and custom domain.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/apprunner/latest/dg/images/migration-alb-host-header.png)

### Step 4: Shift traffic using Route 53 weighted routing

If your App Runner service already uses a custom domain, you can gradually shift traffic to the ECS Express Mode service
by using [Route 53 weighted\
routing](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/routing-policy-weighted.md). Weighted routing allows you to route traffic for the same hostname to multiple endpoints.
Each endpoint is defined as a separate DNS record with its own weight, and Route 53 distributes requests according to those
weights.

###### Note

This guide uses Route 53 as the example. If you use another DNS provider, make equivalent DNS changes using your
provider's traffic-management features.

**Convert the existing App Runner record to a weighted record:**

1. Open the Route 53 console.

2. Choose **Hosted zones**, then select the hosted zone for your domain.

3. Locate the existing record for your hostname (for example `app.example.com`) that currently
    points to App Runner.

4. Edit the record and change its **Routing policy** to
    **Weighted**.

5. Set **Weight** to `100` (this directs all initial traffic to
    App Runner).

6. Under **Record ID**, enter a descriptive identifier such as
    `app-runner-service`.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

**Create a weighted record for ECS Express Mode:**

1. Create a new record in the same hosted zone.

2. Use the same record name (for example `app.example.com`).

3. Use the same record type.

4. Set **Routing policy** to **Weighted**.

5. Under **Route traffic to**, choose **Alias to Application and Classic Load**
**Balancer**.

6. Choose your ECS Express Mode Application Load Balancer from the dropdown.

7. Set **Weight** to `0` (no traffic flows to ECS Express Mode until you
    explicitly increase the weight).

8. Under **Record ID**, enter a descriptive identifier such as
    `ecs-express-service`.

9. Choose **Create records**.

**Gradually shift traffic:**

Once the DNS records are configured, begin shifting traffic by increasing the ECS Express Mode weight while
proportionally decreasing the App Runner weight. A recommended approach:

- Set ECS Express Mode to 10 / App Runner to 90

- Monitor and validate the service handles requests successfully

- Increase to 25 / 75

- Increase to 50 / 50

- Increase to 75 / 25

- Complete at 100 / 0

At each step, test the application before shifting additional traffic. If issues occur at any point, roll back by
adjusting the weights back to their previous values.

###### Important

Keep your App Runner service running for a validation period (such as 24–48 hours) to confirm DNS changes have
propagated globally and to provide a rollback option if needed. If you encounter issues, you can quickly revert the
Route 53 weights back to App Runner.

### Step 5: Complete the migration

After verifying that the ECS Express Mode service handles production traffic correctly and the validation period
has passed, complete the migration:

- In Route 53, remove the weighted record pointing to App Runner (or set its weight to 0).

- Remove the custom domain association from the App Runner service.

**Delete the App Runner service:**

```bash

aws apprunner delete-service --service-arn your-app-runner-service-arn
```

Also consider removing any resources that are no longer needed:

- Route 53 weighted routing records for App Runner

- Unused container images from Amazon Elastic Container Registry

- IAM roles created specifically for App Runner, if no longer needed

###### Note

Do not delete the ECS Express Mode service, its Application Load Balancer, or associated resources if the service
is running in production.

## Migrating source-based deployments

If your existing App Runner service is deployed from source code rather than a container image, you need to add a
containerization step before deploying to ECS Express Mode. Unlike App Runner, ECS Express Mode requires a container image.
However, you can replicate App Runner's automated deployment experience using CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions with the
[Amazon ECS Deploy Express\
Service GitHub Action](https://github.com/aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-express-service).

The migration workflow has three stages:

1. Build the container image using a [Dockerfile](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/create-container-image.md)

2. Push the image to a container registry such as [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](../../../amazonecr/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.md)

3. Deploy the image to ECS Express Mode

The following diagram shows how this workflow works using GitHub Actions:

![Architecture diagram showing migration of a source-based App Runner service to ECS Express Mode using GitHub Actions for building container images, pushing to Amazon Elastic Container Registry, and deploying to ECS Express Mode.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/apprunner/latest/dg/images/migration-source-based.png)

### Containerize your application

If your application does not already have a Dockerfile, create one in your repository root. The Dockerfile serves
as the blueprint for building and packaging your source code into a container image.

Your repository structure should include:

```

your-app/
├── src/                    # Application source code
├── Dockerfile              # Container build instructions
├── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
└── .github/                # GitHub configuration
    └── workflows/          # GitHub Actions workflows
        └── deploy.yml      # ECS Express Mode deployment workflow
```

### Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment

To replicate App Runner's automatic deployment on code push, configure GitHub Actions with the following:

- Create an [OpenID\
Connect (OIDC) provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/security-harden-deployments/oidc-in-aws) to allow GitHub Actions to assume an IAM role

- Create an [IAM\
role with ECS Express Mode](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-express-service-action-for-github-actions) and [Amazon Elastic Container Registry permissions](../../../amazonecr/latest/userguide/ecr-on-ecs.md)

- Create the two IAM roles required by ECS Express Mode

- Create GitHub environment variables for your ECS resources:
`ECS_SERVICE`, `ECS_CLUSTER`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`,
and `ECR_REPOSITORY`

**Example GitHub Actions workflow**

Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml

        max-task-count: 4
        auto-scaling-metric: AVERAGE_CPU
        auto-scaling-target-value: 70
```

When you push code changes to your main branch, GitHub Actions automatically builds a new container image, pushes it
to Amazon Elastic Container Registry, and deploys it to your ECS Express Mode service. This replicates the automated deployment experience you
had with App Runner.

Once the ECS Express Mode service is running, follow Steps 3–5 in the migration walkthrough to configure the
custom domain, shift traffic using DNS routing, and complete the migration.
