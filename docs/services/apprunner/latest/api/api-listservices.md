## Examples

### Paginated listing of App Runner services

This example illustrates how to list all App Runner services in the AWS account. Up to two services are listed in each response. This example shows
the first request. The response includes two results and a token that can be used in the next request. When a subsequent response doesn't include a
token, all services have been listed.

#### Sample Request

```json

$ aws apprunner list-services --cli-input-json "`cat`"
{
  "MaxResults": 2
}
```

#### Sample Response

```json

{
  "NextToken": "eyJDdXN0b21lckFjY291bnRJZCI6IjI3MDIwNTQwMjg0NSIsIlNlcnZpY2VTdGF0dXNDb2RlIjoiUFJPVklTSU9OSU5HIiwiSGFzaEtleSI6IjI3MDIwNTQwMjg0NSNhYjhmOTRjZmUyOWE0NjBmYjg3NjBhZmQyZWU4NzU1NSJ9",
