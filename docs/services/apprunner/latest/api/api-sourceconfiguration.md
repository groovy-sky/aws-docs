## Contents
<a name="API_SourceConfiguration_Contents"></a>

 ** AuthenticationConfiguration **   <a name="apprunner-Type-SourceConfiguration-AuthenticationConfiguration"></a>
Describes the resources that are needed to authenticate access to some source repositories.
Type: [AuthenticationConfiguration](API_AuthenticationConfiguration.md) object
Required: No

 ** AutoDeploymentsEnabled **   <a name="apprunner-Type-SourceConfiguration-AutoDeploymentsEnabled"></a>
If `true`, continuous integration from the source repository is enabled for the App Runner service. Each repository change (including any source code commit or new image version) starts a deployment.
Default: App Runner sets to `false` for a source image that uses an ECR Public repository or an ECR repository that's in an AWS account other than the one that the service is in. App Runner sets to `true` in all other cases (which currently include a source code repository or a source image using a same-account ECR repository).
Type: Boolean
Required: No

 ** CodeRepository **   <a name="apprunner-Type-SourceConfiguration-CodeRepository"></a>
The description of a source code repository.
You must provide either this member or `ImageRepository` (but not both).
Type: [CodeRepository](API_CodeRepository.md) object
Required: No

 ** ImageRepository **   <a name="apprunner-Type-SourceConfiguration-ImageRepository"></a>
The description of a source image repository.
You must provide either this member or `CodeRepository` (but not both).
Type: [ImageRepository](API_ImageRepository.md) object
