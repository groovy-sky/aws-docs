# ObservabilityConfiguration
<a name="API_ObservabilityConfiguration"></a>

Describes an AWS App Runner observability configuration resource. Multiple revisions of a configuration have the same `ObservabilityConfigurationName` and different `ObservabilityConfigurationRevision` values.

The resource is designed to configure multiple features (currently one feature, tracing). This type contains optional members that describe the configuration of these features (currently one member, `TraceConfiguration`). If a feature member isn't specified, the feature isn't enabled.
