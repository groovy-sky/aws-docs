# StartDeployment
<a name="API_StartDeployment"></a>

**Important**
 AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting March 31, 2026. If you would like to use App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS App Runner availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/apprunner-availability-change.html).

Initiate a manual deployment of the latest commit in a source code repository or the latest image in a source image repository to an AWS App Runner service.

For a source code repository, App Runner retrieves the commit and builds a Docker image. For a source image repository, App Runner retrieves the latest Docker image. In both cases, App Runner then deploys the new image to your service and starts a new container instance.

This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use the returned `OperationId` and the [ListOperations](API_ListOperations.md) call to track the operation's progress.
