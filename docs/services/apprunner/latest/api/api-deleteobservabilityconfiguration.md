# DeleteObservabilityConfiguration
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration"></a>

**Important**
 AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting March 31, 2026. If you would like to use App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS App Runner availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/apprunner-availability-change.html).

Delete an AWS App Runner observability configuration resource. You can delete a specific revision or the latest active revision. You can't delete a configuration that's used by one or more App Runner services.

## Request Syntax
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_RequestSyntax"></a>

```
{
   "ObservabilityConfigurationArn": "{{string}}"
}
```

## Request Parameters
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_RequestParameters"></a>

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](CommonParameters.md).

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

 ** [ObservabilityConfigurationArn](#API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="apprunner-DeleteObservabilityConfiguration-request-ObservabilityConfigurationArn"></a>
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner observability configuration that you want to delete.
The ARN can be a full observability configuration ARN, or a partial ARN ending with either `.../name ` or `.../name/revision `. If a revision isn't specified, the latest active revision is deleted.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1011.
Pattern: `arn:aws(-[\w]+)*:[a-z0-9-\\.]{0,63}:[a-z0-9-\\.]{0,63}:[0-9]{12}:(\w|\/|-){1,1011}`
Required: Yes

## Examples
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_Examples"></a>

### Delete the latest active revision of an observability configuration
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_Example_1"></a>

This example illustrates how to delete the latest active revision of an App Runner observability configuration. To delete the latest active revision, specify an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that ends with the configuration name, without the revision component.

In the example, two revisions exist before this action. Therefore, revision `2` (the latest) is deleted. However, it now shows `"Latest": false`, because, after being deleted, it isn't the latest active revision anymore.

**Note**
The two revisions in our examples are identical, because App Runner doesn't yet support enough observability functionality to demonstrate two significantly different revisions (for example, multiple tracing vendors). We're including the two examples only to demonstrate the revisioning behavior during deletion.

#### Sample Request
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_Example_1_Request"></a>

```
$ aws apprunner delete-observability-configuration --cli-input-json "`cat`"
{
  "ObservabilityConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:observabilityconfiguration/xray-tracing"
}
```

#### Sample Response
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_Example_1_Response"></a>

```
{
  "ObservabilityConfiguration": {
    "ObservabilityConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:observabilityconfiguration/xray-tracing/2/e76562f50d78042e819fead0f59672e6",
    "ObservabilityConfigurationName": "xray-tracing",
    "ObservabilityConfigurationRevision": 2,
    "CreatedAt": "2021-02-25T17:42:59Z",
    "DeletedAt": "2021-03-02T08:07:06Z",
    "Latest": false,
    "Status": "INACTIVE",
    "TraceConfiguration": {
        "Vendor": "AWSXRAY"
    }
  }
}
```

### Delete a specific revision of an observability configuration
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_Example_2"></a>

This example illustrates how to delete a specific revision of an App Runner observability configuration. To delete a specific revision, specify an ARN that includes the revision number.

In the example, several revisions exist before this action. The action deletes revision `1`.

#### Sample Request
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_Example_2_Request"></a>

```
$ aws apprunner delete-observability-configuration --cli-input-json "`cat`"
{
  "ObservabilityConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:observabilityconfiguration/xray-tracing/1"
}
```

#### Sample Response
<a name="API_DeleteObservabilityConfiguration_Example_2_Response"></a>

```
{
  "ObservabilityConfiguration": {
    "ObservabilityConfigurationArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:observabilityconfiguration/xray-tracing/1/2f50e7656d7819fead0f59672e68042e",
    "ObservabilityConfigurationName": "xray-tracing",
    "ObservabilityConfigurationRevision": 1,
    "CreatedAt": "2020-11-03T00:29:17Z",
    "DeletedAt": "2021-03-02T08:07:06Z",
    "Latest": false,
    "Status": "INACTIVE",
    "TraceConfiguration": {
        "Vendor": "AWSXRAY"
    }
  }
}
```
