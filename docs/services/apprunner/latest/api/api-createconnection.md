# CreateConnection
<a name="API_CreateConnection"></a>

**Important**
 AWS App Runner will no longer be open to new customers starting March 31, 2026. If you would like to use App Runner, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS App Runner availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/apprunner-availability-change.html).

Create an AWS App Runner connection resource. App Runner requires a connection resource when you create App Runner services that access private repositories from certain third-party providers. You can share a connection across multiple services.

A connection resource is needed to access GitHub and Bitbucket repositories. Both require a user interface approval process through the App Runner console before you can use the connection.

## Examples
<a name="API_CreateConnection_Examples"></a>

### Create a GitHub connection
<a name="API_CreateConnection_Example_1"></a>

This example illustrates how to create a connection to a private GitHub code repository. The connection status after a successful call is `PENDING_HANDSHAKE`. This is because an authentication handshake with the provider still hasn't happened. Complete the handshake using the App Runner console. For more information, see [Managing App Runner connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/manage-connections.html) in the * AWS App Runner Developer Guide*.

#### Sample Request
<a name="API_CreateConnection_Example_1_Request"></a>

```

{
  "ConnectionName": "my-github-connection",
  "ProviderType": "GITHUB"
}
```

#### Sample Response
<a name="API_CreateConnection_Example_1_Response"></a>

```
{
  "Connection": {
    "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/my-github-connection",
