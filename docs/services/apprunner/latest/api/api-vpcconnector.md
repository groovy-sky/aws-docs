# VpcConnector
<a name="API_VpcConnector"></a>

Describes an AWS App Runner VPC connector resource. A VPC connector describes the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) that an App Runner service is associated with, and the subnets and security group that are used.

Multiple revisions of a connector might have the same `Name` and different `Revision` values.

**Note**
At this time, App Runner supports only one revision per name.
