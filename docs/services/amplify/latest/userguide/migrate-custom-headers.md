# Migrating custom headers out of the build specification and amplify.yml
<a name="migrate-custom-headers"></a>

Previously, custom HTTP headers were specified for an app either by editing the build specification in the Amplify console or by downloading and updating the `amplify.yml` file and saving it in the project 's root directory. It is strongly recommended that you migrate your custom headers out of the build specification and the `amplify.yml` file.

Specify your custom headers in the **Custom headers** section of the Amplify console or by downloading and editing the `customHttp.yml` file.

**To migrate custom headers stored in the Amplify console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [ Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

1. Choose the app to perform the custom header migration on.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, **Build settings**. In the **App build specification** section, you can review your app's buildspec.

1. Choose **Download** to save a copy of your current buildspec. You can reference this copy later if you need to recover any settings.

1. When the download is complete, choose **Edit**.

1. Take note of the custom header information in the file, as you will use it later in step 9. In the **Edit** window, delete any custom headers from the file and choose **Save**.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, **Custom headers**.

1. On the **Custom headers** page, choose **Edit**.

1. In the **Edit custom headers** window, enter the information for your custom headers that you deleted in step 6.

1. Choose **Save**.

1. Redeploy any branch that you want the new custom headers to be applied to.

**To migrate custom headers from amplify.yml to customHttp.yml**

1. Navigate to the `amplify.yml` file currently deployed in your app's root directory.

1. Open `amplify.yml` in the code editor of your choice.

1. Take note of the custom header information in the file, as you will use it later in step 8. Delete the custom headers in the file. Save and close the file.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

1. Choose the app to set custom headers for.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, **Custom headers**.

1. On the **Custom headers** page, choose **Download**.

1. Open the downloaded `customHttp.yml` file in the code editor of your choice and enter the information for your custom headers that you deleted from `amplify.yml` in step 3.

1. Save the edited `customHttp.yml` file in your project's root directory. If you are working with a monorepo, save the file in the root of your repo.

1. Redeploy the app to apply the new custom headers.
   + For a CI/CD app, perform a new build from your Git repository that includes the new `customHttp.yml` file.
   + For a manual deploy app, deploy the app again in the Amplify console and include the new `customHttp.yml` file with artifacts that you upload.

**Note**
Custom headers set in the `customHttp.yml` file and deployed in the app's root directory override the custom headers defined in the **Custom headers** section of the Amplify console.
