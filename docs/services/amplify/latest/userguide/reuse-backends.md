# Use Amplify backends across apps (Gen 1 apps only)

###### Note

The information in this section is for Gen 1 apps only. If you want to share backend
resources for a Gen 2 app, see [Share resources across branches](https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/share-resources) in the _Amplify_
_docs_

Amplify enables you to reuse existing backend environments across all of your Gen 1
apps in a given region. You can do this when you create a new app, connect a new branch to
an existing app, or update an existing frontend to point to a different backend
environment.

## Reuse backends when creating a new app

###### To reuse a backend when creating a new Amplify app

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. To create a new backend to use for this example, do the following:
1. In the navigation pane, choose **All apps**.

2. Choose **New app**, **Build an**
      **app**.

3. Enter a name for your app, such as
       `Example-Amplify-App`.

4. Choose **Confirm deployment**.
3. To connect a frontend to your new backend, choose the **Hosting**
**environments** tab.

4. Choose your git provider, and then choose **Connect**
**branch**.

5. On the **Add repository branch** page, for **Recently**
**updated repositories**, choose your repository name. For
    **Branch**, select the branch from your repository to
    connect.

6. On the **Build settings**, page do the following:
1. For **App name**, select the app to use for adding a
       backend environment. You can choose the current app or any other app in the
       current region.

2. For **Environment**, select the name of the backend
       environment to add. You can use an existing environment or create a new
       one.

3. By default, full-stack CI/CD is turned off. Turning off full-stack CI/CD
       causes the app to run in _pull only_ mode. At build time,
       Amplify will automatically generate the `aws-exports.js` file
       only, without modifying your backend environment.

4. Select an existing service role to give Amplify the permissions it
       requires to make changes to your app backend. If you need to create a
       service role, choose **Create new role**. For more
       information about creating a service role, see [Adding a service role with permissions to deploy backend resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/amplify-service-role.html).

5. Choose **Next**.
7. Choose **Save and deploy**.

## Reuse backends when connecting a branch to an existing app

###### To reuse a backend when connecting a branch to an existing Amplify app

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

02. Choose the app to connect a new branch to.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **App Settings**,
     **General**.

04. In the **Branches** section, choose **Connect a**
    **branch**.

05. On the **Add repository branch** page, for
     **Branch**, select the branch from your repository to
     connect.

06. For **App name**, select the app to use for adding a backend
     environment. You can choose the current app or any other app in the current
     region.

07. For **Environment**, select the name of the backend
     environment to add. You can use an existing environment or create a new
     one.

08. If you need to set up a service role to give Amplify the permissions it
     requires to make changes to your app backend, the console prompts you to perform
     this task. For more information about creating a service role, see [Adding a service role with permissions to deploy backend resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/amplify-service-role.html).

09. By default, full-stack CI/CD is turned off. Turning off full-stack CI/CD causes
     the app to run in _pull only_ mode. At build time, Amplify
     will automatically generate the `aws-exports.js` file only, without
     modifying your backend environment.

10. Choose **Next**.

11. Choose **Save and deploy**.

## Edit an existing frontend to point to a different backend

###### To edit a frontend Amplify app to point to a different backend

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. Choose the app to edit the backend for.

3. Choose the **Hosting environments** tab.

4. Locate the branch to edit and choose **Edit**.

![The location of the Edit link for a branch in the Amplify console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/amplify_edit_backend.png)

5. On the **Select a backend environment to use with this**
**branch** page, for **App name**, select the frontend
    app that you want to edit the backend environment for. You can choose the current
    app or any other app in the current region.

6. For **Backend environment**, select the name of the backend
    environment to add.

7. By default, full-stack CI/CD is enabled. Uncheck this option to turn off
    full-stack CI/CD for this backend. Turning off full-stack CI/CD causes the app to
    run in _pull only_ mode. At build time, Amplify will
    automatically generate the `aws-exports.js` file only, without
    modifying the backend environment.

8. Choose **Save**. Amplify applies these changes the next time
    you build the app.
