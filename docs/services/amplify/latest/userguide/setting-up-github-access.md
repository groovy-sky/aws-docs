# Setting up Amplify access to GitHub repositories

Amplify now uses the GitHub Apps feature to authorize Amplify read-only access to GitHub
repositories. With the Amplify GitHub App, permissions are more fine-tuned, enabling you to
grant Amplify access to only the repositories that you specify. To learn more about GitHub
Apps, see [About GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps) on the GitHub website.

When you connect a new app stored in a GitHub repo, by default Amplify uses the GitHub App
to access the repo. However, existing Amplify apps that you previously connected from GitHub
repos use OAuth for access. CI/CD will continue to work for these apps, but we highly recommend
that you migrate them to use the new Amplify GitHub App.

When you deploy a new app or migrate an existing app using the Amplify console, you are
automatically directed to the installation location for the Amplify GitHub App. To manually access the installation landing
page for the app, open a web browser and navigate to the app by region. Use the format
`https://github.com/apps/aws-amplify-REGION`,
replacing `REGION` with the region where you will deploy your Amplify
app. For example, to install the Amplify GitHub App in the US West (Oregon) region, navigate to https://github.com/apps/aws-amplify-us-west-2.

## Installing and authorizing the Amplify GitHub App for a new deployment

When you deploy a new app to Amplify from existing code in a GitHub repo, use the
following instructions to install and authorize the GitHub App.

###### To install and authorize the Amplify GitHub App

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

02. From the **All apps** page, choose **New app**, then
     **Host web app**.

03. On the **Get started with Amplify Hosting** page, choose
     **GitHub**, then choose **Continue**.

04. If this is the first time connecting a GitHub repository, A new page opens in your
     browser on GitHub.com, requesting permission to authorize AWS Amplify in your GitHub
     account. Choose **Authorize**.

05. Next, you must install the Amplify GitHub App in your GitHub account. A page opens
     on Github.com requesting permission to install and authorize AWS Amplify in your GitHub
     account.

06. Select the GitHub account where you want to install the Amplify GitHub App.

07. Do one of the following:
    - To apply the installation to all repositories, choose **All**
      **repositories**.

    - To limit the installation to the specific repositories that you select, choose
       **Only select repositories**. Make sure to include the repo for the
       app that you are migrating in the repos that you select.
08. Choose **Install & Authorize**.

09. You are redirected to the **Add repository branch** page for your app
     in the Amplify console.

10. In the **Recently updated repositories** list, select the name of the
     repository to connect.

11. In the **Branch** list, select the name of the repository branch to
     connect.

12. Choose **Next**.

13. On the **Configure build settings** page, choose
     **Next**.

14. On the **Review** page, choose **Save and**
    **deploy**.

## Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App

Existing Amplify apps that you previously connected from GitHub repositories use OAuth
for repo access. We strongly recommend that you migrate these apps to use the Amplify GitHub
App.

Use the following instructions to migrate an app and delete its corresponding OAuth
webhook in your GitHub account. Note that the procedure for migrating varies depending on
whether the Amplify GitHub app is already installed. After you migrate your first app and
install and authorize the GitHub App, you only need to update the repository permissions for
subsequent app migrations.

###### To migrate an app from OAuth to the GitHub App

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

02. Choose the app that you want to migrate.

03. On the app's information page, locate the blue **Migrate to our GitHub**
    **App** message and choose **Start migration**.

04. On the **Install and authorize GitHub App** page, choose
     **Configure GitHub App**.

05. A new page opens in your browser on GitHub.com, requesting permission to authorize
     AWS Amplify in your GitHub account. Choose **Authorize**.

06. Select the GitHub account where you want to install the Amplify GitHub App.

07. Do one of the following:
    - To apply the installation to all repositories, choose **All**
      **repositories**.

    - To limit the installation to the specific repositories that you select, choose
       **Only select repositories**. Make sure to include the repo for the
       app that you are migrating in the repositories that you select.
08. Choose **Install & Authorize**.

09. You are redirected to the **Install and authorize GitHub App** page
     for your app in the Amplify console. If GitHub authorization was successful, you will
     see a success message. Choose, **Next**.

10. On the **Complete installation** page, choose **Complete**
    **installation**. This step deletes your existing webhook, creates a new one, and
     completes the migration.

## Setting up the Amplify GitHub App for CloudFormation, CLI, and SDK deployments

Existing Amplify apps that you previously connected from GitHub repositories use OAuth
for repo access. This can include apps that you deployed using the Amplify Command Line
Interface (CLI), CloudFormation, or the SDKs. We strongly recommend that you migrate these apps to use
the new Amplify GitHub App. Migration must be performed in the Amplify console in the
AWS Management Console. For instructions, see [Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App](#migrating-to-github-app-auth).

You can use CloudFormation, the Amplify CLI, and the SDKs to deploy a new Amplify app that uses
the GitHub App for repo access. This process requires that you first install the Amplify
GitHub App in your GitHub account. Next, you will need to generate a personal access token in
your GitHub account. Lastly, deploy the app and specify the personal access token.

###### Install the Amplify GitHub App in your account

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the installation location for the Amplify GitHub
    App in the AWS Region where you will deploy your app.

Use the format
    `https://github.com/apps/aws-amplify-REGION/installations/new`,
    replacing `REGION` with your own input. For example, if you are
    installing your app in the US West (Oregon) region, specify
    `https://github.com/apps/aws-amplify-us-west-2/installations/new`.

2. Select the GitHub account where you want to install the Amplify GitHub app.

3. Do one of the following:
   - To apply the installation to all repositories, choose **All**
     **repositories**.

   - To limit the installation to the specific repositories that you select, choose
      **Only select repositories**. Make sure to include the repo for the
      app that you are migrating in the repos that you select.
4. Choose **Install**.

###### Generate a personal access token in your GitHub account

1. Sign in to your GitHub account.

2. In the upper right corner, locate your profile photo and choose
    **Settings** from the menu.

3. In the left navigation menu, choose **Developer settings**.

4. On the **GitHub Apps** page, in the left navigation menu, choose
    **Personal access tokens**.

5. On the **Personal access tokens** page, choose **Generate new**
**token**.

6. On the **New personal access token** page, for
    **Note** enter a descriptive name for the token.

7. In the **Select scopes** section, select
    **admin:repo\_hook**.

8. Choose **Generate token**.

9. Copy and save the personal access token. You will need to provide it when you deploy
    an Amplify app with the CLI, CloudFormation, or the SDKs.

After the Amplify GitHub app is installed in your GitHub account and you have generated
a personal access token, you can deploy a new app with the Amplify CLI, CloudFormation, or the SDKs.
Use the `accessToken` field to specify the personal access token that you created
in the previous procedure. For more information, see [CreateApp](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/APIReference/API_CreateApp.html#API_CreateApp_RequestSyntax) in the _Amplify API reference_ and [AWS::Amplify::App](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-amplify-app.html) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

The following CLI command deploys a new Amplify app that uses the GitHub App for
repository access. Replace `myapp-using-githubapp`,
`https://github.com/Myaccount/react-app`, and
`MY_TOKEN` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws amplify create-app --name myapp-using-githubapp --repository https://github.com/Myaccount/react-app --access-token MY_TOKEN

```

## Setting up web previews with the Amplify GitHub App

A web preview deploys every pull request (PR) made to your GitHub repository to a unique
preview URL. Previews now use the Amplify GitHub App for access to your GitHub repo. For
instructions on installing and authorizing the GitHub App for web previews, see [Enable web previews for pull requests](pr-previews.md#enable-web-previews) .
