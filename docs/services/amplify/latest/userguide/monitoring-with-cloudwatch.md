# Monitoring an Amplify application with Amazon CloudWatch

AWS Amplify is integrated with Amazon CloudWatch, enabling you to monitor metrics for your
Amplify applications in near real-time, and create alarms that send notifications when a
metric exceeds a threshold you set. For more information about how the CloudWatch service works,
see the [Amazon CloudWatch User\
Guide](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/whatiscloudwatch.md).

## Supported CloudWatch metrics

Amplify supports seven CloudWatch metrics in the `AWS/AmplifyHosting`
namespace for monitoring traffic, errors, data transfer, latency, and request tokens for
your apps. These metrics are aggregated at one minute intervals. CloudWatch monitoring metrics
are free of charge and don't count against the [CloudWatch service\
quotas](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-limits.md).

The following table describes each supported metric and lists the most relevant
statistics. Not all available statistics are applicable for every metric.

MetricDescription

Requests

The total number of viewer requests received by your app.

The most relevant statistic is `Sum`. Use the
`Sum` statistic to get the total number of requests.

BytesDownloaded

The total amount of data transferred out of your app (downloaded) in
bytes by viewers for `GET`, `HEAD`, and
`OPTIONS` requests.

The most relevant statistic is `Sum`.

BytesUploaded

The total amount of data transferred into your app (uploaded) in bytes
for any request, including headers.

Amplify doesn't charge you for data uploaded in your
applications.

The most relevant statistic is `Sum`.

4xxErrors

The number of requests that returned an error in the HTTP status code
400-499 range.

The most relevant statistic is `Sum`. Use the
`Sum` statistic to get the total occurrences of these
errors.

5xxErrors

The number of requests that returned an error in the HTTP status code
500-599 range.

The most relevant statistic is `Sum`. Use the
`Sum` statistic to get the total occurrences of these
errors.

Latency

The time to first byte in seconds. This is the total time between when
Amplify Hosting receives a request and when it returns a response to
the network. This doesn't include the network latency encountered for a
response to reach the viewer's device.

The most relevant statistics are `Average`,
`Maximum`, `Minimum`, `p10`,
`p50`, `p90`, `p95`, and
`p100`.

Use the `Average` statistic to evaluate expected
latencies.

TokensConsumed

The request tokens consumed by your app.

The `Sum` statistic represents total request token
consumption. You can compare this statistic to your current `Request
                              tokens per second` service quota to determine whether you need
to request a quota increase to avoid potential throttling during a future
high traffic event.

The `Average` statistic represents request token
consumption across normal and peak times. Higher token consumption
typically leads to longer time to first byte (TTFB). Therefore, you can
use this statistic when evaluating your application's latency. If your
latency is poor, you can improve your downstream APIs to reduce your
token consumption and avoid the throttling that can occur when token
consumption exceeds your application's `Request tokens per
                              second` service quota.

For more information about the `Request tokens per
                              second` service quota, see [Amplify Hosting service quotas](quotas-chapter.md).

Amplify provides the following CloudWatch metric dimensions.

DimensionDescription

App

Metric data is provided by app.

AWS account

Metric data is provided across all apps in the AWS account.

## Accessing CloudWatch metrics

You can access CloudWatch metrics directly from the Amplify console using the following
procedure.

###### Note

You can also access CloudWatch metrics in the AWS Management Console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

###### To access metrics in the Amplify console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. Choose the app that you want to view metrics for.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Monitoring**, then choose
    **Metrics**.

## Creating CloudWatch alarms

You can create CloudWatch alarms in the Amplify console that send notifications when
specific criteria are met. An alarm watches a single CloudWatch metric and sends an Amazon Simple Notification Service
notification when the metric breaches the threshold for a specified number of evaluation
periods.

You can create more advanced alarms that use metric math expressions in the CloudWatch
console or using the CloudWatch APIs. For example, you can create an alarm that notifies you
when the percentage of 4xxErrors exceeds 15% for three consecutive
periods. For more information, see [Creating a CloudWatch Alarm Based on a Metric Math Expression](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/create-alarm-on-metric-math-expression.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

Standard CloudWatch pricing applies to alarms. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

Use the following procedure to create an alarm in the Amplify console.

###### To create a CloudWatch alarm for an Amplify metric

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. Choose the app that you want to set an alarm on.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Monitoring**, then choose
    **Alarms**.

4. On the **Alarms** page, choose **Create**
**alarm**.

5. In the **Create alarm** window, configure your alarm as
    follows:
1. For **Metric**, choose the name of the metric to monitor
       from the list.

2. For **Name of alarm**, enter a meaningful name for the
       alarm. For example, if you are monitoring _Requests_, you
       could name the alarm `HighTraffic`. The name must
       contain only ASCII characters.

3. For **Set up notifications**, do one of the
       following:
      1. Choose **New** to set up a new Amazon SNS
                topic.

      2. For **Email address**, enter the email
          address for the recipient of the notifications.

      3. Choose **Add new email address** to add
          additional recipients.
      1. Choose **Existing** to reuse an Amazon SNS
                topic.

      2. For **SNS topic**, select the name of an
          existing Amazon SNS topic from the list.
4. For **Whenever the _Statistic_ of**
      **_Metric_**, set the conditions for your
       alarm as follows:
      1. Specify whether the metric must be greater than, less than, or
          equal to the threshold value.

      2. Specify the threshold value.

      3. Specify the number of consecutive evaluation periods that must be
          in the alarm state to invoke the alarm.

      4. Specify the length of time of the evaluation period.
5. Choose **Confirm**.

###### Note

Each Amazon SNS recipient that you specify receives a confirmation email from AWS
Notifications. The email contains a link that the recipient must follow to confirm
their subscription and receive notifications.

## Accessing CloudWatch Logs for SSR apps

Amplify sends information about your SSR runtime to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in your
AWS account. When you deploy an SSR app to Amplify Hosting compute, the app requires
an IAM service role that Amplify assumes when calling other services on your behalf.
You can either allow Amplify Hosting compute to automatically create a service role
for you or you can specify a role that you have created.

If you choose to allow Amplify to create an IAM role for you, the role will
already have the permissions to create CloudWatch Logs. If you create your own IAM role, you
will need to add the following permissions to your policy to allow Amplify to access
Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

```nohighlight

logs:CreateLogStream
logs:CreateLogGroup
logs:DescribeLogGroups
logs:PutLogEvents
```

For more information about adding a service role, see [Adding a service role with permissions to deploy backend resources](amplify-service-role.md). For more
information about deploying server-side rendered apps, see [Deploying server-side rendered applications with Amplify Hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/server-side-rendering-amplify.html).

You can view the Amplify Hosting compute logs for an SSR application in the CloudWatch
console or in the Amplify console. Use the following instructions to view the logs in
the Amplify console.

###### To view CloudWatch logs for an SSR application in the Amplify console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. Choose the SSR app to view the CloudWatch logs for.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Monitoring**, then choose
    **Hosting compute logs**.

4. On the **Hosting compute logs** page, search and select a CloudWatch
    log group for a specific branch.
