# Deploy a SvelteKit app to Amplify Hosting

Use the following instructions to deploy a SvelteKit application to Amplify Hosting.
You can use your own application, or create a starter app. For more information, see [Creating a project](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/creating-a-project) in the
_SvelteKit documentation_.

To deploy a SvelteKit app with SSR to Amplify Hosting, you must add an adapter to your
project. We do not maintain an Amplify owned adapter for the SvelteKit framework. In this
example, we are using the `amplify-adapter` created by a member of the
community. The adapter is available at [github.com/gzimbron/amplify-adapter](https://github.com/gzimbron/amplify-adapter) on the GitHub website. AWS does not
maintain this adapter.

###### To deploy a SvelteKit app to Amplify Hosting

01. On your local computer, navigate to the SvelteKit application to deploy.

02. To install the adapter, open a terminal window and run the following command. This
     example uses the community adapter available at [github.com/gzimbron/amplify-adapter](https://github.com/gzimbron/amplify-adapter). If you are using a different
     community adapter, replace `amplify-adapter` with the name
     of your adapter.

    ```nohighlight

    npm install amplify-adapter
    ```

03. In the project folder for your SvelteKit app, open the
     `svelte.config.js` file. Edit the file to use the
     `amplify-adapter` or replace
     `'amplify-adapter'` with the name of your adapter. The
     file should look like the following.

    ```nohighlight

    import adapter from 'amplify-adapter';
    import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte';

    /** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
    const config = {
            // Consult https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/integrations#preprocessors
            // for more information about preprocessors
            preprocess: vitePreprocess(),

            kit: {
                    // adapter-auto only supports some environments, see https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto for a list.
                    // If your environment is not supported, or you settled on a specific environment, switch out the adapter.
                    // See https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters for more information about adapters.
                    adapter: adapter()
            }
    };

    export default config;
    ```

04. Commit the change and push the application to your Git repository.

05. Now you are ready to deploy your SvelteKit app to Amplify.

    Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify\
     console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

06. On the **All apps** page, choose **Create new**
    **app**.

07. On the **Start building with Amplify** page, choose your Git
     repository provider, then choose **Next**.

08. On the **Add repository branch** page, do the following:
    1. Select the name of the repository to connect.

    2. Select the name of the repository branch to connect.

    3. Choose **Next**.
09. On the **App settings** page, locate the **Build**
    **settings** section. For **Build output directory** enter
     `build`.

10. You must also update the app's frontend build commands in the build
     specification. To open the build specification, choose **Edit YML file**.

11. In the `amplify.yml` file, locate the frontend build commands
     section. Enter `- cd build/compute/default/` and `-
                      npm i --production`.

    Your build settings file should look like the following.

    ```nohighlight

    version: 1
    frontend:
        phases:
            preBuild:
                commands:
                - 'npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline'
        build:
            commands:
                - 'npm run build'
                - 'cd build/compute/default/'
                - 'npm i --production'

    artifacts:
        baseDirectory: build
        files:
            - '**/*'
    cache:
        paths:
            - '.npm/**/*'

```

12. Choose **Save**.

13. If you want Amplify to be able to deliver app logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, you must
     explicitly enable this in the console. Open the **Advanced**
    **settings** section, then choose **Enable SSR app logs**
     in the **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) deployment** section.

14. Choose **Next**.

15. On the **Review** page, choose **Save and**
    **deploy**.
