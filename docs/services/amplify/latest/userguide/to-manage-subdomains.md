# Managing subdomains
<a name="to-manage-subdomains"></a>

A subdomain is the part of your URL that appears before your domain name. For example, **www** is the subdomain of **www.amazon.com** and **aws** is the subdomain of **aws.amazon.com**. If you already have a production website, you might want to only connect a subdomain. Subdomains can also be multilevel, for example **beta.alpha.example.com** has the multilevel subdomain **beta.alpha**.
