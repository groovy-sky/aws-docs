# How Amplify applies cache configuration to an app
<a name="cache-configuration-type"></a>

To manage caching for your app, Amplify determines the type of content that is being served by examining the app's platform type and rewrite rules. For `Compute` apps, Amplify also examines the routing rules in the deployment manifest.

**Note**
The app's platform type is set by Amplify Hosting during deployment. An SSG (static) app is set to the platform type `WEB`. An SSR app (Next.js 12 or later) is set to the platform type `WEB_COMPUTE`.

Amplify identifies the following four types of content and applies the specified managed cache policy.

**Static**
The content served from apps with the `WEB` platform, or the static routes in a `WEB_COMPUTE` app.
This content uses the Amplify-StaticContent cache policy.

**Image Optimization**
The images served by the `ImageOptimization` routes in a `WEB_COMPUTE` app.
This content uses the Amplify-ImageOptimization cache policy.

**Compute**
The content served by the `Compute` routes in a `WEB_COMPUTE` app. This includes all server-side rendered (SSR) content.
This content uses either the Amplify-Default or Amplify-DefaultNoCookies cache policy depending on the value of `cacheConfig.type` that is set on your Amplify `App`.

**Reverse Proxy**
The content served by paths that match a reverse proxy rewrite custom rule. For more information about creating this custom rule, see [Reverse proxy rewrite](redirect-rewrite-examples.md#reverse-proxy-rewrite) in the *Using redirects* chapter.
This content uses either the Amplify-Default or Amplify-DefaultNoCookies cache policy depending on the value of `cacheConfig.type` that is set on your Amplify `App`.

## Understanding Amplify's managed cache policies

Amplify uses the following predefined managed cache policies to optimize the default cache configuration for your hosted applications.
+ Amplify-Default
