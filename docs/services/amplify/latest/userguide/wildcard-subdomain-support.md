# Setting up wildcard subdomains

Amplify Hosting now supports wildcard subdomains. A wildcard subdomain is a catch-all
subdomain that enables you to point existing and non-existing subdomains to a specific
branch of your application. When you use a wildcard to associate all subdomains in an app
to a specific branch, you can serve the same content to your app's users in any subdomain
and avoid configuring each subdomain individually.

To create a wildcard subdomain, specify an asterisk (\*) as the subdomain name. For
example, if you specify the wildcard subdomain `*.example.com` for a specific
branch of your app, any URL that ends with example.com will be routed to the branch. In
this case, requests for `dev.example.com` and `prod.example.com` will
be routed to the `*.example.com` subdomain.

Note that Amplify supports wildcard subdomains only for a custom domain. You can't use
this feature with the default `amplifyapp.com` domain.

The following requirements apply to wildcard subdomains:

- The subdomain name must be specified with an asterisk (\*) only.

- You can't use a wildcard to replace part of a subdomain name, like this:
\*domain.example.com.

- You can't replace a subdomain in the middle of a domain name, like this:
subdomain.\*.example.com.

- By default, all Amplify provisioned certificates cover all subdomains for a
custom domain.

## To add or delete a wildcard subdomain

After adding a custom domain to an app, you can add a wildcard subdomain for an app
branch.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify Hosting console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. Choose your app that you want to manage wildcard subdomains for.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosting**, and then choose
    **Custom domains**.

4. On the **Custom domains** page, choose **Domain**
**configuration**.

5. In the **Subdomains** section, you can add or delete wildcard
    subdomains.
   - To add a new wildcard subdomain
     1. Choose **Add new**.

     2. For the subdomain, enter an `*`.

     3. For your app branch, select a branch name from the list.

     4. Choose **Save**.
   - To delete a wildcard subdomain
     1. Choose **Remove** next to the subdomain name.
         Traffic to a subdomain that is not explicitly configured stops, and
         Amplify Hosting returns a 404 status code to those requests.

     2. Choose **Save**.
