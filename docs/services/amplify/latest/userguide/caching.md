# Managing the cache configuration for an app

Amplify uses Amazon CloudFront to manage the caching configuration for your hosted applications. A
cache configuration is applied to each app to optimize for the best performance.

On August 13, 2024, Amplify released improvements to caching efficiency for applications. For more information, see [CDN Caching Improvements for Better App Performance with AWS Amplify Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/cdn-caching-improvements-for-better-app-performance-with-aws-amplify-hosting).

The following table summarizes Amplify support for specific caching behaviors before and
after the caching improvements release.

You can add custom headers for an app in the Amplify console or in a `customHeaders.yaml` file. One of the headers that you can override is
`Cache-Control`. For more information, see [Setting custom headers for an Amplify app](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-headers.html).

Yes

Yes

Amplify respects the `Cache-Control` headers that you define in a `customHeaders.yaml` file and they take precedence over Amplify's
default cache settings.

YesYes

Amplify respects the `Cache-Control` headers set within an application’s framework for dynamic routes (for example, Next.js SSR routes). If a
`Cache-Control` header is set in the app's `customHeaders.yaml` file, this takes precedence over settings in the
`next.config.js` file.

Yes

Each new CI/CD app deployment clears the cache.

Yes

Yes

You can turn on performance mode for an app.

Yes

No

The performance mode setting is no longer available in the
Amplify console. However, you can create a `Cache-Control` header that sets the
`s-maxage` directive. For instructions, see [Using the Cache-Control header to increase app performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/Using-headers-to-control-cache-duration.html).

The following table lists the changes to the default values for specific cache
settings.
