# Automatic build-time generation of Amplify config (Gen 1 apps only)
<a name="amplify-config-autogeneration"></a>

**Note**
The information in this section is for Gen 1 apps only. If you want to automatically deploy infrastructure and application code changes from feature branches for a Gen 2 app, see [Fullstack branch deployments](https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/branch-deployments/) in the *Amplify docs*

Amplify supports the automatic build-time generation of the Amplify config `aws-exports.js` file for Gen 1 apps. By turning off full stack CI/CD deployments, you enable your app to autogenerate the `aws-exports.js` file and ensure that updates are not made to your backend at build-time.

**To autogenerate `aws-exports.js` at build-time**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

1. Choose the app to edit.

1. Choose the **Hosting environments** tab.

1. Locate the branch to edit and choose **Edit**.

1. On the **Edit target backend** page, uncheck **Enable full-stack continuous deployments (CI/CD)** to turn off full-stack CI/CD for this backend.

1. Select an existing service role to give Amplify the permissions it requires to make changes to your app backend. If you need to create a service role, choose **Create new role**. For more information about creating a service role, see [Adding a service role with permissions to deploy backend resources](amplify-service-role.md).

1. Choose **Save**. Amplify applies these changes the next time you build the app.
