# Web previews for pull requests

Web previews offer development and quality assurance (QA) teams a way to preview changes
from pull requests (PRs) before merging code to a production or integration branch. Pull
requests let you tell others about changes you’ve pushed to a branch in a repository. After a
pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators
and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

A web preview deploys every pull request made to your repository to a unique preview URL
which is completely different from the URL your main site uses. For apps with backend
environments provisioned using the Amplify CLI or Amplify Studio, every pull request
( **private Git repositories only**) creates a temporary
backend that is deleted when the PR is closed.

When web previews are turned on for your app, each PR counts toward the Amplify quota of
50 branches per app. To avoid exceeding this quota, make sure to close your PRs. For more
information about quotas, see [Amplify Hosting service quotas](quotas-chapter.md).

###### Note

Currently, the `AWS_PULL_REQUEST_ID` environment variable
is not available when using AWS CodeCommit as your repository provider.

**Web preview security**

For security purposes, you can enable web previews on all apps with private
repositories, but not on all apps with public repositories. If your Git repository is public,
you can set up previews only for apps that don't require an IAM service role. For example,
apps with backends and apps that are deployed to the `WEB_COMPUTE` hosting platform
require an IAM service role. Therefore, you can't enable web previews for these types of
apps if their repository is public. Amplify enforces this restriction to prevent third
parties from submitting arbitrary code that would run using your app's IAM role
permissions.

When web previews are enabled for an application in a public repository, with an SSR
Compute role, you need to carefully manage which branches can access the role. We recommend
that you don't use an app-level role. Instead, you should attach a Compute role at the
branch-level. This allows you to grant permissions only to the branches that require access to
specific resources. For more information, see [Adding an SSR Compute role to allow access to AWS resources](amplify-ssr-compute-role.md) .

## Enable web previews for pull requests

For apps stored in a GitHub repo, web previews use the Amplify GitHub App for repo access.
If you are enabling web previews on an existing Amplify app that you previously deployed
from a GitHub repo using OAuth for access, you must first migrate the app to use the
Amplify GitHub App. For migration instructions, see [Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App](setting-up-github-access.md#migrating-to-github-app-auth).

###### To enable web previews for pull requests

1. Choose **Hosting**, then **Previews**.

###### Note

**Previews** is visible in the **App**
**settings** menu only when an app is set up for continuous deployment
and connected to a git repository. For instructions on this type of deployment,
see [Getting started with existing\
code](getting-started.md).

2. For GitHub repositories only, do the following to install and authorize the
    Amplify GitHub App in your account:
1. In the **Install GitHub App to enable previews** window,
       choose **Install GitHub app**.

2. Select the GitHub account where you want to configure the Amplify GitHub
       App.

3. A page opens on Github.com to configure repository permissions for your
       account.

4. Do one of the following:
      - To apply the installation to all repositories, choose **All**
        **repositories**.

      - To limit the installation to the specific repositories that you
         select, choose **Only select repositories**. Make sure
         to include the repo for the app that you are enabling web previews for in
         the repositories that you select.
5. Choose **Save**
3. After you enable previews for your repo, return to the Amplify console to enable
    previews for specific branches. On the **Previews** page, select a
    branch from the list and choose **Edit settings**.

4. On the **Manage preview settings** page, turn on **Pull**
**request previews**. Then choose **Confirm**.

5. For fullstack applications do one of the following:
   - Choose, **Create new backend environment for every Pull**
     **Request**. This option enables you to test changes without
      impacting production.

   - Choose **Point all Pull Requests for this branch to an existing**
     **environment**.
6. Choose **Confirm**.

The next time you submit a pull request for the branch, Amplify builds and deploys
your PR to a preview URL. After the pull request is closed, the preview URL is deleted, and any temporary backend
environment linked to the pull request is deleted. For GitHub repositories only, you can access a preview of your URL directly from the
pull request in your GitHub account.

## Web preview access with subdomains

Web previews for pull requests are accessible with subdomains for an Amplify app that
is connected to a custom domain managed by Amazon Route 53. When the pull request is closed,
branches and subdomains associated with the pull request are automatically deleted. This is
the default behavior for web previews after you set up pattern-based feature branch
deployments for your app. For instructions on setting up automatic subdomains, see [Setting up automatic subdomains for an Amazon Route 53 custom domain](to-set-up-automatic-subdomains-for-a-route-53-custom-domain.md).
