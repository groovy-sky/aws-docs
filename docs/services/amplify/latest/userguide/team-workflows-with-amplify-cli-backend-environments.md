# Team workflows with fullstack Amplify Gen 1 apps

A feature branch deployment consists of a **frontend**, and
an optional **backend** environment. The frontend is built and
deployed to a global content delivery network (CDN), while the backend is deployed by
Amplify Studio or the Amplify CLI to AWS. To learn how to set up this deployment
scenario, see [Building a backend for an application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/deploy-backend.html).

Amplify Hosting continuously deploys backend resources such as GraphQL APIs and Lambda
functions with your feature branch deployments. You can use the following branching models
to deploy your backend and frontend with Amplify Hosting.

## Feature branch workflow

- Create **prod**, **test**, and **dev** backend environments
with Amplify Studio or the Amplify CLI.

- Map the **prod** backend to the **main** branch.

- Map the **test** backend to the **develop** branch.

- Team members can use the **dev** backend
environment for testing individual **feature**
branches.

![A diagram that shows how to map relationships from backend environments to frontend branches.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/FeatureBranchWorkflow.png)

01. Install the Amplify CLI to initialize a new Amplify project.

    ```nohighlight

    npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
    ```

02. Initialize a _prod_ backend
     environment for your project. If you don’t have a project, create one using
     bootstrap tools like create-react-app or Gatsby.

    ```nohighlight

    create-react-app next-unicorn
    cd next-unicorn
    amplify init
     ? Do you want to use an existing environment? (Y/n): n
     ? Enter a name for the environment: prod
    ...
    amplify push
    ```

03. Add _test_ and _dev_ backend environments.

    ```nohighlight

    amplify env add
     ? Do you want to use an existing environment? (Y/n): n
     ? Enter a name for the environment: test
    ...
    amplify push

    amplify env add
     ? Do you want to use an existing environment? (Y/n): n
     ? Enter a name for the environment: dev
    ...
    amplify push
    ```

04. Push code to a Git repository of your choice (in this example we’ll assume you
     pushed to main).

    ```nohighlight

    git commit -am 'Added dev, test, and prod environments'
    git push origin main
    ```

05. Visit Amplify in the AWS Management Console to see your current backend environment.
     Navigate a level up from the breadcrumb to view a list of all backend environments
     created in the **Backend environments** tab.

    ![The Amplify console showing the backend environments associated with an Amplify app.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/reuse-backend-5.png)

06. Switch to the **Frontend environments** tab and
     connect your repository provider and _main_ branch.

07. On the build settings page, select an existing backend environment to set up
     continuous deployment with the main branch. Choose _prod_ from the list and grant the service
     role to Amplify. Choose **Save and deploy**. After
     the build completes you will get a main branch deployment available at _https://main.appid.amplifyapp.com_.

    ![The Configure build settings page with a list of existing backends.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/reuse-backend-2.png)

08. Connect _develop_ branch in Amplify
     (assume _develop_ and _main_ branch are the same at this point).
     Choose the _test_ backend
     environment.

    ![The Add repository branch page with a branch and backend environment selected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/reuse-backend-4.png)

09. Amplify is now set up. You can start working on new features in a feature
     branch. Add backend functionality by using the _dev_ backend environment from your local workstation.

    ```nohighlight

    git checkout -b newinternet
    amplify env checkout dev
    amplify add api
    ...
    amplify push
    ```

10. After you finish working on the feature, commit your code, create a pull
     request to review internally.

    ```nohighlight

    git commit -am 'Decentralized internet v0.1'
    git push origin newinternet
    ```

11. To preview what the changes will look like, go to the Amplify console and
     connect your feature branch. Note: If you have the AWS CLI installed on your system
     (Not the Amplify CLI), you can connect a branch directly from your terminal. You
     can find your appid by going to App settings > General > AppARN: _arn:aws:amplify:<region>:<region>:apps/<appid>_

    ```nohighlight

    aws amplify create-branch --app-id <appid> --branch-name <branchname>
    aws amplify start-job --app-id <appid> --branch-name <branchname> --job-type RELEASE
    ```

12. Your feature will be accessible at _https://newinternet.appid.amplifyapp.com_ to share with your
     teammates. If everything looks good merge the PR to the develop branch.

    ```nohighlight

    git checkout develop
    git merge newinternet
    git push
    ```

13. This will kickoff a build that will update the backend as well as the frontend
     in Amplify with a branch deployment at _https://dev.appid.amplifyapp.com_. You can share this link with
     internal stakeholders so they can review the new feature.

14. Delete your feature branch from Git, Amplify, and remove the backend
     environment from the cloud (you can always spin up a new one based on by running
     ‘amplify env checkout prod’ and running ‘amplify env add’).

    ```nohighlight

    git push origin --delete newinternet
    aws amplify delete-branch --app-id <appid> --branch-name <branchname>
    amplify env remove dev
    ```

## GitFlow workflow

GitFlow uses two branches to record the history of the project. The _main_ branch tracks release code only, and the
_develop_ branch is used as an integration
branch for new features. GitFlow simplifies parallel development by isolating new
development from completed work. New development (such as features and non-emergency bug
fixes) is done in _feature_ branches. When the
developer is satisfied that the code is ready for release, the _feature_ branch is merged back into the integration
_develop_ branch. The only commits to the
main branch are merges from _release_ branches
and _hotfix_ branches (to fix emergency
bugs).

The diagram below shows a recommended setup with GitFlow. You can follow the same
process as described in the feature branch workflow section above.

## Per-developer sandbox

- Each developer in a team creates a sandbox environment in the cloud that is
separate from their local computer. This allows developers to work in isolation
from each other without overwriting other team members’ changes.

- Each branch in Amplify has its own backend. This ensures that the Amplify
uses the Git repository as a single source of truth from which to deploy changes,
rather than relying on developers on the team to manually push their backend or
front end to production from their local computers.

1. Install the Amplify CLI to initialize a new Amplify project.

```nohighlight

npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

2. Initialize a _mary_ backend
    environment for your project. If you don’t have a project, create one using
    bootstrap tools like create-react-app or Gatsby.

```nohighlight

cd next-unicorn
amplify init
    ? Do you want to use an existing environment? (Y/n): n
    ? Enter a name for the environment: mary
...
amplify push
```

3. Push code to a Git repository of your choice (in this example we’ll assume you
    pushed to main.

```nohighlight

git commit -am 'Added mary sandbox'
git push origin main
```

4. Connect your repo > _main_ to
    Amplify.

5. The Amplify console will detect backend environments created by the Amplify
    CLI. Choose _Create new environment_
    from the dropdown and grant the service role to Amplify. Choose **Save and deploy**. After the build completes you will get
    a main branch deployment available at _https://main.appid.amplifyapp.com_ with a new backend environment
    that is linked to the branch.

6. Connect _develop_ branch in Amplify
    (assume _develop_ and _main_ branch are the same at this point) and
    choose _Create_
