# Amplify Hosting service quotas
<a name="quotas-chapter"></a>

The following are the service quotas for AWS Amplify Hosting. Service quotas (previously referred to as *limits*) are the maximum number of service resources or operations for your AWS account.

New AWS accounts have reduced apps and concurrent jobs quotas. AWS raises these quotas automatically based on your usage. You can also request a quota increase.

The Service Quotas console provides information about the quotas for your account. You can use the Service Quotas console to view default quotas and [request quota increases](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?) for adjustable quotas. For more information, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*.
