# Managing environment secrets

With the release of Amplify Gen 2, the workflow for environment secrets is streamlined
to centralize the management of secrets and environment variables in the Amplify console.
For instructions on setting and accessing secrets for an Amplify Gen 2 app, see [Secrets and environment vars](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/secrets-and-vars) in the _Amplify_
_Documentation_.

Environment secrets for a Gen 1 app are similar to environment variables, but they are
AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store key value pairs that can be encrypted. Some values must be
encrypted, such as the Sign in with Apple private key for Amplify.

## Using AWS Systems Manager to set environment secrets for an Amplify Gen 1 application

Use the following instructions to set an environment secret for a Gen 1 Amplify app
using the AWS Systems Manager console.

###### To set an environment secret

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AWS Systems Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Application Management**,
    then choose **Parameter Store**.

3. On the **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** page, choose
    **Create parameter**.

4. On the **Create parameter** page, in the **Parameter**
**details** section, do the following:
1. For **Name**, enter a parameter in the format
       `/amplify/{your_app_id}/{your_backend_environment_name}/{your_parameter_name}`.

2. For **Type**, choose
       **SecureString**.

3. For **KMS key source**, choose **My current**
      **account** to use the default key for your account.

4. For **Value**, enter your secret value to
       encrypt.
5. Choose, **Create parameter**.

###### Note

Amplify only has access to the keys under the
`/amplify/{your_app_id}/{your_backend_environment_name}` for the
specific environment build. You must specify the default AWS KMS key to allow
Amplify to decrypt the value.

## Accessing environment secrets for a Gen 1 application

Environment secrets for a Gen 1 application are stored in `process.env.secrets` as a JSON
string.

## Amplify environment secrets reference

Specify an Systems Manager parameter in the format
`/amplify/{your_app_id}/{your_backend_environment_name}/AMPLIFY_SIWA_CLIENT_ID`.

You can use the following environment secrets that are accessible by default within
the Amplify console.
