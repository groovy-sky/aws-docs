# Deploy a Next.js app to Amplify Hosting

This tutorial walks you through
building and deploying a Next.js application from a Git repository.

Before you begin this tutorial, complete the following prerequisites.

**Sign up for an AWS account**

If you are not already an AWS customer, you need to [create an\
AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) by following the online instructions. Signing up
enables you to access Amplify and other AWS services that you can use with
your application.

**Create an application**

Create a basic Next.js application to use for this tutorial, using the
[create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app) instructions in the _Next.js_
_documentation_.

**Create a Git repository**

Amplify supports GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and AWS CodeCommit. Push your
`create-next-app` application to your Git repository.

## Step 1: Connect a Git repository

In this step, you connect your Next.js application in a Git repository to Amplify
Hosting.

###### To connect an app in a Git repository

1. Open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. If you are deploying your first app in the current Region, by default you will
    start from the **AWS Amplify** service page.

Choose **Deploy an app** at the top of the page.

3. On the **Start building with Amplify** page, choose your Git
    repository provider, then choose **Next**.

For GitHub repositories, Amplify uses the GitHub Apps feature to authorize
    Amplify access. For more information about installing and authorizing the GitHub
    App, see [Setting up Amplify access to GitHub repositories](setting-up-github-access.md).

###### Note

After you authorize the Amplify console with Bitbucket, GitLab, or
AWS CodeCommit, Amplify fetches an access token from the repository provider, but
it _doesn’t store the token_ on the AWS servers. Amplify
accesses your repository using deploy keys installed in a specific repository
only.

4. On the **Add repository branch** page do the following:
1. Select the name of the repository to connect.

2. Select the name of the repository branch to connect.

3. Choose **Next**.

## Step 2: Confirm the build settings

Amplify automatically detects the sequence of build commands to run for the branch
you are deploying. In this step you review and confirm your build settings.

###### To confirm the build settings for an app

1. On the **App settings** page, locate the **Build**
**settings** section.

Verify that the **Frontend build command** and **Build**
**output directory** are correct. For this Next.js example app, the
    **Build output directory** is set to
    `.next`.

2. The procedure for adding a service role varies depending on whether you want to
    create a new role or use an existing one.
   - To create a new role:
     1. Choose **Create and use a new service**
        **role**.
   - To use an existing role:
     1. Choose **Use an existing role**.

     2. In the service role list, select the role to use.
3. Choose **Next**.

## Step 3: Deploy the application

In this step you deploy your app to the AWS global content delivery network
(CDN).

###### To save and deploy an app

1. On the **Review** page, confirm that your repository details
    and app settings are correct.

2. Choose **Save and deploy**. Your front end build typically
    takes 1 to 2 minutes, but can vary based on the size of the app.

3. When the deployment is complete, you can view your app using the link to the
    `amplifyapp.com` default domain.

###### Note

To augment the security of your Amplify applications, the
_amplifyapp.com_ domain is registered in the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/). For further
security, we recommend that you use cookies with a `__Host-` prefix if you
ever need to set sensitive cookies in the default domain name for your Amplify
applications. This practice will help to defend your domain against cross-site
request forgery attempts (CSRF). For more information see the [Set-Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) page in the Mozilla Developer Network.

## Step 4: (Optional) clean up resources

If you no longer need the app you deployed for the tutorial, you can delete it. This
step helps ensure that you aren't charged for resources that you aren't using.

###### To delete an app

1. From the **App settings** menu in the navigation pane, choose
    **General settings**.

2. On the **General settings** page, choose **Delete**
**app**.

3. In the confirmation window, enter `delete`. Then choose
    **Delete app**.

## Add features to your app

Now that you have an app deployed to Amplify, you can explore some of the following
features that are available to your hosted application.

**Environment variables**

Applications often need configuration information at runtime. These
configurations can be database connection details, API keys, or parameters.
Environment variables provide a way to expose these configurations at build
time. For more information, see [Environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html).

**Custom domains**

In this tutorial, Amplify hosts your app for you on the default
`amplifyapp.com` domain with a URL such as
`https://branch-name.d1m7bkiki6tdw1.amplifyapp.com`. When you
connect your app to a custom domain, users see that your app is hosted on a
custom URL, such as `https://www.example.com`. For more information,
see [Setting up custom domains](custom-domains.md).

**Pull request previews**

Web pull request previews offer teams a way to preview changes from pull
requests (PRs) before merging code to a production or integration branch. For
more information, see [Web previews for pull\
requests](pr-previews.md).

**Manage multiple environments**

To learn how Amplify works with feature branches and GitFlow workflows to
support multiple deployments, see [Feature\
branch deployments and team workflows](multi-environments.md).
