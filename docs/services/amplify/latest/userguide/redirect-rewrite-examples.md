# Redirects and rewrites example reference
<a name="redirect-rewrite-examples"></a>

This section provides examples for a variety of common redirect scenarios.

**Important**
Domain-specific redirects do not support path components in the source field.
**Supported**:
`"source": "https://example.com" `(paths automatically appended)
**Not Supported**:
`"source": "https://example.com/specific-path"`
Rules with `domain+path` combinations are not currently supported.
**Alternative Patterns**
 For domain-specific path redirects, use:
Separate domain-only rules (paths are automatically appended)
Path-only rules with conditional logic
Multiple rule combinations

You can use these examples to understand the JSON syntax for creating your own redirects and rewrites in the Amplify console JSON editor.

**Note**
Original address domain matching is case-insensitive.

## Simple redirects and rewrites
<a name="simple-redirects-and-rewrites"></a>

You can use the following example to permanently redirect a specific page to a new address.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/original.html`  |  `/destination.html`  |  `permanent redirect (301)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/original.html",
    "status": "301",
    "target": "/destination.html",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

You can use the following example to redirect any path under a folder to the same path under a different folder.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/docs/<*>`  |  `/documents/<*>`  |  `permanent redirect (301)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/docs/<*>",
    "status": "301",
    "target": "/documents/<*>",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

You can use the following example to redirect all traffic to index.html as a rewrite. In this scenario, the rewrite makes it appear to the user that they have arrived at the original address.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/<*>`  |  `/index.html`  |  `rewrite (200)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/<*>",
    "status": "200",
    "target": "/index.html",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

You can use the following example to use a rewrite to change the subdomain that appears to the user.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `https://mydomain.com`  |  `https://www.mydomain.com`  |  `rewrite (200)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "https://mydomain.com",
    "status": "200", "target": "https://www.mydomain.com",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

You can use the following example to redirect to a different domain with a path prefix.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `https://mydomain.com`  |  `https://www.mydomain.com/documents`  |  `temporary redirect (302)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "https://mydomain.com",
    "status": "302",
    "target": "https://www.mydomain.com/documents/",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

You can use the following example to redirect paths under a folder that can’t be found to a custom 404 page.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/<*>`  |  `/404.html`  |  `not found (404)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/<*>",
    "status": "404",
    "target": "/404.html",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

**Important**
Path components in domain-based source rules (such as `"https://domain.com/path"`) are not supported and will cause the rule to be ignored without error.

## Redirects for single page web apps (SPA)
<a name="redirects-for-single-page-web-apps-spa"></a>

Most SPA frameworks support HTML5 history.pushState() to change browser location without initiating a server request. This works for users who begin their journey from the root (or */index.html*), but fails for users who navigate directly to any other page.

The following example uses regular expressions to set up a 200 rewrite for all files to index.html, except for the file extensions specified in the regular expression.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `</^[^.]+$\|\.(?!(css\|gif\|ico\|jpg\|js\|png\|txt\|svg\|woff\|woff2\|ttf\|map\|json\|webp)$)([^.]+$)/>`  |  `/index.html`  |  `200`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "</^[^.]+$|\.(?!(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|map|json|webp)$)([^.]+$)/>",
    "status": "200",
    "target": "/index.html",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

## Reverse proxy rewrite
<a name="reverse-proxy-rewrite"></a>

The following example uses a rewrite to proxy content from another location so that it appears to the user that the domain hasn’t changed. HTTPS is the only protocol supported for reverse proxies.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/images/<*>`  |  `https://images.otherdomain.com/<*>`  |  `rewrite (200)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/images/<*>",
    "status": "200",
    "target": "https://images.otherdomain.com/<*>",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

## Trailing slashes and clean URLs
<a name="trailing-slashes-and-clean-urls"></a>

To create clean URL structures like *about* instead of *about.html*, static site generators such as Hugo generate directories for pages with an index.html (*/about/index.html*). Amplify automatically creates clean URLs by adding a trailing slash when required. The table below highlights different scenarios:

| User inputs in browser | URL in the address bar | Document served |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  `/about`  |  `/about`  |  `/about.html`  |
|  `/about (when about.html returns 404)`  |  `/about/`  |  `/about/index.html`  |
|  `/about/`  |  `/about/`  |  `/about/index.html`  |

## Placeholders
<a name="placeholders"></a>

You can use the following example to redirect paths in a folder structure to a matching structure in another folder.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/docs/<year>/<month>/<date>/<itemid>`  |  `/documents/<year>/<month>/<date>/<itemid>`  |  `permanent redirect (301)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source":  "/docs/<year>/<month>/<date>/<itemid>",
    "status": "301",
    "target": "/documents/<year>/<month>/<date>/<itemid>",
               "condition": null
   }
]
```

## Query strings and path parameters
<a name="query-strings-and-path-parameters"></a>

**Warning**
Don’t include secrets, credentials, or sensitive data in URLs as path or query parameters. These values are viewable in plain text in your Amplify application’s access logs.

You can use the following example to redirect a path to a folder with a name that matches the value of a query string element in the original address:

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/docs?id=<my-blog-id-value`  |  `/documents/<my-blog-post-id-value>`  |  `permanent redirect (301)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/docs?id=<my-blog-id-value>",
    "status": "301",
    "target": "/documents/<my-blog-id-value>",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

**Note**
Amplify forwards all query string parameters to the destination path for 301 and 302 redirects. However, if the original address includes a query string set to a specific value, as demonstrated in this example, Amplify doesn't forward query parameters. In this case, the redirect applies only to requests to the destination address with the specified query value `id`.

You can use the following example to redirect all paths that can’t be found at a given level of a folder structure to index.html in a specified folder.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/documents/<folder>/<child-folder>/<grand-child-folder>`  |  `/documents/index.html`  |  `not found (404)`  |  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/documents/<x>/<y>/<z>",
    "status": "404",
    "target": "/documents/index.html",
    "condition": null
  }
]
```

## Region-based redirects
<a name="region-based-redirects"></a>

You can use the following example to redirect requests based on region.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/documents`  |  `/documents/us/`  |  `temporary redirect (302)`  |  `<US>`  |

JSON format

```
[
  {
    "source": "/documents",
    "status": "302",
    "target": "/documents/us/",
    "condition": "<US>"
  }
]
```

## Using wildcard expressions in redirects and rewrites
<a name="wildcard-redirects"></a>

You can use the wildcard expression, `<*>`, in the original address for a redirect or rewrite. You must place the expression at the end of the original address, and it must be unique. Amplify ignores original addresses that include more than one wildcard expression, or use it in a different placement.

The following is an example of a valid redirect with a wildcard expression.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/docs/<*>`  |  `/documents/<*>`  |  `permanent redirect (301)`  |   |

The following two examples demonstrate *invalid* redirects with wildcard expressions.

| Original address | Destination Address | Redirect Type | Country Code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  `/docs/<*>/content`  |  `/documents/<*>/content`  |  `permanent redirect (301)`  |   |
|  `/docs/<*>/content/<*>`  |  `/documents/<*>/content/<*>`  |  `permanent redirect (301)`  |   |
