# Create a backend for a Gen 1 app

In this tutorial, you will set up a fullstack CI/CD workflow with Amplify. You will
deploy a frontend app to Amplify Hosting. Then you will create a backend using
Amplify Studio. Finally, you will connect the cloud backend to the frontend app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, complete the following prerequisites.

**Sign up for an AWS account**

If you are not already an AWS customer, you need to [create an\
AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) by following the online instructions. Signing up
enables you to access Amplify and other AWS services that you can use with
your application.

**Create a Git repository**

Amplify supports GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and AWS CodeCommit. Push your
application to your Git repository.

**Install the Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI)**

For instructions, see [Install the Amplify\
CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/react/start/project-setup/prerequisites) in the _Amplify Framework_
_Documentation_.

## Step 1: Deploy a frontend

If you have an existing frontend app in a git repository that you want to use for
this example, you can proceed to the instructions for deploying a frontend app.

If you need to create a new frontend app to use for this example, you can follow the
[Create React\
App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) instructions in the _Create React App_
_documentation_.

###### To deploy a frontend app

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. On the **All apps** page, choose **New app**,
    then **Host web app** in the upper right corner.

3. Select your GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, or AWS CodeCommit repository provider and
    then choose **Continue**.

4. Amplify authorizes access to your git repository. For GitHub repositories,
    Amplify now uses the GitHub Apps feature to authorize Amplify access.

For more information about installing and authorizing the GitHub App, see [Setting up Amplify access to GitHub repositories](setting-up-github-access.md).

5. On the **Add repository branch** page do the following:
1. In the **Recently updated repositories** list, select
       the name of the repository to connect.

2. In the **Branch** list, select the name of the
       repository branch to connect.

3. Choose **Next**.
6. On the **Configure build settings** page, choose
    **Next**.

7. On the **Review** page, choose **Save and**
**deploy**. When the deployment is complete, you can view your app on
    the `amplifyapp.com` default domain.

###### Note

To augment the security of your Amplify applications, the
_amplifyapp.com_ domain is registered in the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/). For further
security, we recommend that you use cookies with a `__Host-` prefix if you
ever need to set sensitive cookies in the default domain name for your Amplify
applications. This practice will help to defend your domain against cross-site
request forgery attempts (CSRF). For more information see the [Set-Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) page in the Mozilla Developer Network.

## Step 2: Create a backend

Now that you have deployed a frontend app to Amplify Hosting, you can create a
backend. Use the following instructions to create a backend with a simple database and
GraphQL API endpoint.

###### To create a backend

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify).

2. On the **All apps** page, select the app that you created in
    _Step 1_.

3. On the app homepage, choose the **Backend environments** tab,
    then choose **Get started**. This initiates the set up process
    for a default **staging** environment.

4. After the set up finishes, choose **Launch Studio** to access
    the **staging** backend environment in Amplify Studio.

Amplify Studio is a visual interface to create and manage your backend and
accelerate your frontend UI development. For more information about Amplify Studio, see
the [Amplify Studio\
documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/react/tools/console).

Use the following instructions to create a simple database using the Amplify Studio
visual backend builder interface.

###### Create a data model

1. On the home page for your app's **staging** environment,
    choose **Create data model**. This opens the data model
    designer.

2. On the **Data modeling** page, choose **Add**
**model**.

3. For the title, enter `Todo`.

4. Choose **Add a field**.

5. For **Field name**, enter
    `Description`.

The following screenshot is an example of how your data model will look in the
    designer.

![The Amplify Studio UI for creating a data model.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/amplify-deploy-backend-1.png)

6. Choose **Save and Deploy**.

7. Return to the Amplify Hosting console and the **staging**
    environment deployment will be in progress.

During deployment, Amplify Studio creates all the required AWS resources in the
backend, including an AWS AppSync GraphQL API to access data and an Amazon DynamoDB table to
host the Todo items. Amplify uses CloudFormation to deploy your backend, which enables you to
store your backend definition as infrastructure-as-code.

## Step 3: Connect the backend to the frontend

Now that you have deployed a frontend and created a cloud backend that contains a
data model, you need to connect them. Use the following instructions to pull your
backend definition down to your local app project with the Amplify CLI.

###### To connect a cloud backend to a local frontend

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your local
    project.

2. Run the following command in the terminal window, replacing the red text with
    the unique app ID and backend environment name for your project.

```nohighlight

amplify pull --appId abcd1234 --envName staging
```

3. Follow the instructions in the terminal window to complete the project set
    up.

Now you can configure the build process to add the backend to the continuous
deployment workflow. Use the following instructions to connect a frontend branch with a
backend in the Amplify Hosting console.

###### To connect a frontend app branch and cloud backend

1. On the app homepage, choose the **Hosting environments**
    tab.

2. Locate the **main** branch and choose
    **Edit**.

![The location of the Edit link for a branch in the Amplify console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amplify/latest/userguide/images/amplify_edit_backend_alternate.png)

3. In the **Edit target backend** window, for
    **Environment**, select the name of the backend to connect. In
    this example, choose the **staging** backend that you created in
    _Step 2_.

By default, full-stack CI/CD is enabled. Uncheck this option to turn off
    full-stack CI/CD for this backend. Turning off full-stack CI/CD causes the app to
    run in _pull only_ mode. At build time, Amplify will
    automatically generate the `aws-exports.js` file only, without
    modifying your backend environment.

4. Next, you must set up a service role to give Amplify the permissions it
    requires to make changes to your app backend. You can either use an existing
    service role or create a new one. For instructions, see [Adding a service role with permissions to deploy backend resources](amplify-service-role.md).

5. After adding a service role, return to the **Edit target**
**backend** window and choose **Save**.

6. To finish connecting the **staging** backend to
    the **main** branch of the frontend app, perform a
    new build of your project.

Do one of the following:
   - From your git repository, push some code to initiate a build in the
      Amplify console.

   - In the Amplify console, navigate to the app's build details page and
      choose **Redeploy this version**.

## Next steps

### Set up feature branch deployments

Follow our recommended workflow to [set up feature branch deployments with multiple backend\
environments](multi-environments.md#team-workflows-with-amplify-cli-backend-environments).

### Create a frontend UI in Amplify Studio

Use Studio to build your frontend UI with a set of ready-to-use UI
components, and then connect it to your app backend. For more information and
tutorials, see the user guide for [Amplify Studio](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/react/tools/console) in the _Amplify Framework_
_Documentation_.
