# Removing nodes from an ElastiCache cluster

You can delete a node from a Valkey, Memcached, or Redis OSS cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API.

###### Note

Each time you change the number of nodes in a Memcached cluster,
you must re-map at least some of your keyspace so it maps to the correct node.
For more detailed information on load balancing a Memcached cluster, see [Configuring your ElastiCache client for efficient load balancing (Memcached)](bestpractices-loadbalancing.md).

###### To remove nodes from a cluster (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ElastiCache console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache).

2. From the list in the upper-right corner, choose the AWS Region of the cluster that you
    want to remove nodes from.

3. In the navigation pane, choose the engine running on the cluster that you want to remove
    a node.

A list of clusters running the chosen engine appears.

4. From the list of clusters, choose the cluster name from which you want to remove a node.

A list of the cluster's nodes appears.

5. Choose the box to the left of the node ID for the node that you want to remove. Using the
    ElastiCache console, you can only delete one node at a time, so choosing multiple
    nodes means that you can't use the **Delete node**
    button.

The _Delete Node_ page appears.

6. To delete the node, complete the **Delete Node** page and choose
    **Delete Node**. To keep the node, choose
    **Cancel**.

###### Important

With Valkey or Redis OSS, if you're deleting the node results in the cluster which are no longer Multi-AZ compliant, make sure to
first clear the **Multi-AZ** check box and then delete
the node. If you clear the **Multi-AZ** check box, you
can choose to enable **Auto failover**.

Impact of New Add and Remove Requests on Pending RequestsScenariosPending OperationNew RequestResults

Scenario 1

Delete

Delete

The new delete request, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete request.

For example, if nodes 0001, 0003, and 0007 are pending deletion and a new request
to delete nodes 0002 and 0004 is issued, only nodes 0002 and 0004 will be deleted.
Nodes 0001, 0003, and 0007 will not be deleted.

Scenario 2

Delete

Create

The new create request, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete request.

For example, if nodes 0001, 0003, and 0007 are pending deletion and a new request
to create a node is issued, a new node will be created and nodes 0001, 0003, and 0007
will not be deleted.

Scenario 3

Create

Delete

The new delete request, pending or immediate, replaces the pending create request.

For example, if there is a pending request to create two nodes and a new request
is issued to delete node 0003, no new nodes will be created and node 0003 will
be deleted.

Scenario 4

Create

Create

The new create request is added to the pending create request.

For example, if there is a pending request to create two nodes and a new request is
issued to create three nodes, the new requests is added to the pending request and five
nodes will be created.

###### Important

If the new create request is set to **Apply Immediately - Yes**,
all create requests are performed immediately.
If the new create request is set to **Apply Immediately - No**,
all create requests are pending.

To determine what operations are pending, choose the **Description** tab and
check to see how many pending creations or deletions are shown.
You cannot have both pending creations and pending deletions.

1. Identify the IDs of the nodes that you want to remove. For more information, see [Viewing an ElastiCache cluster's details](clusters-viewdetails.md).

2. Use the `decrease-replica-count` CLI operation with
    a list of the nodes to remove, as in the following example.

To remove nodes from a cluster using the command-line interface, use the command
    `decrease-replica-count` with
    the following parameters:

- `--replication-group-id` The ID of the replication group that you want to remove
nodes from.

- `--new-replica-count` The `--new-replica-count` parameter specifies
the number of nodes that you want in this cluster after the
modification is applied.

- `--replicas-to-remove` A list of node IDs that you want removed from
this cluster.

- `--apply-immediately` or `--no-apply-immediately`
Specifies whether to remove these nodes immediately or at the next maintenance window.

- `--region` Specifies the AWS Region of the cluster that you want to remove
nodes from.

###### Note

You can pass only one of `--replicas-to-remove` or `--new-replica-count` parameters when calling this operation.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count \
    --replication-group-id my-replication-group \
    --new-replica-count 2 \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count ^
    --replication-group-id my-replication-group ^
    --new-replica-count 3 ^
    --region us-east-2 ^
    --apply-immediately
```

This operation produces output similar to the following (JSON format):

```json

```

Alternatively, you could call `decrease-replica-count` and instead of passing in the `--new-replica-count`
parameter, you could pass the `--replicas-to-remove` parameter, as shown following:

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count \
    --replication-group-id my-replication-group \
    --replicas-to-remove node-test-003 \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --apply-immediately
```

For Windows:

```nohighlight

aws elasticache decrease-replica-count ^
    --replication-group-id my-replication-group ^
    --replicas-to-remove node-test-003 ^
    --region us-east-2 ^
    --apply-immediately
```

For more information, see the AWS CLI topics [`decrease-replica-count`](../../../cli/latest/reference/elasticache/decrease-replica-count.md).

To remove nodes using the ElastiCache API, call the
`DecreaseReplicaCount` API operation with the replication group Id and a list of nodes to remove, as shown:

- `ReplicationGroupId` The ID of the replication group that you want to remove nodes
from.

- `ReplicasToRemove` The `ReplicasToRemove` parameter specifies the number
of nodes that you want in this cluster after the modification is
applied.

- `ApplyImmediately`
Specifies whether to remove these nodes immediately or at the next maintenance window.

- `Region` Specifies the AWS Region of the cluster that you want to remove a
node from.

The following example immediately removes nodes 0004 and 0005 from the cluster my-cluster.

```

https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
    ?Action=DecreaseReplicaCount
    &ReplicationGroupId=my-replication-group
    &ApplyImmediately=true
    &ReplicasToRemove=node-test-003

    &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
    &Timestamp=20141201T220302Z
    &X-Amz-Algorithm=&AWS;4-HMAC-SHA256
    &X-Amz-Date=20141201T220302Z

    &X-Amz-Expires=20141201T220302Z
    &X-Amz-Credential=<credential>
    &X-Amz-Signature=<signature>
```

For more information, see ElastiCache API topic [`DecreaseReplicaCount`](../../../../reference/amazonelasticache/latest/apireference/api-decreasereplicacount.md).

To remove nodes using the ElastiCache API, call the
`ModifyCacheCluster` API operation with the cache
cluster ID and a list of nodes to remove, as shown:

- `CacheClusterId` The ID of the cluster that you want to remove nodes
from.

- `NumCacheNodes` The `NumCacheNodes` parameter specifies the number
of nodes that you want in this cluster after the modification is
applied.

- `CacheNodeIdsToRemove.member.n`
The list of node IDs to remove from the cluster.

- `CacheNodeIdsToRemove.member.1=0004`

- `CacheNodeIdsToRemove.member.1=0005`

- `ApplyImmediately`
Specifies whether to remove these nodes immediately or at the next maintenance window.

- `Region` Specifies the AWS Region of the cluster that you want to remove a
node from.

The following example immediately removes nodes 0004 and 0005 from the cluster my-cluster.

```

https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
    ?Action=ModifyCacheCluster
    &CacheClusterId=my-cluster
    &ApplyImmediately=true
