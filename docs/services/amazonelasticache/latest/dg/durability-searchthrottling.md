# Search write throttling

To maintain optimal performance and data durability, ElastiCache in **durable mode** implements write throttling
on search traffic when necessary. Throttling helps ensure that automatic backup mechanisms operate
effectively without falling behind during periods of high write activity. By temporarily reducing write
throughput, the system preserves the integrity of the Multi-AZ transactional log, which is essential for
fast database recovery and restart.

## Scope of throttling

Only write commands targeting keys that belong to a search index are throttled. Writes to
non-indexed keys and all read commands are **not** affected.

The following commands are subject to throttling when they target indexed keys:

`COPY`, `RESTORE`

## What clients experience

Throttled commands are **delayed, not rejected**. Affected writes take longer to complete but still
succeed. No errors are returned to the client.

You can observe the impact through the following Amazon CloudWatch metrics:

- `SuccessfulWriteRequestLatency` and `SearchBasedSetCmdsLatency`
— Reflect increased latency on affected writes.

- `SearchWriteThrottleActive`, `SearchWriteThrottledClientsCount`,
and `SearchWriteThrottleEvents` — Indicate whether throttling is active and to what
degree. See [Monitoring](#Durability.SearchThrottling.Monitoring) for details.

## When throttling activates

The system monitors CPU usage of the search module's writer threads over a rolling 2-hour window.
Throttling activates when the average CPU usage during that window exceeds 50%, and adjusts the allowed
write rate to bring average utilization back to 50%.

Because the metric is averaged over a 2-hour window, short bursts of elevated CPU usage do not
trigger throttling on their own — as long as they are offset by lower usage within the same
window.

To prevent over-throttling, the system also evaluates current CPU usage in real time. If current CPU
usage is already at 50% or below, the system holds the write rate steady rather than reducing it
further, even if the 2-hour average remains above the threshold. This ensures that write capacity never
falls below 50% of normal throughput.

## When throttling deactivates

Once the 2-hour average CPU usage drops below 50%, the system gradually increases the allowed write
rate until full throughput is restored and throttling deactivates.

## Monitoring

The following Amazon CloudWatch metrics are available for monitoring search write throttling:

## Best practices

- **Monitor `SearchWriteCPUUtilization`** — Track
your search write CPU usage to understand your workload patterns and anticipate when you might
approach the throttling threshold.

- **Monitor `SearchWriteThrottleActive`** — Track
whether throttling is active so you can investigate and respond promptly.

- **Plan sustained ingestion around the 2-hour window** —
The system uses a 2-hour rolling average, so short bursts of high write activity are fully supported
as long as they are offset by lower usage within the same window.

- **Scale your cluster if you observe sustained or frequent**
**throttling** — If your workload consistently exceeds the threshold and throttling impacts
your application's latency requirements, consider scaling to add capacity.
