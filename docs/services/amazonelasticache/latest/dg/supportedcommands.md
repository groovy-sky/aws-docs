**Server Management Commands**

###### Note

When using node-based ElastiCache clusters for Valkey and Redis OSS, flush commands must be sent to every primary by the client to flush all keys. ElastiCache Serverless for Valkey and Redis OSS works differently, because it abstracts away the underlying cluster topology. The result is that in ElastiCache Serverless, `FLUSHDB` and `FLUSHALL` commands will always flush all keys across the cluster. For this reason, flush commands cannot be included inside a Serverless transaction.

## Supported Memcached commands

ElastiCache Serverless for Memcached supports all of the memcached
[commands](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Commands) in open source memcached 1.6 except for
the following:

- Client connections require TLS, as a result UDP protocol is not supported.

- Binary protocol is not supported, as it is officially
[deprecated](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/ReleaseNotes160) in memcached 1.6.

- `GET/GETS` commands are limited to 16KB to avoid potential DoS attack to the server with fetching large number of keys.

- Delayed `flush_all` command will be rejected with `CLIENT_ERROR`.

- Commands that configure the engine or reveal internal information about engine state or logs
are not supported, such as:

- For `STATS` command, only `stats` and `stats reset` are supported. Other variations will return `ERROR`

- `lru / lru_crawler` \- modification for LRU and LRU crawler settings

- `watch` \- watches memcached server logs

- `verbosity` \- configures the server log level

- `me` \- meta debug (me) command is not supported
