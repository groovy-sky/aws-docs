# Valkey and Redis OSS configuration and limits

The Valkey and Redis OSS engines each provides a number of configuration parameters, some of which are modifiable in ElastiCache for Redis OSS and some of which are not modifiable to provide stable performance and reliability.

## Serverless caches

For serverless caches, parameter groups are not used and all Valkey or Redis OSS configuration is not modifiable. The following Valkey or Redis OSS parameters are in place:

Name  Details  Description `acl-pubsub-default`

`allchannels`

Default pubsub channel permissions for ACL users on the cache.`client-output-buffer-limit`

`normal 0 0 0`

`pubsub 32mb 8mb 60`

Normal clients have no buffer limit. PUB/SUB clients will be disconnected if they breach 32MiB backlog, or breach 8MiB backlog for 60s.`client-query-buffer-limit`1 GiBThe maximum size of a single client query buffer. Additionally, clients cannot issue a request with more than 3,999 arguments.`cluster-allow-pubsubshard-when-down``yes`This allows the cache to serve pubsub traffic while the cache is partially down.`cluster-allow-reads-when-down``yes`This allows the cache to serve read traffic while the cache is partially down.`cluster-enabled``yes`All serverless caches are cluster mode enabled, which allows them to
transparently partition their data across multiple backend shards. All
slots are surfaced to clients as being owned by a single virtual node.`cluster-require-full-coverage``no`When the keyspace is partially down (i.e. at least one hash slot is inaccessible), the cache will continue accepting queries for the part of the
keyspace that is still covered. The entire keyspace will always be "covered" by a single virtual node in `cluster slots`.`lua-time-limit`

5000

The maximum execution time for a Lua script, in milliseconds,
before ElastiCache takes action to stop the script.

If
`lua-time-limit` is exceeded, all Valkey or Redis OSS commands
may return an error of the form _\_\_\_\_-BUSY_.
Since this state can cause interference with many essential
Valkey or Redis OSS operations, ElastiCache will first issue a _SCRIPT_
_KILL_ command. If this is unsuccessful, ElastiCache will
forcibly restart Valkey or Redis OSS.

`maxclients`65000The maximum number of clients that can be connected to the cache at one time. Further connections established may or may not succeed.`maxmemory-policy``volatile-lru`Items with a TTL set are evicted following least-recently-used (LRU) estimation when a cache's memory limit is reached.`notify-keyspace-events`(an empty string)Keyspace events are currently not supported on serverless caches.`port`

Primary port: 6379

Read port: 6380

Serverless caches advertise two ports with the same hostname. The primary port allows writes and reads, whereas the read port allows lower-latency
eventually-consistent reads using the `READONLY` command.`proto-max-bulk-len`512 MiBThe maximum size of a single element request.`timeout`0Clients are not forcibly disconnected at a specific idle time, but they may be disconnected during steady-state for load balancing purposes.

Additionally, the following limits are in place:

Name  Details  Description Size per cache5,000 GiBMaximum amount of data that can be stored per serverless cache.Size per slot32 GiBThe maximum size of a single Valkey or Redis OSS hash slot. Clients trying to set more data than this on a single Valkey or Redis OSS slot will trigger
the eviction policy on the slot, and if no keys are evictable, will receive an out of memory ( `OOM`) error.ECPU per cache15,000,000 ECPU/secondElastiCache Processing Units (ECPU) metric. The number of ECPUs consumed by your requests depends on the vCPU time taken and the amount of data transferred.ECPU per slot30K - 90K ECPU/secondMaximum of 30K ECPUs/second per slot or 90K ECPUs/second when using Read from Replica using READONLY connections.Arguments per Request3,999Maximum number of arguments per request. Clients sending more arguments per request will receive an error.Key name length4 KiBThe maximum size for a single Valkey or Redis OSS key or channel name. Clients referencing keys larger than this will receive an error.Lua script size4 MiBThe maximum size of a single Valkey or Redis OSS Lua script. Attempts to load a Lua script larger than this will receive an error.

## Node-based clusters

For node-based clusters, see [Valkey and Redis OSS parameters](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Redis) for
the default values of configuration parameters and which are configurable. The default values are generally recommended unless
you have a specific use case requiring them to be overridden.
