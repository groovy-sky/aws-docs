# Monitoring

ElastiCache publishes the following additional CloudWatch metrics for durable clusters:

- **DurabilityLag**: The age in milliseconds of the oldest
write operation that has been acknowledged to the client but not yet persisted to the Multi-AZ
transactional log. When this value approaches 10,000 ms (10 seconds), the primary node will begin
rejecting new writes. This metric is always 0 for synchronous writes because writes are persisted
before being acknowledged.

- **DurabilityBufferExceededErrorCount**: The number of write
commands rejected by a node because the durability buffer exceeded 10 seconds. When this metric is
non-zero, your write requests will be rejected. Ensure your client is
configured to retry with exponential backoff. This metric is always 0 for synchronous
writes.

In addition to durability-specific metrics, ElastiCache also monitors write throughput. In the event that
the incoming write traffic exceeds the available throughput of the Multi-AZ transactional log, incoming
write commands will be throttled. In the event that customer traffic is throttled, the
`TrafficManagementActive` metric will emit 1.
