# Caching database query results

A common pattern to reduce database query latencies is query caching. Applications
implement query caching by querying the cache for results associated with a database
query, returning those results if they are cached. If no cached results are found, the
query is executed on the database, the results are populated in the cache, and the
results are then returned to the application initiating the query. Subsequent database
queries will then return cached results as long as they remain in the cache.

## When to use query caching

Query caching with ElastiCache is most effective for the following workload types:

- **Read-heavy applications** where the same
queries are executed repeatedly with data that changes infrequently.

- **Expensive queries** such as non-indexed
lookups, aggregations, or multi-table joins where query execution times are
long.

- **High-concurrency scenarios** where offloading
reads to ElastiCache reduces database CPU pressure and improves overall
throughput.

Query caching is not recommended for queries where strong consistency is required,
or for queries inside multi-statement transactions that require read-after-write
consistency.

## Using the AWS Advanced JDBC Wrapper

If your application is using a JDBC driver to query a relational database, you can
implement query caching with the [Remote Query Cache Plugin](https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheRemoteQueryCachePlugin.md) in the [AWS Advanced JDBC\
Wrapper](https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper). The plugin automatically caches selected SQL query result sets in
ElastiCache, returning the result set from the cache instead of the database for future
queries. Caching query results can reduce database load and lower average query
latencies with minimal application code changes.

## How query caching works with the plugin

The Remote Query Cache Plugin makes it easy for Java applications that query
PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB databases to automatically cache query results in
ElastiCache. You configure the plugin with your cache endpoint information and indicate
which queries in your code to cache using query hints. When the plugin detects a
hinted query, it returns the query result from the cache if present (a cache hit). If
the results are not in the cache (a cache miss), the plugin executes the query on the
database, stores the results in the cache, and returns the results to your application
so the next time the query is executed the results can be served from the cache.

## Caching hints

You control which queries to cache by setting hints on each query. You can apply
query hints directly to query strings in your application code with a comment
prefix:

```

/* CACHE_PARAM(ttl=300s) */ SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = 42
```

where `ttl` is the time-to-live in seconds. You can also set query hints
in prepared statements using common frameworks like Hibernate and Spring Boot.

## Prerequisites

To use the Remote Query Cache Plugin in your application, you need an ElastiCache for
Valkey or Redis OSS cache (both Serverless and node-based are supported) along with
the following dependencies:

- [AWS\
Advanced JDBC Wrapper](https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper) version 3.3.0 or later.

- [Apache Commons\
Pool](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-pool) version 2.11.1 or later.

- [Valkey Glide](https://glide.valkey.io/) version 2.3.0 or
later.

## Example: Caching a query with the plugin

The following example shows how to enable the plugin and cache a query result for
300 seconds (5 minutes) with an ElastiCache for Valkey serverless cache:

```java

import java.sql.*;
import java.util.Properties;

public class QueryCacheExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.setProperty("user", "myuser");
        props.setProperty("password", "mypassword");

        // Enable the remote query cache plugin
        props.setProperty("wrapperPlugins", "remoteQueryCache");

        // Point to your ElastiCache endpoint
        props.setProperty("cacheEndpointAddrRw", "my-cache.serverless.use1.cache.amazonaws.com:6379");

        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
            "jdbc:aws-wrapper:postgresql://my-database.cluster-abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/mydb",
            props
        );

        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();

        // The SQL comment hint tells the plugin to cache this query for 300 seconds
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(
            "/* CACHE_PARAM(ttl=300s) */ SELECT product_name, price FROM products WHERE category = 'electronics'"
        );

        while (rs.next()) {
            System.out.println(rs.getString("product_name") + ": $" + rs.getBigDecimal("price"));
        }

        rs.close();
        stmt.close();
        conn.close();
    }
}
```

The first time this query runs, the result is returned from the database and cached
in ElastiCache. For the next 300 seconds, subsequent executions of that query are served
directly from the cache.
