# Consistency

**Synchronous writes**

Primary nodes are strongly consistent. Successful write operations are durably stored in the Multi-AZ
transactional log before returning to clients. During normal operations, read operations on primaries always return the most
up-to-date data reflecting the effects from all prior successful write operations. Such strong
consistency is preserved across primary failovers. Replica nodes are eventually consistent. Read
operations from replicas (using `READONLY` command) might not always reflect the effects of
the most recent successful write operations, with lag metrics published to CloudWatch. The read
operations from a single replica are sequentially consistent. Successful write operations take effect on
each replica in the same order they were executed on the primary.

**Asynchronous writes**

During normal operation, asynchronous writes provide the same consistency behavior as synchronous
writes. However, as the write operations are returned to clients before being durably stored in the
Multi-AZ transactional log, strong consistency is not preserved across primary failovers. In the event
of a failure, up to 10 seconds of acknowledged write operations may be lost, meaning that after a
failover, read operations on the new primary may not reflect all previously acknowledged writes.
Asynchronous writes is not recommended for workloads that require strong consistency guarantees.
