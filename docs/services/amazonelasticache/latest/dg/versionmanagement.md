# Version Management for ElastiCache

Manage how you would like to update your ElastiCache caches and node-based clusters updated for the Valkey, Memcached, and Redis OSS engines.

## Version management for ElastiCache Serverless Cache

Manage if and when the ElastiCache Serverless cache is upgraded and perform version upgrades on
your own terms and timelines.

ElastiCache Serverless automatically applies the latest minor and patch software version to your cache,
without any impact or downtime to your application. No action is required on your end.

When a new major version is available, ElastiCache Serverless will send you a notification in the console and an event in EventBridge. You can choose to upgrade your cache to the latest major version by modifying your cache using the Console, CLI, or API and selecting the latest engine version. Similar to minor and patch upgrades, major version upgrades are performed without downtime to your application.

## Version management for node-based ElastiCache clusters

When working with node-based ElastiCache clusters, you can control when the software powering your cluster
is upgraded to new versions that are supported by ElastiCache. You can control when to upgrade your cache to the
latest available major, minor, and patch versions. You initiate engine version upgrades to your cluster or replication group by modifying it and specifying a new engine version.

You can control if and when the protocol-compliant software powering your cluster is
upgraded to new versions that are supported by ElastiCache. This level of control enables you
to maintain compatibility with specific versions, test new versions
with your application before deploying in production, and perform version upgrades on
your own terms and timelines.

Because version upgrades might involve some compatibility risk, they don't occur
automatically. You must initiate them.

**Valkey and Redis OSS clusters**

###### Note

- If a Valkey or Redis OSS cluster is replicated across one or more Regions, the engine version is upgraded for secondary Regions
and then for the primary Region.

- ElastiCache for Redis OSS versions are identified with a semantic version which comprise a major and minor component.
For example, in Redis OSS 6.2, the major version is 6, and the minor version 2.
When operating node-based clusters, ElastiCache for Redis OSS also exposes the patch component, e.g. Redis OSS 6.2.1, and the patch version is 1.

Major versions are for API incompatible changes and minor versions are for new functionality added in a backwards-compatible way. Patch versions are for backwards-compatible bug fixes and non-functional changes.

With Valkey and Redis OSS, you initiate engine version upgrades to your cluster or replication group by modifying it
and specifying a new engine version. For more information, see [Modifying a replication group](replication-modify.md).

**Memcached**

With Memcached, to upgrade to a newer version you must modify your cluster and specify the new engine version
you want to use.
Upgrading to a newer Memcached version is a destructive process – you lose your
data and start with a cold cache.
For more information, see [Modifying an ElastiCache cluster](clusters-modify.md).

You should be aware of the following requirements when upgrading from an older version of
Memcached to Memcached version 1.4.33 or newer. `CreateCacheCluster` and
`ModifyCacheCluster` fails under the following conditions:

- If `slab_chunk_max > max_item_size`.

- If `max_item_size modulo slab_chunk_max != 0`.

- If `max_item_size > ((max_cache_memory - memcached_connections_overhead) / 4)`.

The value `(max_cache_memory - memcached_connections_overhead)` is the node's
memory useable for data.
For more information, see [Memcached connection overhead](parametergroups-engine.md#ParameterGroups.Memcached.Overhead).

## Supported engines and versions

ElastiCache serverless caches support ElastiCache version 7.2 for Valkey and above, ElastiCache version 1.6 for Memcached and above, and ElastiCache 7.0 for Redis OSS and above.

Node-based ElastiCache clusters support ElastiCache version 7.2 for Valkey and above, ElastiCache version 1.4.5 for Memcached and above, and ElastiCache 4.0.10 for Redis OSS and above.

###### Node-based ElastiCache clusters support the following Valkey versions:

- [Supported Valkey versions](#supported-engine-versions.valkey)

- [Valkey 8.2](#valkey-version-8.2)

- [Valkey 8.1](#valkey-version-8.1)

- [Valkey 8.0](#valkey-version-8)

- [ElastiCache version 7.2.6 for Valkey](#valkey-version-7.2.6)

### Supported Valkey versions

Supported Valkey versions below. Note that Valkey supports most features available in ElastiCache version 7.2 for Redis OSS by default.

- You can also upgrade your ElastiCache clusters with versions earlier than 5.0.6. The process involved is the same but may incur longer failover time during DNS propagation (30s-1m).

- Beginning with Redis OSS 7, ElastiCache supports switching between Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) and Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled).

- The Amazon ElastiCache for Redis OSS engine upgrade process is designed to make a best effort to retain your existing data
and requires successful Redis OSS replication.

- When upgrading the engine, ElastiCache will terminate existing client connections. To minimize downtime during engine upgrades,
we recommend you implement [best practices for Redis OSS clients](bestpractices-clients-redis.md)
with error retries and exponential backoff and the best practices for
[minimizing downtime during maintenance](bestpractices-minimizedowntime.md).

- You can't upgrade directly from Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) to Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) when you upgrade your
engine. The following procedure shows you how to upgrade from Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled)
to Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled).

###### To upgrade from a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) to Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) engine version

1. Make a backup of your Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) cluster or replication group. For more information,
    see [Taking manual backups](backups-manual.md).

2. Use the backup to create and seed a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster with one shard (node group).
    Specify the new engine version and enable cluster mode when creating the cluster or
    replication group. For more information, see [Tutorial: Seeding a new node-based cluster with an externally created backup](backups-seeding-redis.md).

3. Delete the old Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) cluster or replication group. For more information,
    see [Deleting a cluster in ElastiCache](clusters-delete.md) or [Deleting a replication group](replication-deletingrepgroup.md).

4. Scale the new Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster or replication group to the number of shards (node groups)
    that you need. For more information, see [Scaling Valkey or Redis OSS (Cluster Mode Enabled) clusters](scaling-redis-cluster-mode-enabled.md)

- When upgrading major engine versions, for example from 5.0.6 to 6.0, you need to also choose a new parameter group that is compatible with the new engine version.

- For single Redis OSS clusters and clusters with Multi-AZ disabled, we recommend that
sufficient memory be made available to Redis OSS as described in [Ensuring you have enough memory to make a Valkey or Redis OSS snapshot](bestpractices-bgsave.md).
In these cases, the primary is unavailable to service requests during the
upgrade process.

- For Redis OSS clusters with Multi-AZ enabled, we also recommend that you schedule engine
upgrades during periods of low incoming write traffic. When upgrading to Redis OSS 5.0.6 or above, the primary cluster continues to be available to service requests during the upgrade process.

Clusters and replication groups with multiple shards are processed and patched as follows:

- All shards are processed in parallel. Only one upgrade operation is performed
on a shard at any time.

- In each shard, all replicas are processed before the primary is processed. If there are
fewer replicas in a shard, the primary in that shard might be
processed before the replicas in other shards are finished
processing.

- Across all the shards, primary nodes are processed in series.
Only one primary node is upgraded at a time.

- If encryption is enabled on your current cluster or replication group, you cannot upgrade to
an engine version that does not support encryption, such as from 3.2.6 to 3.2.10.

**Memcached considerations**

When upgrading a node-based Memcached cluster, consider the following.

- Engine version management is designed so that you can have as much control as possible over
how patching occurs. However, ElastiCache reserves the right to patch your cluster
on your behalf in the unlikely event of a critical security vulnerability in
the system or cache software.

- Because the Memcached engine does not support persistence, Memcached engine version
upgrades are always a disruptive process that clears all cache data in the
cluster.
