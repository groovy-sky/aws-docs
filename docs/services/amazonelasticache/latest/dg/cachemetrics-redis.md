# Metrics for Valkey and Redis OSS

The `Amazon ElastiCache` namespace includes the following Valkey and Redis OSS metrics. These metrics are the same when using the Valkey engine.

With the exception of `ReplicationLag`, `EngineCPUUtilization`, `SuccessfulWriteRequestLatency`, and `SuccessfulReadRequestLatency`,
these metrics are derived from the **info** command. Each metric is calculated at the cache node level.

For complete documentation of the **info** command, see
[http://valkey.io/commands/info](https://valkey.io/commands/info).

Metric Description Unit `ActiveDefragHits`The number of value reallocations per minute performed
by the active defragmentation process. This is derived from `active_defrag_hits` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).Number`AuthenticationFailures`The total number of failed attempts to authenticate to Valkey or Redis OSS using the AUTH command.
You can find more information about individual authentication failures
using the [ACL LOG](https://valkey.io/commands/acl-log)
command. We suggest setting an alarm on this to detect unauthorized
access attempts. Count`BytesUsedForCache`The total number of bytes allocated by Valkey or Redis OSS for all purposes, including the dataset, buffers, and so on. Bytes`Dimension: Tier=Memory` for Valkey or Redis OSS clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md): The total number
of bytes used for cache by memory. This is the value of `used_memory` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).
Bytes`Dimension: Tier=SSD` for Valkey or Redis OSS clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md): The total number of bytes used for cache by SSD.Bytes`BytesReadFromDisk`The total number of bytes read from disk per minute. Supported only for clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md).Bytes`BytesWrittenToDisk`The total number of bytes written to disk per minute. Supported only for clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md).Bytes`CacheHits`The number of successful read-only key lookups in the main dictionary. This is derived from `keyspace_hits` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).Count`CacheMisses`The number of unsuccessful read-only key lookups in the main dictionary. This is derived from `keyspace_misses` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).Count`CommandAuthorizationFailures`The total number of failed attempts by users to run commands they don’t have permission
to call. You can find more information about individual authentication
failures using the [ACL\
LOG](https://valkey.io/commands/acl-log) command. We suggest setting an alarm on this to detect
unauthorized access attempts. Count`CacheHitRate`Indicates the usage efficiency of the Valkey or Redis OSS instance. If the cache ratio is lower than
about 0.8, it means that a significant amount of keys are evicted,
expired, or don't exist. This is calculated using
`cache_hits` and `cache_misses` statistics in
the following way: `cache_hits /(cache_hits +
							cache_misses)`.Percent`ChannelAuthorizationFailures`The total number of failed attempts by users to access channels they do not have permission to access.
You can find more information about individual authentication failures using the [ACL\
LOG](https://valkey.io/commands/acl-log) command.
We suggest setting an alarm on this metric to detect unauthorized access attempts.Count`CurrConnections`The number of client connections, excluding connections from read
replicas. ElastiCache uses 4 to 6 of the connections to monitor the
cluster in each case. This is derived from the `connected_clients` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).Count`CurrItems`The number of items in the cache. This is derived from the `keyspace` statistic, summing all of the keys in the entire
keyspace.Count`Dimension: Tier=Memory` for clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md). The number of items in memory.Count`Dimension: Tier=SSD` (solid state drives) for clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md). The number of items in SSD.Count`CurrVolatileItems`Total number of keys in all databases that have a ttl set. This is derived from the `expires` statistic, summing all of the keys with a ttl set in the entire
keyspace.Count`DatabaseCapacityUsagePercentage`

Percentage of the total data capacity for the cluster that is in use.

On Data Tiered instances, the metric is calculated as
`(used_memory - mem_not_counted_for_evict + SSD used) / (maxmemory + SSD total capacity)`,
where `used_memory` and `maxmemory` are taken from [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).

In all other cases, the metric is calculated using `used_memory/maxmemory`.

Percent`DatabaseCapacityUsageCountedForEvictPercentage`

Percentage of the total data capacity for the cluster that is in use, excluding the memory used for overhead and COB. This metric is calculated as:

`used_memory - mem_not_counted_for_evict/maxmemory`

On Data Tiered instances, the metric is calculated as:

`(used_memory + SSD used) / (maxmemory + SSD total capacity) `

where `used_memory` and `maxmemory` are taken from [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info)

Percent`DatabaseMemoryUsagePercentage`
Percentage of the memory for the cluster that is in use. This is calculated using `used_memory/maxmemory` from [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).
Percent`DatabaseMemoryUsageCountedForEvictPercentage`
Percentage of the memory for the cluster that is in use, excluding memory used for overhead and COB. This is calculated using `used_memory-mem_not_counted_for_evict/maxmemory` from [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).
Percent`DB0AverageTTL`

Exposes `avg_ttl` of DBO from the `keyspace` statistic of [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info) command.
Replicas don't expire keys, instead they wait for primary nodes to expire keys. When a primary node expires a key (or evicts it because of LRU), it synthesizes a `DEL` command,
which is transmitted to all the replicas. Therefore, DB0AverageTTL is 0 for replica nodes, due the fact that they don't expire keys, and thus don't track TTL.
Milliseconds`EngineCPUUtilization`

Provides CPU utilization of the Valkey or Redis OSS engine thread. Because Valkey and Redis OSS are single-threaded, you can
use this metric to analyze the load of the process itself. The
`EngineCPUUtilization` metric provides a more precise
visibility of the process. You can use it in conjunction with
the `CPUUtilization` metric. `CPUUtilization`
exposes CPU utilization for the server instance as a whole,
including other operating system and management processes. For
larger node types with four vCPUs or more, use the
`EngineCPUUtilization` metric to monitor and set
thresholds for scaling.

###### Note

On an ElastiCache host, background processes monitor the host to provide a managed database
experience. These background processes can take up a significant
portion of the CPU workload. This is not significant on larger
hosts with more than two vCPUs. But it can affect smaller hosts
with 2vCPUs or fewer. If you only monitor the
`EngineCPUUtilization` metric, you will be
unaware of situations where the host is overloaded with both
high CPU usage from Valkey or Redis OSS and high CPU usage from the background
monitoring processes. Therefore, we recommend monitoring the
`CPUUtilization` metric for hosts with two vCPUs
or less.

Percent`Evictions`The number of keys that have been evicted due to the
`maxmemory` limit. This is derived from the `evicted_keys` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).Count`GlobalDatastoreReplicationLag`This is the lag between the secondary Region's primary node and the primary Region's primary node. For cluster mode enabled Valkey or Redis OSS, the lag indicates the maximum delay among the shards. Seconds`IamAuthenticationExpirations`The total number of expired IAM-authenticated Valkey or Redis OSS connections. You can find more information about [Authenticating with IAM](auth-iam.md) in the user guide.Count`IamAuthenticationThrottling`The total number of throttled IAM-authenticated Valkey or Redis OSS AUTH or HELLO requests. You can find more information about [Authenticating with IAM](auth-iam.md) in the user guide. Count`IsMaster`Indicates whether the node is the primary node of current shard/cluster. The metric can be either 0 (not primary) or 1 (primary). Count`KeyAuthorizationFailures`The total number of failed attempts by users to access keys they don’t have permission
to access. You can find more information about individual authentication
failures using the [ACL\
LOG](https://valkey.io/commands/acl-log) command. We suggest setting an alarm on this to detect
unauthorized access attempts. Count`

							KeysTracked` The number of keys being tracked by Valkey or Redis OSS key tracking as a percentage of
`tracking-table-max-keys`. Key tracking is used to aid
client-side caching and notifies clients when keys are modified.
Count`MemoryFragmentationRatio` Indicates the efficiency in the allocation of memory of the Valkey or Redis OSS engine. Certain
thresholds signify different behaviors. The recommended value is to have
fragmentation above 1.0. This is calculated from the
`mem_fragmentation_ratio statistic` of [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info). Number`NewConnections`The total number of connections that have been accepted by the server
during this period. This is derived from the `total_connections_received` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).

###### Note

If you are using ElastiCache for Redis OSS version 5 or lower, between two and four of the connections reported by this metric are used by ElastiCache to monitor the cluster.
However, when using ElastiCache for Redis OSS version 6 or above, the connections used by ElastiCache to monitor the cluster are not included in this metric.

Count`NumItemsReadFromDisk`The total number of items retrieved from disk per minute. Supported only for clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md).Count`NumItemsWrittenToDisk`The total number of items written to disk per minute. Supported only for clusters using [Data tiering in ElastiCache](data-tiering.md).Count`MasterLinkHealthStatus`This status has two values: 0 or 1. The value 0 indicates that data in the ElastiCache
primary node is not in sync with Valkey or Redis OSS on EC2. The value of 1 indicates
that the data is in sync. To complete the migration, use the [CompleteMigration](../../../../reference/amazonelasticache/latest/apireference/api-completemigration.md) API operation.Boolean`Reclaimed`The total number of key expiration events. This is derived from the `expired_keys` statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).Count`ReplicationBytes`For nodes in a replicated configuration, `ReplicationBytes` reports the
number of bytes that the primary is sending to all of its replicas. This
metric is representative of the write load on the replication group.
This is derived from the `master_repl_offset` statistic at
[INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).
Bytes`ReplicationLag`This metric is only applicable for a node running as a read
replica. It represents how far behind, in seconds, the replica is in
applying changes from the primary node. For Valkey 7.2 and onwards, and Redis OSS 5.0.6 onwards, the lag can be measured in milliseconds.Seconds`SaveInProgress`This binary metric returns 1 whenever a background save (forked or forkless) is in
progress, and 0 otherwise. A background save process is typically used
during snapshots and syncs. These operations can cause degraded
performance. Using the `SaveInProgress` metric, you can
diagnose whether degraded performance was caused by a background save
process. This is derived from the `rdb_bgsave_in_progress`
statistic at [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info).Boolean`TrafficManagementActive`Indicates whether ElastiCache for Redis OSS is actively managing traffic by adjusting traffic allocated to incoming commands, monitoring or replication.
Traffic is managed when more commands are sent to the node than can be processed by Valkey or Redis OSS and is used to maintain the stability and optimal
operation of the engine. Any data points of 1 may indicate that the node is underscaled for the workload being provided.

###### Note

If this metric remains active, evaluate the cluster to decide if scaling up or scaling out is necessary. Related metrics include `NetworkBandwidthOutAllowanceExceeded` and
`EngineCPUUtilization`.

The following are aggregations of certain kinds of commands, derived from **info**
**commandstats**. The commandstats section provides statistics based on the command type, including the number of calls, the total CPU time consumed by these commands, and the average CPU consumed per command execution.
For each command type, the following line is added:
`cmdstat_XXX: calls=XXX,usec=XXX,usec_per_call=XXX`.

The latency metrics listed following are calculated using commandstats statistic from [INFO](https://valkey.io/commands/info). They are calculated in the following way: `delta(usec)/delta(calls)`. `delta` is calculated as the diff within one minute.
Latency is defined as CPU time taken by ElastiCache to process the command. Note that for clusters using data tiering, the time taken to fetch items from SSD is not included in these measurements.

For a full list of available commands, see [commands](https://valkey.io/commands) in the Valkey documentation.
