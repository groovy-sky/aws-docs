# Benefits of Auto Discovery with Memcached

When using Memcached, Auto Discovery offers the following benefits:

- When you increase the number of nodes in a cluster, the new nodes register themselves with the
configuration endpoint and with all of the other nodes. When you remove nodes from the cache
cluster, the departing nodes deregister themselves. In both cases, all of the other
nodes in the cluster are updated with the latest cache node metadata.

- Cache node failures are automatically detected; failed nodes are automatically
replaced.

###### Note

Until node replacement completes, the node will continue to fail.

- A client program only needs to connect to the configuration endpoint. After that, the
Auto Discovery library connects to all of the other nodes in the cluster.

- Client programs poll the cluster once per minute (this interval can be adjusted
if necessary). If there are any changes to the cluster configuration, such as new or
deleted nodes, the client receives an updated list of metadata. Then the client
connects to, or disconnects from, these nodes as needed.

Auto Discovery is enabled on all ElastiCache Memcached clusters. You do not need to reboot
any of your cache nodes to use this feature.
