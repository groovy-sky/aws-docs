# Gateway routes

###### Important

End of support notice: On September 30, 2026, AWS will discontinue support for AWS App Mesh. After September 30, 2026, you will no longer be able to access the AWS App Mesh console or AWS App Mesh resources. For more information, visit this blog post [Migrating from AWS App Mesh to Amazon ECS Service Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrating-from-aws-app-mesh-to-amazon-ecs-service-connect).

A gateway route is attached to a virtual gateway and routes traffic to an existing virtual
service. If a route matches a request, it can distribute traffic to a target virtual
service. This topic helps you work with gateway routes in a service mesh.

## Creating a gateway route

AWS Management Console

###### To create a gateway route using the AWS Management Console

01. Open the App Mesh console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh).

02. Choose the mesh in which you want to create the gateway route. All
     of the meshes that you own and that have been [shared](sharing.md) with you are listed.

03. Choose **Virtual gateways** in the left
     navigation.

04. Choose the virtual gateway with which you want to associate a new
     gateway route. If none are listed, then you need to [create a virtual gateway](virtual-gateways.md#create-virtual-gateway)
     first. You can only create a gateway route for a virtual gateway of
     which your account is listed as the **Resource**
    **owner**.

05. In the **Gateway routes** table, choose
     **Create gateway route**.

06. For **Gateway route name**, specify the name to
     use for your gateway route.

07. For **Gateway route type** choose either
     **http**, **http2**, or **grpc**.

08. Select an existing **Virtual service name**. If
     none are listed, then you need to create a [virtual service](virtual-services.md#create-virtual-service)
     first.

09. Choose the port that corresponds to the target for
     **Virtual service provider port**. Virtual
     service provider port is **required**
     when the provider (router or node) of the selected virtual service
     has multiple listeners.

10. (Optional) For **Priority**, specify the priority
     for this gateway route.

11. For **Match** configuration, specify:

- If **http/http2** is the selected
type:

- (Optional) **Method** ‐
Specifies the method header to be matched in the
incoming **http**/ **http2** requests.

- (Optional) **Port match** ‐
Match the port for incoming traffic. Port match is
**required** if this
virtual gateway has multiple listeners.

- (Optional) **Exact/Suffix**
**hostname** ‐ Specifies the hostname
that should be matched on the incoming request to
route to the target virtual service.

- (Optional) **Prefix/Exact/Regex**
**path** ‐ The method of matching the
path of the URL.

- **Prefix match** ‐ A
matched request by a gateway route is rewritten to
the target virtual service's name and the matched
prefix is rewritten to `/`, by default.
Depending on how you configure your virtual
service, it could use a virtual router to route
the request to different virtual nodes, based on
specific prefixes or headers.

###### Important

- You can't specify either
`/aws-appmesh*` or
`/aws-app-mesh*` for **Prefix**
**match**. These prefixes are reserved for
future App Mesh internal use.

- If multiple gateway routes are defined, then
a request is matched to the route with the longest
prefix. For example, if two gateway routes
existed, with one having a prefix of
`/chapter` and one having a prefix of
`/`, then a request for
`www.example.com/chapter/` would be
matched to the gateway route with the
`/chapter` prefix.

###### Note

If you enable **Path**/ **Prefix** based matching, App Mesh enables
path normalization ( [normalize\_path](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto) and [merge\_slashes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto)) to minimize the
probability of path confusion
vulnerabilities.

Path confusion vulnerabilities occur when
parties participating in the request use different
path representations.

- **Exact match** ‐ The
exact parameter disables the partial matching for
a route and makes sure that it only returns the
route if the path is an **EXACT** match to the current URL.

- **Regex match** ‐ Used
to describe patterns where multiple URLs may
actually identify a single page on the
website.

- (Optional) **Query parameters**
‐ This field allows you to match on the query
parameters.

- (Optional) **Headers** ‐
Specifies the headers for **http** and **http2**. It should match the incoming
request to route to the target virtual
service..

- If **grpc** is the selected
type:

- **Hostname match type** and
(optional) **Exact/Suffix match**
‐ Specifies the hostname that should be matched
on the incoming request to route to the target
virtual service.

- **grpc service name** ‐ The
**grpc** service acts
as an API for your application and is defined with
ProtoBuf.

###### Important

You can't specify `/aws.app-mesh*`
or `aws.appmesh` for the
**Service name**. These service
names are reserved for future App Mesh internal
use.

- (Optional) **Metadata** ‐
Specifies the metadata for **grpc**. It should match the incoming
request to route to the target virtual
service.

12. (Optional) For **Rewrite** configuration:

- If **http/http2** is the selected
type:

- If **Prefix** is the selected
match type:

- **Override automatic rewrite of**
**hostname** ‐ By default the hostname
is rewritten to the target virtual service's
name.

- **Override automatic rewrite of**
**prefix** ‐ When toggled on,
**Prefix rewrite** specifies the
value of the rewritten prefix.

- If **Exact Path** is the
selected match type:

- **Override automatic rewrite of**
**hostname** ‐ by default the hostname
is rewritten to the target virtual service's
name.

- **Path rewrite** ‐
Specifies the value of the rewritten path. No
default path.

- If **Regex Path** is the
selected match type:

- **Override automatic rewrite of**
**hostname** ‐ by default the hostname
is rewritten to the target virtual service's
name.

- **Path rewrite** ‐
Specifies the value of the rewritten path. No
default path.

- If **grpc** is the selected
type:

- **Override automatic rewrite of**
**hostname** ‐ By default the hostname
is rewritten to the target virtual service's
name.

13. Choose **Create gateway route** to finish.

AWS CLI

**To create a gateway route using the**
**AWS CLI.**

Create a gateway route using the following command and input JSON (replace
the `red` values with your own):

1. ```nohighlight

aws appmesh create-virtual-gateway \
   --mesh-name meshName \
   --virtual-gateway-name virtualGatewayName \
   --gateway-route-name gatewayRouteName \
   --cli-input-json file://create-gateway-route.json
```

2. Contents of **example**
    create-gateway-route.json:

```

       "spec": {
           "httpRoute" : {
               "match" : {
