# Envoy Proxy authorization

###### Important

End of support notice: On September 30, 2026, AWS will discontinue support for AWS App Mesh. After September 30, 2026, you will no longer be able to access the AWS App Mesh console or AWS App Mesh resources. For more information, visit this blog post [Migrating from AWS App Mesh to Amazon ECS Service Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/migrating-from-aws-app-mesh-to-amazon-ecs-service-connect).

Proxy authorization authorizes the [Envoy](envoy.md) proxy running within
an Amazon ECS task, in a Kubernetes pod running on Amazon EKS, or running on an Amazon EC2 instance to read the
configuration of one or more mesh endpoints from the App Mesh Envoy Management
Service. For customer accounts who already have Envoys connected to their App Mesh endpoint before
04/26/2021, proxy authorization is required for virtual nodes that use [Transport Layer Security\
(TLS)](tls.md) and for virtual gateways (with or without TLS). For customer accounts who want
to connect Envoys to their App Mesh endpoint after 04/26/2021, proxy authorization is required for
all App Mesh capabilities. It is recommended for all customer accounts to enable proxy
authorization for all virtual nodes, even if they don't use TLS, to have a secure and consistent
experience using IAM for authorization to specific resources. Proxy authorization requires
that the `appmesh:StreamAggregatedResources` permission is specified in an IAM
policy. The policy must be attached to an IAM role, and that IAM role must be attached to
the compute resource on which you host the proxy.

## Create IAM policy

If you want all mesh endpoints in a service mesh to be able to read the
configuration for all mesh endpoints, then skip to [Create IAM role](#create-iam-role). If you want to limit the
mesh endpoints that configuration can be read from by individual
mesh endpoints, then you need to create one or more IAM policies. Limiting the
mesh endpoints that configuration can be read from to only the Envoy proxy
running on specific compute resources is recommended. Create an IAM policy and add the
`appmesh:StreamAggregatedResources` permission to the policy. The following
example policy allows the configuration of the virtual nodes named `serviceBv1` and
`serviceBv2` to be read in a service mesh. Configuration can't be read for any
other virtual nodes defined in the service mesh. For more information about creating or
editing an IAM policy, see [Creating IAM Policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-create.md) and
[Edit\
IAM Policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-edit.md).

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "appmesh:StreamAggregatedResources",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/app1/virtualNode/serviceBv1",
                "arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/app1/virtualNode/serviceBv2"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

You can create multiple policies, with each policy restricting access to different
mesh endpoints.

## Create IAM role

If you want all mesh endpoints in a service mesh to be able to read the
configuration for all mesh endpoints, then you only need to create one IAM role.
If you want to limit the mesh endpoints that configuration can be read from by
individual mesh endpoints, then you need to create a role for each policy that
you created in the previous step. Complete the instructions for the compute resource that the
proxy runs on.

- **Amazon EKS** – If you want to use a singe role, then
you can use the existing role that was created and assigned to the worker nodes when you
created your cluster. To use multiple roles, your cluster must meet the requirements
defined in [Enabling IAM Roles\
for Service Accounts on your Cluster](../../../eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.md). Create the IAM roles and associate the
roles with Kubernetes service accounts. For more information, see [Creating an\
IAM Role and Policy for your Service Account](../../../eks/latest/userguide/create-service-account-iam-policy-and-role.md) and [Specifying an IAM Role for\
your Service Account](../../../eks/latest/userguide/specify-service-account-role.md).

- **Amazon ECS** – Select **AWS**
**service,** select **Elastic Container Service**, and then
select the **Elastic Container Service Task** use case when creating your
IAM role.

- **Amazon EC2** – Select **AWS**
**service,** select **EC2**, and then select the
**EC2** use case when creating your IAM role. This applies whether
you host the proxy directly on an Amazon EC2 instance or on Kubernetes running on an
instance.

For more information about how to create an IAM role, see [Creating a Role for an AWS Service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md#roles-creatingrole-service-console).

## Attach IAM policy

If you want all mesh endpoints in a service mesh to be able to read the
configuration for all mesh endpoints, then attach the `AWSAppMeshEnvoyAccess` managed IAM policy to the IAM role that you
created in a previous step. If you want to limit the mesh endpoints that
configuration can be read from by individual mesh endpoints, then attach each
policy that you created to each role that you created. For more information about attaching a
custom or managed IAM policy to an IAM role, see [Adding IAM Identity Permissions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-attach-detach.md#add-policies-console).

## Attach IAM role

Attach each IAM role to the appropriate compute resource:

- **Amazon EKS** – If you attached the policy to the role
attached to your worker nodes, you can skip this step. If you created separate roles, then
assign each role to a separate Kubernetes service account, and assign each service account
to an individual Kubernetes pod deployment spec that includes the Envoy proxy. For more
information, see [Specifying an IAM Role for\
your Service Account](../../../eks/latest/userguide/specify-service-account-role.md) in the _Amazon EKS User Guide_ and [Configure Service Accounts for Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account) in the Kubernetes documentation.

- **Amazon ECS** – Attach an Amazon ECS Task Role to the task
definition that includes the Envoy proxy. The task can be deployed with the EC2 or
Fargate launch type. For more information about how to create an Amazon ECS Task Role and
attach it to a task, see [Specifying an IAM Role for your Tasks](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.md#create_task_iam_policy_and_role).

- **Amazon EC2** – The IAM role must be attached to the
Amazon EC2 instance that hosts the Envoy proxy. For more information about how to attach a role
to an Amazon EC2 instance, see [I’ve created an IAM\
role, and now I want to assign it to an EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/assign-iam-role-ec2-instance).

## Confirm permission

Confirm that the `appmesh:StreamAggregatedResources` permission is assigned to
the compute resource that you host the proxy on by selecting one of the compute service
names.

Amazon EKS

A custom policy may be assigned to the role assigned to the worker nodes, to
individual pods, or both. It's recommended however, that you assign the policy only at
individual pods, so that you can restrict access of individual pods to individual
mesh endpoints. If the policy is attached to the role assigned to the
worker nodes, select the **Amazon EC2** tab, and complete the steps found
there for your worker node instances. To determine which IAM role is assigned to a
Kubernetes pod, complete the following steps.

1. View the details of a Kubernetes deployment that includes the pod that you want
    to confirm that a Kubernetes service account is assigned to. The following command
    views the details for a deployment named
    `my-deployment`.

```nohighlight

kubectl describe deployment my-deployment
```

In the returned output note the value to the right of `Service
                     Account:`. If a line that starts with `Service Account:` doesn't
    exist, then a custom Kubernetes service account isn't currently assigned to the
    deployment. You'll need to assign one. For more information, see [Configure Service Accounts for Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account) in the Kubernetes
    documentation.

2. View the details of the service account returned in the previous step. The
    following command views the details of a service account named
    `my-service-account`.

```nohighlight

kubectl describe serviceaccount my-service-account
```

Provided the Kubernetes service account is associated to an AWS Identity and Access Management role, one
    of the lines returned will look similar to the following example.

```
Annotations:         eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-deployment
```

In the previous example `my-deployment` is the name of the IAM role
    that the service account is associated with. If the service account output doesn't
    contain a line similar to the example above, then the Kubernetes service account
    isn't associated to an AWS Identity and Access Management account and you need to associate it to one. For
    more information, see [Specifying an IAM\
    Role for your Service Account](../../../eks/latest/userguide/specify-service-account-role.md).

3. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

4. In the left navigation, select **Roles**. Select the name of
    the IAM role that you noted in a previous step.

5. Confirm that either the custom policy you created previously, or the
    `AWSAppMeshEnvoyAccess` managed policy is listed. If neither
    policy is attached, [attach an IAM policy](#attach-iam-policy)
    to the IAM role. If you want to attach a custom IAM policy but don't have one,
    then you need to [create a custom IAM\
    policy](#create-iam-policy) with the required permissions. If a custom IAM policy is attached,
    select the policy and confirm that it contains `"Action":
                     "appmesh:StreamAggregatedResources"`. If it does not, then you need to add
    that permission to your custom IAM policy. You can also confirm that the
    appropriate Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a specific mesh endpoint is listed. If no
    ARNs are listed, then you can edit the policy to add, remove, or change the listed
    ARNs. For more information, see [Edit IAM\
    Policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-edit.md) and [Create IAM policy](#create-iam-policy).

6. Repeat the previous steps for each Kubernetes pod that contains the Envoy
    proxy.

Amazon ECS

1. From the Amazon ECS console, choose **Task Definitions**.

2. Select your Amazon ECS task.

3. On the **Task Definition Name** page, select your task
    definition.

4. On the **Task Definition** page, select the link of the IAM
    role name that is to the right of **Task Role**. If an IAM role
    isn't listed, then you need to [create an IAM\
    role](#create-iam-role) and attach it to your task by [updating your\
    task definition.](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/update-task-definition.md)

5. In the **Summary** page, on the
    **Permissions** tab, confirm that either the custom policy you
    created previously, or the `AWSAppMeshEnvoyAccess` managed policy is listed. If neither
    policy is attached, [attach an IAM policy](#attach-iam-policy)
    to the IAM role. If you want to attach a custom IAM policy but don't have one,
    then you need to [create the custom IAM\
    policy](#create-iam-policy). If a custom IAM policy is attached, select the policy and confirm
    that it contains `"Action": "appmesh:StreamAggregatedResources"`. If it
    does not, then you need to add that permission to your custom IAM policy. You can
    also confirm that the appropriate Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a specific
    mesh endpoints is listed. If no ARNs are listed, then you can edit
    the policy to add, remove, or change the listed ARNs. For more information, see
    [Edit IAM\
    Policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-edit.md) and [Create IAM policy](#create-iam-policy).

6. Repeat the previous steps for each task definition that contains the Envoy
    proxy.

Amazon EC2

1. From the Amazon EC2 console, select **Instances** in the left
    navigation.

2. Select one of your instances that hosts the Envoy proxy.

3. In the **Description** tab, select the link of the IAM role
    name that is to the right of **IAM role**. If an IAM role isn't
    listed, then you need to [create an IAM\
    role](#create-iam-role).

4. In the **Summary** page, on the
    **Permissions** tab, confirm that either the custom policy you
    created previously, or the `AWSAppMeshEnvoyAccess` managed policy is listed. If neither
    policy is attached, [attach the IAM policy](#attach-iam-policy)
    to the IAM role. If you want to attach a custom IAM policy but don't have one,
    then you need to [create the custom IAM\
    policy](#create-iam-policy). If a custom IAM policy is attached, select the policy and confirm
    that it contains `"Action": "appmesh:StreamAggregatedResources"`. If it
    does not, then you need to add that permission to your custom IAM policy. You can
    also confirm that the appropriate Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a specific
    mesh endpoints is listed. If no ARNs are listed, then you can edit
    the policy to add, remove, or change the listed ARNs. For more information, see
    [Edit IAM\
    Policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-manage-edit.md) and [Create IAM policy](#create-iam-policy).

5. Repeat the previous steps for each instance that you host the Envoy proxy
    on.
