# Creating frameworks using the AWS Backup console
<a name="creating-frameworks-console"></a>

After turning on resource tracking, create a framework using the following steps.

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Frameworks**.

1. Choose **Create Framework**.

1. For **Framework name**, enter a unique name. The framework name must be between 1 and 256 characters, starting with a letter, and consisting of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (\_).

1. (Optional) Enter a **Framework description**.

1. In **Controls**, your active controls will be displayed. By default, all controls eligible for a resource are listed.

   To change which controls are active, click **Edit controls**.

   1. The first check box indicates if the control is turned on. To turn off a control, uncheck the box.

   1. Under **Choose resources to evaluate**, you can select how to choose resources, either by type, by tags, or by a single resource.

   The list of [AWS Backup Audit Manager controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/controls-and-remediation.html) describes the customization options for each control.

1. (Optional) Tag your framework by choosing **Add new tag**. You can use tags to search and filter your frameworks or track your costs.

1. Choose **Create framework**.

AWS Backup Audit Manager might take several minutes to create the framework.

If the error `AlreadyExists` occurs, a framework with the same controls and parameters already exists. To successfully create a new framework, at least one control or parameter must be different from existing frameworks.
