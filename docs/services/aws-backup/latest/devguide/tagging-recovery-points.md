# Add or remove tags on existing recovery points
<a name="tagging-recovery-points"></a>

In addition to copying tags from source resources at backup creation time, you can add, modify, or remove tags on existing recovery points.

**Important**
You can only manage tags via the AWS Backup console and API for recovery points of resources that are [fully managed by AWS Backup](whatisbackup.md#full-management). For non-fully managed resources (such as Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, Amazon RDS, and Aurora), the **Manage tags** option is not available in the console. To manage tags on these recovery points, use the underlying service's tagging capabilities instead.

## Required permissions
<a name="tagging-recovery-points-permissions"></a>

The IAM role or user performing the tagging operation must have the following permissions:
+ `backup:TagResource` – Required to add or modify tags on a recovery point.
+ `backup:UntagResource` – Required to remove tags from a recovery point.
+ `backup:ListTags` – Required to view existing tags on a recovery point.
