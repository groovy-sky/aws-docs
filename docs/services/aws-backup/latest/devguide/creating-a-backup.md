# Backup creation by resource type
<a name="creating-a-backup"></a>

With AWS Backup, you can create backups automatically using backup plans or manually by initiating an on-demand backup.

## Creating automatic backups
<a name="creating-automatic-backups"></a>

When backups are created automatically by backup plans, they are configured with the lifecycle settings that are defined in the backup plan. They are organized in the backup vault that is specified in the backup plan. They are also assigned the tags that are listed in the backup plan. For more information about backup plans, see [Backup plans](about-backup-plans.md).

## Creating on-demand backups
<a name="creating-on-demand-backups"></a>

When you create an on-demand backup, you can configure these settings for the backup that is being created. When a backup is created either automatically or manually, a backup *job* is initiated. For how to create an on-demand backup, see [Creating an on-demand backup using AWS Backup](recov-point-create-on-demand-backup.md).

Note: An on-demand backup creates a backup job; the backup job will transition in state of `Running` within an hour (or when specified). You can choose an on-demand backup if you wish to create a backup at a time other than the scheduled time defined in a backup plan. An on-demand backup can be used, for example, to test backup and functionality at any time.

[ On-demand backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/recov-point-create-on-demand-backup.html) cannot be used with [ point-in-time restore (PITR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/point-in-time-recovery.html) since an on-demand backup preserves resources in the state they are in when the backup is taken, whereas PITR uses [ continuous backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/point-in-time-recovery.html#point-in-time-recovery-working-with) which record changes over a period of time.

## Backup job statuses
<a name="backup-job-statuses"></a>

Each backup job has a unique ID. For example, `D48D8717-0C9D-72DF-1F56-14E703BF2345`.

You can view the status of a backup job on the **Jobs** page of the AWS Backup console. Backup job statuses include `CREATED`, `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `ABORTING`, `ABORTED`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `EXPIRED`, and `PARTIAL`.

## Incremental backups
<a name="incremental-backup-works"></a>

Many resources support incremental backup with AWS Backup. A full list is available in the incremental backup section of the [Feature availability by resource](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource) table.

Although each backup after the first (full) one is incremental (meaning it only captures changes from the previous backup), all backups made with AWS Backup retain the necessary reference data to allow a full restore. This is true even if the original (full) backup has reached the end of its lifecycle and been deleted.

For example, if your day 1 (full) backup was deleted due to a 3-day lifecycle policy, you would still be able to perform a full restore with the backups from days 2 and 3. AWS Backup maintains the necessary reference data from day 1 to do so.

**Incremental backups and Regions**

Backups of resources which are fully managed by AWS Backup can only be incremental if the vault in which the backup is created also contains an earlier backup (incremental or full); other resource types (not fully managed by AWS Backup) can have incremental backups as long as there is a previous backup of the resource within the same *Region*.

**Note**
Not all resource types support incremental backups. Some resources, such as Amazon Aurora, offer incremental backup only through continuous backups and point-in-time restore (PITR), not through snapshot-based backups. For a full list of which resources support incremental backups, see the [Feature availability by resource](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource) table.

## Access to source resources
<a name="source-resource-statuses"></a>

AWS Backup needs access to your source resources to back them up. For example:
+ To back up an Amazon EC2 instance, the instance can be in the `running` or `stopped` state, but not the `terminated` state. This is because a `running` or `stopped` instance can communicate with AWS Backup, but a `terminated` instance cannot.
+ To back up a virtual machine, its hypervisor must have the Backup gateway status `ONLINE`. For more information, see [Understanding hypervisor status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/working-with-hypervisors.html#understand-hypervisor-status).
+ To back up an Amazon RDS database, Amazon Aurora, or Amazon DocumentDB cluster, those resources must have the status `AVAILABLE`.
+ To back up an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), it must have the status `AVAILABLE`.
+ To back up an Amazon FSx file system, it must have the status `AVAILABLE`. If the status is `UPDATING`, the backup request is queued until the file system becomes `AVAILABLE`.

  FSx for ONTAP doesn’t support backing up certain volume types, including DP (data-protection) volumes, LS (load-sharing) volumes, full volumes, or volumes on file systems that are full. For more information, please see [FSx for ONTAP Working with backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/using-backups.html).

AWS Backup retains previously-created backups consistent with your lifecycle policy, regardless of the health of your source resource.
