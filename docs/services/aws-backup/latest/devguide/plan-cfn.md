# CloudFormation templates for backup plans

We provide three sample CloudFormation templates for your reference. The first template creates a
simple backup plan. The second template enables VSS backups in a backup plan. The third
template enables Amazon GuardDuty Malware Protection scanning in a backup plan.

###### Note

If you are using the default service role, replace
`service-role` with
`AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForBackup`.
