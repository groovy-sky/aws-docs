# Data protection in AWS Backup

AWS Backup conforms to the AWS [shared responsibility\
model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model), which includes regulations and guidelines for data protection. AWS is
responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all the AWS services. AWS
maintains control over data hosted on this infrastructure, including the security
configuration controls for handling customer content and personal data. AWS customers and
AWS Partner Network (APN) partners, acting either as data controllers or data processors,
are responsible for any personal data that they put in the AWS Cloud.

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account credentials and
set up individual user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This helps ensure that each user is
given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties. We also recommend that you
secure your data in the following ways:

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.

- Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to communicate with
AWS resources.

- Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS
services.

We strongly recommend that you never put sensitive identifying information, such as your
customers' account numbers, into free-form fields such as a **Name** field. This includes when you work with AWS Backup or other AWS
services using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Any data that you enter into
AWS Backup or other services might get picked up for inclusion in diagnostic logs. When you
provide a URL to an external server, don't include credentials information in the URL to
validate your request to that server.

_Security Blog_.
