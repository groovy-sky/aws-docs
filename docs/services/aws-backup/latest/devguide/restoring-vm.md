# Restore a virtual machine using AWS Backup
<a name="restoring-vm"></a>

You can restore a virtual machine to VMware, VMware Cloud on AWS, VMware Cloud on AWS Outposts, an Amazon EBS volume, or [to an Amazon EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restoring-ec2.html). Restoring (or migrating) a virtual machine to EC2 requires a license. By default, AWS will include a license (charges apply). For more information, see [Licensing options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/licensing.html) in the *VM Import/Export User Guide*.

You can restore a VMware virtual machine using the AWS Backup console or through the AWS CLI. When a virtual machine is restored, the VMware Tools folder is not included. See VMware documentation to reinstall VMware Tools.

AWS Backup restores of virtual machines are non-destructive, meaning AWS Backup does not overwrite existing virtual machines during a restore. Instead, the restore job deploys a new virtual machine.

## Considerations when restoring a VM to an Amazon EC2 instance
<a name="vm-restore-ec2"></a>
+ Restoring (or migrating) a virtual machine to EC2 requires a license. By default, an AWS will include a license (charges apply). For more information, see [Licensing options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/licensing.html) in the *VM Import/Export User Guide*.
+ There is a maximum limit of 5 TB (terabytes) for each virtual machine disk.
+ You can't specify a key pair when you restore the virtual machine to an instance. You can add a key pair to `authorized_keys` during launch (through instance user data) or after launch (as described in [this troubleshooting section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#replacing-lost-key-pair) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide).
+ Confirm your [operating system is supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/prerequisites.html#vmimport-operating-systems) for import to and export from Amazon EC2 in the *VM Import/Export User Guide*.
+ Review limitations involved with [Importing VMs to Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/prerequisites.html#limitations-image) in the *VM Import/Export User Guide*.
+ When you restore to an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CLI, you must specify `"RestoreTo":"EC2Instance"`. All other attributes have default values.
+ Amazon EC2 offers [EC2 Allowed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html). If this setting is enabled in your account, add the alias `aws-backup-vault` to your allowlist. Otherwise, restore operations of VM recovery points to EC2 instances will fail with an error message, such as "Source AMI not found in Region".
+ VMware restores to EC2 involving more than 21 disks are not supported. As a workaround, use [VMware Restores to EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restoring-vm.html#restore-vm-ebs) to restore each disk individually as an EBS volume, then attach the EBS volumes to an EC2 instance.

## Use the AWS Backup console to restore virtual machine recovery points
<a name="vm-restore-console"></a>

You can restore a virtual machine from multiple locations in the left navigation pane of the AWS Backup console:
+ Choose **Hypervisors** to view recovery points for virtual machines managed by a hypervisor that is connected to AWS Backup.
+ Choose **Virtual machines** to view recovery points for virtual machines across all your hypervisors that are connected to AWS Backup.
+ Choose **Backup vaults** to view recovery points stored in a specific AWS Backup vault.
+ Choose **Protected resources** to view recovery points across all your AWS Backup protected resources.

If you need to restore a virtual machine that no longer has a connection with Backup gateway, choose **Backup vaults** or **Protected resources** to locate your recovery point.

**Options**
+ [Restore to VMware](#restore-vm-vmware)
+ [Restore to an Amazon EBS volume](#restore-vm-ebs)
+ [Restore to an Amazon EC2 instance](#restore-vm-ec2)<a name="restore-vm-vmware"></a>

## Use AWS CLI to restore virtual machine recovery points
<a name="vm-restore-cli"></a>

Use `[StartRestoreJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_StartRestoreJob.html)`.

You can specify the following metadata for a virtual machine restore to Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS:

```
RestoreTo
InstanceType
VpcId
SubnetId
SecurityGroupIds
IamInstanceProfileName
InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior
HibernationOptions
DisableApiTermination
Placement
CreditSpecification
RamdiskId
KernelId
UserData
EbsOptimized
LicenseSpecifications
KmsKeyId
AvailabilityZone
EbsVolumeType
IsEncrypted
ItemsToRestore
RequireIMDSv2
NetworkInterfaces
```

AWS Backup supports both partial restores to Amazon EBS and full restores to Amazon EC2. For partial restores, use `ItemsToRestore` to specify which disk to restore to the specified EBS volume. When restoring to Amazon EC2, the parameter `ItemsToRestore` can be left blank because it is ignored and the full list of disks is restored.

You can specify the following metadata for a virtual machine restore to VMware, VMware Cloud on AWS, and VMware cloud on AWS Outpost:

```
RestoreTo
HypervisorArn
VMName
VMPath
ComputeResourceName
VMDatastore
DisksToRestore
ItemsToRestore
```

AWS Backup supports both partial and full restores to an on-premises virtual machine. You can choose to restore all disks or only a subset of disks. When performing a partial restore, specify your disk selection in `ItemsToRestore`. When performing a full restore, you must either omit both `DisksToRestore` and `ItemsToRestore`, or specify all the disks in `DisksToRestore`. The `DisksToRestore` parameter does not support subsets of disks.

This example shows how to conduct a full restore to VMware:

```
'{"RestoreTo":"VMware","HypervisorArn":"arn:aws:backup-gateway:us-east-1:209870788375:hypervisor/hype-9B1AB1F1","VMName":"name","VMPath":"/Labster/vm","ComputeResourceName":"Cluster","VMDatastore":"vsanDatastore","DisksToRestore":"[{\"DiskId\":\"2000\",\"Label\":\"Hard disk 1\"}]","vmId":"vm-101"}'
```
