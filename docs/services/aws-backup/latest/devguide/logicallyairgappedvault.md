# Logically air-gapped vault

## Overview of logically air-gapped vaults

AWS Backup offers a secondary type of vault which can store backups in a container
with additional security features. A **logically air-gapped vault** is a
specialized vault which provides increased security beyond a standard backup vault, as well
as the ability to share vault access to other accounts so that recovery
time objectives (RTOs) can be faster and more flexible in case of an incident that requires
rapid restoration of resources.

Logically air-gapped vaults come equipped with additional protection features; each
vault is encrypted with either an [AWS owned key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) (default) or optionally with a customer-managed KMS key, and each vault is equipped with [AWS Backup Vault\
Lock](vault-lock.md)'s compliance mode. The encryption key type information is visible through AWS Backup APIs and console for transparency and compliance reporting.

You can integrate your logically air-gapped vaults with [Multi-party approval](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/multipartyapproval.html) (MPA) to enable recovery of backups in
the vaults even if the vault-owning account is inaccessible, which helps to maintain
business continuity. Further more, you can choose to integrate with [AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-create.html) (RAM) to share a logically air-gapped vault with other AWS accounts
(including accounts in other organizations) so that the backups stored within the vault can
be restored from an account with which the vault is shared, if needed for data loss recovery
or [restore testing](restore-testing.md). As part of this added security, a
logically air-gapped vault stores its backups in an AWS Backup service owned account (which
results in backups shown as shared outside your organization in modify attribute items in
AWS CloudTrail logs).

In the scenario where your logically air-gapped vault owning account is closed (maliciously or otherwise), you can still access backups in the vault (restore or copy them)
via MPA until the [post-closure period](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-closing.md#post-closure-period) ends.
After the post-closure period expires, the backups are no longer accessible. During the post-closure period, you can reference the
[AWS Account Management documentation](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-closing.md#what-to-expect-after-closure) to regain control of your account while working on recovery.

For greater resiliency, we recommend creating cross-Region copies in logically air-gapped vaults in same or separate accounts.
However, if you want to reduce storage costs by maintaining just a single copy, you can use
[Primary backups to logically air-gapped vaults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/lag-vault-primary-backup.html), after onboarding to AWS MPA.

You can view the storage pricing for backups of supported services in a logically
air-gapped vault on the [AWS Backup pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/pricing)
page.

See [Feature availability by resource](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource) for
resource types you can copy to a logically air-gapped vault.

## Use case for logically air-gapped vaults

A logically air-gapped vault is a secondary vault that serves as part of a data
protection strategy. This vault can help enhance your organization's retention strategy and
recovery when you desire a vault for your backups that

- Is automatically set with a vault lock in [compliance\
mode](vault-lock.md)

- By default offers encryption with an AWS owned key. Optionally you can provide a customer managed key

- Contains backups which, through AWS RAM or MPA, can be shared with and restored from a
different account than the one that created the backup

**Considerations and limitations**

- Unencrypted Amazon Aurora, Amazon DocumentDB, and Amazon Neptune clusters are not supported for logically air-gapped vault,
as they do not support encryption of unencrypted DB cluster snapshots.

- Amazon EC2 offers [EC2 Allowed AMIs](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-allowed-amis.md). If
this setting is enabled in your account, add the alias `aws-backup-vault` to your
allowlist.

If this alias is not included, copy operations from a logically air-gapped vault to
a backup vault and restore operations of EC2 instances from a logically air-gapped vault
will fail with an error message such as "Source AMI ami-xxxxxx not found in Region."

- The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of a recovery point stored in a logically air-gapped
vault will have `backup` in place of the underlying resource type. For
example, if the original ARN begins with
`arn:aws:ec2:region::image/ami-*` , then the
ARN of the recovery point in the logically air-gapped vault will be
`arn:aws:backup:region:account-id:recovery-point:*`.

You can use the CLI command [`list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListRecoveryPointsByBackupVault.html) to determine the
ARN.

## Compare and contrast with a standard backup vault

A **backup vault** is the primary and standard type of vault used in
AWS Backup. Each backup is stored in a backup vault when the backup is created. You can assign
resource-based policies to manage backups stored in the vault, such as the lifecycle of
backups stored within the vault.

A **logically air-gapped vault** is a specialized vault with additional
security and flexible sharing for faster recovery time (RTO). This vault stores primary backups or
copies of backups that were initially created and stored within a standard backup vault.

Backup vaults are encrypted with a key, a security mechanism
that limits access to intended users. These keys can be customer managed or AWS managed.
See [Copy encryption](encryption.md#copy-encryption) for encryption behavior
during copy jobs, including copying into a logically air-gapped vault.

Additionally, a backup vault can have additional security through a vault lock; logically air-gapped
vaults come equipped by a vault lock in compliance mode.

Similar to backup vaults, logically air-gapped vaults also support
[restricted tags](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-tags.md#tag-restrictions)
for Amazon EC2 backups.

FeatureBackup vaultLogically air-gapped vault[AWS Backup Audit Manager](aws-backup-audit-manager.md)You can use AWS Backup Audit Manager [Controls and remediation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/controls-and-remediation.html) to monitor your backup vaults.Ensure a backup of a specific resource is stored in
[at least one logically air-gapped\
vault](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/controls-and-remediation.html#resources-in-lag-vault-control) on a schedule you determine, in addition to controls available to
standard vaults.

[Billing](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/pricing)

Storage and data transfer charges for resources fully managed by AWS Backup
occur under "AWS Backup". Other resource type storage and data transfer charges will
occur under their respective services.

For example, Amazon EBS backups will show under "Amazon EBS"; Amazon S3 backups will show
under "AWS Backup".

All billing charges from these vaults (storage or data transfer) occur
under "AWS Backup".

[Regions](whatisbackup.md#features-by-region)

Available in all Regions in which AWS Backup operates

Available in most Regions supported by AWS Backup. Not currently available in
Asia Pacific (Malaysia), Canada West (Calgary), Mexico (Central),
Asia Pacific (Thailand), Asia Pacific (Taipei), Asia Pacific (New Zealand), China (Beijing),
China (Ningxia), AWS GovCloud (US-East), or AWS GovCloud (US-West).

[Resources](whatisbackup.md#supported-resources)

Can store copies of backups for most resource types that support
cross-account copy.

See the logically air-gapped vault column in
[Feature availability by resource](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource)
for resources that can be copied to
this vault.

[Restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restoring-a-backup.html)

Backups can be restored by the same account to which the
vault belongs.

Backups can be restored by a different account than the one to
which the vault belongs if the vault is shared with that separate account.

[Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/security-considerations.html)

Can optionally be encrypted with a key (customer managed or AWS
managed)

Can optionally use a vault lock in compliance or governance
mode

Can be encrypted with an [AWS owned key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) or a customer managed key

Is always locked with a [vault lock](vault-lock.md) in
compliance mode

Encryption key type information is preserved and visible when vaults are shared through AWS RAM or MPA

[Sharing](#lag-share)

Access can be managed through policies and [AWS Organizations](manage-cross-account.md)

Not compatible with AWS RAM

Can optionally be shared across accounts using [AWS RAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-create.html)

## Create a logically air-gapped vault

You can create a logically air-gapped vault either through the AWS Backup console or through
a combination of AWS Backup and AWS RAM CLI commands.

Each logically air-gapped comes equipped with a vault lock in compliance mode. See [AWS Backup Vault Lock](vault-lock.md) to help determine the retention
period values most appropriate for your operation

Console

###### Create a logically air-gapped vault from the console

01. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

02. In the navigation pane, select **Vaults**.

03. Both types of vaults will be displayed. Select **Create new**
    **vault**.

04. Enter a name for your backup vault. You can name your vault to reflect what
     you will store in it, or to make it easier to search for the backups you need. For
     example, you could name it `FinancialBackups`.

05. Select the radio button for **Logically air-gapped vault**.

06. _(Optional)_ Choose an encryption key. You can select a customer-managed KMS key for additional control over encryption, or use the default AWS-owned key (recommended).

07. Set the **Minimum retention period**.

    This value (in days, months, or years) is the shortest amount of time a backup
     can be retained in this vault. Backups with retention periods shorter than this
     value cannot be copied to this vault.

    The minimum value allowed is `7` days. Values for months
     and years meet this minimum.

08. Set the **Maximum retention period**.

    This value (in days, months, or years) is the longest amount of time a backup
     can be retained in this vault. Backups with retention periods greater than this
     value cannot be copied to this vault.

09. _(Optional)_ Set the **Encryption key**.

    Specify the key to use with your vault. You can choose an **AWS owned key (managed by AWS Backup)**
     or enter the ARN for a **Customer managed key** that preferably belongs to a different account to which
     you have access. AWS Backup recommends using an AWS owned key.

10. _(Optional)_ Add tags that will help you search for and
     identify your logically air-gapped vault. For example, you could add a
     `BackupType:Financial` tag.

11. Select **Create vault**.

12. Review the settings. If all settings show as you intended, select
     **Create logically air-gapped vault**.

13. The console will take you to the details page of your new vault. Verify the
     vault details are as expected.

14. Select **Vaults** to view vaults in your account. Your logically air-gapped vault
     will be displayed. The KMS key will be available approximately 1 to 3 minutes
     after the vault creation. Refresh the page to see the associated key. Once the key
     is visible, the vault is in an available state and can be used.

AWS CLI

Create a logically air-gapped vault from CLI

You can use AWS CLI to programmatically carry out operations for logically
air-gapped vaults. Each CLI is specific to the AWS service in which it originates.
Commands related to sharing are prepended with `aws ram`; all other
commands should be prepended with `aws backup`.

Use the CLI command [`create-logically-air-gapped-backup-vault`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/create-logically-air-gapped-backup-vault.html), modified with the
following parameters:

```json

aws backup create-logically-air-gapped-backup-vault
--region us-east-1 // optional
--backup-vault-name sampleName // required
--min-retention-days 7 // required Value must be an integer 7 or greater
--max-retention-days 35 // required
--encryption-key-arn arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 // optional
--creator-request-id 123456789012-34567-8901 // optional
```

The optional `--encryption-key-arn` parameter allows you to specify a customer-managed KMS key for vault encryption. If not provided, the vault will use an AWS-owned key.

Example CLI command to create a logically air-gapped vault:

```json

aws backup create-logically-air-gapped-backup-vault
--region us-east-1
--backup-vault-name sampleName
--min-retention-days 7
--max-retention-days 35
--creator-request-id 123456789012-34567-8901 // optional
```

Example CLI command to create a logically air-gapped vault with customer-managed encryption:

```json

aws backup create-logically-air-gapped-backup-vault
--region us-east-1
--backup-vault-name sampleName
--min-retention-days 7
--max-retention-days 35
--encryption-key-arn arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
--creator-request-id 123456789012-34567-8901 // optional
```

See [CreateLogicallyAirGappedBackupVault API response elements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_CreateLogicallyAirGappedBackupVault.html) for information
after the create operation. If the operation was successful, the new logically
air-gapped vault will have the VaultState of `CREATING`.

Once the creation is complete and the KMS encrypted key has been assigned, the
VaultState will transition to `AVAILABLE`. Once available, the vault can be
used. `VaultState` can be retrieved by calling [`DescribeBackupVault`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_DescribeBackupVault.html) or [`ListBackupVaults`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupVaults.html).

## View logically air-gapped vault details

You can see the vault details such as summary, the recovery points, the protected
resources, account sharing, access policy, and tags through the AWS Backup console or the AWS Backup
CLI.

Console

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

2. Select **Vaults** from the left-hand navigation.

3. Below the descriptions of vaults will be three lists, **Vaults created by**
**this account**, **Vaults shared through RAM**, and
    **Vaults accessible through Multi-party approval**.
    Select the desired tab to view the vaults.

4. Under **Vault name**, click on the name of the vault to open
    the details page. You can see the summary, the recovery points, the protected
    resources, account sharing, access policy, and tag details.

Details display depending on account type: Accounts which own a vault can
    view account sharing; accounts which do not own a vault will not be able
    to view account sharing. For shared vaults, the encryption key type (AWS-owned
    or customer-managed KMS key) is displayed in the vault summary.

AWS CLI

View details of a logically air-gapped vault through CLI

The CLI command [`describe-backup-vault`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/describe-backup-vault.html) can be used to obtain details about a
vault. Parameter `backup-vault-name` is required; `region` is
optional.

```json

aws backup describe-backup-vault
--region us-east-1
--backup-vault-name testvaultname
```

Example of response:

```json

}
```

###### Note

The `VaultType` field is not included in the API response in regions where logically air-gapped vaults are not available.

## Creating backups in a logically air-gapped vault

Logically air-gapped vaults can be a copy job destination target in a backup plan
or a target for an on-demand copy job. It can also be used as a primary backup target. See
[Primary backups to logically air-gapped vaults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/lag-vault-primary-backup.html).

**Compatible encryption**

A successful copy job from a backup vault to a logically air-gapped vault requires
an encryption key that is determined by the resource type being copied.

When you create or copy a backup of a [fully managed\
resource type](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource), the source resource can be encrypted by a customer managed key or by an AWS managed key.

When you create or copy a backup of other resource types (ones [not fully managed](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource)), the source must be encrypted with a customer managed key. AWS managed keys
for not fully managed resources are not supported.

**Create or copy backups to a logically air-gapped vault through a backup plan**

You can copy a backup (recovery point) from a standard backup vault to a logically
air-gapped vault by [creating a new backup plan](creating-a-backup-plan.md)
or [updating an existing one](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/updating-a-backup-plan.html) in the AWS Backup
console or through the AWS CLI commands [`create-backup-plan`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/create-backup-plan.html) and [`update-backup-plan`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/update-backup-plan.html). You can also create backups directly in a logically air-gapped vault
by using it as a primary target. See
[Primary backups to logically air-gapped vaults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/lag-vault-primary-backup.html)
for more details.

You can copy a backup from one logically air-gapped vault to another logically
air-gapped vault on-demand (this type of backup cannot be scheduled in a backup plan). You
can copy a backup from a logically air-gapped vault to a standard backup vault as long as
the copy is encrypted with a customer managed key.

**On-demand backup copy to a logically air-gapped vault**

To create a one-time [on-demand](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/recov-point-create-on-demand-backup.html) copy of a backup to a logically air-gapped vault, you can copy from a
standard backup vault. Cross-Region or cross-account copies are available if the resource
type supports the copy type.

**Copy availability**

A copy of a backup can be created from the account to which the vault belongs. Accounts
with which the vault has been shared have the ability to view or a restore a backup, but not
to create a copy.

Only [resource types that support cross-Region or\
cross-account copy](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource) can be included.

Console

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

2. Select **Vaults** from the left-hand navigation.

3. In the vault detail page, all recovery points within that vault are displayed.
    Place a check mark next to the recovery point you wish to copy.

4. Select **Actions**, and then select **Copy**
    from the drop-down menu.

5. On the next screen, input the details of the destination.
1. Specify the destination Region.

2. Destination backup vault drop-down menu displays eligible destination
       vaults. Select one with the type `logically air-gapped
                            vault`
6. Select **Copy** once all details are set to your preferences.

On the **Jobs** page in the console, you can select
**Copy** jobs to see current copy jobs.

AWS CLI

Use [start-copy-job](https://amazonaws.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_StartCopyJob.html) to copy an existing backup in a backup vault to a logically
air-gapped vault.

Sample CLI input:

```json

aws backup start-copy-job
--region us-east-1
--recovery-point-arn arn:aws:resourcetype:region::snapshot/snap-12345678901234567
--source-backup-vault-name sourcevaultname
--destination-backup-vault-arn arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:destinationvaultname
--iam-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/servicerole
```

For more information, see [Copying a backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/recov-point-create-a-copy.html),
[cross-Region backup](cross-region-backup.md), and [Cross-account\
backup](create-cross-account-backup.md).

## Share a logically air-gapped vault

You can use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a logically air-gapped vault with other accounts
you designate. When sharing vaults, the encryption key type information (AWS-owned or
customer-managed KMS key) is preserved and visible to accounts with which the vault is shared.

A vault can be shared with an account in its organization or with an account in another
organization. The vault cannot be shared with an entire organization, only with accounts within the
organization.

Only accounts with specific IAM privileges can share and manage the sharing of vaults.

To share using AWS RAM, ensure you have the following:

- Two or more accounts that can access AWS Backup

- Vault-owning account that intends to share has necessary RAM permissions. The permission
`ram:CreateResourceShare` is necessary for this procedure. The policy
`AWSResourceAccessManagerFullAccess` contains all needed RAM-related
permissions:

- `backup:DescribeBackupVault`

- `backup:DescribeRecoveryPoint`

- `backup:GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata`

- `backup:ListProtectedResourcesByBackupVault`

- `backup:ListRecoveryPointsByBackupVault`

- `backup:ListTags`

- `backup:StartRestoreJob`

- At least one logically air-gapped vault

Console

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

2. Select **Vaults** from the left-hand navigation.

3. Below the descriptions of vaults will be two lists, **Vaults owned by**
**this account** and **Vaults shared with this**
**account**. Vaults owned by the account are eligible to be
    shared.

4. Under **Vault name**, select the name of the logically
    air-gapped vault to open the details page.

5. The **Account sharing** pane shows with which accounts the
    vault is being shared.

6. To begin sharing with another account or to edit accounts already being
    shared, select **Manage sharing**.

7. The AWS RAM console opens when **Manage sharing** is selected.
    For steps to share a resource using AWS RAM, see [Creating a resource\
    share in AWS RAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-create.html) in the _AWS RAM User_
_Guide_.

8. The account invited to accept an invitation to receive a share has 12 hours to
    accept the invitation. See [Accepting and\
    rejecting resource share invitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-shared-invitations.html) in the _AWS RAM User_
_Guide_.

9. If the sharing steps are completed and accepted, the vault summary page will
    show under **Account sharing = “Shared - see account sharing table**
**below**”.

AWS CLI

AWS RAM uses the CLI command `create-resource-share`. The access to this
command is only available to accounts with sufficient permissions. See [Creating a resource share in AWS RAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-create.html) for CLI steps.

Steps 1 through 4 are conducted with the account that owns the logically
air-gapped vault. Steps 5 through 8 are conducted with the account with which the
logically air-gapped vault will be shared.

1. Log into the owning account OR request a user at your organization with
    sufficient credentials for accessing the source account completes these steps.
1. If a resource share was previously created and you wish to add an
       additional resource to it, use CLI `associate-resource-share`
       instead with the ARN of the new vault.
2. Fetch credentials of a role with sufficient permissions to share via RAM.
    [Input these into the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html#getting-started-quickstart-new).
1. The permission `ram:CreateResourceShare` is necessary for this
       procedure. The policy [AWSResourceAccessManagerFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1) contains all RAM-related
       permissions.
3. Use [create-resource-share](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ram/create-resource-share.html).
1. Include the ARN of the logically air-gapped vault.

2. Example input:

      ```json

      aws ram create-resource-share
      --name MyLogicallyAirGappedVault
      --resource-arns arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:test-vault-1
      --principals 123456789012
      --region us-east-1
      ```

3. Example output:

      ```json

      {
         "resourceShare":{
            "resourceShareArn":"arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/12345678-abcd-09876543",
            "name":"MyLogicallyAirGappedVault",
            "owningAccountId":"123456789012",
            "allowExternalPrincipals":true,
            "status":"ACTIVE",
            "creationTime":"2021-09-14T20:42:40.266000-07:00",
            "lastUpdatedTime":"2021-09-14T20:42:40.266000-07:00"
         }
      }
      ```
4. Copy the resource share ARN in the output (which is needed for subsequent
    steps). Give the ARN to the operator of account you are inviting to receive the
    share.

5. Obtain the resource share ARN
1. If you did not perform steps 1 through 4, obtain the resourceShareArn from
       whomever did.

2. Example:
       `arn:aws:ram:us-east-1:123456789012:resource-share/12345678-abcd-09876543`
6. In the CLI, assume credentials of the recipient account.

7. Get resource share invitation with [`get-resource-share-invitations`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ram/get-resource-share-invitations.html). For more information,
    see [Accepting and\
    rejecting invitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-shared-invitations.html) in the _AWS RAM User_
_Guide_.

8. Accept the invitation in destination (recovery) account.
1. Use [`accept-resource-share-invitation`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ram/accept-resource-share-invitation.html) (can also [`reject-resource-share-invitation`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ram/reject-resource-share-invitation.html)).

You can use AWS RAM CLI commands to view shared items:

- Resources you have shared:

`aws ram list-resources --resource-owner SELF --resource-type
                      backup:backup-vault --region us-east-1`

- Show the principal:

`aws ram get-resource-share-associations --association-type PRINCIPAL
                      --region us-east-1`

- Resources shared by other accounts:

`aws ram list-resources --resource-owner OTHER-ACCOUNTS --resource-type
                      backup:backup-vault --region us-east-1`

## Restore a backup from a logically air-gapped vault

You can restore a backup stored in a logically air-gapped vault from either the account
that owns the vault or from any account with which the vault is shared.

See [Restoring a backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restoring-a-backup.html) for information on how to restore a recovery point through the
AWS Backup console.

Once a backup has been shared from a logically air-gapped vault to your account, you
can use [`start-restore-job`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/start-restore-job.html) to restore the backup.

A sample CLI input can include
the following command and parameters:

```json

aws backup start-restore-job
--recovery-point-arn arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:accountnumber:recovery-point:RecoveryPointID
--metadata {\"availabilityzone\":\"us-east-1d\"}
--idempotency-token TokenNumber
--resource-type ResourceType
--iam-role arn:aws:iam::number:role/service-role/servicerole
--region us-east-1
```

## Delete a logically air-gapped vault

See [delete a vault](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/create-a-vault.html#delete-a-vault). Vaults cannot be deleted if they still
contain backups (recovery points). Ensure the vault is empty of backups before you initiate
a delete operation.

Deletion of a vault also deletes the key associated with the vault seven days after
the vault is deleted in accordance with key deletion policy.

The following sample CLI command [`delete-backup-vault`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/delete-backup-vault.html) can be used to delete a vault.

```json

aws backup delete-backup-vault
--region us-east-1
--backup-vault-name testvaultname
```

## Additional programmatic options for logically air-gapped vaults

The CLI command [`list-backup-vaults`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupVaults.html) can be modified to list all the vaults owned by and
present in the account:

```json

aws backup list-backup-vaults
--region us-east-1
```

To list just the logically air-gapped vaults, add the parameter

```java

--by-vault-type LOGICALLY_AIR_GAPPED_BACKUP_VAULT
```

Include the parameter `by-shared` to
filter the returned list of vaults to show only shared logically air-gapped vaults.
The response will include encryption key type information for each shared vault.

```json

aws backup list-backup-vaults
--region us-east-1
--by-shared
```

Example response showing encryption key type information:

```json

{
    "BackupVaultList": [
        {
            "BackupVaultName": "shared-logically air-gapped-vault",
            "BackupVaultArn": "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:shared-logically air-gapped-vault",
            "VaultType": "LOGICALLY_AIR_GAPPED_BACKUP_VAULT",
            "EncryptionKeyType": "AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY",
            "CreationDate": "2024-07-25T16:05:23.554000-07:00",
            "Locked": true,
            "MinRetentionDays": 7,
            "MaxRetentionDays": 30
        }
    ]
}
```

###### Note

The `VaultType` field is not included in the API response in regions where logically air-gapped vaults are not available.

## Understanding encryption key types for logically air-gapped vaults

Logically air-gapped vaults support different encryption key types, and this information
is visible through AWS Backup APIs and console. When vaults are shared through AWS RAM or MPA,
the encryption key type information is preserved and made visible to accounts with which
the vault is shared. This transparency helps you understand the encryption configuration
of vaults and make informed decisions about backup and restore operations.

### Encryption key type values

The `EncryptionKeyType` field can have the following values:

- `AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY` \- The vault is encrypted with an AWS-owned key.
This is the default encryption method for logically air-gapped vaults when no customer-managed key is specified.

- `CUSTOMER_MANAGED_KMS_KEY` \- The vault is encrypted with a
customer-managed KMS key that you control. This option provides additional control over encryption keys and access policies.

###### Note

- AWS Backup recommends using AWS owned keys with logically air-gapped vaults.

- If your organization policy requires using a customer managed key, AWS does not recommend using keys from the same account, except for testing.
For production workloads, use a customer managed key from another account in a secondary organization dedicated to recovery as a best practice. You can reference the blog
[Encrypt AWS Backup logically air-gapped vaults with customer-managed keys](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/encrypt-aws-backup-logically-air-gapped-vaults-with-customer-managed-keys) to gather more insights into setting up CMK based logically air-gapped vaults.

- You can only select an AWS KMS encryption key during vault creation.
Once created, all backups contained in the vault will be encrypted with that key. You cannot change or migrate your vaults to use a different encryption key.

### Key policy for CMK encrypted logically air-gapped vault creation

When creating a logically air-gapped vault with a customer managed key, you must apply the AWS-managed policy
`AWSBackupFullAccess` to your account role. This policy includes
`Allow` actions that enable AWS Backup to interact with AWS KMS for grant creation
on KMS keys during backup, copy, and storage operations. Additionally, you must ensure
your customer managed key (if used) policy includes specific required permissions.

- The CMK must be shared with the account where the logically air-gapped vault
resides

```json

{
    "Sid": "Allow use of the key to create a logically air-gapped vault",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::[account-id]:role/TheRoleToAccessAccount"
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:CreateGrant",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
   "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
            "kms:ViaService": "backup.*.amazonaws.com"
        }
   }
}
```

**Key policy for copy/restore**

To prevent job failures, review your AWS KMS key policy to ensure it
includes all required permissions and doesn't contain any deny statements that could block
operations. The following conditions apply:

- For all copy scenarios, the CMKs must be shared with the source copy role

```json

{
    "Sid": "Allow use of the key for copy",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::[source-account-id]:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole"      //[Source copy role]
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
   "Condition": {
         "StringLike": {
            "kms:ViaService": "backup.*.amazonaws.com"
         }
   }
},
{
    "Sid": "Allow AWS Backup to create grant on the key for copy",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::[source-account-id]:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole" //[Source copy role]
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:CreateGrant"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
            "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
        },
        "StringLike": {
            "kms:ViaService": "backup.*.amazonaws.com"
        }
    }
}
```

- When copying from a CMK encrypted logically air-gapped vault to a backup vault, the CMK must
also be shared with the destination account SLR

```json

{
    "Sid": "Allow use of the key for copy from a CMK encrypted logically air-gapped vault to normal backup vault",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::[source-account-id]:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole",      //[Source copy role]
                "arn:aws:iam::[destination-account-id]:role/aws-service-role/backup.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForBackup"], //[Destination SLR]
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
},
{
    "Sid": "Allow AWS Backup to create grant on the key for copy",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
          "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::[source-account-id]:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole",      //[Source copy role]
                  "arn:aws:iam::[destination-account-id]:role/aws-service-role/backup.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForBackup"], //[Destination SLR]
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:CreateGrant"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
            "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
        }
    }
}
```

- When copying or restoring from a recovery account using RAM/MPA shared logically air-gapped vault

```json

{
    "Sid": "Allow use of the key for copy/restore from a recovery account",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::[recovery-account-id]:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole", //[Recovery account copy/restore role]
                "arn:aws:iam::[destination-account-id]:role/aws-service-role/backup.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForBackup"] //[Destination SLR]
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
},
{
    "Sid": "Allow AWS Backup to create grant on the key for copy",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::[recovery-account-id]:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole" //[Recovery account copy/restore role]
                "arn:aws:iam::[destination-account-id]:role/aws-service-role/backup.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForBackup"], //[Destination SLR]

    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:CreateGrant"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
            "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
        }
    }
}
```

**IAM Role**

When performing logically air-gapped vault copy operations, customers can utilize the
`AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole` which includes the AWS-managed policy
`AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForBackup`. However, if customers prefer to
implement a least-privilege policy approach, their IAM policy must include a specific
requirement:

- The source account's copy role must have access permissions to both the source and
destination CMKs.

```json

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
         {
            "Sid": "KMSPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kms:DescribeKey",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kms:*:[source-account-id]:key/*",  - Source logically air-gapped vault CMK -
                "arn:aws:kms:*:[destination-account-id]:key/*".  - Destination logically air-gapped vault CMK -
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "KMSCreateGrantPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kms:CreateGrant",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kms:*:[source-account-id]:key/*",  - Source logically air-gapped vault CMK -
                "arn:aws:kms:*:[destination-account-id]:key/*".  - Destination logically air-gapped vault CMK -
            ]
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
                }
            }
        },
    ]
}
```

Consequently, one of the most common customer errors occurs during copy when customers
fail to provide sufficient permissions on their CMKs and copy roles.

### Viewing encryption key types

You can view encryption key type information through both the AWS Backup console
and programmatically using the AWS CLI or SDKs.

**Console:** When viewing logically air-gapped vaults in the AWS Backup console,
the encryption key type is displayed in the vault details page under the security
information section.

**AWS CLI/API:** The encryption key type is returned in the response
of the following operations when querying logically air-gapped vaults:

- `list-backup-vaults` (including `--by-shared` for shared vaults)

- `describe-backup-vault`

- `describe-recovery-point`

- `list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault`

- `list-recovery-points-by-resource`

### Considerations for vault encryption

When working with logically air-gapped vaults and encryption key types, consider the following:

- **Key selection during creation:** You can optionally specify a customer-managed KMS key when creating a logically air-gapped vault. If not specified, an AWS-owned key will be used.

- **Shared vault visibility:** Accounts with which a vault is shared can view
the encryption key type but cannot modify the encryption configuration.

- **Recovery point information:** The encryption key type is also available when viewing recovery points within logically air-gapped vaults.

- **Restore operations:** Understanding the encryption key type
helps you plan restore operations and understand any potential access requirements.

- **Compliance:** The encryption key type information supports
compliance reporting and audit requirements by providing transparency into the
encryption methods used for backup data.

## Usage of service-owned key

AWS Backup creates and manages encryption keys that are used to encrypt all the backup data
stored in logically air-gapped vaults, to protect and prevent loss of access of the
encryption key during a data loss event.

- These keys are free of charge and do not count against the AWS KMS quotas for your
account.

- A single key is only used for a specific vault and is not shared with any other
account or other purpose.

- These keys are deleted once the assigned (empty) vault is also deleted.

- These keys are created using the [SYMMETRIC\_DEFAULT\
key spec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-choose-key-spec.html#symmetric-cmks).

- The default rotation policy is 90 days. You can request rotation (once every 6
months) of service-owned encryption keys for your logically air-gapped vaults through a
support ticket.

Visit the [AWS KMS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html) to learn
more.

## Considerations for security auto-remediation

When AWS Backup copies an EC2 (AMI) backup to a logically air-gapped vault, it temporarily
grants `launchPermission` (on the AMI) and `createVolumePermission`
(on associated EBS snapshots) to a service-owned account. These permissions are
automatically revoked after the copy completes.

These operations generate `ModifyImageAttribute` and
`ModifySnapshotAttribute` events in your AWS CloudTrail logs, with
`userIdentity.invokedBy` set to `backup.amazonaws.com`.

If you have security auto-remediation logic (e.g., Amazon EventBridge rules with
AWS Lambda) that monitors these events and revokes cross-account sharing, you must exclude
events where `userIdentity.invokedBy` is `backup.amazonaws.com`.
Otherwise, copy jobs to logically air-gapped vaults will fail with: "You do not have
permission to access the storage of this ami."

This exclusion is safe because the copy is authorized by your vault access policies
( `backup:CopyFromBackupVault` on the source vault and
`backup:CopyIntoBackupVault` on the destination vault), which are evaluated
before any EC2 attribute modifications occur. The temporary permissions are granted only
to a fixed AWS service-owned account and are automatically revoked after the copy
completes.

Example EventBridge rule event pattern that excludes AWS Backup operations:

```json

{
  "source": ["aws.ec2"],
  "detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"],
  "detail": {
    "eventSource": ["ec2.amazonaws.com"],
    "eventName": ["ModifySnapshotAttribute", "ModifyImageAttribute"],
    "userIdentity": {
      "invokedBy": [{"anything-but": "backup.amazonaws.com"}]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshoot a logically air-gapped vault issue

If you encounter errors during your workflow, consult the following example errors and
suggested resolutions:

### `EC2 AMI copy job to logically air-gapped vault fails with permission error`

**Error:** `Copy job fails with "You do not have permission to access
          the storage of this ami."`

**Possible cause:** During an EC2 AMI copy job to a logically
air-gapped vault, AWS Backup temporarily grants launch permission (AMI) and create volume
permission (EBS snapshot) to a service-owned account, generating
`ModifyImageAttribute` and `ModifySnapshotAttribute` events in
your AWS CloudTrail logs. If you have security auto-remediation logic (such as EventBridge
rules with Lambda) that monitors these events and automatically revokes cross-account
sharing permissions, it can remove the temporary access before the copy completes.

###### Note

This can similarly happen for copy jobs for other resources like Amazon FSx.

**Resolution:** Update your EventBridge rule event pattern to exclude
operations performed by AWS Backup. Specifically, exclude events where
`userIdentity.invokedBy` is `backup.amazonaws.com` to ensure your
auto-remediation logic does not revoke the temporary cross-account permissions that AWS Backup
grants during the copy process.

### `AccessDeniedException`

**Error:** `An error occured (AccessDeniedException) when calling
      the [command] operation: Insufficient privileges to perform this action."`

**Possible cause:** The parameter `--backup-vault-account-id`
was not included when one of the following requests was run on a vault shared by RAM:

- `describe-backup-vault`

- `describe-recovery-point`

- `get-recovery-point-restore-metadata`

- `list-protected-resources-by-backup-vault`

- `list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault`

**Resolution:** Retry the command that returned the error, but include
the parameter `--backup-vault-account-id` that specifies the account that owns
the vault.

### `OperationNotPermittedException`

**Error:** `OperationNotPermittedException` is returned
after a `CreateResourceShare` call.

**Possible cause:** If you attempted to share a resource,
such as a logically air-gapped vault, with another organization, you may get
this exception. A vault can be shared with an account in another organization,
but it cannot be shared with the other organization itself.

**Resolution:** Retry the operation, but specify an
account as the value for `principals` instead of an organization
or OU.

### Encryption key type not displayed

**Issue:** The encryption key type is not visible when viewing
a logically air-gapped vault or its recovery points.

**Possible causes:**

- You are viewing an older vault that was created before encryption
key type support was added

- You are using an older version of the AWS CLI or SDK

- The API response does not include the encryption key type field

**Resolution:**

- Update your AWS CLI to the latest version

- For older vaults, the encryption key type will be populated automatically
and should appear in subsequent API calls

- Verify you are using the correct API operations that return encryption key type information

- For shared vaults, verify that the vault is properly shared through AWS Resource Access Manager

### "FAILED" VaultState with AccessDeniedException in CloudTrail logs

**Error in CloudTrail:** `"User: <assumed role> is not authorized to perform: kms:CreateGrant on this resource because the resource does not exist in this Region, no resource-based policies allow access, or a resource-based policy explicitly denies access"`

**Possible causes:**

- The vault was created using a customer managed key, but the assumed role does not have CreateGrant permission on the key policy required to use the key for vault creation

**Resolution:**

- Grant the permissions specified in the [Key policy for CMK encrypted logically air-gapped vault creation](#key-policy-lag-vault-creation) section, then retry the vault creation workflow.
