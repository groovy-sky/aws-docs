## CloudWatch Dashboard

###### Note

The console dashboard depends on which Region is accessing the console. See [Feature availability by AWS Region](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-region) to see which Regions
have access to the Jobs dashboard. Regions not listed will be able to access the CloudWatch
dashboard.

Your AWS Backup console includes a dashboard to see metrics on completed or failed backup,
copy, and restore jobs. Within this dashboard, you can view job status by time period,
customized to the time frame you desire.

**TO ACCESS THE DASHBOARD**

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

2. Select **Dashboard** in the left-hand navigation pane.

**VIEW AND UNDERSTAND THE DASHBOARD**

The CloudWatch dashboard displays several widgets. Each widget shows job metrics by count.
Each widget shows several line graphs. Each line corresponds to a protected resource (if you
do not see an expected resource displayed, ensure the resource is turned on in
**Settings**). The displays do not show in-progress jobs.

The y-axis (vertical values) shows the count. The x-axis (horizontal values) shows
points in time. If there are no data points to visualize in the selected job status, the
value will be set to 0 with a horizontal line on the x-axis. The legend showing the
resources will still be visible.

The metrics display account-specific and Region-specific information related to the
current login. To see other accounts or Regions, you must login under the chosen
account.

**CUSTOMIZE THE DASHBOARD**

By default, the displayed time frame is one week. Along the top menu, there are options
for redefining the displayed time frame. You can choose from among 1 hour, 3 hours, 12
hours, 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week. Additionally, you can select **Custom**
to specify a different value. Customization will temporarily change the current view to your
specifications.

You can hover over a widget, which will display a **Enlarge** button in
the top right of the widget. Click on **Enlarge** to open the widget in
full-screen view. In full screen, there are more options for customizing the graph display,
such as changing the period (the time between every data point). Any changes will not be
retained once the full-screen view is closed.

To view only one resource type at a time, click on the label text of the resource type
you wish to view in the graph legend. This will deselect other all resource types. To
reverse this, click on a resource type color box in the legend. To go back to default view
of all resource types with all the labels selected, click again on the label text of any
resource type selected.

Clicking the three vertical dots in the top right corner of a widgets opens up a drop
down menu with options to refresh, enlarge, view in metrics and view in logs. “View in
metrics” opens up the metric used in the widget in CloudWatch console. You can make any changes to
the widget there and add the widget to a custom dashboard in CloudWatch dashboard. Any changes you
make in the CloudWatch dashboard will not be reflected on the dashboard in AWS Backup Console. “View as
logs” opens up the logs view page in CloudWatch console.

To add widgets displayed to your own custom CloudWatch dashboard, click on the **Add**
**to dashboard** button located on the top right of the dashboard. This will open
up the CloudWatch console where you can select in which custom dashboard to add all the six
widgets.

## Metrics with CloudWatch

You can use CloudWatch to monitor AWS Backup metrics. The `AWS/Backup` namespace allows
you to track the following metrics. AWS Backup emits updated metrics to CloudWatch every 5
minutes.

The purpose of this documentation page is to provide you with the reference materials to
use CloudWatch to monitor AWS Backup. To learn how to monitor a metric using CloudWatch, see the blog [Amazon CloudWatch Events and Metrics for AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/amazon-cloudwatch-events-and-metrics-for-aws-backup) or [Focus on Metrics and Alarms in a Single AWS Service](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-automatic-dashboards-focus-service.md) in the _CloudWatch User_
_Guide_. To set alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch\
Alarms](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/alarmthatsendsemail.md) in the _CloudWatch User Guide_.

CategoryMetricsExample dimensionsExample use caseJobs

Number of backup, restore, and copy jobs across each state, including
`CREATED`, `PENDING`, `RUNNING`,
`ABORTED`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, and
`EXPIRED`.

Different job types have different available states.

Resource type, vault name.

The vault name of copy jobs is
that of their destination vault.

Monitor the number of failed backup jobs within one or more specific
backup vaults. When there are more than five failed jobs within 1 hour, send an
email or SMS using Amazon SNS or open a ticket to the engineering team to
investigate.

**Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero
value

Recovery pointsNumber of warm and cold recovery points across each state:
`MODIFIED`, `COMPLETED`, `PARTIAL`,
`EXPIRED`, `DELETED`.Resource type, vault name.

Track the number of deleted recovery points for your Amazon EBS volumes, and
separately track the number of warm and cold recovery points in each backup
vault.

**Reporting criteria**: There is a nonzero
value

###### Note

The job status of `Completed with issues` is specific to only the AWS Backup
console; it cannot be tracked via CloudWatch.

The following table lists all the metrics available to you.

MetricDescription`NumberOfBackupJobsCreated`The number of backup jobs that AWS Backup created.`NumberOfBackupJobsPending`The number of backup jobs about to run in AWS Backup.`NumberOfBackupJobsRunning`The number of backup jobs currently running in AWS Backup.`NumberOfBackupJobsAborted`The number of user cancelled backup jobs.`NumberOfBackupJobsCompleted`The number of backup jobs that AWS Backup finished.`NumberOfBackupJobsFailed`The number of backup jobs with status of `Failed`. Often caused by
scheduling a backup job during or 1 hour before a database resource or 4 hours
before or during a Amazon FSx maintenance window or automated backup window and not using
AWS Backup to perform continuous backup for point-in-time restores. See [Point-in-Time Recovery](point-in-time-recovery.md) for a list of supported services and instructions
on how to use AWS Backup to take continuous backups, or reschedule your backup jobs.
`NumberOfBackupJobsExpired`

The number of backup jobs that have a status of `EXPIRED`.

A backup job changes from status `CREATED` to `EXPIRED`
if a backup cannot begin within the start window time.

`NumberOfCopyJobsCreated`The number of cross-account and cross-Region copy jobs that AWS Backup
created.`NumberOfCopyJobsRunning`The number of cross-account and cross-Region copy jobs currently running in
AWS Backup.`NumberOfCopyJobsCompleted`The number of cross-account and cross-Region copy jobs that AWS Backup
finished.`NumberOfCopyJobsFailed`The number of cross-account and cross-Region copy jobs that AWS Backup attempted but
could not complete.`NumberOfRestoreJobsPending`The number of restore jobs about to run in AWS Backup.`NumberOfRestoreJobsRunning`The number of restore jobs currently running in AWS Backup.`NumberOfRestoreJobsCompleted`The number of restore jobs that AWS Backup finished.`NumberOfRestoreJobsFailed`The number of restore jobs that AWS Backup attempted but could not complete.`NumberOfRecoveryPointsCompleted`The number of recovery points that AWS Backup created.`NumberOfRecoveryPointsPartial`The number of recovery points that AWS Backup started to create but could not
finish. AWS retries the process later, but because the retry occurs at the later
time, it retains the partial recovery point.`NumberOfRecoveryPointsExpired`The number of recovery points that AWS Backup attempted to delete based on your
backup retention lifecycle, but could not delete. You are billed for the storage
that expired backups consume and should delete them manually.`NumberOfRecoveryPointsDeleting`The number of recovery points that AWS Backup is deleting.`NumberOfRecoveryPointsCold`The number of recovery points that AWS Backup tiered to cold storage.

More dimensions are available beyond those listed in the table. To view all the
dimensions of a metric, type the name of that metric into the `AWS/Backup`
namespace of the **Metrics** section of the CloudWatch console.
