# Advanced DynamoDB backup

AWS Backup supports additional, advanced features for your Amazon DynamoDB data protection needs.

Customers who started using AWS Backup after November 2021 have advanced DynamoDB backup
features enabled by default. Specifically, advanced DynamoDB backup features are enabled by
default to customers who have not created a backup vault prior to November 21, 2021.

It's best practice for existing AWS Backup customers to enable advanced features for DynamoDB. There is
no difference in warm backup storage pricing after you enable advanced features. You can
potentially save money by moving backups to cold storage and optimize your costs by using cost
allocation tags. You can also start taking advantage of AWS Backup's cross-Region and cross-account copy and
security features.

## Benefits of advanced DDB backup

After you enable AWS Backup's advanced features in your AWS Region, you unlock the following
features for all new for DynamoDB table backups you create:

- Cost savings and optimization:

- [Tiering backups to cold storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_Lifecycle.html) to reduce storage costs

- [Cost allocation tagging for use with Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/metering-and-billing.html#cost-allocation-tags)

- Additional copy options:

- [Cross-Region\
copy](cross-region-backup.md)

- [Cross-account\
copy](create-cross-account-backup.md#prereq-cab)

- Security:

- Backups inherit tags from their source DynamoDB tables, allowing you to use those
tags to set permissions and [service\
control policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html).

## Considerations for Advanced DynamoDB backup

**Opting in**

Backups, including those of Advanced DDB resources, can be created by a backup plan,
an on-demand backup, or through a backup policy. Backups created by a plan or on-demand
will automatically opt-in your account to allow backups of Advanced DDB resources.

If your backup job is created by a backup policy, you need to manually opt-in to
Advanced DynamoDB backups, either through the [Backup console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/assigning-resources-console.html) or through [CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/assigning-resources-json.html).

**Custom policies and roles**

If you use a custom role or policy instead of AWS Backup's default service role, you must
add or use the following permissions policies (or add their equivalent permissions) to
your custom role:

- `AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForBackup` to perform advanced DynamoDB
backup.

- `AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForRestores` to restore advanced DynamoDB
backups.

To learn more about AWS-managed policies and view examples of customer-managed
policies, see [Managed policies for AWS Backup](security-iam-awsmanpol.md).

## Enabling advanced DynamoDB backup using the console

You can enable AWS Backup advanced features for DynamoDB backups using either the AWS Backup or
DynamoDB console.

###### To enable advanced DynamoDB backup features from the AWS Backup console:

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

2. In the left navigation menu, choose **Settings**.

3. Under the **Supported services** section, verify that
    **DynamoDB** is **Enabled**.

If it is not, choose **Opt-in** and enable DynamoDB as an AWS Backup
    supported service.

4. Under the **Advanced features for DynamoDB backups** section, choose
    **Enable**.

5. Choose **Enable features**.

For how to enable AWS Backup advanced features using the DynamoDB console, see [Enabling AWS Backup features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/CreateBackupAWS.html#CreateBackupAWS_enabling) in the _Amazon DynamoDB User_
_Guide_.

## Enabling advanced DynamoDB backup programmatically

You can also enable AWS Backup advanced features for DynamoDB backups using the AWS Command Line Interface
(CLI). You enable advanced DynamoDB backups when you set both of the following values to
`true`:

###### To programmatically enable AWS Backup advanced features for DynamoDB backups:

1. Check if you already enabled AWS Backup advanced features for DynamoDB using the following
    command:

```sh

$ aws backup describe-region-settings
```

If `"DynamoDB":true` under both
    `"ResourceTypeManagementPreference"` and
    `"ResourceTypeOptInPreference"`, you have already enabled advanced
    DynamoDB backup.

If, like the following output, you have at least one instance of
    `"DynamoDB":false`, you have not yet enabled advanced DynamoDB backup,
    proceed to the next step.

```JSON

{
     "ResourceTypeManagementPreference":{
       "DynamoDB":false,
       "EFS":true
     }
     "ResourceTypeOptInPreference":{
       "Aurora":true,
       "DocumentDB":false,
       "DynamoDB":false,
       "EBS":true,
       "EC2":true,
       "EFS":true,
       "FSx":true,
       "Neptune":false,
       "RDS":true,
       "Storage Gateway":true
     }
}
```

2. Use the following [`UpdateRegionSettings`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_UpdateRegionSettings.html) operation to set both
    `"ResourceTypeManagementPreference"` and
    `"ResourceTypeOptInPreference"` to `"DynamoDB":true`:

```sh

aws backup update-region-settings \
                 --resource-type-opt-in-preference DynamoDB=true \
                 --resource-type-management-preference DynamoDB=true
```

## Editing an advanced DynamoDB backup

When you create a DynamoDB backup after you enable AWS Backup advanced features, you can use
AWS Backup to:

- Copy a backup across Regions

- Copy a backup across accounts

- Change when AWS Backup tiers a backup to cold storage

- Tag the backup

To use those advanced features on an existing backup, see [Editing a backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/editing-a-backup.html).

If you later disable AWS Backup advanced features for DynamoDB, you can continue to perform
those operations to DynamoDB backups that you created during the period of time when you
enabled advanced features.

## Restoring an advanced DynamoDB backup

You can restore DynamoDB backups taken with AWS Backup advanced features enabled in the same
way you restore DynamoDB backups taken prior to enabling AWS Backup advanced features. You can
perform a restore using either AWS Backup or DynamoDB.

You can specify how to encrypt your newly-restored table with the following
options:

- When you restore in the same Region as your original table, you can optionally
specify an encryption key for your restored table. If you do not specify an encryption
key, AWS Backup will automatically encrypt your restored table using the same key that
encrypted your original table.

- When you restore in a different Region than your original table, you must specify
an encryption key.

To restore using AWS Backup, see [Restore a Amazon DynamoDB table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restoring-dynamodb.html).

To restore using DynamoDB, see [Restoring a DynamoDB table\
from a backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Restore.Tutorial.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB User Guide_.

## Deleting an advanced DynamoDB backup

You cannot delete backups created using these advanced features in DynamoDB. You must use
AWS Backup to delete backups to maintain global consistency throughout your AWS
environment.

To delete a DynamoDB backup, see [Backup deletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/deleting-backups.html).

## Other benefits of full AWS Backup management when you enable advanced DynamoDB backup

When you enable AWS Backup advanced features for DynamoDB, you give full management of your
DynamoDB backups to AWS Backup. Doing so gives you the following, additional benefits:

**Encryption**

AWS Backup automatically encrypts the backups with the KMS key of your destination AWS Backup
vault. Previously, they were encrypted using the same encryption method of your source
DynamoDB table. This increases the number of defenses you can use to safeguard your data. See
[Encryption for backups in AWS Backup](encryption.md) for more information.

**Amazon Resource Name (ARN)**

Each backup ARN’s service namespace is `awsbackup`. Previously, the service
namespace was `dynamodb`. Put another way, the beginning of each ARN will
change from `arn:aws:dynamodb` to `arn:aws:backup`. See [ARNs for AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsbackup.html#awsbackup-resources-for-iam-policies) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.

With this change, you or your backup administrator can create access policies for
backups using the `awsbackup` service namespace that now apply to DynamoDB backups
created after you enable advanced features. By using the `awsbackup` service
namespace, you can also apply policies to other backups taken by AWS Backup. See [Access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/access-control.html) for more information.

**Location of charges on billing statement**

Charges for backups (including storage, data transfers, restores, and early deletion)
appear under “Backup” in your AWS bill. Previously, charges appeared under “DynamoDB” in
your bill.

This change ensures that you can use AWS Backup billing to centrally monitor your backup
costs. See [Metering, costs, and billing for AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/metering-and-billing.html) for
more information.
