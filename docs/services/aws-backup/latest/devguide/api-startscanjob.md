## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[BackupVaultName](#API_StartScanJob_RequestSyntax)**

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[IdempotencyToken](#API_StartScanJob_RequestSyntax)**

Type: String

Valid Values: `GUARDDUTY`

Required: Yes

**[RecoveryPointArn](#API_StartScanJob_RequestSyntax)**

If you are running an incremental scan, this will be your a recovery point which has been created after your base recovery point selection.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[ScanBaseRecoveryPointArn](#API_StartScanJob_RequestSyntax)**

An ARN that uniquely identifies the base recovery point to be used for incremental scanning.

Type: String

Required: No

**[ScanMode](#API_StartScanJob_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the scan type use for the scan job.

Includes:

- `FULL_SCAN` will scan the entire data lineage within the backup.

- `INCREMENTAL_SCAN` will scan the data difference between the target recovery point and base recovery point ARN.

Type: String

Valid Values: `FULL_SCAN | INCREMENTAL_SCAN`

Required: Yes

**[ScannerRoleArn](#API_StartScanJob_RequestSyntax)**

Specified the IAM scanner role ARN.

Type: String

Required: Yes
