# Restore a Amazon DynamoDB table
<a name="restoring-dynamodb"></a>

## Use the AWS Backup console to restore DynamoDB recovery points
<a name="ddb-restore-console"></a>

**To restore a DynamoDB table**

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Protected resources** and the DynamoDB resource ID you want to restore.

1. On the **Resource details** page, a list of recovery points for the selected resource ID is shown. To restore a resource, in the **Backups** pane, choose the radio button next to the recovery point ID of the resource. In the upper-right corner of the pane, choose **Restore**.

1. For **Settings**, **New table name** text field, enter a new table name.

1. For **Restore role**, choose the IAM role that AWS Backup will assume for this restore.
**Note**
If role manager is enabled in your account, AWS Backup selects the default service role for you, and a **Customize** option is available. For more information, see [IAM role creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

1. For **Encryption settings**:

   1. If your backup is managed by DynamoDB (its ARN begins with `arn:aws:dynamodb`), AWS Backup encrypts your restored table using an AWS-owned key.

      To choose a different key to encrypt your restored table, you can either use the AWS Backup [StartRestoreJob operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_StartRestoreJob.html) or perform the restore from the [DynamoDB console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Restore.Tutorial.html#restoretable_console).

   1. If your backup supports full AWS Backup management (its ARN begins with `arn:aws:backup`), you can choose any of the following encryption options to protect your restored table:
      + (Default) DynamoDB-owned KMS key (no additional charge for encryption)
      + DynamoDB-managed KMS key (KMS charges apply)
      + Customer-managed KMS key (KMS charges apply)

      "DynamoDB-owned" and "DynamoDB-managed" keys are the same as "AWS-owned" and "AWS-managed" keys, respectively. For clarification, see [ Encryption at Rest: How It Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/encryption.howitworks.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

      For more information about full AWS Backup management, see [Advanced DynamoDB backup](advanced-ddb-backup.md).
**Note**
The following guidance applies only if you restore a copied backup AND want to encrypt the restored table with the same key you used to encrypt your original table.
When restoring a cross-Region backup, to encrypt your restored table using the same key you used to encrypt your original table, your key must be a multi-Region key. AWS-owned and AWS-managed keys are not multi-Region keys. To learn more, see [Multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.
When restoring a cross-account backup, to encrypt your restored table using the same key you used to encrypt your original table, you must share the key in your source account with your destination account. AWS-owned and AWS-managed keys cannot be shared between accounts. To learn more, see [Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

1. Choose **Restore backup**.

   The **Restore jobs** pane appears. A message at the top of the page provides information about the restore job.

## Use the AWS Backup API, CLI, or SDK to restore DynamoDB recovery points
<a name="ddb-restore-cli"></a>

Use `[StartRestoreJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_StartRestoreJob.html)`. You can specify the following metadata during any DynamoDB restore. The metadata is not case-sensitive.

```
targetTableName
encryptionType
kmsMasterKeyArn
aws:backup:request-id
```

The following is an example of the `restoreMetadata` argument for a `StartRestoreJob` operation in the CLI:

```
aws backup start-restore-job \
--recovery-point-arn "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:abcdef12-g3hi-4567-8cjk-012345678901" \
--iam-role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/YourIamRole" \
--metadata 'TargetTableName=TestRestoreTestTable,EncryptionType=KMS,kmsMasterKeyArn=arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcdefg' \
--region us-east-1 \
--endpoint-url https://endpointurl.com
```

The preceding example encrypts the restored table using a customer-managed key.

To encrypt your restored table using an AWS-owned key, specify the following restore metadata: `"encryptionType\":\"Default\"`.

To encrypt your restored table using an AWS-managed key, omit the `kmsMasterKeyArn` parameter and specify: `"encryptionType\":\"KMS\"`.

To encrypt your restored table using a customer-managed key, specify the following restore metadata: `"encryptionType\":\"KMS\",\"kmsMasterKeyArn\":\"{{arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab}}\"`.
