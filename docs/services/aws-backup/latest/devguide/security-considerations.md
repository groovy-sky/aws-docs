# Security in AWS Backup
<a name="security-considerations"></a>

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security *of* the cloud and security *in* the cloud:
+ **Security of the cloud** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS compliance programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/). To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS Backup, see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/).
+ **Security in the cloud** – Your responsibility for AWS Backup includes, but is not limited to, the following. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your organization's requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.
  + Responding to communications you receive from AWS.
  + Managing the credentials you and your team use. For more information, see [Identity and access management in AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-iam.html).
  + Configuring your backup plans and resource assignments to reflect your organization’s data protection policies. For more information, see [Managing backup plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/getting-started.html).
  + Regularly testing your ability to find certain recovery points and restore them. For more information, see [Working with backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/recovery-points.html).
  + Incorporating AWS Backup procedures in your organization’s disaster recovery and business continuity written procedures. For a start point, see [Getting started with AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/getting-started.html).
  + Ensuring that your employees are familiar with and have practiced using AWS Backup along with your organizational procedures in the event of an emergency. For more information, see the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html).
