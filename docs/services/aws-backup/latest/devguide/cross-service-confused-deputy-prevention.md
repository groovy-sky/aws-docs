# Cross-service confused deputy prevention

The confused deputy problem is a security issue where an entity that doesn't have permission
to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform the action. In AWS,
cross-service impersonation can result in the confused deputy problem. Cross-service
impersonation can occur when one service (the _calling service_) calls
another service (the _called service_). The calling service can be
manipulated to use its permissions to act on another customer's resources in a way it should not
otherwise have permission to access. To prevent this, AWS provides tools that help you protect
your data for all services with service principals that have been given access to resources in
your account.

We recommend using the [`aws:SourceArn`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourcearn) and [`aws:SourceAccount`](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-sourceaccount) global condition context keys in resource policies
to limit the permissions that AWS Backup gives another service to the resource. If you
use both global condition context keys, the `aws:SourceAccount` value and the account
in the `aws:SourceArn` value must use the same account ID when used in the same
policy statement.

The value of `aws:SourceArn` must be a AWS Backup vault when using AWS Backup to publish Amazon SNS topics on your behalf.

The most effective way to protect against the confused deputy problem is to use the
`aws:SourceArn` global condition context key with the full ARN of the resource. If
you don't know the full ARN of the resource or if you are specifying multiple resources, use the
`aws:SourceArn` global context condition key with wildcards ( `*`) for
the unknown portions of the ARN. For example,
`arn:aws::servicename::123456789012:*`.

The following example policy shows how you can use the `aws:SourceArn` and
`aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in AWS Backup to prevent the
confused deputy problem. This policy grants the service principal backup-storage.amazonaws.com
ability to perform KMS actions only when the service principal is acting on behalf of AWS account
123456789012 on the backup vaults:
