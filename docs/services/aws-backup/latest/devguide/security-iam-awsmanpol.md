# Managed policies for AWS Backup

Managed policies are standalone identity-based policies that you can attach to
multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. When you attach a policy to a
principal entity, you give the entity the permissions that are defined in the policy.

_AWS managed policies_ are created and administered by AWS.
You can't change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the
permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities
(users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to.

_Customer managed policies_ give you fine-grained controls to set
access to backups in AWS Backup. For example, you can use them to give your database backup
administrator access to Amazon RDS backups but not Amazon EFS ones.

For more information, see [Managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

## AWS managed policies

AWS Backup provides the following AWS managed policies for common use cases. These policies
make it easier to define the right permissions and control access to your backups. There
are two types of managed policies. One type is designed to be assigned to users to control
their access to AWS Backup. The other type of managed policy is designed to be attached to
roles that you pass to AWS Backup. The following table lists all the managed policies that
AWS Backup provides and describes how they are defined. You can find these managed policies in
the **Policies** section of the IAM console.

### AWSBackupAuditAccess

This policy grants permissions for users to create controls and frameworks
that define their expectations for AWS Backup resources and activities, and to audit
AWS Backup resources and activities against their defined controls and frameworks.
This policy grants permissions to AWS Config and similar services to describe user
expectations perform the audits.

This policy also grants permissions to deliver audit reports to Amazon S3 and
similar services, and enables users to find and open their audit
reports.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupAuditAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupAuditAccess.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupDataTransferAccess

This policy provides permissions for the AWS Backup storage plane data transfer APIs,
allowing the AWS Backint agent to complete backup data transfer with the AWS Backup storage plane.
You can attach this policy to roles assumed by Amazon EC2 instances running SAP HANA with the
Backint agent.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupDataTransferAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupDataTransferAccess.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupFullAccess

The backup administrator has full access to AWS Backup operations, including
creating or editing backup plans, assigning AWS resources to backup plans, and
restoring backups. Backup administrators are responsible for determining and
enforcing backup compliance by defining backup plans that meet their
organization's business and regulatory requirements. Backup administrators also
ensure that their organization's AWS resources are assigned to the appropriate
plan.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupFullAccess.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupGatewayServiceRolePolicyForVirtualMachineMetadataSync

This policy provides Backup gateway permission to sync the metadata of Virtual Machines on
your behalf

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupGatewayServiceRolePolicyForVirtualMachineMetadataSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupGatewayServiceRolePolicyForVirtualMachineMetadataSync.html) in the
_AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupGuardDutyRolePolicyForScans

This policy must be added to a new scanning role that grants Amazon GuardDuty permission to read and scan your backups. You'll need to attach this scanning role to your backup plan within the malware protection or scan settings. When AWS Backup initiates a scan, it passes this scanning role to Amazon GuardDuty.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupGuardDutyRolePolicyForScans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupGuardDutyRolePolicyForScans.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupOperatorAccess

Backup operators are users that are responsible for ensuring the resources
that they are responsible for are properly backed up. Backup operators have
permissions to assign AWS resources to the backup plans that the backup
administrator creates. They also have permissions to create on-demand backups of
their AWS resources and to configure the retention period of on-demand backups.
Backup operators do not have permissions to create or edit backup plans or to
delete scheduled backups after they are created. Backup operators can restore
backups. You can limit the resource types that a backup operator can assign to a
backup plan or restore from a backup. You do this by allowing only certain service
roles to be passed to AWS Backup that have permissions for a certain resource
type.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupOperatorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupOperatorAccess.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupOrganizationAdminAccess

The organization administrator has full access to AWS Organizations operations,
including creating, editing, or deleting backup policies, assigning backup
policies to accounts and organizational units, and monitoring backup activities
within the organization. Organization administrators are responsible for
protecting accounts in their organization by defining and assigning backup
policies that meet their organization's business and regulatory
requirements.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupOrganizationAdminAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupOrganizationAdminAccess.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupRestoreAccessForSAPHANA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupRestoreAccessForSAPHANA.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupSearchOperatorAccess

The search operator role has access to create backup indexes and to create
searches of indexed backup metadata.

This policy contains the necessary permissions for those functions.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AWSBackupSearchOperatorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupSearchOperatorAccess.html) in the _AWS Managed Policy Reference_.

### AWSBackupServiceLinkedRolePolicyForBackup

This policy is attached to the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleforBackup
to allow AWS Backup to call AWS services on your behalf to manage your backups. For more information,
see [Using roles to back up and copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/using-service-linked-roles-AWSServiceRoleForBackup.html).

## Customer managed policies

The following sections describe the recommended backup and restore permissions for
the AWS services and third-party application supported by AWS Backup. You can use the
existing AWS managed policies as a model as you create your own policy documents,
and then customize them to further restrict access to your AWS resources.

###### Important

When using custom IAM roles for AWS Backup, you must include resource-specific permissions
in addition to AWS Backup permissions. For example, when calling `backup:ListTags`
on an Amazon RDS resource, your custom IAM role must also include `rds:ListTagsForResource`
permission. While these permissions are included in the default AWS Backup service role, they must
be explicitly added to customer-managed policies. The underlying resource permissions required
depend on the specific AWS service and operation being performed.
