# Using AWS Backup Audit Manager with AWS Audit Manager
<a name="aws-audit-manager-integration"></a>

AWS Backup Audit Manager controls map to prebuilt, standard controls in AWS Audit Manager, allowing you to import your AWS Backup Audit Manager compliance findings to your AWS Audit Manager reports. You might want to do so to help a compliance officer, audit manager, or other colleague who reports on backup activity as part of your organization’s overall compliance posture.

You can import the compliance results of your AWS Backup Audit Manager controls to your AWS Audit Manager frameworks. To enable AWS Audit Manager to automatically collect data from your AWS Backup Audit Manager controls, create a custom control in AWS Audit Manager using the instructions for [Customizing an existing control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/customize-control-from-existing.html) in the *AWS Audit Manager User Guide*. As you follow those instructions, note that the **Data source** for AWS Backup controls is **AWS Config**.

For a list of AWS Backup controls, see [Choosing your controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/choosing-controls.html).
