# Access points
<a name="backup-access-points"></a>

## Overview
<a name="backup-access-points-overview"></a>

AWS Backup now lets you access Amazon S3 backup data directly through S3 access points, without initiating a restore. Using a backup access point, you can read S3 backup data immediately using familiar S3 APIs such as `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, `ListObjectsV2`, and `ListObjectVersions`.

Backup access points provide on-demand, read-only connections to recovery points. You create a backup access point for a specific recovery point, and AWS Backup provisions an S3 access point that routes S3 API calls to your backup data. This enables use cases such as targeted file recovery, data validation, compliance auditing, and forensic investigation without waiting for a full restore to complete.

While a backup access point is active for a recovery point, AWS Backup pauses lifecycle deletion and blocks manual deletion of that recovery point. This protects your data from being removed while applications are actively reading it. Backup tiering to lower-cost warm storage, which is configured separately, is not affected. You must delete all backup access points associated with a recovery point before the recovery point can be deleted or lifecycled.

This page explains how to create, manage, and delete backup access points using the AWS Backup console and AWS CLI.

**Important**
Access points provide read-only access to backup data. Write operations through backup access points are not supported.

## How backup access points work
<a name="how-backup-access-points-work"></a>

When you create a backup access point, AWS Backup performs the following steps:

1. Validates that the recovery point exists and is in a usable state (AVAILABLE, STOPPED, or COMPLETED)

1. Creates a backup access point resource in AWS Backup with status CREATING

1. Provisions an S3 access point on your behalf (asynchronously)

1. Pauses lifecycle deletion and blocks manual deletion of the associated recovery point

1. Updates the backup access point status to AVAILABLE

Once the backup access point is AVAILABLE, you call `DescribeBackupAccessPoint` to retrieve the S3 access point ARN and alias. You then use the S3 access point alias or ARN with standard S3 APIs to read your backup data.

When you are done, call `DeleteBackupAccessPoint`. AWS Backup deletes the S3 access point and this resumes recovery point lifecycle transitions (if no other access points remain).

### Access point statuses
<a name="backup-access-point-statuses"></a>

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CREATING | Access point creation is in progress. S3 access point is being provisioned. |
| AVAILABLE | Access point is ready. Use DescribeBackupAccessPoint to get the S3 ARN and alias. |
| DELETING | Deletion is in progress. |
| FAILED | Creation or deletion failed. Use DescribeBackupAccessPoint to get the error details. |
| EXPIRED | The backup access point is no longer usable. |
| DISASSOCIATING | Access is being revoked. The logically air-gapped vault is being unshared or the restore access backup vault is being deleted |
| DISASSOCIATED | Access has been revoked. The backup access point is no longer usable. |

### Continuous recovery points
<a name="backup-access-point-continuous-recovery-points"></a>

For continuous (PITR) recovery points, you can specify an `AccessPointInTime` timestamp when creating the access point. This determines the point-in-time view of your backup data. The timestamp must be within the continuous backup retention window *at the time of access point creation. As long as the access point exists, the data for that point in time is retained and accessible, even if the timestamp later falls outside the retention window.*

## Prerequisites
<a name="backup-access-point-prerequisites"></a>

Before creating/managing a backup access point, ensure:
+ Your IAM role has the required permissions. You can use the managed policy [AWSBackupAccessPointOperatorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSBackupAccessPointOperatorAccess.html), or ensure the following permissions are applied:
  + `backup:CreateBackupAccessPoint`
  + `backup:DescribeBackupAccessPoint`
  + `backup:DeleteBackupAccessPoint`
  + `backup:ListBackupAccessPoints`
  + `backup:ListBackupAccessPointsByRecoveryPoint`
  + `s3:GetAccessPoint` (required during create, describe, and delete)
  + `s3:CreateAccessPoint` (required during create)
  + `s3:DeleteAccessPoint` (required during delete)
  + `s3:PutAccessPointPolicy` (required only if an access point policy is included in the request)

## Creating a backup access point
<a name="creating-a-backup-access-point"></a>

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Protected resources** or navigate to a recovery point through **Backup vaults**.

1. Select the S3 recovery point you want to access.

1. Choose **Create access point**.

1. For **Access point name**, enter a unique name. This name is shared with the S3 access point namespace, so it must not conflict with existing S3 access points in the same Region and account. *Note: For naming rules, see* [*Naming rules for Amazon S3 access points*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-restrictions-limitations-naming-rules.html#access-points-names)*.*

1. (Optional) For continuous recovery points, specify the **Access point in time** to set the point-in-time view.

1. (Optional) Add access point policy.

1. (Optional) Add tags.

1. Choose **Create access point**.

1. The backup access point status shows CREATING. When status changes to AVAILABLE, choose the backup access point to view the S3 access point ARN and alias.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

```
aws backup create-backup-access-point \
  --recovery-point-arn "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:rp-1234567890abcdef0" \
  --name "my-access-point" \
  --access-point-metadata '{"AccessPointInTime": "2026-07-01T12:00:00Z"}'
```

Response:

```
{
  "AccessPointArn": "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point",
  "Status": "CREATING"
}
```

After creation, describe the access point to get the S3 ARN and alias:

```
aws backup describe-backup-access-point \
  --access-point-arn "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point"
```

Response (when AVAILABLE):

```
{
  "AccessPointArn": "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point",
  "AccessPointMetadata": {
    "S3AccessPointAlias": "my-access-point-abc123-ext-s3alias",
    "S3AccessPointArn": "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point"
  },
  "BackupVaultName": "MyVault",
  "CreationTime": "2026-07-28T12:00:25.938000-07:00",
  "Name": "my-access-point",
  "RecoveryPointArn": "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:rp-1234567890abcdef0",
  "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
  "ResourceType": "S3",
  "Status": "AVAILABLE"
}
```

------

## Accessing backup data through the access point
<a name="accessing-backup-data-through-the-access-point"></a>

Once the access point is in AVAILABLE status, use the S3 access point alias or ARN with S3 APIs to read backup data.

### Using the alias
<a name="accessing-backup-data-using-the-alias"></a>

```
# List objects in the backup
aws s3api list-objects-v2 \
  --bucket "my-access-point-abc123-ext-s3alias"

# Get a specific object
aws s3api get-object \
  --bucket "my-access-point-abc123-ext-s3alias" \
  --key "path/to/my-file.txt" \
  output-file.txt

# Head an object (metadata only)
aws s3api head-object \
  --bucket "my-access-point-abc123-ext-s3alias" \
  --key "path/to/my-file.txt"
```

### Using the S3 access point ARN
<a name="accessing-backup-data-using-the-arn"></a>

```
aws s3api list-objects-v2 \
  --bucket "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point"
```

## Managing access points
<a name="managing-backup-access-points"></a>

### Listing access points
<a name="listing-backup-access-points"></a>

List all backup access points in your account:

```
aws backup list-backup-access-points
```

List backup access points for a specific recovery point:

**Note**
If you are the recovery point owner and have shared the recovery point with other accounts, the response includes access points created by those accounts.

```
aws backup list-backup-access-points-by-recovery-point \
  --recovery-point-arn "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:rp-1234567890abcdef0"
```

List backup access points for a specific resource:

```
aws backup list-backup-access-points-by-resource \
  --resource-arn "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
```

### Deleting an access point
<a name="deleting-a-backup-access-point"></a>

```
aws backup delete-backup-access-point \
  --access-point-arn "arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point"
```

When you delete a backup access point:
+ The S3 access point is deleted
+ Recovery point lifecycle resumes (if no other access points remain for that recovery point)
+ The backup access point resource is removed from AWS Backup

**Important**
Always delete backup access points using the `DeleteBackupAccessPoint` API or the AWS Backup console. Do not delete the underlying S3 access point directly through S3 APIs. Deleting the S3 access point directly leaves the backup access point in EXPIRED status and lifecycle protection remains in place until you delete the orphaned backup access point.

## Access point policies
<a name="access-point-policies"></a>

Each access point can have its own resource-based access point policy. Access point policies control how objects in the backup data source can be accessed through the access point by resource, user, or conditions.

### How access point policies work
<a name="how-access-point-policies-work"></a>

When you create a backup access point, the S3 access point is created without an access point policy by default. Without a policy, access to backup data through the access point is governed by the caller's IAM permissions.

You can optionally specify a policy during creation or add one afterward to:
+ Grant read access to additional IAM principals in your account
+ Restrict access by source IP address or VPC endpoint
+ Add conditions such as requiring MFA or specific tags

Restrictions that you include in an access point policy apply only to requests made through that access point. An access point policy grants permissions only if the underlying data source also allows the same access.

### Editing an access point policy
<a name="editing-an-access-point-policy"></a>

You can edit an access point policy through the AWS Backup console or the S3 `PutAccessPointPolicy` API.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Open the AWS Backup console.

1. Navigate to **Access points** and select your access point.

1. Choose the **Access point policy** tab.

1. Choose **Edit**.

1. Modify the JSON policy.

1. Choose **Save changes**.

When you edit a policy, AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer runs policy checks to validate your policy against IAM policy grammar and best practices. Resolve security warnings, errors, and suggestions before saving.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

```
aws s3control put-access-point-policy \
  --account-id 123456789012 \
  --name "my-access-point" \
  --policy '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DataAnalyst"
        },
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point",
          "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

------

### Block Public Access
<a name="access-point-block-public-access"></a>

Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings apply to backup access points. If Block Public Access is turned on for your account, public access through backup access points is blocked regardless of the access point policy. To check your settings, review your account-level Block Public Access configuration.

## Supported S3 operations
<a name="supported-s3-operations"></a>

The following table shows which S3 API operations are compatible with backup access points. Backup access points are read-only, so all write, delete, and multipart upload operations are not supported.

| S3 operation | Backup access point |
| --- | --- |
| GetObject | Supported |
| HeadObject | Supported |
| GetObjectAttributes | Supported |
| GetObjectTagging | Supported |
| GetBucketLocation | Supported |
| ListObjectsV2 | Supported |
| ListObjects | Supported |
| ListObjectVersions | Supported |
| PutObject | Not supported |
| DeleteObject | Not supported |
| DeleteObjects | Not supported |
| CopyObject | Not supported |
| CreateMultipartUpload | Not supported |
| UploadPart | Not supported |
| CompleteMultipartUpload | Not supported |
| AbortMultipartUpload | Not supported |
| PutObjectTagging | Not supported |
| DeleteObjectTagging | Not supported |
| PutObjectAcl | Not supported |
| GetObjectAcl | Not supported |
| GetObjectLegalHold | Not supported |
| GetObjectRetention | Not supported |

## Recovery point lifecycle protection
<a name="recovery-point-lifecycle-protection"></a>

While one or more active access points exist for a recovery point:
+ **Scheduled lifecycle transitions are paused.** The recovery point will not be automatically deleted by lifecycle rules.
+ **Manual deletion is blocked.** Calls to `DeleteRecoveryPoint` return an error until all access points are deleted.
+ **Tiering is not affected.** Backup tiering to lower-cost warm storage is configured independently and continues to apply normally while access points are active.

You can still update the recovery point lifecycle (for example, changing the delete-after-days value), but the deletion will not be enforced until all backup access points for the recovery point are removed.

Once all access points for a recovery point are deleted, lifecycle processing resumes automatically.

**Note**
Each account can have up to 5 backup access points per recovery point, regardless of their status. To create a new backup access point when the limit is reached, delete an existing one (including any in FAILED or EXPIRED status).

## Access points for recovery points in logically air-gapped vaults
<a name="access-points-lag-vaults"></a>

You can create backup access points for recovery points stored in logically air-gapped vaults. Access points can be created by the vault-owning account directly, or from another account that has been granted access through AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) sharing or a restore access backup vault (via Multi-Party Approval).

**Same-account access**

The account that owns the logically air-gapped vault can create access points for recovery points in that vault, the same way as for standard backup vaults.

**RAM sharing**

When a logically air-gapped vault is shared with an account via RAM, that account can create access points for recovery points in the shared vault. The RAM permission `AWSRAMPermissionBackupVaultReadOnly` includes `backup:CreateBackupAccessPoint`. Vault owners can restrict this by adding a vault access policy that denies `backup:CreateBackupAccessPoint`.

For more information, see [Share a logically air-gapped vault](logicallyairgappedvault.md#lag-share).

**Restore access backup vaults (Multi-Party Approval)**

An account that has a restore access backup vault for a logically air-gapped vault can create backup access points for recovery points accessible through that vault.

For more information, see [Multi-party approval for logically air-gapped vaults](multipartyapproval.md).

**When access is revoked**

If access is removed (logically air-gapped vault unshared via RAM, or restore access backup vault deleted or revoked):
+ All backup access points created by the formerly authorized account transition to DISASSOCIATED status
+ Lifecycle protection for associated recovery points is removed if the recovery point has no more associated access points.
+ S3 API calls through existing S3 access points fail

## Monitoring and notifications
<a name="backup-access-points-monitoring"></a>

AWS Backup emits CloudTrail events, EventBridge events, and Amazon SNS notifications for backup access point status changes (creation, deletion, failure etc.). For details on event formats and how to subscribe, see [Monitoring AWS Backup](monitoring.md).

## Supported features and limitations
<a name="backup-access-points-supported-features-and-limitations"></a>

### Supported features
<a name="backup-access-points-supported-features"></a>
+ **Recovery point types**: Both snapshot and continuous (PITR) recovery points
+ **Vault types**: Standard backup vaults and logically air-gapped vaults
+ **Cross-account**: Access points can be created for recovery points shared through RAM

### Limitations
<a name="backup-access-points-limitations"></a>
+ **Read-only**: Only read operations (GET, HEAD, LIST) are supported. Write operations are not available.
+ **S3 only**: Access points are supported for Amazon S3 recovery points only.
+ **Access point limit**: Up to 5 access points per recovery point in an account.
+ **Name uniqueness**: Access point names share the S3 access point namespace within a Region and account. Names cannot conflict with existing S3 access points.
+ **No scheduled deletion**: Access points do not have a delete-after-days setting. You must delete them manually.
+ **External deletion**: If the S3 access point is deleted directly through S3 APIs, the backup access point moves to EXPIRED status and becomes unusable.
+ **Access**: The access point creator's account must have access to the recovery point (either owns it, has RAM share access or has a restore access backup vault for the logically air-gapped vault via Multi-Party Approval).
+ **Access point name**: After you delete a backup access point, wait for sometime before you attempt to create a new backup access point with the same name in the same account and Region. Attempting to reuse the name before it becomes available returns a `ConflictException`.

## Troubleshooting
<a name="backup-access-points-troubleshooting"></a>

**Common issues**

`InvalidParameterValueException` when creating
+ Verify the recovery point is in `AVAILABLE`, `STOPPED`, or `COMPLETED` state.
+ For continuous recovery points, ensure `AccessPointInTime` is within the retention window.
+ Verify the access point name follows S3 naming rules (lowercase, no underscores, 3-50 characters).

Cannot delete recovery point
+ Check if active access points exist for the recovery point using `list-backup-access-points-by-recovery-point`.
+ Delete all access points before attempting to delete the recovery point.

Access point in `EXPIRED` status
+ The backup access point is no longer usable. Delete the expired backup access point using `DeleteBackupAccessPoint`, then create a new one if needed.

S3 API calls return `409 InvalidBucketState`
+ The backup access point is not yet in `AVAILABLE` status. Wait for creation to complete, then retry.

`LimitExceededException`
+ You have reached the maximum of 5 access points for this recovery point. Delete an existing access point (including any in `FAILED` or `EXPIRED` status) before creating a new one.

`ConflictException` when creating
+ You are attempting to create a backup access point with a name that was recently deleted. Wait for the name to become available, or choose a different name.
