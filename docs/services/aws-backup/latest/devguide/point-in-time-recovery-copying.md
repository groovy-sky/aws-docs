# Copying continuous backups

If a continuous backup rule also specifies a cross-account or cross-Region copy and
AWS Backup supports the operation for the resource type, AWS Backup takes a snapshot of the resource
and copies the snapshot to the destination vault. To learn more about copying your recovery
points across accounts and Regions, see [Copying a backup](recov-point-create-a-copy.md).

Continuous backups create a periodic backups in accordance with the frequency set in the
backup plan rule in the destination account and/or Region.

AWS Backup does not support on-demand copies of continuous backups.

###### Note

For database resources, ensure that your IAM role has the
`rds:DeleteDBSnapshot` permission. AWS Backup temporarily creates a source snapshot
during a point-in-time recovery (PITR) copy. After the copy completes, the service removes
the snapshot. If the role lacks this permission, AWS Backup cannot remove the temporary
snapshot. Instead, it creates an expired recovery point to prevent a snapshot leak. You
must manually delete any expired recovery points that result from insufficient
permissions.
