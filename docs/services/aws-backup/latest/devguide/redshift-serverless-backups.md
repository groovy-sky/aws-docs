# Amazon Redshift Serverless backups
<a name="redshift-serverless-backups"></a>

## Overview
<a name="redshift-serverless-backups-overview"></a>

AWS Backup offers full backup management of your Amazon Redshift Serverless namespaces. Through AWS Backup, you can schedule and restore Redshift Serverless manual snapshots through the console or through CLI.

Redshift Serverless data protection through AWS Backup provides several options for backing up and restoring your data warehouses. You can create a scheduled or on-demand snapshot of your namespace. Then, you can choose to restore all the databases in that snapshot to a Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster or a Serverless namespace. Alternatively, you can restore a single table.

Redshift Serverless offers both automated and manual snapshots. Currently, AWS Backup can be used to manage manual snapshots but not automated ones.

## Backup options for Redshift Serverless

You can use the AWS Backup console or CLI to create backups on demand or as part of a backup plan.

### Create on-demand backup
<a name="redshift-serverless-backups-on-demand"></a>

You can create on-demand backups of Redshift Serverless namespaces through the following steps:

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Open the [AWS Backup console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. On the dashboard, choose **Create an on-demand backup**.

1. Choose **Redshift Serverless** in the resource type dropdown menu.

1. Select the namespace you plan to back up.

1. Ensure **Create backup now** is selected.

1. Specify the retention period for the backup.

1. Choose an existing backup vault or create a new one.

1. Select the IAM role to use for the backup.

1. Optionally, add tags to the backup. To assign a tag to your on-demand backup, expand **Tags added to recovery points**, choose **Add new tag**, and enter a tag key and tag value.

1. Select **Create on-demand backup** to begin the backup job.

1. Once the job is initiated, the console will show the Jobs screen where you can see a list of your backup jobs and their statuses.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

Use the **start-backup-job** command.

**Required parameters**
+ `BackupVaultName`
+ `IamRoleArn`
+ `ResourceArn`

**Optional parameters**
+ `CompleteWindowMinutes`
+ `IdempotencyToken`
+ `Lifecyle`
+ `StartWindowMinutes`

**Example**
The following example creates an on-demand backup of a Redshift Serverless namespace.

```
aws backup start-backup-job \
    --backup-vault-name sample-vault \
    --iam-role-arn arn:aws:iam::{{account}}:role/service-role/AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:redshift-serverless:{{region}}:{{account}}:namespace/{{namespace-name-UUID}}
```

### Create scheduled Redshift Serverless backups in a backup plan
<a name="redshift-serverless-backups-scheduled"></a>

You can create a new backup plan for their Redshift Serverless namespaces through the AWS Backup console or through CLI, or you can add Redshift Serverless to an existing backup plan.

Your scheduled backups can include Redshift Serverless namespaces if they are a protected resource. To opt into protecting Redshift Serverless in the AWS Backup console, complete the following steps:

------
#### [ Console ]

To opt into protecting Redshift Serverless in the AWS Backup console, complete the following steps:

1. Open the [AWS Backup console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. Using the navigation pane, choose **Protected resources**.

1. Toggle **Amazon Redshift Serverless** to **On**.

1. See [Select AWS services to backup](assigning-resources.md) to include Redshift Serverless namespaces in an existing or new plan. When you add the resource type *Redshift Serverless*, you can choose to add **All Amazon Redshift namespaces**, or check the boxes next to the namespaces you wish to back up.

Under **Manage Backup plans**, you can:
+ [Create a backup plan](creating-a-backup-plan.md) and include Redshift Serverless;
+ [Update](updating-a-backup-plan.md) an existing backup plan to include Redshift Serverless.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

See [Create backup plans using the AWS CLI](creating-a-backup-plan.md#create-backup-plan-cli) for guidance to use **create-backup-plan**.

If you want to alter an existing plan to include your Serverless resources, use the command **update-backup-plan**.

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for Serverless resources to include in "BackupSelection": { "Resources" has the following format:

```
arn:aws:redshift-serverless:Region:account:snapshot/a12bc34d-567e-890f-123g-h4ijk56l78m9
```

See [Amazon Redshift Serverless restore](redshift-serverless-restore.md) for information to restore data from a snapshot to a Serverless namespace.
