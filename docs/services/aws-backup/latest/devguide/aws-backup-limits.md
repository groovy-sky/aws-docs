| Maximum character length of restore testing plan name | 50 characters (alphanumeric and underscores, no white spaces) | No |
| Maximum character length of restore testing selection name | 50 characters (alphanumeric and underscores, no white spaces) | No |

Each resource type has a limit on the number of concurrent restore jobs that can exist at one time for restore jobs that are created through a restore testing plan. Once this limit is reached, no new restore jobs for that resource type will be created until a job in a state of `RUNNING` transitions to `COMPLETED`.

If a scheduled restore job did not start due to this quota, that job will result in a `FAILED` status with the status message `"Restore job was unable to start within the specified start window. Try increasing your start window."`. If you receive a failed job with this status message, the best practice is to first increase your start window with sufficient time to allow jobs to finish. Then, retry the jobs.

Note quotas do not apply to on-demand restore jobs, but to restore jobs created by a [restore testing plan](restore-testing.md#restore-testing-create). For some resource types, you may request an increase in the quota limit.

## Related quotas
<a name="backup-related-quotas"></a>

There are [ quotas on a single resource assignment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/assigning-resources.html#assigning-resources-quotas) in a single backup rule. You can create a backup plan with multiple backup rules.

When you manage backups across multiple accounts using AWS Organizations, you might encounter quotas that AWS Organizations imposes. For these quotas, see [Quotas for AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_reference_limits.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
