<a name="associate-multipartyapproval-team"></a>

Requester: **User with access to account that owns the logically air-gapped vault**.

You can associate a Multi-party approval team with a logically air-gapped vault to enable collaborative approval for access to the vault (step 5 in the [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview)).

------
#### [ Console ]

**Associate a Multi-party approval team with a logically air-gapped vault**

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. Navigate to the **Backup vaults** section in the left navigation pane.

1. Select the logically air-gapped backup vault you want to associate with an MPA team.

1. From the dropdown menu, select the approval team you want to associate with the vault

1. *Optional* Enter a comment explaining the reason for the association.

1. Select **Send request** to submit the association request.

If this is the first approval team to be associated with the vault, the team will be associated with the vault. If the vault already has an associated team, see [Update Multi-party approval team](#update-multpartyapproval-team) for steps.

------
#### [ CLI ]

Use the CLI command `associate-backup-vault-mpa-approval-team`, modified with the following parameters:

```
aws backup associate-backup-vault-mpa-approval-team \
--backup-vault-name {{VAULT_NAME}} \
--mpa-approval-team-arn {{MPA_TEAM_ARN}} \
--requester-comment "{{OPTIONAL_COMMENT}}" \
--region {{REGION}}
```

If this is the first approval team to be associated with the vault, the team will be associated with the vault. If the vault already has an associated team, see [Update Multi-party approval team](#update-multpartyapproval-team) for steps.

## Request access to a logically air-gapped vault
<a name="create-restore-access-vault"></a>

Requester: **User with access to recovery account**.

You can request access to a logically air-gapped vault in another account (step 6 in the [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview)).

After an approval team has granted the request, AWS Backup creates a restore access backup vault in your designated recovery account so that account will have access to recovery points in the connected logically air-gapped vault.

**Required IAM permission: **The IAM role used to call `CreateRestoreAccessBackupVault` (CLI: [`create-restore-access-backup-vault`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/create-restore-access-backup-vault.html)) must include the `mpa:StartSession` permission in addition to the required backup permissions. `mpa:StartSession` is required to start the approval session that allows the approval team to approve or decline the request. If this permission is missing, the request fails and `CreateRestoreAccessBackupVaultFailed` events appear in your AWS CloudTrail logs.

------
#### [ Console ]

**Request access to a logically air-gapped vault**

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. Select the **Vaults accessible through MPA** tab

1. Select **Request vault access**.

1. Enter the source backup vault ARN of the logically air-gapped vault you want to access.

1. Enter an optional name for the restore access backup vault. If you do not input a name, AWS Backup will assign a name based on the name of the logically air gapped vault.

1. Enter an optional requester comment explaining the reason for the access request.

1. Select **Send request** to submit the access request.

The approval team members associated with the source vault will receive an email notification to approve the request.

Once the request is approved by the required number ("threshold") of team members, the restore access backup vault will be created in the recovery account.

------
#### [ CLI ]

Use the CLI command `create-restore-access-backup-vault`:

```
aws backup create-restore-access-backup-vault \
--source-backup-vault-arn {{SOURCE_VAULT_ARN}} \
--backup-vault-name {{OPTIONAL_VAULT_NAME}} \
--requester-comment "{{OPTIONAL_COMMENT}}" \
--region {{REGION}}
```

The MPA approval team members associated with the source vault will receive a notification to approve the request. Once the request is approved by the required number ("threshold") of team members, the restore access backup vault will be created in the recovery account.

You can check the status of the vault using:

```
aws backup describe-backup-vault \
--backup-vault-name {{VAULT_NAME}} \
--region {{REGION}}
```
