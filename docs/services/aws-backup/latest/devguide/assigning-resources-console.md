# Assign resources using the AWS Backup console
<a name="assigning-resources-console"></a>

**To navigate to the **Assign resources** page:**

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. Choose **Backup plans**.

1. Choose **Create Backup plan**.

1. Select any template in the **Choose template** dropdown list, then choose **Create plan**.

1. Type in a **Backup plan name**.

1. Choose **Create plan**.

1. Choose **Assign resources**.

**To begin your resource assignment, in the **General** section:**

1. Type in a **Resource assignment name**.

1. Choose the **Default role** or **Choose an IAM role**.
**Note**
If you choose an IAM role, verify that it has permission to back up all the resources you are about assign. If your role encounters a resource that it doesn't have permission to back up, your backup plan will fail.
**Note**
If role manager is enabled in your account, AWS Backup selects the default service role for you, and a **Customize** option is available. For more information, see [IAM role creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

To assign your resources, in the **Assign resources** section, choose one of the two options under **Define resource selection**:
+ **Include all resource types**. This option configures your backup plan to protect all current and future AWS Backup-supported resources assigned to your backup plan. Use this option to quickly and easily protect your data estate.

  When you choose this option, you can optionally **Refine selection using tags** as the next step.
+ **Include specific resource types**. When you choose this option, you must **Select specific resource types** with the following steps:

  1. Using the **Select resource types** dropdown menu, assign one or more resource types.

     Once you finish, AWS Backup presents you the list of resource types you selected and its default setting, which is to protect all resources for each selected resource type.

  1. Optionally, if you want to exclude specific resources from a resource type you selected:

     1. Use the **Choose resources** dropdown menu and deselect the default option.

     1. Select the specific resources to assign to your backup plan.

  1. Optionally, you can **Exclude specific resource IDs from the selected resource types**. Use this option if you want to exclude one or a few resources out of many, because doing so might be faster than selecting many resources during the previous step. You must include a resource type before you can exclude resources from that resource type. Exclude a resource ID using the following steps:

     1. Under **Exclude specific resource IDs from the selected resource types**, choose one or more of the resource types that you included using **Select resource types**.

     1. For each resource type, use the **Choose resources** menu to select one or more resources to exclude.

In addition to your previous choices, you can make even more granular selections using the optional **Refine selection using tags** feature. This feature allows you to refine your current selection to include a subset of your resources using tags.

Tags are key-value pairs that you can assign to specific resources to help you identify, organize, and filter your resources. Tags are case sensitive. For more information about tags, see [Tagging your AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.html).

When you refine your selection using two or more tags, the effect is an AND condition. For example, if you refine your selection using two tags, `env: prod` and `role: application`, you only assign resources with BOTH tags to your backup plan.

**To refine your selection using tags:**

1. Under **Refine selection using tags**, choose a **Key** from the list.

1. Choose a **Condition for value** from the list.
   + *Value* refers to the next input, the value of your key-value pair.
   + **Condition** can be `Equals`, `Contains`, `Begins with`, or `Ends with`, or their inverse: `Does not equal`, `Does not contain`, `Does not begin with`, or `Does not end with`.

1. Choose a **Value** from the list.
**Important**
Wildcard conditions such as "Begins with" or "Does not begin with" do not match spaces. For example, `prod*` matches `prod_server` but not `prod server`. To match values with spaces, include each space explicitly in the pattern (for example, `prod *` matches `prod server`). We recommend avoiding spaces in tag values used with wildcard conditions.

1. To further refine using another tag, choose **Add tag**.
