# Monitoring AWS Backup

AWS Backup works with other AWS tools to empower you to monitor its workloads. These tools
include the following:

- [AWS Backup console dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-dashboards.html)

- The jobs dashboard brings job health monitoring, where you can view metrics showing
job successes and failures, filtered by reasons, accounts, Region, and resource
type.

- The jobs dashboard is available in Regions where AWS Backup Audit Manager is supported.
See [Feature availability by AWS Region](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-region) for those
Regions. All other Regions will be able to access the [CloudWatch Dashboard](cloudwatch.md#cloudwatch-dashboard).

- **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Amazon EventBridge**
to monitor AWS Backup processes.

- You can use CloudWatch to track metrics, create alarms, and view dashboards. For more information, see [AWS Backup metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](cloudwatch.md).

- You can use EventBridge to view and monitor AWS Backup events. For more information, see [Monitoring AWS Backup events using Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/eventbridge.html).

- **AWS CloudTrail** to monitor AWS Backup API calls. You can identify
the time, source IP, users, and accounts making those calls. For more information, see [Logging AWS Backup API calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

- **Amazon Simple Notification Service** (Amazon SNS) to subscribe to AWS Backup-related topics
such as backup, restore, and copy events. For more information, see [Notification options with AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-notifications.html).
