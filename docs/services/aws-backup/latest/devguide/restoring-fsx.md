# Restore an FSx file system

The restore options that are available when you use AWS Backup to restore Amazon FSx file systems
are the same as using the native Amazon FSx backup. You can use a backup's recovery point to
create a new file system and restore a point-in-time snapshot of another file system.

AWS Backup supports restoring file systems that use Intelligent Tiering storage for both
FSx for Lustre and FSx for OpenZFS file systems. Intelligent Tiering file systems have specific
configuration requirements during restore operations.

When restoring Amazon FSx file systems, AWS Backup creates a new file system and populates it with
the data (Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP allows restoring a volume to an existing file system). This is
similar to how native Amazon FSx backs up and restores file systems. Restoring a backup to a new
file system takes the same amount of time as creating a new file system. The data restored
from the backup is lazy-loaded onto the file system. You might therefore experience slightly
higher latency during the process.

###### Note

You can't restore to an existing Amazon FSx file system, and you can't restore individual
files or folders.

FSx for ONTAP doesn’t support backing up certain volume types, including DP
(data-protection) volumes, LS (load-sharing) volumes, full volumes, or volumes on file
systems that are full. For more information, please see [FSx for ONTAP Working with\
backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/using-backups.html).

AWS Backup vaults that contain recovery points of Amazon FSx file systems are visible outside
of AWS Backup. You can restore the recovery points using Amazon FSx but you can't delete
them.

You can see backups created by the built-in Amazon FSx automatic backup functionality
from the AWS Backup console. You can also recover these backups using AWS Backup. However, you can't
delete these backups or change the automatic backup schedules of your Amazon FSx file systems
using AWS Backup.

## Use the AWS Backup console to restore Amazon FSx recovery points

You can restore most Amazon FSx backups created by AWS Backup using the AWS Backup console, API, or
AWS CLI.

This section shows you how to use the AWS Backup console to restore Amazon FSx file
systems.

###### Topics

###### To restore an FSx for Windows File Server file system

01. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Protected resources**, and
     then choose the Amazon FSx resource ID that you want to restore.

03. On the **Resource details** page, a list of recovery points
     for the selected resource ID is shown. Choose the recovery point ID of the
     resource.

04. In the upper-right corner of the pane, choose **Restore** to
     open the **Restore backup** page.

05. In the **File system details** section, the ID of your backup
     is shown under **Backup ID**, and the file system type is shown
     under **File system type**. You can restore both FSx for Windows File Server and
     FSx for Lustre file systems.

06. For **Deployment type**, accept the default. You can't change
     the deployment type of a file system during restore.

07. Choose the **Storage type** to use. If the storage capacity
     of your file system is less than 2,000 GiB, you can't use the
     **HDD** storage type.

08. For **Throughput capacity**, choose **Recommended**
    **throughput capacity** to use the recommended 16 MB per second (MBps)
     rate, or choose **Specify throughput capacity** and enter a new
     rate.

09. In the **Network and security** section, provide the required
     information.

10. If you are restoring an FSx for Windows File Server file system, provide the **Windows authentication** information used to access the file system, or
     you can create a new one.

    ###### Note

    When restoring a backup, you can't change the type of Active Directory on
    the file system.

    For more information about Microsoft Active Directory, see [Working with Active Directory in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/aws-ad-integration-fsxW.html) in
     the _Amazon FSx for Windows File Server User Guide_.

11. (Optional) In the **Backup and maintenance** section, provide
     the information to set your backup preferences.

12. In the **Restore role** section, choose the IAM role that
     AWS Backup will use to create and manage your backups on your behalf. We recommend that
     you choose the **Default role**. If there is no default role, one
     is created for you with the correct permissions. You can also provide your own
     IAM role.

13. Verify all your entries, and choose **Restore**
    **Backup**.

AWS Backup supports Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems that have persistent storage
deployment type and are not linked to a data repository like Amazon S3.

###### Note

You can only restore your backup to a file system of the same deployment type, storage
class, throughput capacity, storage capacity, data compression type, and AWS Region
as the original. You can increase your restored file system's storage capacity after
it becomes available.

###### To restore an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system

01. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Protected resources**, and
     then choose the Amazon FSx resource ID that you want to restore.
