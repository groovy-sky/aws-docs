# Access control

You can have valid credentials to authenticate your requests, but unless you have the
appropriate permissions, you can't access AWS Backup resources such as backup vaults. You also
can't back up AWS resources such as Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

Every AWS resource is owned by an AWS account, and permissions to create or access a
resource are governed by permissions policies. An account administrator can attach
permissions policies to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identities (that is, users, groups, and roles).
And some services also support attaching permissions policies to resources.

An _account administrator_ (or administrator user) is a user with
administrator permissions. For more information, see [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

When granting permissions, you decide who is getting the permissions, the resources they
get permissions for, and the specific actions that you want to allow on those
resources.

The following sections cover how access policies work and how you use them to protect
your backups.

## Resources and operations

A resource is an object that exists within a service. AWS Backup resources include backup
plans, backup vaults, and backups. _Backup_ is a general term that
refers to the various types of backup resources that exist in AWS. For example, Amazon EBS
snapshots, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) snapshots, and Amazon DynamoDB backups are all types of backup
resources.

In AWS Backup, backups are also referred to as _recovery points_. When
using AWS Backup, you also work with the resources from other AWS services that you are
trying to protect, such as Amazon EBS volumes or DynamoDB tables. These resources have unique
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) associated with them. ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources.
You must have an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of
AWS, such as in IAM policies or API calls.

The following table lists resources, subresources, ARN format, and an example unique
ID.

Resources that support full AWS Backup management all have recovery points in the format
`arn:aws:backup:region:account-id::recovery-point:*`.
making it easier for you to apply permissions policies to protect those recovery points.
To see which resources support full AWS Backup management, see that section of the [Feature availability by resource](backup-feature-availability.md#features-by-resource) table.

AWS Backup provides a set of operations to work with AWS Backup resources. For a list of
available operations, see AWS Backup [Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_Operations.html).

## Resource ownership

The AWS account owns the resources that are created in the account, regardless of
who created the resources. Specifically, the resource owner is the AWS account of the
[principal entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#id_roles_terms-and-concepts)
(that is, the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role) that authenticates
the resource creation request. The following examples illustrate how this works:

- If you use the AWS account root user credentials of your AWS account to create
a backup vault, your AWS account is the owner of the vault.

- If you create an IAM user in your AWS account and grant permissions to create
a backup vault to that user, the user can create a backup vault. However, your AWS
account, to which the user belongs, owns the backup vault resource.

- If you create an IAM role in your AWS account with permissions to create a
backup vault, anyone who can assume the role can create a vault. Your AWS account,
to which the role belongs, owns the backup vault resource.

## Specifying policy elements: actions, effects, and principals

For each AWS Backup resource (see [Resources and operations](#access-control-resources)), the service defines a set of API operations
(see [Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_Operations.html)). To grant
permissions for these API operations, AWS Backup defines a set of actions that you can specify
in a policy. Performing an API operation can require permissions for more than one
action.

The following are the most basic policy elements:

- Resource – In a policy, you use an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to identify
the resource to which the policy applies. For more information, see [Resources and operations](#access-control-resources).

- Action – You use action keywords to identify resource operations that you
want to allow or deny.

- Effect – You specify the effect when the user requests the specific
action—this can be either allow or deny. If you don't explicitly grant access
to (allow) a resource, access is implicitly denied. You can also explicitly deny
access to a resource, which you might do to make sure that a user cannot access it,
even if a different policy grants access.

- Principal – In identity-based policies (IAM policies), the user that the
policy is attached to is the implicit principal. For resource-based policies, you
specify the user, account, service, or other entity that you want to receive
permissions (applies to resource-based policies only).

To learn more about IAM policy syntax and descriptions, see [IAM JSON Policy Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

For a table showing all of the AWS Backup API actions, see [API permissions: actions, resources, and conditions reference](#backup-api-permissions-ref).

## Specifying conditions in a policy

When you grant permissions, you can use the IAM policy language to specify the
conditions when a policy should take effect. For example, you might want a policy to be
applied only after a specific date. For more information about specifying conditions in a
policy language, see [Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

AWS supports global condition keys and service-specific condition keys. To see all
global condition keys, see [AWS global condition\
context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

AWS Backup defines its own set of condition keys. To see a list of AWS Backup condition keys,
see [Condition keys\
for AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsbackup.html#awsbackup-policy-keys) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.

## API permissions: actions, resources, and conditions reference

When you are setting up [Access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/access-control.html) and writing a permissions policy that you can attach to an IAM identity (identity-based
policies), you can use the following table
as a reference. The table lists
each AWS Backup API operation, the
corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions to perform the action, and the
AWS resource for which you can grant the permissions. You specify the actions in the
policy's `Action` field, and you specify the resource value in the policy's
`Resource` field. If `Resource` field is blank, you can use the
wildcard ( `*`) to include all resources.

You can use AWS-wide condition keys in your AWS Backup policies to express conditions.
For a complete list of AWS-wide keys, see [Available\
Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Use the scroll bars to see the rest of the table.

## Copy tags permissions

When AWS Backup performs a backup or copy job, it attempts to copy the tags from your
source resource (or recovery point in the case of copy) to your recovery point.

###### Note

AWS Backup does **not** natively copy tags during restore
jobs. For an event-driven architecture that will copy tags during restore jobs, see
[How to retain\
resource tags in AWS Backup restore jobs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/how-to-retain-resource-tags-in-aws-backup-restore-jobs).

During a backup or copy job, AWS Backup aggregates the tags you specify in your backup plan
(or copy plan, or on-demand backup) with the tags from your source resource. However,
AWS enforces a limit of 50 tags per resource, which AWS Backup cannot exceed. When a backup
or copy job aggregates tags from the plan and the source resource, it might discover more
than 50 total tags, it will be unable to complete the job, and will fail the job. This is
consistent with AWS-wide tagging best practices.

- Your resource has more than 50 tags after aggregating your backup job tags with
your source resource tags. AWS supports up to 50 tags per resource.

- The IAM role you provide to AWS Backup lacks permissions to read the source tags or set
the destination tags. For more information and sample IAM role policies, see [Managed\
Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/access-control.html#managed-policies).

You can use your backup plan (tags added to recovery points) to create tags that contradict your source resource tags.
When the two conflict, the tags from your backup plan take precedence. Use this technique
if you prefer not to copy a tag value from your source resource. Specify the same tag key,
but different or empty value, using your backup plan.

DynamoDB does not support assigning tags to backups unless you first enable [Advanced DynamoDB backup](advanced-ddb-backup.md).

When an Amazon EC2 backup creates an Image Recovery Point and a set of snapshots, AWS Backup
copies tags to the resulting AMI. AWS Backup also copies the tags from the volumes associated
with the Amazon EC2 instance to the resulting snapshots.

## Access policies

A _permissions_ policy describes who has access to what. Policies
attached to an IAM identity are referred to as _identity-based_
policies (IAM policies). Policies attached to a resource are referred to as
_resource-based_ policies. AWS Backup supports both identity-based
policies and resource-based policies.

###### Note

This section discusses using IAM in the context of AWS Backup. It doesn't provide
detailed information about the IAM service. For complete IAM documentation, see
[What Is IAM?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_. For information about IAM policy syntax and
descriptions, see [IAM JSON Policy\
Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

### Identity-based policies (IAM policies)

Identity-based policies are policies that you can attach to IAM identities, such
as users or roles. For example, you can define a policy that allows a user to view and
back up AWS resources, but prevents them from restoring backups.

For more information about users, groups, roles, and permissions, see [Identities (Users, Groups, and Roles)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

For information about how to use IAM policies to control access to backups, see
[Managed policies for AWS Backup](security-iam-awsmanpol.md).

### Resource-based policies

AWS Backup supports resource-based access policies for backup vaults. This enables you to
define an access policy that can control which users have what kind of access to any of
the backups organized in a backup vault. Resource-based access policies for backup
vaults provide an easy way to control access to your backups.

Backup vault access policies control user access when you use AWS Backup APIs. Some
backup types, such as Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) snapshots, can also be
accessed using those services' APIs. You can create separate access policies in IAM
that control access to those APIs in order to fully control access to backups.

To learn how to create an access policy for backup vaults, see [Vault access policies](create-a-vault-access-policy.md).
