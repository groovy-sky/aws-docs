## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[BackupVaultArn](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup vault; for example,
`arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault`.

Type: String

**[BackupVaultName](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults are identified
by names that are unique to the account used to create them and the Region where they are
created.

Type: String

**[CreationDate](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The date and time that a backup vault is created, in Unix format and Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC). The value of `CreationDate` is accurate to milliseconds.
For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087
AM.

Type: Timestamp

**[CreatorRequestId](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried
without the risk of running the operation twice. This parameter is optional. If used, this
parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-\_.' characters.

Type: String

**[EncryptionKeyArn](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The server-side encryption key that is used to protect your backups; for example,
`arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`.

Type: String

**[EncryptionKeyType](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The type of encryption key used for the backup vault. Valid values are CUSTOMER\_MANAGED\_KMS\_KEY for customer-managed keys or AWS\_OWNED\_KMS\_KEY for AWS-owned keys.

Type: String

Valid Values: `AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY | CUSTOMER_MANAGED_KMS_KEY`

**[LatestMpaApprovalTeamUpdate](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

Information about the latest update to the MPA approval team association for this backup vault.

Type: [LatestMpaApprovalTeamUpdate](api-latestmpaapprovalteamupdate.md) object

**[LockDate](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The date and time when AWS Backup Vault Lock configuration cannot be changed or
deleted.

If you applied Vault Lock to your vault without specifying a lock date, you can change
any of your Vault Lock settings, or delete Vault Lock from the vault entirely, at any
time.

This value is in Unix format, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and accurate to
milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018
12:11:30.087 AM.

Type: Timestamp

**[Locked](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

A Boolean that indicates whether AWS Backup Vault Lock is currently protecting
the backup vault. `True` means that Vault Lock causes delete or update
operations on the recovery points stored in the vault to fail.

Type: Boolean

**[MaxRetentionDays](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The AWS Backup Vault Lock setting that specifies the maximum retention period
that the vault retains its recovery points. If this parameter is not specified, Vault Lock
does not enforce a maximum retention period on the recovery points in the vault (allowing
indefinite storage).

If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a
retention period equal to or shorter than the maximum retention period. If the job's
retention period is longer than that maximum retention period, then the vault fails the
backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different
vault. Recovery points already stored in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not
affected.

Type: Long

**[MinRetentionDays](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The AWS Backup Vault Lock setting that specifies the minimum retention period
that the vault retains its recovery points. If this
parameter is not specified, Vault Lock will not enforce a minimum retention period.

If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle policy with a
retention period equal to or longer than the minimum retention period. If the job's
retention period is shorter than that minimum retention period, then the vault fails the
backup or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different
vault. Recovery points already stored in the vault prior to Vault Lock are not
affected.

Type: Long

**[MpaApprovalTeamArn](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The ARN of the MPA approval team associated with this backup vault.

Type: String

**[MpaSessionArn](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The ARN of the MPA session associated with this backup vault.

Type: String

**[NumberOfRecoveryPoints](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The number of recovery points that are stored in a backup vault.

Recovery point count value displayed in the console can be an approximation. Use [`ListRecoveryPointsByBackupVault`](api-listrecoverypointsbybackupvault.md) API to obtain the exact
count.

Type: Long

**[SourceBackupVaultArn](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The ARN of the source backup vault from which this restore access backup vault was created.

Type: String

**[VaultState](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The current state of the vault.->

Type: String

Valid Values: `CREATING | AVAILABLE | FAILED`

**[VaultType](#API_DescribeBackupVault_ResponseSyntax)**

The type of vault described.

Type: String

Valid Values: `BACKUP_VAULT | LOGICALLY_AIR_GAPPED_BACKUP_VAULT | RESTORE_ACCESS_BACKUP_VAULT`
