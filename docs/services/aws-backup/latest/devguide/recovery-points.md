# Backup creation, maintenance, and restore
<a name="recovery-points"></a>

A backup, or *recovery point*, represents the content of a resource, such as an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or Amazon DynamoDB table, at a specified time. Recovery point is a term that refers generally to the different backups in AWS services, such as Amazon EBS snapshots and DynamoDB backups. The terms *recovery point* and *backup* are used interchangeably.

AWS Backup saves recovery points in backup vaults, which you can organize according to your business needs. For example, you can save a set of resources that contain financial information for fiscal year 2020. When you need to recover a resource, you can use either the AWS Backup console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to find and recover the resource you need.

Each recovery point has a unique ID. The unique ID is at the end of the recovery point's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For examples of recovery point ARNs and unique IDs, see the table in [Resources and operations](access-control.md#access-control-resources).

**Important**
To avoid additional charges, configure your retention policy with a warm storage duration of **at least one week**. For more information, see [Metering, costs, and billing for AWS Backup](metering-and-billing.md).
