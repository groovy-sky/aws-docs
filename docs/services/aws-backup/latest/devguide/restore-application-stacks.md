# Restore CloudFormation stacks
<a name="restore-application-stacks"></a>

A CloudFormation composite backup is a combination of a CloudFormation template and all associated nested recovery points. Any number of nested recovery points can be restored, but the composite recovery point (which is the top-level recovery point) cannot be restored.

When you restore a CloudFormation template recovery point, you create a new stack with a change set to represent the backup.

## Restore CloudFormation with the AWS Backup console
<a name="restoring-stack-console"></a>

From the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) you can see the new stack and change set. To learn more about change sets, see [ Updating stacks using change sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html) in the *CloudFormation User Guide*.

Determine which nested recovery points you want to restore from with your CloudFormation stack, and then restore them using the AWS Backup console.

1. Open the AWS Backup console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup).

1. Go to **Backup vaults**, select the backup vault containing your desired recovery point, then click on **Recovery points**.

1. Restore the CloudFormation template recovery point.

   1. Click the composite recovery point containing the nested recovery points you want to restore to bring up the Details page for the composite recovery point.

   1. Under **Nested recovery points**, the nested recovery points will be displayed. Each recovery point will have a recovery point ID, a status, a resource ID, a resource type, a backup type, and the time that recovery point was created. Click the radio button next to the CloudFormation recovery point, then click **Restore**. Ensure that you are selecting the recovery point that has **resource type: CloudFormation** and **backup type: backup.**

1. Once the restore job for the CloudFormation template is completed, your restored CloudFormation template will be visible in the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) under **Stacks**.

1. Under **Stack names** you should find the restored template with the status of `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`.

1. Click on the name of the stack to see the stack's details.

1. There are tabs under the stack name. Click on **Change sets**.

1. Execute the change set.

1. After this processes, the resources in the original stack will be recreated in the new stack. The stateful resources will be recreated empty. For example, a stateful resource is an Amazon EBS volume or an Amazon EFS file system. To recover the stateful resources, go back to the list of recovery points in the AWS Backup console, select the recovery point you need, and initiate a restore.

**Important**
CloudFormation performs pre-deployment validation, including resource existence checks, when a change set is created. If a resource defined in the restored template already exists in your account (for example, a DynamoDB table with a fixed name), the restore operation fails at the create change set step (step 8) rather than at the execute change set step (step 9). For more information, see [Considerations for validating stack deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/validate-stack-deployments.html#validate-stack-deployments-considerations) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.

**Note**
If a CloudFormation restore operation fails, the stack may remain in `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` status with a `FAILED` change set. Delete these stacks manually to avoid naming conflicts when you retry the restore operation.
 For more information, see [Deleting a stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.

## Restore CloudFormation with AWS CLI
<a name="restoring-cfn-cli"></a>

In the command line interface, [`start-restore-job`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/backup/start-restore-job.html) allows you to restore a CloudFormation stack.

The following list is the accepted metadata to restore an CloudFormation resource.

```
// Mandatory metadata:
ChangeSetName // This is the name of the change set which will be created
StackName // This is the name of the stack that will be created by the new change set

// Optional metadata:
ChangeSetDescription // This is the description of the new change set
StackParameters // This is the JSON of the stack parameters required by the stack
aws:backup:request-id
```
