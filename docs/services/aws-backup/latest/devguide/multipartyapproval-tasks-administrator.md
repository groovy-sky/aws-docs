# Administrator tasks
<a name="multipartyapproval-tasks-administrator"></a>

Several tasks involving AWS Backup and Multi-party overview required a user with admin permissions and access to the management account.

## Create an approval team
<a name="create-multipartyapproval-team"></a>

A user at your organization with admin permissions for an AWS account needs to [set up Multi-party approval](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/setting-up.html) (step 3 in the [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview)).

Before doing this step, it is recommended as a best practice you have both a primary organization and a secondary organization (for recovery purposes) set up through AWS Organizations (step 1 in [Overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview).

See [Create an approval team](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/create-team.html#create-team-steps) in the *Multi-party approval user guide* to create your team.

During the [`aws mpa create-approval-team`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/APIReference/API_CreateApprovalTeam.html) operation, one of the parameters is `policies`. This is a list of ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) for Multi-party approval resource policies that define permissions that protect the team.

The policy shown in the example in the *Multi-party approval User Guide* in the procedure [Create an approval team](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/create-team.html#create-team-steps) contains the policy `["arn:aws:mpa::aws:policy/backup.amazonaws.com/CreateRestoreAccessVault"]` with several necessary permissions.

Follow these steps to return a list of available policies by using `mpa list-policies`:

1. List Policies:

   ```
   aws mpa list-policies --region us-east-1
   ```

1. List all policy versions:

   ```
   aws mpa list-policy-versions --policy-arn arn:aws:mpa:::aws:policy/backup.amazonaws.com/CreateRestoreAccessVault --region us-east-1
   ```

1. Get details on a policy:

   ```
   aws mpa get-policy-version --policy-version-arn arn:aws:mpa:::aws:policy/backup.amazonaws.com/CreateRestoreAccessVault/1 --region us-east-1
   ```

Expand below to see the policy that will created then attached to your approval team by this operation:

## Share a Multi-party approval team using AWS RAM
<a name="share-multipartyapproval-team-using-ram"></a>

You can share a Multi-party approval team with other AWS accounts using [AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-create.html), step 4 in the [overview](multipartyapproval.md#multipartyapproval-overview).

------
#### [ Console ]

**Share a Multi-party approval team using AWS RAM**

1. Sign in to the [AWS RAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home?region=us-east-1).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Resource shares**.

1. Choose **Create resource share**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a descriptive name for your resource share.

1. Under **Resource type**, select **Multi-party approval Team** from the dropdown menu.

1. Under **Resources**, select the approval team you want to share.

1. Under **Principals**, specify the AWS accounts with whom you want to share the approval team.

1. To share with specific AWS accounts, select **AWS accounts** and enter the 12-digit account IDs.

1. To share with an organization or organizational unit, select **Organization** or **Organizational unit** and enter the appropriate ID.

1. (*Optional*) Under **Tags**, add any tags you want to associate with this resource share.

1. Choose **Create resource share**.

The resource share status will initially show as `PENDING`. Once the recipient accounts accept the invitation, the status will change to `ACTIVE`.

------
#### [ CLI ]

To share a Multi-party approval team using AWS RAM through the CLI, use the following commands:

First, identify the ARN of the approval team you want to share:

```
aws mpa list-approval-teams --region {{us-east-1}}
```

Create a resource share using the create-resource-share command:

```
aws ram create-resource-share \
--name "MPA-Team-Share" \
--resource-arns "arn:aws:mpa:{{us-east-1}}:{{ACCOUNT_ID}}:approval-team/{{TEAM_ID}}" \
--principals "{{ACCOUNT_ID_TO_SHARE_WITH}}" \
--permission-arns "arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMMPAApprovalTeamAccess" \
--region {{us-east-1}}
```

To share with an organization instead of specific accounts:

```
aws ram create-resource-share \
--name "MPA-Team-Share" \
--resource-arns "arn:aws:mpa:{{us-east-1}}:{{ACCOUNT_ID}}:approval-team/{{TEAM_ID}}" \
--permission-arns "arn:aws:ram::aws:permission/AWSRAMMPAApprovalTeamAccess" \
--allow-external-principals \
--region {{us-east-1}}
```

Check the status of your resource share:

```
aws ram get-resource-shares \
--resource-owner SELF \
--region {{us-east-1}}
```

The recipient account(s) will need to accept the resource share invitation:

```
aws ram get-resource-share-invitations --region {{us-east-1}}
```

Run in recipient account to accept an invitation:

```
aws ram accept-resource-share-invitation \
--resource-share-invitation-arn "arn:aws:ram:{{REGION}}:{{ACCOUNT_ID}}:resource-share-invitation/{{INVITATION_ID}}" \
--region {{us-east-1}}
```

Once the invitation is accepted, the Multi-party approval team will be available for use in the recipient account.

AWS offers tools to share account access, including through [AWS Resource Access Manager](logicallyairgappedvault.md#lag-share) and [Multi-party access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/share-team.html). When you choose to share a logically air-gapped vault with another account, consider the following details:

| Feature | AWS RAM based sharing | Multi-party approval based access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access to logically air-gapped vaults | Once RAM share is complete, the vaults can be accessed. | Any attempt by a different account must be approved by a threshold number of Multi-party approval team members. The approval session automatically expires 24 hours after the request is initiated. |
| Access removal | The account which owns the logically air-gapped vault can end RAM based sharing at any time. | Access to a vault can only be removed by a request to the Multi-party approval team. |
| Copy across accounts and/or Regions | Not currently supported. | Backups can be copied within the same account or with other accounts in the same organization as the recovery account. |
| Cross-Region transfer billing |  | Cross-Region transfers are billed to the same account that owns the restore access backup vault. |
| Recommended use | Primary use is for data loss recovery and for restore testing. | Primary use is for situations where account access or security is suspected to be compromised. |
| Regions | Available in all AWS Regions where logically air-gapped vaults are supported. | Available in all AWS Regions where logically air-gapped vaults are supported. |
| Restores | All supported resource types can be restored from a shared account. | All supported resource types can be restored from a shared account. |
| Setup | Sharing can occur as soon as the AWS Backup account sets up RAM sharing and the receiving account accepts the share. | Sharing requires the management account to first create a team, then set up RAM sharing. Then, the management account opts in to Multi-party approval and assigns that team to a logically air-gapped vault. |
| Sharing | Sharing is done through RAM within same AWS organization or across AWS organizations.<br />Access is granted according to the 'push' model, in which the account that owns the logically air-gapped vault first grants access. Then, the other account accepts access. | Access to a logically air-gapped vault is through Organizations supported approval teams within the same AWS organization or across organizations.<br />Access is granted according to the 'pull' model, where the receiving account first requests access, then the approval team grants or denies the request. |
