# Using the local Administrators group on the image builder
<a name="manual-procedure"></a>

To grant Active Directory users or groups local administrator rights on your image builder, you can manually add these users or groups to the local Administrators group on the image builder. Image builders that are created from images with these rights maintain the same rights.

The Active Directory users or groups to which to grant local administrator rights must already exist.

**To add Active Directory users or groups to the local Administrators group on the image builder**

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).

1. Connect to the image builder in Administrator mode. The image builder must be running and domain-joined. For more information, see [Tutorial: Setting Up Active Directory](active-directory-directory-setup.md).

1. Choose **Start**, **Administrative Tools**, and then double-click **Computer Management**.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Local Users and Groups** and open the **Groups** folder.

1. Open the **Administrators** group and choose **Add...**.

1. Select all Active Directory users or groups to which to assign local administrator rights and choose **OK**. Choose **OK** again to close the **Administrator Properties** dialog box.

1. Close Computer Management.

1. To log in as an Active Directory user and test whether that user has local administrator rights on the image builder, choose **Admin Commands**, **Switch user**, and then enter the credentials of the relevant user.
