## SAML federation is not working. The user is not authorized to view WorkSpaces Applications applications.

This might happen because the inline policy that is embedded for the SAML 2.0
federation IAM role does not include permissions to the stack ARN. The IAM role
is assumed by the federated user who is accessing an WorkSpaces Applications stack. Edit the role
permissions to include the stack ARN. For more information, see [Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Integration with SAML 2.0](external-identity-providers.md) and [Troubleshooting SAML 2.0 Federation with AWS](../../../iam/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-saml.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## After federating from an ADFS portal, my streaming session doesn't start. I am getting the error "Sorry connection went down".

Set the claim rule's **Incoming Claim Type** for the
**NameID** SAML attribute to **UPN** and try the connection again.

## I get an invalid redirect URI error.

This error occurs due to a malformed or invalid WorkSpaces Applications stack relay state URL. Make
sure that the relay state configured in your federation setup is the same as the
stack relay state that is displayed in the stack details through the WorkSpaces Applications console. If they are
the same and the problem still persists, contact AWS Support. For more information,
see [Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Integration with SAML 2.0](external-identity-providers.md).

## My image builders and fleets never reach the running state. My DNS servers are in a Simple AD directory.

WorkSpaces Applications relies on the DNS servers within your VPC to return a non-existent domain
(NXDOMAIN) response for local domain names that don’t exist. This enables the
WorkSpaces Applications-managed network interface to communicate with the management servers.

When you create a directory with Simple AD, AWS Directory Service creates two domain controllers that also function as DNS servers on your behalf. Because the domain controllers don't provide the
NXDOMAIN response, they can't be used with WorkSpaces Applications.

## I've enabled application settings persistence for my users, but their persistent application settings aren't being saved or loaded.

WorkSpaces Applications automatically saves application settings that are created in certain
locations on the Windows instance. The settings are saved only if your application
saves them to one of these locations. For a list of supported locations, see [How Application Settings Persistence Works](how-it-works-app-settings-persistence.md). If your application is
configured to save to C:\\Users\\%username% and your users' settings for the
application aren’t persisting between sessions, the mount point might not be
created. This prevents the settings from being saved to the VHD file that contains
your users’ persistent application settings.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. On the fleet instance, open File Explorer and browse to the user profile directory at C:\\Users\\%username%.

2. Confirm whether this directory contains a symlink, and then do either of the following:

- If there is a symlink, confirm that it points to D:\\%username%.

- If there isn't a symlink, try to delete the C:\\Users\\%username% directory.

If you can’t delete this directory, identify the file in the directory that is preventing it from being deleted and the application that created the file. Then contact the application vendor for information about how to change the file permissions or move the file.

If you can delete this directory, contact AWS Support for further
guidance to resolve this issue. For
more information, see [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

## I've enabled application settings persistence for my users, but for certain streaming applications, my users’ passwords aren’t persisting across sessions.

This issue occurs when:

- Users are streaming applications such as Microsoft Outlook, which use the [Microsoft Data Protection API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/seccng/cng-dpapi).

- App settings persistence is enabled for streaming instances that are not joined to Active Directory domains.

In cases where a streaming instance is not joined to an Active Directory domain,
the Windows user, PhotonUser, is different on each fleet instance. Due to the way in
which the DPAPI security model works, users' passwords don’t persist for
applications that use DPAPI in this scenario. In cases where streaming instances are
joined to an Active Directory domain and the user is a domain user, the Windows user
name is that of the logged in user, and users’ passwords persist for applications
that use DPAPI.

## Google Chrome data is filling the VHD file that contains my users' persistent application settings. This is preventing their settings from persisting. How can I manage the Chrome profile?

By default, Google Chrome stores both user data and the local disk cache in the Windows user profile. To prevent the local disk cache data from filling the VHD file that contains users' persistent application settings, configure Chrome to save only the user data. To do so, on the fleet instance, open the command line as an administrator and start Chrome with the following parameters to change the location of the disk cache:

`chrome.exe --disk-cache-dir C:\` `path-to-unsaved-location` `\`

Running Chrome with these parameters prevents the disk cache from being persisted between WorkSpaces Applications sessions.

## I set up a custom domain for my embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, but my WorkSpaces Applications streaming URLs aren't redirecting to my custom domain.

To resolve this issue, verify that when you created your WorkSpaces Applications streaming URL, you replaced the WorkSpaces Applications endpoint with your custom domain. By default, WorkSpaces Applications streaming URLs are formatted as follows:

```nohighlight

https://appstream2.region.aws.amazon.com/authenticate?parameters=authenticationcode
```

To replace the default WorkSpaces Applications endpoint in your streaming URL, replace `https://appstream2.` `region` in the URL with your custom domain. For example, if your custom domain is `training.example.com`, your new streaming URL must follow this format:

```nohighlight

https://training.example.com/authenticate?parameters=authenticationcode
```

For more information about configuring custom domains for embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, see [Configuration Requirements for Using Custom Domains](create-streaming-url-user-authentication.md#configuration-requirements-custom-domains).

## I launched an app on a smartcard-enabled WorkSpaces Applications fleet, and there are a limited number of certificates (or none) available to the app for authentication.

This happens when the application is launched before the [Certificate Propagation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/smart-cards/smart-card-certificate-propagation-service) service is in a running state.

To resolve this issue, use the PowerShell module [Get-Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-service?view=powershell-7.1) to query the Certificate Propagation service’s status, and
make sure that it's in a running state before launching your application.

For example, the following script won't launch the application until the
Certificate Propagation service is running:

```

$logFile = "$Env:TEMP\AS2\Logging\$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss")_applaunch.log"
New-Item -path $logfile -ItemType File -Force | Out-Null

Function Write-Log {
    Param ([string]$message)
    $stamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss"
    $logoutput = "$stamp $message"
    Add-content $logfile -value $logoutput
}

if (Get-Service -Name "CertPropSvc" | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Running) {

    Write-Log "The Certificate Propagation Service is running. Launching Application..."
    try {
        Start-Process -FilePath "Path to Application" -WindowStyle Maximized -ErrorAction Stop
    }
    catch {
        Write-Log "There was an error launching the application: $_"

    }

}
else {

    do {

        $status = Get-Service "CertPropSvc" | select-object -ExpandProperty Status
        Write-Log "The Certificate Propagation service status is currently $status"
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 2

    } until (Get-Service -Name "CertPropSvc" | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Running)

    write-log "The Certificate Propagation Service is running. Launching Application..."
    try {
        Start-Process -FilePath "Path to Application" -WindowStyle Maximized -ErrorAction Stop
    }
    catch {
        Write-Log "There was an error launching the application: $_"

    }
}

```

## The Certification Propagation service isn't starting on my smartcard-enabled WorkSpaces Applications fleet.

If the [Certificate Propagation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/smart-cards/smart-card-certificate-propagation-service) service isn't starting, the service’s startup
type might be set to **Disabled**. To resolve this, on the
WorkSpaces Applications image builder used to create your fleet’s image, launch the Windows
Services Microsoft Management Console, and make sure that the startup type of the
Certificate Propagation service isn't set to **Disabled**.

If the startup type isn't set to **Disabled**, and the service is
still not starting on your WorkSpaces Applications fleet, use the PowerShell module [Start-Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/start-service?view=powershell-7.1) to start the Certificate Propagation service when your
fleet instance starts.

For example, the following PowerShell script will start the service if it detects
that it's in a stopped state:

```

$logFile = "C:\AppStream\Logging\$(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss")_certpropcheck.log"
New-Item -path $logfile -ItemType File -Force | Out-Null

Function Write-Log {
    Param ([string]$message)
    $stamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss"
    $logoutput = "$stamp $message"
    Add-content $logfile -value $logoutput
}

if (Get-Service -Name "CertPropSvc" | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Running) {

    Write-Log "The Certificate Propagation Service is running. Exiting..."
    Exit
}
else {
    do {

        if (Get-Service -Name "CertPropSvc" | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Stopped) {

            Write-Log "The Certificate Propagation Service is stopped, attepmting to start..."
            try {
                Start-Service -Name "CertPropSvc" -ErrorAction Stop

            }
            catch {
                Write-Log "There was a problem starting the service: $_"
                break
            }

            $status = Get-Service "CertPropSvc" | select-object -ExpandProperty Status
            Write-Log "The Certificate Propagation service status is currently $status"

        }
        else {

            $status = Get-Service "CertPropSvc" | select-object -ExpandProperty Status
            Write-Log "The Certificate Propagation service status is currently $status"
            break
        }

    } until (Get-Service -Name "CertPropSvc" | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Running)
}

```

## I can't log in with my Active Directory username or password after SAML authentication.

The nameID in the SAML claim needs to match the username in Active Directory. Some
IdPs require an update, refresh, or redeploy after adjusting certain attributes. If
you make an adjustment and it is not reflected in your SAML capture, refer to your
IdP's documentation or support program regarding the specific steps required to make
the change take effect.
