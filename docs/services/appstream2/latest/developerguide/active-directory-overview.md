# Overview of Active Directory Domains

Using Active Directory domains with WorkSpaces Applications requires an understanding of how they work
together and the configuration tasks that you'll need to complete. You'll need to
complete the following tasks:

1. Configure Group Policy settings as needed to define the end user experience
    and security requirements for applications.

2. Create the domain-joined application stack in WorkSpaces Applications.

3. Create the WorkSpaces Applications application in the SAML 2.0 identity provider and assign it
    to end users either directly or through Active Directory groups.

For your users to be authenticated to a domain, several steps must occur when these
users initiate an WorkSpaces Applications streaming session. The following diagram illustrates the
end-to-end user authentication flow from the initial browser request through SAML and
Active Directory authentication.

###### User Authentication Flow

1. The user browses to `https://applications.exampleco.com`. The
    sign-on page requests authentication for the user.

2. The federation service requests authentication from the organization's
    identity store.

3. The identity store authenticates the user and returns the authentication
    response to the federation service.

4. On successful authentication, the federation service posts the SAML assertion
    to the user's browser.

5. The user's browser posts the SAML assertion to the AWS Sign-In SAML endpoint
    ( `https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`). AWS Sign-In receives the
    SAML request, processes the request, authenticates the user, and forwards the
    authentication token to the WorkSpaces Applications service.

6. Using the authentication token from AWS, WorkSpaces Applications authorizes the user and
    presents applications to the browser.

7. The user chooses an application and, depending on the Windows login
    authentication method that is enabled on the WorkSpaces Applications stack, they're prompted to
    enter their Active Directory domain password or choose a smart card. If both
    authentication methods are enabled, the user can choose whether to enter their
    domain password or use their smart card. Certificate-based authentication can
    also be used to authenticate users, removing the prompt.

8. The domain controller is contacted for user authentication.

9. After being authenticated with the domain, the user's session starts with
    domain connectivity.

From the user's perspective, this process is transparent. The user starts by
navigating to your organization's internal portal and is redirected to an WorkSpaces Applications
application portal, without having to enter AWS credentials. Only an Active Directory
domain password or smart card credentials are required.

Before a user can initiate this process, you must configure Active Directory with the
required entitlements and Group Policy settings and create a domain-joined application
stack.
