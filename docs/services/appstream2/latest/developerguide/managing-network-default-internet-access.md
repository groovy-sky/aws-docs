# Configure a New or Existing VPC with a Public Subnet

If you created your Amazon Web Services account after 2013-12-04, you have a [default VPC](default-vpc-with-public-subnet.md) in each AWS Region that includes default public subnets. However, you may want to create your own nondefault VPC or configure an existing VPC to use with WorkSpaces Applications. This topic describes how to configure a nondefault VPC and public subnet to use with WorkSpaces Applications.

After you configure your VPC and public subnet, you can provide your streaming
instances (fleet instances and image builders) with access to the internet by
enabling the **Default Internet Access** option. When you enable
this option, WorkSpaces Applications enables internet connectivity by associating an [Elastic IP address](../../../ec2/latest/windowsguide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.md)
to the network interface that is attached from the streaming instance to your public
subnet. An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address that is reachable from the
internet. For this reason, we recommend that you instead use a NAT gateway to
provide internet access to your WorkSpaces Applications instances. In addition, when
**Default Internet Access** is enabled, a maximum of 100 fleet
instances is supported. If your deployment must support more than 100 concurrent
users, use the [NAT gateway\
configuration](managing-network-internet-nat-gateway.md) instead.

For more information, see
the steps in [Configure a VPC with Private Subnets and a NAT Gateway](managing-network-internet-nat-gateway.md). For additional VPC configuration recommendations, see [VPC Setup Recommendations](vpc-setup-recommendations.md).

## Step 1: Configure a VPC with a Public Subnet

You can configure your own non-default VPC with a public subnet by using either of the following methods:

- [Create a New VPC with a Single Public Subnet](#new-vpc-with-public-subnet)

- [Configure an Existing VPC](#existing-vpc-with-public-subnet)

###### Note

When working with IPv6 only subnets, default internet access cannot be enabled. You'll need to set up an Egress-Only Internet Gateway and configure route table to allow outbound internet traffic. For more information check the [steps](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/egress-only-internet-gateway.md). You also need to enable auto-assign IPv6 addresses for your subnets. The Egress-Only gateway handles outbound internet traffic only so if you need inbound access, you'll still need a regular internet gateway. You can find more details about this in [egress only internet gateway documentation](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/egress-only-internet-gateway.md).

### Create a New VPC with a Single Public Subnet

When you use the VPC wizard to create a new VPC, the wizard creates an internet gateway and a custom route table that is associated with the public subnet. The route table routes all traffic destined for an address outside the VPC to the internet gateway. For more information about this configuration, see [VPC with a Single Public Subnet](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-scenario1.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

1. Complete the steps in [Step 1: Create the VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/getting-started-ipv4.md#getting-started-create-vpc) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_ to create your
    VPC.

2. To enable your fleet instances and image builders to access the internet, complete the steps in [Step 2: Enable Default Internet Access Your Fleet, Image Builder, or App Block Builder](#managing-network-enable-default-internet-access).

### Configure an Existing VPC

If you want to use an existing VPC that does not have a public
subnet, you can add a new public subnet. In addition to a public subnet, you
must also have an internet gateway attached to your VPC and a route table
that routes all traffic destined for an address outside the VPC to the
internet gateway. To configure these components, complete the following
steps.

1. To add a public subnet, complete the steps in [Creating a Subnet in Your VPC](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.md#AddaSubnet). Use the
    existing VPC that you plan to use with WorkSpaces Applications.

If your VPC is configured to support IPv6 addressing, the **IPv6 CIDR block** list displays. Select **Don't assign Ipv6**.

2. To create and attach an internet gateway to your VPC,
    complete the steps in [Creating and Attaching an Internet Gateway](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-internet-gateway.md#Add_IGW_Attach_Gateway).

3. To configure your subnet to route internet traffic
    through the internet gateway, complete the steps in
    [Creating a Custom Route Table](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-internet-gateway.md#Add_IGW_Routing). In step 5, for **Destination**, use IPv4 format ( `0.0.0.0/0`).

4. To enable your fleet instances and image builders to access the internet, complete the steps in [Step 2: Enable Default Internet Access Your Fleet, Image Builder, or App Block Builder](#managing-network-enable-default-internet-access).

## Step 2: Enable Default Internet Access Your Fleet, Image Builder, or App Block Builder

After you configure a VPC that has a public subnet, you can enable the **Default Internet**
**Access** option for your fleet and image builder.

### Enable Default Internet Access for a Fleet

You can enable the **Default Internet Access** option
when you create the fleet, or later.

###### Note

For fleet instances that have the **Default Internet Access** option enabled, the limit is 100.

###### To enable internet access at fleet creation

1. Complete the steps in [Create a Fleet in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-create.md) up to
    **Step 4: Configure Network**.

2. Select the **Default Internet Access** check box.

3. If the subnet fields are empty, select a subnet for
    **Subnet 1** and, optionally, **Subnet**
**2**.

4. Continue with the steps in [Create a Fleet in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-create.md).

###### To enable internet access after fleet creation

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Fleets**.

2. Select a fleet and verify that its state is
    **Stopped**.

3. Choose **Fleet Details**, **Edit**, then select the
    **Default Internet Access** check box.

4. Choose a subnet for **Subnet 1** and, optionally,
    **Subnet 2**. Choose
    **Update**.

You can test internet connectivity by starting your fleet, creating a stack,
associating the fleet with a stack, and browsing the internet within a streaming session
for stack. For more information, see [Create an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Fleet and Stack](set-up-stacks-fleets.md).

### Enable Default Internet Access for an Image Builder

After you configure a VPC that has a public subnet, you can enable the
**Default Internet Access** option for your image
builder. You can do so when you create the image builder.

###### To enable internet access for an image builder

1. Complete the steps in [Launch an Image Builder to Install and Configure Streaming Applications](tutorial-image-builder-create.md) up to
    **Step 3: Configure Network**.

2. Select the **Default Internet Access** check box.

3. If **Subnet 1** is empty, select a subnet.

4. Continue with the steps in [Launch an Image Builder to Install and Configure Streaming Applications](tutorial-image-builder-create.md).

### Enable Default Internet Access for an App Block Builder

After you configure a VPC that has a public subnet, you can enable the
**Default Internet Access** option for your app block
builder. You can do so when you create the app block builder.

###### To enable internet access for an app block builder

1. Follow the steps in [Create an App Block Builder](create-app-block-builder.md), up to **Step 2: Configure Network**.

2. Select the **Default Internet Access** check box.

3. If **Subnet** is empty, select a
    subnet.

4. Continue with the steps in [Create an App Block Builder](create-app-block-builder.md).
