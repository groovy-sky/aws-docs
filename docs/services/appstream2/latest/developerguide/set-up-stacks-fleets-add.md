# Provide Access to Users in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

After you create a stack with an associated fleet, you can provide access to users
through the WorkSpaces Applications user pool, SAML 2.0 \[single sign-on (SSO)\], or the WorkSpaces Applications API. For
more information, see [User Pool Administration in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](user-pool-admin.md)
and [Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Integration with SAML 2.0](external-identity-providers.md).

###### Note

Users in the WorkSpaces Applications user pool can't be assigned to stacks with fleets that are
joined to an Active Directory domain.

After you provide your users with access to WorkSpaces Applications, they can start WorkSpaces Applications streaming
sessions by using a web browser or by using the WorkSpaces Applications client application for a
supported device. If you provide access to users through the WorkSpaces Applications user pool, they must
use a web browser for streaming sessions. If you use SAML 2.0 or the WorkSpaces Applications API, you can
make the WorkSpaces Applications client available to them. The WorkSpaces Applications client is a native application that
is designed for users who require additional functionality during their WorkSpaces Applications streaming
sessions. For more information, see [Provide Access Through the WorkSpaces Applications Client](client-application.md).
