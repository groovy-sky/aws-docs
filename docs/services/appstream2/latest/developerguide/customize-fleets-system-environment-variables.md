# Change System Environment Variables
<a name="customize-fleets-system-environment-variables"></a>

Follow these steps to change system environment variables across your fleet instances.

**To change system environment variables on an image builder**

This procedure applies only to system environment variables, not user environment variables. To change user environment variables that persist across your fleet instances, perform the steps in the next procedure.

1. Connect to the image builder on which to change system environment variables and sign in with an account that has local administrator permissions. To do so, do either of the following:
   + [Use the WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)
   + [Create a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-URL.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client connections)
**Note**
If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to an Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart card sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications client for the connection. For information about smart card sign in, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-USB-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

1. Choose the Windows **Start** button, open the context (right-click) menu for **Computer**, and then choose **Properties**.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Advanced system settings**.

1. In **System variables**, change the environment variables that you want to persist across your fleet instances, and then choose** OK**.

1. On the image builder desktop, open Image Assistant.

1. Follow the necessary steps in Image Assistant to finish creating your image. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

   The changes to the system environment variables persist across your fleet instances and are available to streaming sessions launched from those instances.
**Note**
Setting AWS CLI credentials as system environment variables might prevent WorkSpaces Applications from creating the image.
