# End User Certificates
<a name="certificate-based-authentication-manage-certs"></a>

End user certificates issued by AWS Private CA for WorkSpaces Applications certificate-based authentication don't require renewal or revocation. These certificates are short-lived. WorkSpaces Applications automatically issues a new certificate for each new session, or every 24 hours for sessions with a long duration. The WorkSpaces Applications session governs the use of these end user certificates. If you end a session, WorkSpaces Applications stops using that certificate. These end user certificates have a shorter validity period than a typical AWS Private CA CRL distribution. As a result, end user certificates don't need to be revoked and won't appear in a CRL.
