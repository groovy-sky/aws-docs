# Constants, Functions, and Events for Embedded Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Sessions
<a name="constants-functions-events-embedded-sessions"></a>

The following topics provide reference information for constants, functions, and events that you can use to configure embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions.

**Topics**
+ [Working with `HIDDEN_ELEMENTS`](#constants-hidden-elements)
+ [Functions for the `AppStream.Embed` Object](#functions-embed-object)
+ [Events for Embedded WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Sessions](#events-embedded-streaming-sessions)
+ [Examples for Adding Event Listeners and Ending an Embedded WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Session](#examples-add-event-listeners-end-embedded-streaming-session)

The following WorkSpaces Applications user interface elements can be passed into the `HIDDEN_ELEMENTS` configuration option when an embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming session is initialized.

## Working with `HIDDEN_ELEMENTS`
<a name="constants-hidden-elements"></a>

The following WorkSpaces Applications user interface elements can be passed as constants into the `HIDDEN_ELEMENTS` configuration option when an embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming session is initialized.

```
AppStream.Embed.Elements.TOOLBAR
AppStream.Embed.Elements.FULLSCREEN_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.END_SESSION_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.TOOLBAR
AppStream.Embed.Elements.CATALOG_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.WINDOW_SWITCHER_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.FILES_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.CLIPBOARD_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.COPY_LOCAL_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.PASTE_REMOTE_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.SETTINGS_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.STREAMING_MODE_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.SCREEN_RESOLUTION_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.REGIONAL_SETTINGS_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.FULLSCREEN_BUTTON
AppStream.Embed.Elements.END_SESSION_BUTTON
```

The following three elements can be passed as strings into HIDDEN\_ELEMENTS, rather than as constants.

| String | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 'adminCommandsButton' | When you are connected to an WorkSpaces Applications image builder, the Admin Commands button displays on the top right corner of the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar. Passing this string into HIDDEN\_ELEMENTS hides the Admin Commands button. |
| 'softKeyboardButton' | During WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions on touch-enabled devices, users can tap the keyboard icon on the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar to display the on-screen keyboard. Passing this string into HIDDEN\_ELEMENTS hides the keyboard icon. |
| 'keyboardShortcutsButton' | During WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions on touch-enabled devices, users can tap the Fn icon on the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar to display keyboard shortcuts. Passing this string into HIDDEN\_ELEMENTS hides the Fn icon. |

## Functions for the `AppStream.Embed` Object
<a name="functions-embed-object"></a>

The following table lists the functions that can be performed on the `AppStream.Embed` object.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AppStream.Embed(containerId:string, options:object) | The AppStream.Embed object constructor. This constructor initializes and communicates with the AppStream.Embed object, and it uses a div container ID. The ID is used to inject the iframe. It also injects an object that includes the configuration options for appstreamOptions ({{sessionURL}} and HIDDEN\_ELEMENTS).  |
| endSession() | This function ends the streaming session, but does not destroy the iframe. If you specify a redirect URL, the iframe attempts to load the URL. Depending on the CORS headers of the page, the URL may not load.  |
| launchApp(appId:string) | This function programmatically launches an application with the application ID that was specified during image creation.  |
| launchAppSwitcher() | This function sends the AppSwitcher command to the WorkSpaces Applications portal. This triggers the AppSwitcher command on the instance.  |
| getSessionState() | This function returns an object for sessionStatus. For more information, see [Events for Embedded WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Sessions](#events-embedded-streaming-sessions).  |
| getUserInterfaceState() | This function returns an object for `UserInterfaceState`. The object contains the key-value pairs for the following: <br />`sessionStatus`: State enumeration<br />`sessionTerminationReason`: String<br />`sessionDisconnectionReason`: String<br /> For more information, see [Events for Embedded WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Sessions](#events-embedded-streaming-sessions). |
| addEventListener(name, callback) | This function adds a callback function to call when the specified event is triggered. For a list of the events that can be triggered, see [Events for Embedded WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Sessions](#events-embedded-streaming-sessions).  |
| removeEventListener(name, callback) | This function removes the callback for the specified events.  |
| destroy() | This function deletes the iframe and cleans up resources. This function does not affect streaming sessions that are in progress.  |

## Events for Embedded WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Sessions
<a name="events-embedded-streaming-sessions"></a>

The following table lists the events that can be triggered during embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions.

| Event | Data | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION\_STATE\_CHANGE | `sessionStatus`: `State enumeration`<br />`sessionTerminationReason`: String<br />`sessionDisconnectionReason`: String | This event is triggered when any session state change occurs. The event includes a map of the states that changed. To retrieve the full session state, use the `getSessionState()` function.<br />Following are the session states:<br />`AppStream.Embed.SessionStatus.Unknown` — The session has not started and is not reserved<br />`AppStream.Embed.SessionStatus.Reserved` — The session is reserved but has not started. <br />`AppStream.Embed.SessionStatus.Started` — The user connected to the session and started streaming.<br />`AppStream.Embed.SessionStatus Disconnected `— The user disconnected from the session.<br />`AppStream.Embed.SessionStatus.Ended` — The session was marked as ended or expired. |
| AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION\_INTERFACE\_STATE\_CHANGE | `hiddenElements`: Array of strings<br /> `isFullscreen`: Boolean<br />`isSoftKeyboardVisible`: Boolean | This event is triggered when any session state change occurs. The event includes a map of the states that changed. To retrieve the full session state, use the getSessionState() function. |
| AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION\_ERROR | `errorCode`: Number<br />`errorMessage`: String | This event is triggered when any errors occur during a session. |

## Examples for Adding Event Listeners and Ending an Embedded WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Session
<a name="examples-add-event-listeners-end-embedded-streaming-session"></a>

The examples in this section show how to do the following:
+ Add event listeners for embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions.
+ Programmatically end an embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming session.

### Example 1: Add event listeners for embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions
<a name="example-add-event-listeners"></a>

To add event listeners for session state changes, session interface state changes, and session errors during embedded streaming sessions, use the following code:

```
appstreamEmbed.addEventListener(AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION_STATE_CHANGE, updateSessionStateCallback);

appstreamEmbed.addEventListener(AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION_INTERFACE_STATE_CHANGE, updateUserInterfaceStateCallback);

appstreamEmbed.addEventListener(AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION_ERROR, errorCallback);
```

In this example, `AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION_STATE_CHANGE`, `AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION_INTERFACE_STATE_CHANGE`, and `AppStream.Embed.Events.SESSION_ERROR` are event names.

The `updateSessionStateCallback`, `updateUserInterfaceStateCallback`, and `errorCallback` functions are ones that you implement. These functions are passed into the `addEventListener` function and called when an event is triggered.

### Example 2: Programmatically end an embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming session
<a name="programmatically-end-embedded-streaming-session"></a>

To end an embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, use the following function:

```
appstreamEmbed.endSession();
```
