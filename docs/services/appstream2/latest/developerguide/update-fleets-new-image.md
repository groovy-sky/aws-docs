# Update an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Fleet

You can make updates to an existing WorkSpaces Applications fleet.

When you create a new WorkSpaces Applications image, you must update your Always-On and On-Demand fleets to
make the applications and data on the new image available to users. If your update is minor
(for example, patching applications or the operating system), you can update your running
fleet. When new streaming instances are created, they are created from the updated image.
Changing the image on a running fleet does not disrupt users who have active streaming
sessions. Unused streaming instances are replaced periodically, while streaming instances
that users are connected to are terminated after the streaming sessions are finished.

You can update a fleet with a new image that runs the same operating system when the fleet
is in a **Running** or **Stopped** state. However, you can
update a fleet with a new image that runs a different operating system only when the fleet
is in a **Stopped** state.

###### Note

The application catalog that WorkSpaces Applications displays to users is based on the current image
that is associated with the fleet. If the updated image contains applications that are
not specified in the older image, the applications may not launch if the user streams
from an instance that is based on the older image.
