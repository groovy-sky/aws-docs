# Streaming URL (Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Client or Browser Connection)
<a name="connect-app-block-builder-streaming"></a>

You can create a streaming URL to connect to an app block builder through a browser or the WorkSpaces Applications client. Unlike a streaming URL that you create to enable user access to a fleet instance, which is valid for a maximum of seven days, by default, a streaming URL that you create to access an image builder expires after one hour. To set a different expiration time, you must generate the streaming URL by using the [CreateAppBlockBuilderStreamingURL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAppBlockBuilderStreamingURL.html) API action.

**Note**
Streaming a URL to connect to an app block builder is not supported on the macOS client.

You can create a streaming URL in any of the following ways:
+ WorkSpaces Applications console
+ The [CreateAppBlockBuilderStreamingURL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAppBlockBuilderStreamingURL.html) API action
+ The [create-app-block-builder-streaming-url](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/appstream/create-app-block-builder-streaming-url.html) AWS CLI command

To create a streaming URL and connect to the app block builder by using the WorkSpaces Applications console, complete the steps in the following procedure.
