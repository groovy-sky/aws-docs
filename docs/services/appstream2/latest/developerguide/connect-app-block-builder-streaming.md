# Streaming URL (Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Client or Browser Connection)

You can create a streaming URL to connect to an app block builder through a
browser or the WorkSpaces Applications client. Unlike a streaming URL that you create to enable
user access to a fleet instance, which is valid for a maximum of seven days, by
default, a streaming URL that you create to access an image builder expires
after one hour. To set a different expiration time, you must generate the
streaming URL by using the [CreateAppBlockBuilderStreamingURL](../../../../reference/appstream2/latest/apireference/api-createappblockbuilderstreamingurl.md) API action.

###### Note

Streaming a URL to connect to an app block builder is not supported on the
macOS client.

You can create a streaming URL in any of the following ways:

- WorkSpaces Applications console

- The [CreateAppBlockBuilderStreamingURL](../../../../reference/appstream2/latest/apireference/api-createappblockbuilderstreamingurl.md) API action

- The [create-app-block-builder-streaming-url](../../../cli/latest/reference/appstream/create-app-block-builder-streaming-url.md) AWS CLI command

To create a streaming URL and connect to the app block builder by using the WorkSpaces Applications
console, complete the steps in the following procedure.
