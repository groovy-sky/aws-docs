# Configure a VPC with Private Subnets and a NAT Gateway

If you plan to provide your streaming instances (fleet instances, app block
builders, and image builders) with access to the internet, we recommend that you
configure a VPC with two private subnets for your streaming instances and a NAT
gateway in a public subnet. You can create and configure a new VPC to use with a NAT
gateway, or add a NAT gateway to an existing VPC. For additional VPC configuration
recommendations, see [VPC Setup Recommendations](vpc-setup-recommendations.md).

The NAT gateway lets the streaming instances in your private subnets connect to the
internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating a
connection with those instances. In addition, unlike configurations that use the **Default Internet Access** option for enabling internet access for WorkSpaces Applications streaming instances, this configuration is not limited to 100 fleet instances.

For information about using NAT Gateways and this configuration, see [NAT Gateways](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.md) and [VPC with Public and Private Subnets (NAT)](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-scenario2.md) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.
