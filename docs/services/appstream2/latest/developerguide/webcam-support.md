# Enabling and Disabling Webcam Support

WorkSpaces Applications supports real-time audio-video (AV) by redirecting local webcam video input to
WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions. This capability enables your users to use their local webcam
for video and audio conferencing within an WorkSpaces Applications streaming session. With real-time AV
and support for real-time audio, your users can collaborate by using familiar video and
audio conferencing applications without having to leave their WorkSpaces Applications streaming
session.

To use this feature, you must use a Linux WorkSpaces Applications image that uses a Linux WorkSpaces Applications agent
released on or after September 21, 2022.

###### Note

Real-time AV is not supported for stream.standard.small instances powered by Rocky
Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Users don't see the Camera and Mic icons on the
client toolbar.

The real-time AV feature is enabled by default for Linux streaming sessions. To
configure webcam permissions for your users on a Linux image builder, create
`/etc/appstream/appstream.conf` and add the following
contents:

###### Note

Specify `1` to enable webcam, or `0` to
disable webcam.

```

[webcam]
permission = 1
```
