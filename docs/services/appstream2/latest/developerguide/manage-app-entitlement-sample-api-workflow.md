# Example API Operations Work Flow for the Dynamic Application Framework

The following diagram is an example of the API operations flow between WorkSpaces Applications and
a third-party application provider.

1. The user connects to WorkSpaces Applications. A fleet streaming instance is assigned to the
    user and Windows login occurs.

2. Your service or agent detects the Windows logon event and determines the
    user who is logging in to Windows.

3. The service or agent fetches the application entitlements for the user. In
    the example diagram, the application entitlements are stored in a database.
    This information can be stored and retrieved in different ways. For example,
    application entitlements may be fetched from server software, or group names
    in Active Directory may be parsed to locate the application identifiers
    (IDs).

4. Your dynamic app provider calls the WorkSpaces Applications agent
    `AddApplications` API operation with the application metadata
    for the applications that the user should have.

5. The WorkSpaces Applications agent dynamically updates the application catalog with the
    modified application list.

6. The user selects an application to launch.

7. The application is launched by using the application metadata specified by
    your service or agent.

From the user’s perspective, the process happens transparently. The user connects
to WorkSpaces Applications and logs in to the fleet instance. After login, the list of applications
specified in the image and provided by your dynamic app provider displays for the
user.
