# Active Directory Domain Environment

Your active directory domain environment must meet the following requirements.

- You must have a Microsoft Active Directory domain to which to join your
streaming instances. If you don't have an Active Directory domain or you
want to use your on-premises Active Directory environment, see [Active Directory Domain Services on AWS Partner Solution Deployment\
Guide](https://aws-solutions-library-samples.github.io/cfn-ps-microsoft-activedirectory).

- You must have a domain service account with permissions to create and manage
computer objects in the domain that you intend to use with WorkSpaces Applications. For
information, see [How to\
Create a Domain Account in Active Directory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa545262(v=cs.70).aspx) in the Microsoft
documentation.

When you associate this Active Directory domain with WorkSpaces Applications, provide
the service account name and password. WorkSpaces Applications uses this account to create and
manage computer objects in the directory. For more information, see [Granting Permissions to Create and Manage Active Directory Computer Objects](active-directory-permissions.md).

- When you register your Active Directory domain with WorkSpaces Applications, you must provide
an organizational unit (OU) distinguished name. Create an OU for this purpose.
The default Computers container is not an OU and cannot be used by WorkSpaces Applications. For
more information, see [Finding the Organizational Unit Distinguished Name](active-directory-oudn.md).

- The directories that you plan to use with WorkSpaces Applications must be accessible through
their fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) through the virtual private cloud
(VPC) in which your streaming instances are launched. For more information, see
[Active Directory and Active Directory Domain Services Port\
Requirements](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772723.aspx) in the Microsoft documentation.

- Domain controller access can also be supported over IPv6, and require [DHCP options set updates](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dhcp-options.md).
