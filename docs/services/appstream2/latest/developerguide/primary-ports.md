<a name="primary_ports"></a>

Follow the guidance below for customer network interface ports.
+ For internet connectivity, the following ports must be open to all destinations. If you are using a modified or custom security group, you need to add the required rules manually. For more information, see [Security Group Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SecurityGroupRules) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.
  + TCP 80 (HTTP)
  + TCP 443 (HTTPS)
  + UDP 8433
+ If you join your streaming instances to a directory, the following ports must be open between your WorkSpaces Applications VPC and your directory controllers.
  + TCP/UDP 53 - DNS
  + TCP/UDP 88 - Kerberos authentication
  + UDP 123 - NTP
  + TCP 135 - RPC
  + UDP 137-138 - Netlogon
  + TCP 139 - Netlogon
  + TCP/UDP 389 - LDAP
  + TCP/UDP 445 - SMB
  + TCP 1024-65535 - Dynamic ports for RPC

  For a complete list of ports, see [Active Directory and Active Directory Domain Services Port Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd772723(v=ws.10)) in the Microsoft documentation.
+ All streaming instances require that port 80 (HTTP) be open to IP address `169.254.169.254` to allow access to the EC2 metadata service. The IP address range `169.254.0.0/16` is reserved for WorkSpaces Applications service usage for management traffic. Failure to exclude this range might result in streaming issues.
