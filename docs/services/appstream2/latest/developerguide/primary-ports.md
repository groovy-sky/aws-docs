# Customer Network Interface Ports in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

Follow the guidance below for customer network interface ports.

- For internet connectivity, the following ports must be open to all
destinations. If you are using a modified or custom security group, you need
to add the required rules manually. For more information, see
[Security Group Rules](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-securitygroups.md#SecurityGroupRules) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- TCP 80 (HTTP)

- TCP 443 (HTTPS)

- UDP 8433

- If you join your streaming instances to a directory, the following ports must be
open between your WorkSpaces Applications VPC and your directory controllers.

- TCP/UDP 53 - DNS

- TCP/UDP 88 - Kerberos authentication

- UDP 123 - NTP

- TCP 135 - RPC

- UDP 137-138 - Netlogon

- TCP 139 - Netlogon

- TCP/UDP 389 - LDAP

- TCP/UDP 445 - SMB

- TCP 1024-65535 - Dynamic ports for RPC

For a complete list of ports, see [Active Directory and Active Directory Domain Services Port\
Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd772723(v=ws.10)) in the Microsoft documentation.

- All streaming instances require that port 80 (HTTP) be open to IP address
`169.254.169.254` to allow access to the EC2 metadata
service. The IP address range `169.254.0.0/16` is reserved for
WorkSpaces Applications service usage for management traffic. Failure to exclude this range
might result in streaming issues.
