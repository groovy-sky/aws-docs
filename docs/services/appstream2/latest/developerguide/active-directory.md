# Using Active Directory with WorkSpaces Applications
<a name="active-directory"></a>

You can join your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Always-On and On-Demand Windows fleets and image builders to domains in Microsoft Active Directory and use your existing Active Directory domains, either cloud-based or on-premises, to launch domain-joined streaming instances. You can also use AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, to create an Active Directory domain and use that to support your WorkSpaces Applications resources. For more information about using AWS Managed Microsoft AD, see [Microsoft Active Directory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*.

**Note**
Amazon Linux 2 fleets, image builders, elastic fleets, and app block builders currently do not support domain join.

**Active Directory trust requirements**
WorkSpaces Applications supports only two-way (bidirectional) trusts between the user domain and the WorkSpaces Applications computer object domain. Selective authentication may be used if WorkSpaces Applications computer objects are allowed to authenticate to the user domain, gather the user's security identifier (SID), and translate the user principal name (UPN) to the Security Account Manager account name (SAMAccountName).

By joining WorkSpaces Applications to your Active Directory domain, you can:
+ Allow your users and applications to access Active Directory resources such as printers and file shares from streaming sessions.
+ Use Group Policy settings that are available in the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to define the end user experience.
+ Stream applications that require users to be authenticated using their Active Directory login credentials.
+ Apply your enterprise compliance and security policies to your WorkSpaces Applications streaming instances.
