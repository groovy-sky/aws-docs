Before enabling Google Drive, you must do the following:
+ Have an active Google Workspace account with a valid organizational domain and users in the domain to use with WorkSpaces Applications.
+ Configure an WorkSpaces Applications stack with an associated fleet.

   The fleet must use an image that uses a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent released on or after May 31, 2018. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Agent Release Notes](agent-software-versions.md). The fleet must also have access to the internet.
+ Add Amazon WorkSpaces Applications as a trusted app in one or more domains associated with your Google Workspace account. You can enable Google Drive for up to 10 domains.
+ Have a Windows-based stack. (Linux-based stacks are not supported).
