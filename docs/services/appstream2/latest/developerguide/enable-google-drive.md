# Enable Google Drive for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users

Before enabling Google Drive, you must do the following:

- Have an active Google Workspace account with a valid organizational domain
and users in the domain to use with WorkSpaces Applications.

- Configure an WorkSpaces Applications stack with an associated fleet.

The fleet must use an image that uses a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent
released on or after May 31, 2018. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Agent Release Notes](agent-software-versions.md). The fleet must also have access to
the internet.

- Add Amazon WorkSpaces Applications as a trusted app in one or more domains associated with
your Google Workspace account. You can enable Google Drive for up to 10
domains.

- Have a Windows-based stack. (Linux-based stacks are not supported).

Follow these steps to add Amazon WorkSpaces Applications as a trusted app in your Google Workspace
domains.
