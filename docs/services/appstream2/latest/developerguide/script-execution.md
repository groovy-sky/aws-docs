The following diagrams indicate where in the process the setup script runs. The run order is dependent upon whether Application Settings Persistence is enabled on the stack associated with the elastic fleet.

**Note**
WorkSpaces Applications uses your VPC details to download the VHD and setup script from the Amazon S3 bucket. Your VPC must provide access to the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 VPC Endpoints for WorkSpaces Applications Features](managing-network-vpce-iam-policy.md).
