# Protecting Data in Transit with FIPS Endpoints
<a name="protecting-data-in-transit-FIPS-endpoints"></a>

By default, when you communicate with the WorkSpaces Applications service, whether as an administrator using the WorkSpaces Applications console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or an AWS SDK, or as a user streaming from an image builder or a fleet instance, all data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2.

If you require FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. WorkSpaces Applications offers FIPS endpoints in all United States AWS Regions where WorkSpaces Applications is available. When you use a FIPS endpoint, all data in transit is encrypted using cryptographic standards that comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3. For information about FIPS endpoints, including a list of WorkSpaces Applications endpoints, see [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips).
