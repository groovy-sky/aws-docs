# Disable Home Folders
<a name="home-folders-admin-disabling"></a>

You can disable home folders for a stack without losing user content already stored in home folders. Disabling home folders for a stack has the following effects:
+ Users who are connected to active streaming sessions for the stack receive an error message. They are informed that they can no longer store content in their home folder.
+ Home folders do not appear for any new sessions that use the stack with home folders disabled.
+ Disabling home folders for one stack does not disable it for other stacks.
+ Even if home folders are disabled for all stacks, WorkSpaces Applications does not delete the user content.

To restore access to home folders for the stack, enable home folders again by following the steps described earlier in this topic.

**To disable home folders while creating a stack**
+ Follow the steps in [Create a Stack in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-install.md) and make sure that the **Enable Home Folders** option is cleared.

**To disable home folders for an existing stack**

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Stacks**, and select the stack.

1. Below the stacks list, choose **Storage** and clear **Enable Home Folders**.

1. In the **Disable Home Folders** dialog box, type `CONFIRM` (case-sensitive) to confirm your choice, then choose **Disable**.
