# Disable Home Folders

You can disable home folders for a stack without losing user content already
stored in home folders. Disabling home folders for a stack has the following
effects:

- Users who are connected to active streaming sessions for the stack
receive an error message. They are informed that they can no longer
store content in their home folder.

- Home folders do not appear for any new sessions that use the stack
with home folders disabled.

- Disabling home folders for one stack does not disable it for other
stacks.

- Even if home folders are disabled for all stacks, WorkSpaces Applications does not
delete the user content.

To restore access to home folders for the stack, enable home folders again by
following the steps described earlier in this topic.

###### To disable home folders while creating a stack

- Follow the steps in [Create a Stack in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-install.md) and make sure that the
**Enable Home Folders** option is cleared.
