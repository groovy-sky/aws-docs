# Network Interfaces in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications
<a name="network-interfaces"></a>

Each WorkSpaces Applications streaming instance has the following network interfaces:
+ The customer network interface provides connectivity to the resources within your VPC, as well as the internet, and is used to join the streaming instance to your directory.
+ The management network interface is connected to a secure WorkSpaces Applications management network. It is used for interactive streaming of the streaming instance to a user's device, and to allow WorkSpaces Applications to manage the streaming instance.

WorkSpaces Applications selects the IP address for the management network interface from the following private IP address range: 198.19.0.0/16. Do not use this range for your VPC CIDR or peer your VPC with another VPC with this range, as this might create a conflict and cause streaming instances to be unreachable. Also, do not modify or delete any of the network interfaces attached to a streaming instance, as this might also cause the streaming instance to become unreachable.
