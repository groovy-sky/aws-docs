# Unsupported Applications

Applications might encounter failures when installing or running in the following
scenarios:

- **Applications requiring reboots after**
**installation**: If an application needs to perform additional
changes or configurations after installation that require a reboot, it
might fail. Currently, app block builder does not support restart, which
can prevent the application from completing its required
post-installation steps.

- **Applications relying on user-specific details**:
Applications that are intended to be installed only for the currently
logged-in user on app block builder, or that rely on the logged-in user
details on app block builder, such as security identifiers (SIDs) during
installation, might not function correctly on Elastic fleets. This is
due to the logged-in user changes within the elastic fleet environment.
Additionally, application redirection does not record all directories
under %USERPROFILE%. However, you have the option to configure post
setup scripts to dynamically change your application configuration based
on environment.

- **Applications relying on machine-specific details**:
Applications that rely on machine-specific details on app block builder
during installation, such as network adaptor GUID, might encounter
issues on Eastic fleets. This is because the machine details, including
network adaptor GUIDs, can change within the elastic fleet environment.
To address this, you can configure the post setup scripts to handle the
configuration of those machine-specific details.

If you are uncertain whether your application falls into any of these
categories, you can use WorkSpaces Applications packaging to create an app block. This process
involves installing your application(s) on an app block builder instance. In the
event that your application(s) fail to install on the app block builder
instance, you can take the following actions:

- Check the logs. The error log file for your app block builder instance can be
found at C:\\AppStream\\AppBlocks\\errorLog. This log records all installation
failures, including registry keys and file operation processing. If you see
any of the following logs in the errorLog, it indicates that the packaging
of your application is currently unsupported by the WorkSpaces Applications app block
builder:

- "Unable to create symbolic link"

- "Service doesn't support file renaming"

If there is no errorLog file, or if this file is empty, then check
your application installation logs to identify the reason for failures.

- Report a problem. Select the **Report a problem** button,
which is available on the application builder assistant in the app block
builder. Selecting this option will gather all the WorkSpaces Applications logs from your app
block builder instance, and submit them to the WorkSpaces Applications team.

- Create an app block with custom packaging: If you are unable to package your
applications using the app block builder, you can try to create an app block
using custom packaging methods. For more information, see [Custom App Blocks](custom-app-blocks.md).

- If you need more help, contact AWS Support. For more information, see [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

It is important to consider these potential limitations, and plan accordingly
when using WorkSpaces Applications packaging for your applications.
