# Infrastructure Security in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

As a managed service, Amazon WorkSpaces Applications is protected by AWS global network security. For
information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security). To design your AWS
environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure\
Protection](../../../wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.md) in _Security Pillar AWS Well‐Architected_
_Framework_.

You use AWS published API calls to access WorkSpaces Applications through the network. Clients must
support the following:

- Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems
such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

The following topics provide additional information about WorkSpaces Applications infrastructure security.
