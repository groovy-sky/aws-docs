# Update the App Block, VHD, and Setup Script

App block resources are immutable and do not allow you to change them once
created. If you need to make backwards compatible updates to the VHD or setup
script, it is recommended that you upload a new version of the file to the Amazon S3
bucket, overwriting the current version. New Elastic fleet streaming sessions will
download the latest version of the objects, and use them.

If you need to make backwards incompatible updates to the VHD or setup script, it
is recommended that you upload them as new objects to the Amazon S3 bucket, and create a
new app block and application resource. You can then manage the deployment to your
users as part of a change window or other outage.
