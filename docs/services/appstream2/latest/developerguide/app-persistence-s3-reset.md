# Reset a User's Application Settings
<a name="app-persistence-s3-reset"></a>

To reset a user's application settings, you must find and delete the VHD and associated metadata file from the S3 bucket in your AWS account. Make sure that you do not do this during a user's active streaming session. After you delete the user's VHD and the metadata file, the next time the user launches a session from a streaming instance that has application settings persistence enabled, WorkSpaces Applications creates a new settings VHD for that user.

**To reset a user's application settings**

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).

1. In the **Bucket name** list, choose the S3 bucket that contains the application settings VHD that you want to reset.

1. Locate the folder that contains the VHD. For more information about how to navigate the S3 bucket folder structure, see *Amazon S3 Bucket Storage* earlier in this topic.

1. In the **Name** list, select the check box next to the VHD and the REG, choose **More**, and then choose **Delete**.

1. In the **Delete objects** dialog box, verify that the VHD and the REG are listed, and then choose **Delete**.

The next time the user streams from a fleet on which application settings persistence is enabled with the applicable settings group, a new application settings VHD is created. This VHD is saved to the S3 bucket at the end of the session.
