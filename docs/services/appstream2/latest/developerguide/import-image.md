# Import Image
<a name="import-image"></a>

You can create WorkSpaces Applications images by importing your customized EC2 AMIs or WorkSpaces images. Here's how it works:

1. Customize your EC2 AMI using any preferred method including [EC2 Image Builder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/).

1. Import your customized AMI or WorkSpaces images into WorkSpaces Applications to create a WorkSpaces Applications image

1. Optionally, use Image Builder for additional image customization

WorkSpaces Applications images created through EC2 AMI or WorkSpaces Windows Server image import are of `type = "custom"`. WorkSpaces Windows BYOL images import will create WorkSpaces Applications images with `type = "BYOL"`. WorkSpaces Applications provided images are of `type = "native"`.

You can use stream.\* instance types for images with `type = "native"` and `type = "BYOL"`. To use any of the following instance types, you must import your AMI and create an image with `type = "custom"`.
+ GeneralPurpose.\*
+ MemoryOptimized.\*
+ ComputeOptimized.\*
+ Accelerated.\*

**Important**
WorkSpaces images with License included applications installed are not supported. You must uninstall those applications from the image using [Manage Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/manage-applications.html) and configure those applications using [Manage License Included Applications on Your Image in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](license-included-applications.md).

## Prerequisites for EC2 AMI image import
<a name="import-image-prerequisites"></a>

All these prerequisites are important for a successful workflow execution. Supported EC2 AMI configurations and other mandatory requirements are listed below. Note these do not apply to importing WorkSpaces images, as that is managed by the WorkSpaces service.

### Required AMI Properties
<a name="required-ami-properties"></a>

EBS
+ Less or equal to 500GB size
  + You can import an AMI with < 200 GB, however, the imported image will use minimum 200GB.
+ GP2
  + You can import an AMI with gp2 or gp3 EBS volume type, however, the imported image will use gp2.
+ One volume per image
+ `/dev/sda1` Root Device Name
+ Image Type: Machine
+ Architecture: x86\_64
+ Virtualization Type: HVM

If you want to use image with graphics instances such as Accelerated.g4dn, Accelerated.g5, Accelerated.g6, Accelerated.g6e, or Accelerated.g7 you must install proper GRID driver on your AMI. For more details please refer to [Install NVIDIA GRID drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/nvidia-GRID-driver.html). If the drivers are not setup correctly the streaming will work, however, graphics card may not be available.

**Important**
"Owner Account Id" of the AMI must be your AWS account id. You cannot import a public EC2 AMI.
Perform any Windows updates and disable automatic Windows updates before importing the image.
Import of encrypted EC2 AMIs is currently not supported

### IAM Role Requirements
<a name="iam-role-requirements"></a>

**Important**
Create an IAM role with the following permissions to use for image import:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowModifyImageAttributeWithTagCondition",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:ModifyImageAttribute",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowDescribeImages",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeImages",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Add the following trust relationship for this IAM role

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "appstream.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Requirements for WorkSpaces image import
<a name="import-workspaces-image-requirements"></a>

When importing an Amazon WorkSpaces image into WorkSpaces Applications, the following operating system and protocol requirements apply:
+ Windows Server 2022 — Only WSP (WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol) images are supported. PCoIP images are not supported.
+ Windows Server 2025 — All images are supported.
+ Windows 11 — Version 24H2 or newer only.

## To import an image
<a name="import-image-procedure"></a>

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).
**Note**
Your console role will also need to include the `workspaces:DescribeWorkspaceImages` permission to import an Amazon WorkSpaces image.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Images** and then choose **Image registry**.

1. Choose **Import Image**.

1. **Image source** - choose from the below options based on what type of image you want to import
   + **AMI ID** - Enter an AMI ID for AMI that you would like to import to WorkSpaces Applications. You can also search for your AMI using this field.
   + **Amazon WorkSpaces Image** - Enter a WorkSpaces Image ID (starts with "wsi-"). You can also search for your WorkSpaces Image ID using this field.

1. **Image name** - Enter a unique name for the image that will be created because of import operation.

1. **Display name** *(Optional)* - Enter a display name for the image.

1. **Description** *(Optional)* – Enter a description for the image.

1. **IAM Role** - Select the IAM role that you have created for image import. For more details refer to [IAM Role Requirements](#iam-role-requirements).
   + Required for EC2 AMI import
   + Not applicable for WorkSpaces image import

1. **Manage WorkSpaces Applications agent** – Select this option if you want to always use the latest WorkSpaces Applications agent version, your streaming instances are automatically updated with the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates that are available from AWS when a new agent version is released.

1. **Runtime validation** *(Optional)*: Select this option and service will provision an instance with the image being imported and run streaming tests.
   +
**Note**
These streaming tests will be executed in the background, you cannot connect to this instance via WorkSpaces Applications client.
   + We recommend using this option to get higher confidence that your image is suitable for WorkSpaces Applications.
   + You will be billed for the hourly price of that instance.
   + You can avoid running runtime validation if you are re-importing your AMI after making minor changes that may not affect the streaming test, and if runtime validation passed the last time, you imported this AMI.
   + **Choose instance type** *(Optional)*: Select the right instance family, type, and size for running the streaming test. It is recommended that you use the same instance which you are planning to use for fleet creation.

1. **Applications catalog and launch performance manifest** *(Optional)*: Provide details to create applications catalog for your end users and improve the launch performance of your applications.
   + **Application catalog**: To create an application catalog specify details about the applications installed your image. For each application that you plan to stream, you can specify the name, display name, executable file to launch, and icon to display.
   + **Launch performance**: Adding files to the application optimization manifest reduces the time that it takes for the application to launch for the first time on a new fleet instance. The optimization manifest is a line-delimited text file that is per application.

   To learn more refer to [Applications Details](applications-details.md).

1. **Tags** *(Optional)* - Choose **Add Tag** and type the key and value for the tag. To add more tags, repeat this step. For more information, see [Tagging Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Resources](tagging-basic.md).

1. **Import Image** – Review all the information you have entered and choose **Import Image**. Service will run compatibility checks to make sure AMI is compatible with WorkSpaces Applications.
   + If the static checks fail, you will receive an error straight away.
   + If the static checks pass, your import request will be submitted and depending upon the options you have selected it could take 30-60 min to create a new WorkSpaces Applications image with `type = "custom"` or `type = "BYOL"`
