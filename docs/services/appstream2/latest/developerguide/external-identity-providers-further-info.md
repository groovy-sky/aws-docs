# WorkSpaces Applications Integration with SAML 2.0

The following links help you configure third-party SAML 2.0 identity provider
solutions to work with WorkSpaces Applications.

— Describes how to set up the initial federation between the
Shibboleth IdP and the AWS Management Console. You must complete the following
additional steps to enable federation to WorkSpaces Applications.

Step 4 of the
AWS Security whitepaper describes how to create IAM roles that
define the permissions that federated users have to the AWS Management Console.
After you create these roles and embed the inline policy as
described in the whitepaper, modify this policy so that it provides
federated users with permissions to access only an WorkSpaces Applications stack. To
do this, replace the existing policy with the policy noted in
_Step 3: Embed an Inline Policy for the IAM_
_Role_, in [Setting Up SAML](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md).

When you add the stack relay state URL as described
in _Step 6: Configure the Relay State of Your_
_Federation_, in [Setting Up SAML](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md),
add the relay state parameter to the federation URL as a target
request attribute. The URL must be encoded. For information about
configuring relay state parameters, see the [SAML 2.0](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/UnsolicitedSSOConfiguration) section in the Shibboleth
documentation.
