# Process Overview for Programmatically Creating an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Image
<a name="process-overview-creating-image-programmatically-image-assistant-cli"></a>

You can use the Image Assistant CLI operations with your application installation automation to create a fully programmatic WorkSpaces Applications image creation workflow. After your application installation automation completes, but before the image is created, use the Image Assistant CLI operations to specify the following:
+ The executable files that your users can launch
+ The optimization manifests for your applications
+ Other WorkSpaces Applications image metadata

The following high-level overview describes the process for programmatically creating an WorkSpaces Applications image.

1. Use your application installation automation to install the required applications on your image builder. This installation may include applications that your users will launch, any dependencies, and background applications.

1. Determine the files and folders to optimize.

1. If applicable, use the Image Assistant `add-application` CLI operation to specify the application metadata and optimization manifest for the WorkSpaces Applications image.

1. To specify additional applications for the WorkSpaces Applications image, repeat steps 1 through 3 for each application as needed.

1. If applicable, use the Image Assistant `update-default-profile` CLI operation to overwrite the default Windows profile and create default application and Windows settings for your users.

1. Use the Image Assistant `create-image` CLI operation to create the image.
