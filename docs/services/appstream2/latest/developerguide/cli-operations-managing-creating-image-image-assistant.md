# Image Assistant CLI Operations for Creating and Managing Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Image

This section describes the Image Assistant CLI operations that you can use to create
and manage your WorkSpaces Applications image.

On Windows image builders, the executable file that includes the command line
interface is located at: C:\\Program
Files\\Amazon\\Photon\\ConsoleImageBuilder\\Image-Assistant.exe. For your convenience, this
executable file is included in the Windows PATH variable. This lets you call the Image
Assistant CLI operations without specifying the absolute path to the executable file. To
call these operations, type the **image-assistant.exe** command.

On Linux image builders, the image assistant tool is located at
/usr/local/appstream/image-assistant/AppStreamImageAssistant, with a symbolic link at
/bin/AppStreamImageAssistant.

## `help` operation

Retrieves a list of all Image Assistant CLI operations. For each operation in the
list, a description and usage syntax is provided. To display help for a specific
operation, type the name of the operation and specify the
**--help** parameter. For example:

```

add-application --help
```

**Synopsis**

```

help
```

**Output**

Prints to standard out the list of available operations with a description of
their function.

## `add-application` operation

Adds the application to the application list for WorkSpaces Applications users. Applications in
this list are included in the application catalog. The application catalog displays
to users when they sign in to an WorkSpaces Applications streaming session.

###### Note

If you need to make changes to an application configuration, remove the
application and add the application with the updated settings.

**Synopsis**

```nohighlight

add-application
--name <value>
--absolute-app-path <value>
[--display-name <value>]
[--absolute-icon-path <value>]
[--working-directory <value>]
[--launch-parameters <""-escaped value>]
[--absolute-manifest-path <value>]
```

**Options**

**`--name` (string)**

A unique name for the application. The maximum length is 256
characters. You can add up to 50 applications. You cannot use whitespace
characters.

**`--absolute-app-path` (string)**

The absolute path to the executable file, batch file, or script for
the application. The path must point to a valid file.

**`--display-name` (string)**

The name to display for the application in the application catalog. If
you don't specify a display name, WorkSpaces Applications creates a name that is derived
from the executable file name. The name is created without the file
extension and with underscores in place of spaces. The maximum length is
256 characters.

**`--absolute-icon-path` (string)**

The absolute path to the icon for the application. The path must point
to a valid icon file that is one of the following types: .jpg, .png, or
.bmp. The maximum dimensions are: 256 px x 256 px. If you don't specify
a path, the default icon for the executable file is used, if available.
If a default icon is not available for the executable file, a default
WorkSpaces Applications application icon is used.

**`--working-directory` (string)**

The initial working directory for the application when the application
is launched.

**`--absolute-manifest-path` (string)**

The path to a new line-delimited text file. The file specifies the
absolute paths of the files to optimize before the fleet instance is
made available to a user for streaming. The path must point to a valid
text file.

The dynamic application framework provides operations within an WorkSpaces Applications
streaming instance that you can use to build a dynamic app provider.
Dynamic app providers can use these operations to modify the catalog of

If you don't specify either parameter, the image is pinned to the
version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent that is currently installed. For more
information, see [Manage WorkSpaces Applications Agent Versions](base-images-agent.md).

**`--tags` (string)**

The tags to associate with the image. A tag is a key-value pair. Use
