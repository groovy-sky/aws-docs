The following sections provide information about WorkSpaces Applications support for USB devices.

+ [Smart Cards](#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards)

## USB Redirection
<a name="feature-support-USB-devices-USB-redirection"></a>

USB redirection is required for most local USB devices to be used during WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions. When USB redirection is required, you must [qualify the device](qualify-usb-devices.md) before your users can use it during their WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions. After you qualify the device, users must [share the device with WorkSpaces Applications](client-application-windows-how-to-share-usb-devices-user.md). With USB redirection, during WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, users' devices are not accessible for use with local applications.

In other cases, USB devices are already enabled for use with WorkSpaces Applications and no further configuration is required. For example, smart card redirection is already enabled by default when the WorkSpaces Applications client is installed. Because USB redirection isn't used when this feature is enabled, you don't need to qualify smart card readers, and users don't need to share these devices with WorkSpaces Applications to use them during streaming sessions.

**Note**
USB redirection is currently not supported for Linux-based fleet instances, or when using the WorkSpaces Applications macOS client application.

## Smart Cards
<a name="feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards"></a>

WorkSpaces Applications supports using a smart card for Windows sign in to Active Directory-joined streaming instances and in-session authentication for streaming applications. Because smart card redirection is enabled by default, users can use smart card readers that are connected to their local computer and their smart cards without USB redirection.

### Windows Sign In and In-Session Authentication
<a name="feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards-windows-signin-in-session-auth"></a>

WorkSpaces Applications supports the use of Active Directory domain passwords or smart cards such as [Common Access Card (CAC)](https://www.cac.mil/Common-Access-Card) and [Personal Identity Verification (PIV)](https://piv.idmanagement.gov/) smart cards for Windows sign in to WorkSpaces Applications streaming instances (fleets and image builders). Your users can use smart card readers connected to their local computer and their smart cards to sign in to an WorkSpaces Applications streaming instance that is joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain. They can also use their local smart card readers and smart cards to sign in to applications within their streaming session.

To ensure that your users can use their smart cards for Windows sign in to Active Directory-joined streaming instances and for in-session authentication for streaming applications, you must:
+ Use an image that meets the following requirements:
  + The image must be created from a base image published by AWS on or after December 28, 2020. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Base Image and Managed Image Update Release Notes](base-image-version-history.md).
  + The image must use a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent released on or after January 4, 2021. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Agent Release Notes](agent-software-versions.md).
+ Enable **Smart card sign in for Active Directory** on the WorkSpaces Applications stack that your users access for streaming sessions, as described in this section.
**Note**
This setting controls only the authentication method that can be used for Windows sign in to an WorkSpaces Applications streaming instance (fleet or image builder). It doesn't control the authentication method that can be used for in-session authentication, after a user signs in to a streaming instance.
+ Ensure that your users have WorkSpaces Applications client version 1.1.257 or later installed. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Windows Client Release Notes](client-release-versions.md).

By default, password sign in for Active Directory is enabled on WorkSpaces Applications stacks. You can enable smart card sign in for Active Directory by performing the following steps in the WorkSpaces Applications console.

**To enable smart card sign in for Active Directory by using the WorkSpaces Applications console**

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Stacks**.

1. Choose the stack for which you want to enable smart card authentication for Active Directory.

1. Choose the **User Settings** tab, and then expand the **Clipboard, file transfer, print to local device, and authentication permissions** section.

1. For **Smart card sign in for Active Directory**, choose **Enabled**.

   You can also enable **Password sign in for Active Directory**, if it's not already enabled. At least one authentication method must be enabled.

1. Choose **Update**.

Alternatively, you can enable smart card sign in for Active Directory by using the WorkSpaces Applications API, an AWS SDK, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

### Smart Card Redirection
<a name="feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards-support"></a>

When the WorkSpaces Applications client is installed, smart card redirection is enabled by default. When this feature is enabled, users can use smart card readers that are connected to their local computer and their smart cards during WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions without USB redirection. During WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, users' smart card readers and smart cards remain accessible for use with local applications. The WorkSpaces Applications client redirects the smart card API calls from users’ streaming applications to their local smart card.

**Note**
Smart card redirection is currently not supported for Linux-based fleet instances or multi-session fleet instances, or when using the WorkSpaces Applications macOS client application.

**Note**
If your smart card requires middleware software to operate, the middleware software must be installed on both the user’s device, and the WorkSpaces Applications streaming instance.

You can disable smart card redirection during client installation on managed devices. For more information, see [Choose Whether to Disable Smart Card Redirection](install-client-configure-settings.md#disable-local-smart-card-support-client). If you disable smart card redirection, your users can't use their smart card reader and smart card during a WorkSpaces Applications streaming session without USB redirection. In this case, you must [qualify the device](qualify-usb-devices.md). After you qualify the device, users must [share the device with WorkSpaces Applications](client-application-windows-how-to-share-usb-devices-user.md). When smart card redirection is disabled, during users' WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, their smart card reader and smart card are not accessible for use with local applications.
