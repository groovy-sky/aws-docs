# User Connections to Amazon WorkSpaces Applications
<a name="user-connections-to-appstream2"></a>

Users can connect to WorkSpaces Applications streaming instances through the default public internet endpoint, or by using an interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) that you create in your virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information, see [Tutorial: Creating and Streaming from Interface VPC Endpoints](creating-streaming-from-interface-vpc-endpoints.md).

By default, WorkSpaces Applications is configured to route streaming connections over the public internet. Internet connectivity is required to authenticate users and deliver the web assets that WorkSpaces Applications requires to function. To allow this traffic, you must allow the domains listed in [Allowed Domains](allowed-domains.md).

**Note**
For user authentication, WorkSpaces Applications supports user pools, Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0), and the [CreateStreamingURL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStreamingURL.html) API action. For more information, see [User Authentication](authentication-authorization.md).

The following topics provide information about how to enable user connections to WorkSpaces Applications.
