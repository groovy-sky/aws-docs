# Real-Time Audio-Video

WorkSpaces Applications supports real-time audio-video (AV) by redirecting local webcam
video input to WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions. This capability enables your users
to use their local webcam for video and audio conferencing within an WorkSpaces Applications
streaming session. With real-time AV and support for real-time audio, your
users can collaborate by using familiar video and audio conferencing
applications without having to leave their WorkSpaces Applications streaming session.

When a user starts a video conference from within an WorkSpaces Applications streaming
session, WorkSpaces Applications compresses the webcam video and microphone audio input
locally before transmitting this data over a secure channel to a streaming
instance. During their streaming sessions, users can enable audio and video
input by using the WorkSpaces Applications toolbar. If users have more than one webcam (for
example, if they have a USB webcam that is connected to their local computer
and a built-in webcam), they can also choose which webcam to use during
their streaming session.

###### Note

For multi-session fleets, only in/out functionalities are accessible.
Video in (webcam support) is not yet available for multi-session
fleets.

To configure and test support for real-time AV, complete the following
steps.

###### Configure and test support for real-time AV

01. Create a new image builder or connect to an existing image builder
     that meets the following requirements:

- The image builder must run Windows Server 2016 or Windows
Server 2019.

- The image builder must use a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent
released on or after June 1, 2021.

- For WorkSpaces Applications agents released on or after May 17, 2021,
real-time AV is enabled by default. To create a streaming
URL for testing, you can skip steps 3 through 6 and
disconnect from the image builder. If you need to disable
real-time AV, complete all of the steps, and disable webcam
permissions in step 4.

- The image builder must use a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent
released on or after June 24, 2021 to support video when
connecting using web browser access. For more information
about supported web browsers, see [Web Browser Access](web-browser-user.md).

For information about how to create an image builder, see [Launch an Image Builder to Install and Configure Streaming Applications](tutorial-image-builder-create.md).

02. Connect to the image builder that you want to use and sign in as
     Administrator. To connect to the image builder, do either of the
     following:

- [Use the WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections
only)

- [Create a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-url.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client
connections)

###### Note

If the image builder that you want to connect to is
joined to an Active Directory domain and your
organization requires smart card sign in, you must
create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications client for the
connection. For information about smart card sign in,
see [Smart Cards](feature-support-usb-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

03. On the image builder, open Registry Editor. To do so, on the image
     builder desktop, in the search box on the taskbar, type
     `regedit`. Then, select the top result for
     **Registry Editor**.

04. Under
     **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Amazon\\AppStream\**,
     create a new registry value that has the following type, name, and
     value data:

- Registry value type: DWORD

- Registry value name: WebcamPermission

- Registry value data (Hexademical): 1 to enable or 0 to
disable webcam permissions

05. After you create the registry value, switch to **Template**
    **User** or to a domain account that does not have
     administrator permissions on the image builder. To switch to
     **Template User**, in the toolbar on the top
     right of the session window, choose **Admin**
    **Commands**, **Switch User**,
     **Template User**.

06. Switch back to **Administrator**.

07. Disconnect from the image builder and create a streaming URL for
     the image builder. To do so:
    1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
        [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).

    2. In the navigation pane, choose
        **Images**, then choose **Image**
       **Builder**.

    3. Select the image builder from which you just disconnected,
        and choose **Actions**, **Create**
       **streaming URL**.

    4. Choose **Copy Link** and save the link to
        a secure and accessible location. You will use the link in
        the next step to connect to the image builder.
08. Using the streaming URL that you just created, connect to the
     image builder by using the WorkSpaces Applications client or web browser
     access.

09. Test the real-time AV experience on the image builder by following
     the steps in [Video and Audio Conferencing](client-application-windows-how-to-use-local-webcam-user.md).

10. After you verify that real-time AV is working as expected,
     disconnect from your streaming session, reconnect to the image
     builder and follow the necessary steps in Image Assistant to finish
     creating your image. For information about how to create an image,
     see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

After you finish configuring your image builder and creating an image that
supports real-time AV, you can make this feature available to your users on
WorkSpaces Applications fleets. Ensure that version 1.1.257 or later of the WorkSpaces Applications client is
installed on your users' computers.

###### Note

To use real-time AV with the WorkSpaces Applications client, your WorkSpaces Applications base image and
agent version should be June 1, 2021 or later. We recommend using the
latest WorkSpaces Applications client. For guidance that you can provide to your users to
help them use real-time AV, see [Video and Audio Conferencing](client-application-windows-how-to-use-local-webcam-user.md).

To use real-time AV with web browser access, your WorkSpaces Applications image must
use a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent released on or after June 24, 2021.
For more information on supported web browsers, see [Web Browser Access](web-browser-user.md).
