# Locking the Streaming Session When the User is Idle
<a name="active-directory-session-lock"></a>

WorkSpaces Applications relies on a setting that you configure in the GPMC to lock the streaming session after your user is idle for specified amount of time. To use the GPMC, you'll need to do the following first:
+ Obtain access to a computer or an EC2 instance that is joined to your domain.
+ Install the GPMC. For more information, see [Installing or Removing Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 7](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee449483.aspx) in the Microsoft documentation.
+ Log in as a domain user with permissions to create GPOs. Link GPOs to the appropriate OUs.

   + Create a new GPO by opening the context (right-click) menu and choosing **Create a GPO in this domain, Link it here**. For **Name**, provide a descriptive name for this GPO.
   + Select an existing GPO.

1. Open the context menu for the GPO, and choose **Edit**.
