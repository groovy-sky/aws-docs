# Cookie-Based Authentication in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications

WorkSpaces Applications uses browser cookies to authenticate streaming sessions and allow users to
reconnect to an active session without re-entering their sign-in credentials every time.
Authentication tokens are stored in browser cookies for every authentication scenario.
While cookies are necessary for many online services, they can potentially be vulnerable
to cookie theft attacks. We strongly recommend that you take proactive measures to
prevent cookie theft, such as implementing robust endpoint protection solutions for your
users' devices. Furthermore, to mitigate the potential impact in the event of cookie
theft, we advise you to consider the following actions:

- **Enforce single-session limit**: For your WorkSpaces Applications Windows
images, create a registry key under
`HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\GSettings\com\nicesoftware\dcv\session-management`
with the name **max-concurrent-clients** set to 1 to only allow
one connection at a time. This limits the number of concurrent session to one,
and blocks mirroring of active sessions. For more information, see [session-management Parameters](../../../dcv/latest/adminguide/config-param-ref.md#session_management).

- **Enforce session expiry and re-authentication**

- Reduce the SessionDuration value so that the authentication token
expires after the user successfully starts the streaming session.
Reusing authentication cookies after the sessionDuration expires
requires users to re-authenticate themselves. SessionDuration specifies
the maximum amount of time that a federated streaming session for a user
can remain active before re-authentication is required. The default
value is 60 minutes. For more information, see [Step 5: Create Assertions for the SAML Authentication Response](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md#external-identity-providers-create-assertions).

- To help maximize security, users should end sessions properly with the
toolbar (terminate session), instead of closing the streaming window.
Ending the session through the toolbar terminates both the user session
and the streaming instance. This requires re-authentication for future
access, preventing cookie misuse. If a user closes the streaming window
without ending the session, the session and instance remains active for
a configurable disconnect timeout period (in minutes). The disconnect
timeout must be a number between 1 and 5760, with a default value of 15
minutes. To prevent misuse of inactive sessions, we recommend setting a
short disconnect timeout. For more information, see [Create a Fleet in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-create.md).

- **Limit access to stream WorkSpaces Applications applications to your IP**
**ranges**: We recommend that you implement IP-based IAM policies.
This ensures that WorkSpaces Applications sessions can only be accessed from clients whose IP
address belongs to an authorized IP range. All connection attempts initiated by
a user whose client's IP address is outside an authorized range will be denied,
even if they are presenting an otherwise valid authentication cookie
(potentially stolen from a user). For more information, see [Limit access to stream Amazon AppStream 2.0 applications to your IP\
ranges](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/limit-access-to-stream-amazon-appstream-2-0-applications-to-your-ip-ranges).

- **Add additional authentication**: To launch domain-joined
streaming instances, you can join your WorkSpaces Applications Always-On and On-Demand Windows
fleets and image builders to domains in Microsoft Active Directory, and use your
existing Active Directory domains, either cloud-based or on-premises. After the
initial SAML-based authentication, your users will be prompted to provide their
domain credentials for additional authentication against the organizational
domain. For more information, see [Using Active Directory with WorkSpaces Applications](active-directory.md).
