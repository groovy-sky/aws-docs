# Tutorial: Setting Up Active Directory

To use Active Directory with WorkSpaces Applications, you must first register your directory
configuration by creating a Directory Config object in WorkSpaces Applications. This object includes the
information required to join streaming instances to an Active Directory domain. You
create a Directory Config object by using the WorkSpaces Applications management console, AWS SDK, or
AWS CLI. You can then use your directory configuration to launch domain-joined Always-On
and On-Demand fleets and image builders.

###### Note

You can only join Always-On and On-Demand fleet streaming instances to an Active
Directory domain.

###### Tasks

- [Step 1: Create a Directory Config Object](#active-directory-setup-config)

- [Step 2: Create an Image by Using a Domain-Joined Image Builder](#active-directory-setup-image-builder)

- [Step 3: Create a Domain-Joined Fleet](#active-directory-setup-fleet)

- [Step 4: Configure SAML 2.0](#active-directory-setup-saml)

## Step 1: Create a Directory Config Object

The Directory Config object that you create in WorkSpaces Applications will be used in later
steps.

If you are using the AWS SDK, you can use the
[CreateDirectoryConfig](../../../../reference/appstream2/latest/apireference/api-createdirectoryconfig.md) operation. If you are using the AWS CLI, you
can use the [create-directory-config](../../../cli/latest/reference/appstream/create-directory-config.md) command.

###### To create a Directory Config object by using the WorkSpaces Applications console

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Directory Configs**,
    **Create Directory Config**.

3. For **Directory Name**, provide the fully qualified
    domain name (FQDN) of the Active Directory domain (for example,
    `corp.example.com`). Each region can have only one
    **Directory Config** value with a specific directory
    name.

4. For **Service Account Name**, enter the name of an
    account that can create computer objects and that has permissions to join
    the domain. For more information, see [Granting Permissions to Create and Manage Active Directory Computer Objects](active-directory-permissions.md). The account name must be in
    the format `DOMAIN\username`.

5. For **Password** and **Confirm**
**Password**, type the directory password for the specified
    account.

6. For **Organizational Unit (OU)**, type the distinguished
    name of at least one OU for streaming instance computer objects.

###### Note

The OU name can't contain spaces. If you specify an OU name that
contains spaces, when a fleet or image builder attempts to rejoin the
Active Directory domain, WorkSpaces Applications cannot cycle the computer objects
correctly and the domain rejoin does not succeed. For information about
how to troubleshoot this issue, see the
_DOMAIN\_JOIN\_INTERNAL\_SERVICE\_ERROR_ topic for
"The account already exists" message in [Active Directory Domain Join](troubleshooting-notification-codes.md#troubleshooting-notification-codes-ad).

In addition, the default Computers container is not an OU and cannot
be used by WorkSpaces Applications. For more information, see [Finding the Organizational Unit Distinguished Name](active-directory-oudn.md).

7. To add more than one OU, select the plus sign ( **+**)
    next to **Organizational Unit (OU)**. To remove OUs, choose
    the **x** icon.

8. Choose **Next**.

9. Review the configuration information and choose
    **Create**.

## Step 2: Create an Image by Using a Domain-Joined Image Builder

Next, using the WorkSpaces Applications image builder, create a new image with Active Directory
domain-join capabilities. Note that the fleet and image can be members of different
domains. You join the image builder to a domain to enable domain join and to install
applications. Fleet domain join is discussed in the next section.

###### To create an image for launching domain-joined fleets

1. Follow the procedures in [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

2. For the base image selection step, use an AWS base image released on or
    after July 24, 2017. For a current list of released AWS images, see [WorkSpaces Applications Base Image and Managed Image Update Release Notes](base-image-version-history.md).

3. For **Step 3: Configure Network**, select a VPC and
    subnets with network connectivity to your Active Directory environment.
    Select the security groups that are set up to allow access to your directory
    through your VPC subnets.

4. Also in **Step 3: Configure Network**, expand the
    **Active Directory Domain (Optional)** section, and
    select values for the **Directory Name** and
    **Directory OU** to which the image builder should be
    joined.

5. Review the image builder configuration and choose
    **Create**.

6. Wait for the new image builder to reach a **Running**
    state, and choose **Connect**.

7. Log in to the image builder in Administrator mode or as a directory user
    with local administrator permissions. For more information, see [Granting Local Administrator Rights on Image Builders](active-directory-image-builder-local-admin.md).

8. Complete the steps in [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md) to install applications and create a
    new image.

## Step 3: Create a Domain-Joined Fleet

Using the private image created in the previous step, create an Active Directory
domain-joined Always-On or On-Demand fleet for streaming applications. The domain
can be different than the one that you used for the image builder to create the
image.

###### To create a domain-joined Always-On or On-Demand fleet

1. Follow the procedures in [Create a Fleet in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](set-up-stacks-fleets-create.md).

2. For the image selection step, use the image that was created in the
    previous step, [Step 2: Create an Image by Using a Domain-Joined Image Builder](#active-directory-setup-image-builder).

3. For **Step 4: Configure Network**, select a VPC and
    subnets with network connectivity to your Active Directory environment.
    Select the security groups that are set up to allow communication to your
    domain.

4. Also in **Step 4: Configure Network**, expand the
    **Active Directory Domain (Optional)** section and
    select the values for the **Directory Name** and
    **Directory OU** to which the fleet should be
    joined.

5. Review the fleet configuration and choose
    **Create**.

6. Complete the remaining steps in [Create an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Fleet and Stack](set-up-stacks-fleets.md) so that your fleet is associated with a
    stack and running.

## Step 4: Configure SAML 2.0

Your users must use your SAML 2.0-based identity federation environment to launch
streaming sessions from your domain-joined fleet.

###### To configure SAML 2.0 for single sign-on access

1. Follow the procedures in [Setting Up SAML](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md).

2. WorkSpaces Applications requires that the SAML\_Subject `NameID` value for the
    user who is logging in be provided in either of the following
    formats:

- `domain\username` using the
sAMAccountName

- `username@domain.com` using the
userPrincipalName

If you are using the sAMAccountName format, you can specify the
`domain` by using either the
NetBIOS name or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

3. Provide access to your Active Directory users or groups to enable access
    to the WorkSpaces Applications stack from your identity provider application portal.

4. Complete the remaining steps in [Setting Up SAML](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md).

###### To log in a user with SAML 2.0

1. Log in to your SAML 2.0 provider's application catalog and open the WorkSpaces Applications
    SAML application that you created in the previous procedure.

2. When the WorkSpaces Applications application catalog is displayed, select an application to
    launch.

3. When a loading icon is displayed, you are prompted to provide a password.
    The domain user name provided by your SAML 2.0 identity provider appears
    above the password field. Enter your password, and choose **log**
**in**.

The streaming instance performs the Windows login procedure, and the selected
application opens.
