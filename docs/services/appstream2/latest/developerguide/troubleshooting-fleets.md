# Troubleshooting Fleets

The following are issues that might occur when users connect to Amazon WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions launched from fleet instances.

## I tried to increase my fleet capacity, but the update isn't taking effect.

You can increase your fleet capacity in either of the two following ways:

- Manually, by increasing the **Minimum capacity** value on the **Scaling Policies** tab for the fleet in the WorkSpaces Applications console.

- Automatically, by configuring a fleet scaling policy that manages your capacity for the fleet.

If your manual modification or scaling policy exceeds your current WorkSpaces Applications quota
for your fleet instance type and size, the new values will not take effect. If you
experience this issue, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) [describe-scaling-activities](../../../cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/describe-scaling-activities.md) command to verify whether your capacity request exceeds
your quota for the applicable fleet instance type and size. This command uses the
following format:

```nohighlight

aws application-autoscaling describe-scaling-activities
  --service-namespace appstream \
  --resource-id fleet/fleetname \

```

For example, the following command provides information for the `TestFleet` fleet in the `us-west-2` AWS Region.

```

aws application-autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --service-namespace appstream --resource-id fleet/TestFleet --region us-west-2
```

The following JSON output shows that a scaling policy for
`TestFleet` with a **Minimum capacity** value of 150 was set.
This value exceeds the limit (quota) for `TestFleet`, which is 100, so the new scaling
policy doesn’t take effect. In the output, the **StatusMessage** parameter provides
detailed information about the cause of the error, including the fleet instance type
(in this case, stream.standard.medium), and the current quota, which is
100.

###### Note

WorkSpaces Applications instance type and size quotas are per Amazon Web Services account, per AWS Region. If you have multiple fleets in the same Region that use the same instance type and size, the total number of instances in all fleets in that Region must be less than or equal to the applicable quota.

```json

{
    "ScalingActivities": [
        {
            "ActivityId": "id",
            "ServiceNamespace": "appstream",
            "ResourceId": "fleet/TestFleet",
            "ScalableDimension": "appstream:fleet:DesiredCapacity",
            "Description": "Setting desired capacity to 150.",
            "Cause": "minimum capacity was set to 150",
            "StartTime": 1596828816.136,
            "EndTime": 1596828816.646,
            "StatusCode": "Failed",
            "StatusMessage": "Failed to set desired capacity to 150. Reason: The Instance type 'stream.standard.medium' capacity limit for fleet TestFleet' was exceeded. Requested: 150, Limit: 100 (Service: AmazonAppStream; Status Code: 400; Error Code: LimitExceededException; Request ID: id; Proxy: null)."
```

If you run the `describe-scaling-activities` command and the output indicates that your capacity request exceeds your current quota, you can resolve the issue by:

- Changing your capacity request to a value that doesn’t exceed your quota.

- Requesting a quota increase. To request a quota increase, use the [WorkSpaces Applications Limits form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home).

## My applications won't work correctly unless I use the Internet Explorer defaults. How do I restore the Internet Explorer default settings?

If your WorkSpaces Applications environment includes applications that render elements, you might
need to restore the Internet Explorer default settings to enable full enable access
to the internet.

###### To automatically restore the Internet Explorer default settings

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Images**, **Image Builder**.

3. Choose the image builder on which to restore the Internet Explorer
    default settings, verify that it is in the **Running**
    state, and choose **Connect**.

4. Log in to the image builder by doing either of the following:

- If your image builder is not joined to an Active Directory domain, on the **Local**
**User** tab, choose
**Template User**.

- If your image builder is joined to an Active Directory domain, choose the **Directory**
**User** tab, enter the credentials for a domain user who
does not have local administrator permissions on the image builder,
and then choose **Log in**.

5. Open Internet Explorer and reset your settings by doing the following:

1. In the upper right area of the Internet Explorer browser window, choose the
       **Tools** icon, then choose **Internet**
      **options**.

2. Choose the **Advanced** tab, and then choose
       **Reset**.

3. When prompted to confirm your choice, choose **Reset** again.

4. When the **Reset Internet Explorer Settings** message is displayed, choose
       **Close**.
6. In the upper right area of the image builder desktop, choose **Admin Commands**,
    **Switch User**.

![Admin Commands dropdown menu with Switch User option highlighted.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appstream2/latest/developerguide/images/admin-commands-switch-user.png)

7. This disconnects your current session and opens the login menu. Do
    either of the following:

- If your image builder is not joined to an Active Directory domain, on the **Local**
**User** tab, choose
**Administrator**.

- If your image builder is joined to an Active Directory domain, choose the **Directory**
**User** tab, and log in as a domain user who has local
administrator permissions on the image builder.

8. On the image builder desktop, open Image Assistant.

9. Follow the required steps in Image Assistant to finish creating your image. For more
    information, see [Tutorial: Create a Custom WorkSpaces Applications Image by Using the WorkSpaces Applications Console](tutorial-image-builder.md).

## I need to persist environment variables across my fleet instances.

Environment variables enable you to dynamically pass settings across applications.
You can make user environment variables and system environment variables available
across your fleet instances. You can also create environment variables with limited
scope, which is useful when you need to use the same environment variable with
different values across different applications. For more information, see [Persist Environment Variables in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](customize-fleets-persist-environment-variables.md).

## I want to change the default Internet Explorer home page for my users.

You can use Group Policy to set the default home page in Internet Explorer for
your users. You can also enable users to change the default page that you set. For
more information, see [Change the Default Internet Explorer Home Page for Users' Streaming Sessions in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](customize-fleets-change-ie-homepage.md).

## When my users end a streaming session and then start a new one, they see a message that says no streaming resources are available.

When a user ends a session, WorkSpaces Applications terminates the underlying instance and
creates a new instance if needed to meet the desired capacity of the fleet. If a
user tries to start a new session before WorkSpaces Applications creates the new instance and all
other instances are in use, the user will receive an error stating that no streaming
resources are available. If your users start and stop sessions frequently, consider
increasing your fleet capacity. For more information, see [Fleet Auto Scaling for Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](autoscaling.md). Or, consider increasing the
maximum session duration for your fleet and instructing your users to close their
browser during periods of inactivity rather than ending their session.
