# Recommendations and Usage Considerations for Embedding Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Streaming Sessions

Consider the following recommendations and usage notes for embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions.

- To maintain maximum control over the embedded WorkSpaces Applications streaming
experience for your users, we recommend that you configure short-lived streaming
URLs that last approximately 5 seconds. Any user can inspect the contents of a
webpage and view its source. This includes the document object model (DOM) and
the src (source) URL of the iframe. If the URL is still valid when a user copies
it, that user can paste the URL in a separate browser tab and stream the session
with the standard WorkSpaces Applications portal user interface, without the embed
options.

- Concurrent sessions are not supported when custom domains are used for embedded WorkSpaces Applications
streaming sessions. Concurrent sessions occur when users start two embedded
WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions either on the same webpage or across two different
browser tabs. You can't have a single user with concurrent sessions, but you can
have multiple users. For example, a user logs into your app, your app generates
a streaming URL to give to the customer (which counts as a unique user for
billing), a customer loads the streaming URL, and the customer is assigned to an
appstream instance within your specified pool.
