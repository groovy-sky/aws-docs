# Export Image
<a name="export-image"></a>

You can export your images to create EC2 AMIs. Later you can [Import Image](import-image.md) those AMIs back to create WorkSpaces Applications images. This helps you to use your own AMI customization tools for customizing of your images.

**Note**
During export following components will be removed from your images
WorkSpaces Applications agent
Microsoft license included applications, which were added using Image Builder
Only Microsoft Windows Server 2022 and 2025 images can be exported.

## IAM Role Requirements
<a name="export-image-iam-requirements"></a>

**Important**
Create an IAM role with the following permissions to use for export import:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCopyImage",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:CopyImage",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowDescribeImages",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeImages",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCreateTags",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:CreateTags",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Add the following trust relationship for this IAM role

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "appstream.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }

```
