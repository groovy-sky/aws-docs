# Endpoint Security and Antivirus

The brief ephemeral nature of WorkSpaces Applications instances and the lack of persistency
of data means a different approach is required to ensure user experience and performance is
not compromised by activities that would be required on a persistent desktop. Endpoint
Security agents are installed in WorkSpaces Applications images when there is an organizational policy
or when used with external data ingress e.g. e-mail, files ingress, external web
browsing.

## Removing unique identifiers

Endpoint Security agents may have a globally unique identifier (GUID) which must be
reset during the fleet instance creation process. Vendors have instructions on installing
their products in images which will ensure a new GUID is generated for each instance
generated from an image.

To ensure the GUID is not generated, install the Endpoint Security agent as the last
action before running the WorkSpaces Applications Assistant to generate the image.

## Performance optimization

Endpoint Security Vendors provide switches and setting that optimize the performance of
WorkSpaces Applications. The settings vary between vendors and can be found in their documentation,
typically in a section on VDI. Some common settings include but are not limited to
are:

- Turn off boot up scans to ensure instance creation, startup and login times
are minimized

- Turn off scheduled scans to prevent unnecessary scans

- Turn off signature caches to prevent file enumeration

- Enable VDI optimized IO settings

- Exclusions required by applications to ensure performance

Endpoint security vendors provide instructions for use with virtual desktop environments
which optimize performance.

## Scanning exclusions

If security software is installed in WorkSpaces Applications instances,
the security software must not interfere with the following
processes.

_Table 6 — Security software must not interfere with the_
_following processes. This may impact the service availability and performance._

## Folders

If security software is installed in WorkSpaces Applications instances,
the software must not interfere with the following folders:

###### Example

```

    C:\Program Files\Amazon\*
    C:\ProgramData\Amazon\*
    C:\Program Files (x86)\AWS Tools\*
    C:\Program Files (x86)\AWS SDK for .NET\*
    C:\Program Files\NICE\*
    C:\ProgramData\NICE\*
    C:\AppStream\*
    C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\AWSPowerShell\*

```

## Endpoint security console hygiene

WorkSpaces Applications will create new unique instances each time a user connects beyond
the idle and disconnect timeouts. The instances will have a unique name and will build up in
endpoint security management condoles. Setting unused aged machines over 4 or more days old
(or lower depending on WorkSpaces Applications session timeouts) to be deleted will minimize the
number of expired instances in the console.
