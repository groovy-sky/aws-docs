# Use Group Policy to Change the Default Internet Explorer Home Page

In Active Directory environments, you use the Group Policy Management (GPMC)
MMC-snap-in to set a default home page that users can't change. If Active Directory
is not in your environment, you can use Local Group Policy Editor to perform this
task. To set a home page that users can change, you must use the GPMC.

To use the GPMC, do the following first:

- Obtain access to a computer or an EC2 instance that is joined to your
domain.

- Install the GPMC. For more information, see [Installing or Removing Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows\
7](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee449483.aspx) in the Microsoft documentation.

- Log in as a domain user with permissions to create GPOs. Link GPOs to the
appropriate organizational units (OUs).

###### To change the default Internet Explorer home page by using a Group Policy administrative template

You can use a Group Policy administrative template to set a default home page
that users can't change. For more information about administrative templates,
see [Edit Administrative Template Policy Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc771479(v=ws.11)) in the Microsoft
documentation.

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home).

2. If you are not using Active Directory in your environment, open Local
    Group Policy Editor. If you are using Active Directory, open the GPMC.
    Locate the **Scripts (Logon\\Logoff)** policy setting:

- Local Group Policy Editor:

On your image builder, open the command prompt as an
administrator, type `gpedit.msc`, and then press ENTER.

Under **User Configuration**, expand

**Components**, and then choose **Internet**
**Explorer**.

- GPMC:

In your directory or on a domain controller, open the command
prompt as an administrator, type `gpmc.msc`, and then
press ENTER.

In the left console tree, select the OU in which you want to
create a new GPO, or use an existing GPO, and then do either of the
following: :

- Create a new GPO by opening the context (right-click) menu
and choosing **Create a GPO in this domain, Link it**
**here**. For **Name**, provide
a descriptive name for this GPO.

- Select an existing GPO.

Open the context menu for the GPO, and choose
**Edit**.

Under **User Configuration**, expand
**Policies**, **Administrative**
**Templates**, **Windows Components**,
and then choose **Internet Explorer**.

3. Double-click **Disable changing home page settings**,
    choose **Enabled**, and in **Home Page**,
    enter a URL.

4. Choose **Apply**, **OK**.
