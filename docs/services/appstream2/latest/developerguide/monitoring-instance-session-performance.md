# Viewing Instance and Session Performance Metrics Using the Console

You can monitor Amazon WorkSpaces Applications fleet instances and session performance using the WorkSpaces Applications
console or the CloudWatch console.

Performance metrics are collected at a 5-minute interval. After a new session is
provisioned, the first metric data point will show up in 5 minutes. Subsequent metric
data points will be available at every 5-minute interval.

###### Note

Performance metrics are currently available only for multi-session fleets
