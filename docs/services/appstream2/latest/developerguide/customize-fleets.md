# Customize an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Fleet to Optimize Your Users' Application Streaming Experience

By customizing WorkSpaces Applications fleet instances, you can define specific aspects of your WorkSpaces Applications
environment to optimize your users' application streaming experience. For example, you can
persist environment variables to dynamically pass settings across applications and set
default file associations that are applied to all of your users. At a high level,
customizing a fleet instance includes the following tasks:

- Connecting to an image builder and customizing it as needed.

- On the image builder, using Image Assistant to create a new image that includes
your customizations.

- Creating a new fleet instance or modifying an existing one. When you configure the
fleet instance, select the new customized image that you created.

- Creating a new stack or modifying an existing one and associating it with your
fleet instance.

###### Note

For certain fleet customizations, in Active Directory environments, you might need to
use the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to update Group Policy object (GPO)
settings on a domain-joined computer.

On Linux fleet instances, these environment variables are exported through the following
profile.d scripts:

- **User environment variables** in
/etc/profile.d/appstream\_user\_vars.sh

- **System environment variables** in
/etc/profile.d/appstream\_system\_vars.sh

To access the environment variables, you must explicitly source these files in your
applications.
