# Disable Google Drive for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users
<a name="disable-google-drive"></a>

You can disable Google Drive for a stack without losing user content that is already stored on Google Drive. Disabling Google Drive for a stack has the following effects:
+ Users who are connected to active streaming sessions for the stack receive an error message. They are informed that they do not have permissions to access their Google Drive.
+ Any new sessions that use the stack with Google Drive disabled do not display Google Drive.
+ Only the specific stack for which Google Drive is disabled is affected.
+ Even if Google Drive is disabled for all stacks, WorkSpaces Applications does not delete the user content stored in their Google Drive.

Follow these steps to disable Google Drive for an existing stack.

**To disable Google Drive for an existing stack**

1. Open the WorkSpaces Applications console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Stacks**, and select the stack for which to disable Google Drive.

1. Below the stacks list, choose **Storage**, and clear the **Enable Google Drive for Google Workspace** option.

1. In the **Disable Google Drive for Google Workspace** dialog box, type `CONFIRM` (case-sensitive) to confirm your choice, then choose **Disable**.

   When users of the stack start their next WorkSpaces Applications streaming session, they can no longer access their Google Drive folder from within that session and future sessions.
