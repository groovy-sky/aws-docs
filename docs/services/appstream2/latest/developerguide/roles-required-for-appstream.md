# Roles Required for WorkSpaces Applications, Application Auto Scaling, and AWS Certificate Manager Private CA

In AWS, IAM roles are used to grant permissions to an AWS service so it can
access AWS resources. The policies that are attached to the role determine
which AWS resources the service can access and what it can do with those resources.
For WorkSpaces Applications, in addition to having the permissions defined in the
**AmazonAppStreamFullAccess** policy, you must also have the
following roles in your AWS account.

###### Roles

- [AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess](#AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess)

- [ApplicationAutoScalingForAmazonAppStreamAccess](#ApplicationAutoScalingForAmazonAppStreamAccess)

- [AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling\_AppStreamFleet](#AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_AppStreamFleet)

- [AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess](#AppStreamPCAAccess)

## AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess

This role is a service role that is created for you automatically when you get
started with WorkSpaces Applications in an AWS Region. For more information about services roles,
see [Creating a role \
to delegate permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

While WorkSpaces Applications resources are being created, the WorkSpaces Applications service makes API
calls to other AWS services on your behalf by assuming this role. To
create fleets, you must have this role in your account. If this role is
not in your AWS account and the required IAM permissions and trust
relationship policies are not attached, you cannot create WorkSpaces Applications fleets.

For more information, see [Checking for the AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess Service Role and Policies](controlling-access-checking-for-iam-service-access.md) to
check whether the **AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess** service role
is present and has the correct policies attached.

###### Note

This service role can have permissions that are different from the first
user that is getting started with WorkSpaces Applications. For details on the permissions of
this role see “AmazonAppStreamServiceAccess” in [AWS Managed Policies Required to Access WorkSpaces Applications Resources](managed-policies-required-to-access-appstream-resources.md).

## ApplicationAutoScalingForAmazonAppStreamAccess

This role is a service role that is created for you automatically when you get
started with WorkSpaces Applications in an AWS Region. For more information about services roles,
see [Creating a role \
to delegate permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

Automatic scaling is a feature of WorkSpaces Applications fleets. To configure scaling
policies, you must have this service role in your AWS account.
If this service role is not in your AWS account and the required
IAM permissions and trust relationship policies are not attached, you
cannot scale WorkSpaces Applications fleets.

For more information, see [Checking for the ApplicationAutoScalingForAmazonAppStreamAccess Service Role and Policies](controlling-access-checking-for-iam-autoscaling.md).

## AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling\_AppStreamFleet

This role is a service-linked role that is created for you automatically.
For more information, see [Service-linked roles](../../../autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-service-linked-roles.md) in the _Application Auto Scaling User Guide_.

Application Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role to perform automatic scaling on your
behalf. A _service-linked role_ is an IAM role that is
linked directly to an AWS service. This role includes all the permissions that
the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.

For more information, see [Checking for the AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling\_AppStreamFleet Service-Linked Role and Policies](controlling-access-checking-for-iam-service-linked-role-application-autoscaling-appstream-fleet.md).

## AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess

This role is a service role that is created for you automatically when you get
started with WorkSpaces Applications in an AWS Region. For more information about services
roles, see [Creating\
a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-service.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

Certificate-based authentication is a feature of WorkSpaces Applications fleets joined to
Microsoft Active Directory domains. To enable and use certificate-based
authentication, you must have this service role in your AWS account. If this
service role is not in your AWS account and the required IAM permissions and
trust relationship policies are not attached, you cannot enable or use
certificate-based authentication.

For more information, see [Checking for the AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess Service Role and Policies](controlling-access-checking-for-appstreampcaaccess.md).
