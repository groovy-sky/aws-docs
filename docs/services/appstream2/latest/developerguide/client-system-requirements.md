# System Requirements and Considerations

The WorkSpaces Applications client requires the following:

- Follow the principle of least privilege when launching the WorkSpaces Applications client.
The client should only run with the level of privilege required to complete
a task.

- Client requirements

- Windows client

- Operating system — Windows 10 (32-bit or 64-bit),
Windows 11 (64-bit)

- Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 version 14.20.xx Redistributable
or later. For more information, see the [Latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable\
Version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) in the Microsoft Support
documentation.

- RAM — 2 GB minimum

- Hard drive space — 200 MB minimum

- macOS client

- Operating system — macOS 13 (Ventura), macOS 14
(Sonoma), macOS 15 (Sequoia)

- Hard drive space — 200 MB minimum

- Local administrator rights — Used if you want to install the WorkSpaces Applications
USB driver for USB driver support.

###### Note

Local administrator rights are not supported for the macOS
client.

- An WorkSpaces Applications image that uses the latest WorkSpaces Applications agent or agent versions
published on or after November 14, 2018. For information about WorkSpaces Applications agent
versions, see [WorkSpaces Applications Agent Release Notes](agent-software-versions.md).

- The client supports UDP as well as the default TCP-based streaming over
NICE DCV. For more information about NICE DCV and UDP, see [Enabling the QUIC UDP transport protocol](../../../dcv/latest/adminguide/enable-quic.md). If you want to enable
UDP streaming for the client, make sure you meet the following requirements.
If you don't meet the following requirements, the client will default back
to TCP-based streaming.

- Your Stack has been configured to prefer UDP in the
**Streaming Setting Experience** section.
For more information, see [Create an Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Fleet and Stack](set-up-stacks-fleets.md).

- Your network allows UDP traffic on port 8433 for the AWS IP
Ranges. For more information, see [AWS IP address\
ranges](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.md).

- You are using the latest base image when creating your fleet.
For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Base Image and Managed Image Update Release Notes](base-image-version-history.md).

- Your end users are using the latest client. For more information,
see [Supported\
clients](https://clients.amazonappstream.com/).

###### Note

We recommend an internet connection for WorkSpaces Applications client installation. In some cases, the client
can't be installed on a computer that is not connected to the internet, or USB devices
might not work with applications streamed from WorkSpaces Applications. For more information, see
[Troubleshooting WorkSpaces Applications User Issues](troubleshooting-user-issues.md).
