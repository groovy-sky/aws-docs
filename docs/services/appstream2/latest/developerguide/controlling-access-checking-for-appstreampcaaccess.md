# Checking for the AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess Service Role and Policies
<a name="controlling-access-checking-for-AppStreamPCAAccess"></a>

Complete the steps in this section to check whether the **AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess** service role is present and has the correct policies attached. If this role is not in your account and must be created, you or an administrator with the required permissions must perform the steps to get started with WorkSpaces Applications in your Amazon Web Services account.

**To check whether the AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess IAM service role is present**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

1. In the search box, type **appstreampca ** to narrow the list of roles to select, and then choose **AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess**. If this role is listed, select it to view the role **Summary**page.

1. On the **Permissions** tab, confirm whether the **AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess ** permissions policy is attached.

1. Return to the **Role** summary page.

1. On the **Trust relationships **tab, choose **Show policy document**, and then confirm whether the **AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess ** trust relationship policy is attached and follows the correct format. If so, the trust relationship is correctly configured. Choose **Cancel** and close the IAM console.

## AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess trust relationship policy
<a name="controlling-access-amazonappstreampcaaccess-trust-policy"></a>

The **AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess** trust relationship policy must include prod.euc.ecm.amazonaws.com as the principal. This policy must also include the `sts:AssumeRole` action. The following policy configuration defines ECM as a trusted entity.

**To create the AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess trust relationship policy using the AWS CLI**

1. Create a JSON file named `AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess.json` with the following text.

------
#### [ JSON ]

****

   ```
   {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": [
                       "prod.euc.ecm.amazonaws.com"
                   ]
               },
               "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
               "Condition": {}
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

------

1. Adjust the `AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess.json` path as needed and run the following AWS CLI commands to create the trust relationship policy and attach the AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess managed policy. For more information about the managed policy, see [AWS Managed Policies Required to Access WorkSpaces Applications Resources](managed-policies-required-to-access-appstream-resources.md).

   ```
   aws iam create-role --path /service-role/ --role-name AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess --assume-role-policy-document file://AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess.json
   ```

   ```
   aws iam attach-role-policy —role-name AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess —policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonAppStreamPCAAccess
   ```
