# Prerequisites
<a name="certificate-based-authentication-prereq"></a>

Complete the following steps before you use certificate-based authentication.

1. Set up a domain-joined fleet and configure SAML 2.0. Ensure that you use the `username@domain.com` `userPrincipalName` format for the SAML\_Subject `NameID`. For more information, see [Step 5: Create Assertions for the SAML Authentication Response](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md#external-identity-providers-create-assertions).
**Note**
Don't enable **Smart card sign in for Active Directory** in your stack if you want to use certificate-based authentication. For more information, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-USB-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

1. Use WorkSpaces Applications agent version 10-13-2022 or later with your image. For more information, see [Keep Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Image Up-to-Date](keep-image-updated.md).

1. Configure the `ObjectSid` attribute in your SAML assertion. You can use this attribute to perform strong mapping with the Active Directory user. Certificate-based authentication fails if the `ObjectSid` attribute doesn't match the Active Directory security identifier (SID) for the user specified in the SAML\_Subject `NameID`. For more information, see [Step 5: Create Assertions for the SAML Authentication Response](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md#external-identity-providers-create-assertions). The `ObjectSid` is mandatory for certificate-based authentication after September 10, 2025. For more information, see [KB5014754: Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16).

1. Add the `sts:TagSession` permission to the IAM role trust policy that you use with your SAML 2.0 configuration. For more information, see [Passing session tags in AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html.html). This permission is required to use certificate-based authentication. For more information, see [Step 2: Create a SAML 2.0 Federation IAM Role](external-identity-providers-setting-up-saml.md#external-identity-providers-grantperms).

1. Create a private certificate authority (CA) using AWS Private CA, if you don't have one configured with your Active Directory. AWS Private CA is required to use certificate-based authentication. For more information, see [Planning your AWS Private CA deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaPlanning.html). The following AWS Private CA settings are common for many certificate-based authentication use cases:
   + **CA type options**
     + **Short-lived certificate CA usage mode** – Recommended if the CA only issues end user certificates for certificate-based authentication.
     + **Single level hierarchy with a Root CA** – Choose a subordinate CA to integrate it with an existing CA hierarchy.
   + **Key algorithm options** – RSA 2048
   + **Subject distinguished name options** – Use the most appropriate options to identify this CA in your Active Directory Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.
   + **Certificate revocation options** – CRL distribution
**Note**
Certificate-based authentication requires an online CRL distribution point accessible from both the WorkSpaces Applications fleet instance and the domain controller. This requires unauthenticated access to the Amazon S3 bucket configured for AWS Private CA CRL entries, or a CloudFront distribution with access to the Amazon S3 bucket if it blocks public access. For more information about these options, see [Planning a certificate revocation list (CRL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/crl-planning.html).

1. Tag your private CA with a key entitled `euc-private-ca` to designate the CA for use with WorkSpaces Applications certificate-based authentication. This key doesn't require a value. For more information, see [Managing tags for your private CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaCaTagging.html). For more information about the AWS managed policies used with WorkSpaces Applications to grant permissions to resources in your AWS account, see [AWS Managed Policies Required to Access WorkSpaces Applications Resources](managed-policies-required-to-access-appstream-resources.md).

1. Certificate-based authentication uses virtual smart cards to log on. For more information, see [Guidelines for enabling smart card logon with third-party certification authorities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/enabling-smart-card-logon-third-party-certification-authorities). Follow these steps:

   1. Configure domain controllers with a domain controller certificate to authenticate smart card users. If you have an Active Directory Certificate Services enterprise CA configured in your Active Directory, it automatically enrolls domain controllers with certificates that enable smart card logon. If you don't have Active Directory Certificate Services, see [Requirements for domain controller certificates from a third-party CA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/requirements-domain-controller). AWS recommends Active Directory enterprise certificate authorities to automatically manage enrollment for domain controller certificates.
**Note**
If you use AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can configure Certificate Services on an Amazon EC2 instance that satisfies the requirement for domain controller certificates. See [Deploy Active Directory to a new Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/launchwizard/latest/userguide/launch-wizard-ad-deploying-new-vpc.html) for example deployments of AWS Managed Microsoft AD configured with Active Directory Certificate Services.
With AWS Managed Microsoft AD and Active Directory Certificate Services, you must also create outbound rules from the controller's VPC security group to the Amazon EC2 instance running Certificate Services. You must provide the security group access to TCP port 135, and ports 49152 through 65535 to enable certificate auto-enrollment. The Amazon EC2 instance must also allow inbound access on these same ports from domain instances, including domain controllers. For more information on locating the security group for AWS Managed Microsoft AD, see [Configure your VPC subnets and security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_tutorial_setup_trust_prepare_mad.html#tutorial_setup_trust_open_vpc).

   1. On the AWS Private CA console, or with the SDK or CLI, export the private CA certificate. For more information, see [Exporting a private certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/export-private.html).

   1. Publish the private CA to Active Directory. Log on to a domain controller or a domain-joined machine. Copy the private CA certificate to any `{{<path>}}\{{<file>}}` and run the following commands as a domain administrator. You can also use Group Policy and the Microsoft PKI Health Tool (PKIView) to publish the CA. For more information, see [Configuration instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/enabling-smart-card-logon-third-party-certification-authorities#configuration-instructions).

      ```
      certutil -dspublish -f {{<path>}}\<file> RootCA
      ```

      ```
      certutil -dspublish -f {{<path>}}\<file> NTAuthCA
      ```

      Make sure that the commands complete successfully, then remove the private CA certificate file. Depending on your Active Directory replication settings, it can take several minutes for the CA to publish to your domain controllers and WorkSpaces Applications fleet instances.
**Note**
Active Directory must distribute the CA to the Trusted Root Certification Authorities and Enterprise NTAuth stores automatically for WorkSpaces Applications fleet instances when they join the domain.

For Windows operating systems, the distribution of the CA (Certificate Authority) happens automatically. However, for Rocky Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you must download the root CA certificate(s) from the CA used by your WorkSpaces Applications Directory Config. If your KDC root CA certificate(s) are different, you must also download those. Before using certificate-based authentication, it's necessary to import these certificates onto an image or snapshot.

On the image, there should be a file named /`etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem`. It should look like the following:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Base64-encoded certificate chain from ACM Private CA
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Base64-encoded certificate body from ACM private CA
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Base64-encoded root CA KDC certificate chain
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

**Note**
When copying an image across regions or accounts, or re-associating an image with a new Active Directory, this file will need to be reconfigured with the relevant certificates on an image builder and snapshotted again before use.

Below are instructions for downloading the root CA certificates:

1. On the image builder, create a file named `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem`.

1. Open the [AWS Private CA console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/).

1. Choose the private certificate used with your WorkSpaces Applications Directory Config.

1. Choose the **CA certificate** tab.

1. Copy the certificate chain and certificate body to `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem` on the image builder.

If the root CA certificates used by the KDCs are different from the root CA certificate used by your WorkSpaces Applications Directory Config, follow these example steps to download them:

1. Connect to a Windows instance joined to the same domain as your image builder.

1. Open `certlm.msc`.

1. In the left pane, choose **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities**, and then choose **Certificates**..

1. For each root CA certificate, open the context (right-click) menu.

1. Choose **All Tasks**, choose **Export** to open the Certificate Export Wizard, and then choose **Next**.

1. Choose **Base64-encoded X.509 (.CER)**, and choose **Next**.

1. Choose **Browse**, enter a file name, and choose **Next**.

1. Choose **Finish**.

1. Open the exported certificate in a text editor.

1. Copy the contents of the file to `/etc/sssd/pki/sssd_auth_ca_db.pem` on the image builder.
