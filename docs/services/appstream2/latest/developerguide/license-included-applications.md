available in 32-bit and 64-bit architecture:

###### Important

versions. For example, you can't mix 2021 applications with 2024
applications.

- Microsoft Office, Visio, and Project must follow the same
architecture. For example, you can't mix 32-bit applications with

versions are supported on Microsoft Windows Server 2019/2022/2025.

- To enable this feature, you must use an WorkSpaces Applications Image Builder that
uses an WorkSpaces Applications agent released on or after October 2, 2025. For more
information, see [Manage WorkSpaces Applications Agent Versions](base-images-agent.md) . Or, your
image must use managed WorkSpaces Applications image updates released on or after
October 3, 2025. For more information, see [Keep Your Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Image Up-to-Date](keep-image-updated.md).

- Outbound TCP on port 1688 must be open on the management network
interface of all streaming instances.

- All users streaming through a fleet powered by an image with one
or more licensed apps incur billing for these apps monthly,
regardless of usage. The application entitlement feature doesn't
restrict access for specific users.

- License included applications on Image Builder aren't activated
because they are installed for administrative purposes. Activation
occurs when users stream through a fleet instance.
