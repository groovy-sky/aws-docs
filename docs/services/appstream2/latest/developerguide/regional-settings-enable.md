# Enable Regional Settings for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users
<a name="regional-settings-enable"></a>

To enable users to configure regional settings for a given stack during their WorkSpaces Applications streaming sessions, your stack must be associated with a fleet based on an image that uses a version of the WorkSpaces Applications agent released on or after June 6, 2018. For more information, see [WorkSpaces Applications Agent Release Notes](agent-software-versions.md). Additionally, your image must have Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later installed. Images created from WorkSpaces Applications base images published on or after June 12, 2018 meet both criteria. Images created from WorkSpaces Applications base images published before June 12, 2018 do not have Windows PowerShell 5.1 by default.

**To update an existing image to include Windows PowerShell 5.1**

1. Launch a new image builder using your existing image as the base image by doing the following:

   1.  In the left navigation pane in the WorkSpaces Applications console, choose **Images**.

   1. Choose the **Image Builder** tab, **Launch Image Builder**, and then select your existing image.

   1. If you are prompted to update the WorkSpaces Applications agent when you launch the image builder, select the check box, and then choose **Start**.

1. After your image builder is running, connect to it and sign in with an account that has local administrator permissions. To do so, do either of the following:
   + [Use the WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)
   + [Create a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-URL.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client connections)
**Note**
If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to an Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart card sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications client for the connection. For information about smart card sign in, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-USB-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

1. From the image builder desktop, open Windows PowerShell. Choose the Windows **Start** button, and then choose **Windows PowerShell**.

1. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the command `$PSVersionTable` to determine the version of Windows PowerShell that is installed on your image builder. If your image builder does not include Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later, use the following steps to install it.

1. Open a web browser and follow the steps in [Install and Configure WMF 5.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/wmf/setup/install-configure?view=powershell-7) in the Microsoft documentation, making sure that you download the Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.1 package for Windows Server 2012 R2. WMF 5.1 includes Windows PowerShell 5.1.

1. At the end of the WMF 5.1 installation process, the installer prompts you to restart your computer. Choose** Restart Now** to restart the image builder.

1. Wait about 10 minutes before logging in to your image builder, even though WorkSpaces Applications prompts you to do so immediately. Otherwise, you might encounter an error.

1. After logging in to your image builder again, open Windows PowerShell and type the command `$PSVersionTable` to confirm that Windows PowerShell 5.1 is installed on your image builder.

1. Use the image builder to create a new image. This new image now includes the latest versions of the WorkSpaces Applications agent and Windows PowerShell.

1. Update your fleet to use the new image by doing the following:

   1. In the left navigation pane in the WorkSpaces Applications console, choose **Fleets**, and then choose the fleet associated with the stack for which you want to enable regional settings.

   1. On the **Fleet Details** tab, choose **Edit**.

   1. In **Image name,** choose the new image to use for the fleet.
