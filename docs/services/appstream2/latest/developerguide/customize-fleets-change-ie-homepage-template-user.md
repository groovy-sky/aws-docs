Follow these steps to use the **Template User** account to change the default Internet Explorer home page.

**To change the default Internet Explorer Home page by using the Template User account**

1. Connect to the image builder on which to change the default Internet Explorer home page and sign in with the **Template User** account. To do so, do either of the following:
   + [Use the WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)
   + [Create a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-URL.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client connections)
**Note**
If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to an Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart card sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications client for the connection. For information about smart card sign in, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-USB-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

   **Template User** lets you create default application and Windows settings for your users.
