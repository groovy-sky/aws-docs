# Use the WorkSpaces Applications Template User Account to Change the Default Internet Explorer Home Page

Follow these steps to use the **Template User** account to change
the default Internet Explorer home page.

###### To change the default Internet Explorer Home page by using the Template User account

1. Connect to the image builder on which to change the default Internet
    Explorer home page and sign in with the **Template User**
    account. To do so, do either of the following:

- [Use the\
WorkSpaces Applications console](managing-image-builders-connect-console.md) (for web connections only)

- [Create a streaming URL](managing-image-builders-connect-streaming-url.md) (for web or WorkSpaces Applications client
connections)

###### Note

If the image builder that you want to connect to is joined to
an Active Directory domain and your organization requires smart
card sign in, you must create a streaming URL and use the WorkSpaces Applications
client for the connection. For information about smart card sign
in, see [Smart Cards](feature-support-usb-devices-qualified.md#feature-support-USB-devices-qualified-smart-cards).

**Template User** lets you create default application and
Windows settings for your users. For more information, see "Creating Default
Application and Windows Settings for Your WorkSpaces Applications Users" in [Default Application and Windows Settings and Application Launch Performance in Amazon WorkSpaces Applications](customizing-appstream-images.md).

2. Open Internet Explorer and complete the necessary steps to change the
    default home page.
