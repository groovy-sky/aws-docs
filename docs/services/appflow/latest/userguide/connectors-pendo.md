# Pendo connector for Amazon AppFlow

Pendo is a product analytics solution that helps teams record, monitor, and
analyze data about the user experience in their apps. If you're a Pendo user, your
account contains data about your users and their behavior in your product.
You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from
Pendo to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Pendo

Amazon AppFlow supports Pendo as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Pendo.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Pendo.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Pendo to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an account with Pendo that contains the data that you want to transfer. For more
information about the Pendo data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#pendo-objects).

- In your Pendo account, you've created an integration key for Amazon AppFlow, and
you've configured the key to allow write access. For the steps to create a key, see [Authentication](https://developers.pendo.io/docs?bash=) in the
Pendo Developers documentation.

Note the value of the integration key. You provide this value to Amazon AppFlow when you connect to
your Pendo account.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Pendo account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Pendo account, provide the value of your integration
key so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured your Pendo
account for Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#pendo-prereqs).

###### To connect to Pendo

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Pendo**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Pendo** window, for **API**
**key**, enter the value of the integration key from your Pendo
    account.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Pendo as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Pendo with a flow

To transfer data from Pendo, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Pendo as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose the data object that you want to transfer. For the objects
that Amazon AppFlow supports for Pendo, see [Supported objects](#pendo-objects).

Also, choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information about how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#pendo-destinations).

## Supported destinations

When you create a flow that uses Pendo as the data source, you can set the destination to any of the following connectors:

- [Amazon Lookout for Metrics](lookout.md)

- [Amazon Redshift](redshift.md)

- [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](connectors-amazon-rds-postgres-sql.md)

- [Amazon S3](s3.md)

- [HubSpot](connectors-hubspot.md)

- [Marketo](marketo.md)
