You must provide Amazon AppFlow with the API key and secret key for the project with the data that you want to transfer. Your API key can be found on the Settings page of the Amplitude dashboard. For more information about how to retrieve this information from Amplitude, see [Settings](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/235649848#project-general-settings) in the Amplitude documentation.

**Tip**
If you aren’t connected successfully, ensure that you have followed the instructions in the [Requirements](#amplitude-requirements).

## Notes
<a name="amplitude-notes"></a>
+ When you use Amplitude as a source, you can run schedule-triggered flows at a maximum frequency of one flow run per day.
+ Amplitude can process 25 MB of data as part of a single flow run.

## Supported destinations
<a name="amplitude-destinations"></a>

When you create a flow that uses Amplitude as the data source, you can set the destination to any of the following connectors:
+ Lookout for Metrics
+ Amazon S3

You can also set the destination to any custom connectors that you create with the Amazon AppFlow Custom Connector SDKs for [ Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-appflow-custom-connector-python) or [Java ](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-appflow-custom-connector-java). You can download these SDKs from GitHub.
