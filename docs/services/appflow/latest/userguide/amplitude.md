###### Tip

If you aren’t connected successfully, ensure that you have followed the instructions in the
[Requirements](#amplitude-requirements).

## Notes

- When you use Amplitude as a source, you can run schedule-triggered flows at a maximum
frequency of one flow run per day.

- Amplitude can process 25 MB of data as part of a single flow run.

## Supported destinations

When you create a flow that uses Amplitude as the data source, you can set the destination to any of the following connectors:

- Lookout for Metrics

- Amazon S3

You can also set the destination to any custom connectors that you
create with the Amazon AppFlow Custom Connector SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-appflow-custom-connector-python) or [Java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-appflow-custom-connector-java). You can download these SDKs from GitHub.
