flows. Run these flows to transfer data between Zoho CRM and AWS services or other
supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Zoho CRM

Amazon AppFlow supports Zoho CRM as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Zoho CRM.

**Supported as a data destination?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Zoho CRM.

**Supported API version**

Amazon AppFlow transfers your data by sending requests to version 2.1 of the Zoho CRM
API.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to or from Zoho CRM, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have a Zoho account, which you use to sign in to Zoho CRM. Your
Zoho CRM account contains the data that you want to transfer.

- In the Zoho Developer Console, you've created a server-based application for Amazon AppFlow. This
application provides the credentials that Amazon AppFlow uses to access your data securely when it
makes authenticated calls to your account. For the steps to create an application, see [Register your\
Application](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v2.1/register-client.html) in the Zoho CRM documentation.

- You've configured the application with one or more redirect URLs for Amazon AppFlow.

Redirect URLs have the following format:

```nohighlight

https://region.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

In this URL, _region_ is the code for the AWS Region
where you use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Zoho CRM. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia)
Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the URL is the following:

```nohighlight

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

For the AWS Regions that Amazon AppFlow supports, and their codes, see [Amazon AppFlow endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/appflow.md)
in the _AWS General Reference._

- (Optional) If you want to use your application credentials for all Zoho CRM data
centers, you've activated Multi-DC in the application settings, and you've activated all
applicable domains.

- If you want to transfer data to Zoho CRM as the destination, you've stored the
data in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you're new to Amazon S3, see [Getting started with Amazon S3](../../../s3/latest/userguide/getstartedwiths3.md)
in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

From your application settings, note the values for client ID and client secret. You provide
these values to Amazon AppFlow when you connect to your Zoho CRM account.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Zoho CRM account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Zoho CRM account, provide details from your
Zoho CRM application so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured
your Zoho CRM account for Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#zoho-crm-prereqs).

###### To connect to Zoho CRM

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Zoho CRM**.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**

    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
