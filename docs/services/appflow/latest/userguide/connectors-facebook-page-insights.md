# Facebook Page Insights connector for Amazon AppFlow

Facebook Page Insights provides Facebook Page owners with information about the performance and
visitor demographics of their Pages. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Facebook Page Insights
to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Facebook Page Insights

Amazon AppFlow supports Facebook Page Insights as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Facebook Page Insights.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Facebook Page Insights.

**Supported API version**

Amazon AppFlow retrieves your Facebook Page Insights data by sending requests to Graph API v15.0.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Facebook Page Insights to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have a Facebook account and one or more Facebook Pages that contain the data that you
want to transfer. For more information about the Facebook Page Insights data objects that Amazon AppFlow
supports, see [Supported objects](#facebook-page-insights-objects).

- You have a Meta for Developers account.

- Your account contains an app with its type set to _Business_. For information about how to create an app, see [Create an\
App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) in the Meta for Developers App Development documentation.

- Your Meta for Developers app includes the _Facebook_
_Login_ product, and you've configured this product to meet the following
additional requirements:

- Client OAuth login is enabled.

- Web OAuth login is enabled.

- One or more OAuth redirect URIs are present for Amazon AppFlow. Each of these URIs has the
following form:

`https://region.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth`

In this URI, _region_ is the code for the AWS Region
where you use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from the Marketing API. For example, if you use Amazon AppFlow
in the US East (N. Virginia) region, the URI is
`https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth`.

For the AWS Regions that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Amazon AppFlow endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/appflow.md) in the _AWS General Reference._

For more information about Facebook Login, see [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login) in the Meta
For Developers documentation.

- In the Data Use Checkup settings for your app, you've activated the public\_profile and
email permissions. For the steps to configure Data Use Checkup settings, see [Data Use Checkup](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/maintaining-data-access/data-use-checkup) in the Meta for Developers App Development documentation.

- You've configured your app with the following permissions:

- `ads_management`

- `ads_read`

- `page_events`

- `pages_manage_ads`

- `pages_manage_cta`

- `pages_manage_engagement`

- `pages_manage_instant_articles`

- `pages_manage_metadata`

- `pages_manage_posts`

- `pages_read_engagement`

- `pages_read_user_content`

- `pages_show_list`

- `public_profile`

- `read_insights`

For more information about these permissions, see [Permissions Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference)
in the Meta for Developers Graph API documentation.

From the settings for your app, note the app ID and app secret. You provide these values to
Amazon AppFlow in the connection settings.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Facebook Page Insights account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Facebook account, provide the app credentials from your Meta for
Developers app so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured an app for
Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#facebook-page-insights-prereqs).

###### To connect to Facebook Page Insights

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Facebook Page Insights**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Facebook Page Insights** window, enter the following
    information:

- **Client ID** – The app ID from your Meta for Developers
app.

- **Client secret** – The app secret from your Meta for Developers
app.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Continue**.

9. In the window that appears, sign in to your Facebook account, and grant access to
    Amazon AppFlow.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Facebook Page Insights as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Facebook Page Insights with a flow
