# Recharge connector for Amazon AppFlow

Recharge is a subscription payment solution designed for merchants to set up and
manage dynamic, recurring billing across web and mobile applications. If you're a
Recharge user, your account contains data about your customers, transactions,
subscriptions, and more. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from
Recharge to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Recharge

Amazon AppFlow supports Recharge as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Recharge.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Recharge.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Recharge to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an account with Recharge that contains the data that you want to transfer. For more
information about the Recharge data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#recharge-objects).

- In your Recharge account, you've created an API token. For the steps to create
this token, see [Recharge API key](https://docs.rechargepayments.com/docs/recharge-api-key) in the Recharge documentation.

- You've configured the API token with read permissions that allow Amazon AppFlow to access the data
that you want to transfer.

From your account settings, note your API token key because you provide this value to Amazon AppFlow
when you connect to your Recharge account.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Recharge account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Recharge account, provide the API token from your
account settings.

###### To connect to Recharge

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Recharge**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Recharge** window, for **API**
**Token**, enter your API token key.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Recharge as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Recharge with a flow

To transfer data from Recharge, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Recharge as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose the data object that you want to transfer. For the objects
that Amazon AppFlow supports for Recharge, see [Supported objects](#recharge-objects).

Also, choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information about how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#recharge-destinations).
