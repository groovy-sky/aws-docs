The following are the requirements and connection instructions for using Snowflake with Amazon AppFlow.

**Note**
You can use Snowflake as a destination only.

**Topics**
+ [Requirements](#snowflake-requirements)
+ [Connection instructions](#snowflake-setup)
+ [Related resources](#snowflake-resources)

## Requirements
<a name="snowflake-requirements"></a>
+ Amazon AppFlow uses the Snowflake COPY command to move data using an S3 bucket. To configure the integration, see [Configuring Secure Access to Amazon S3](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/data-load-s3-config.html) in the Snowflake documentation.
+ You must also add access to the `kms:Decrypt` action so that Snowflake can access the encrypted data that Amazon AppFlow stored in the Amazon S3 bucket.

  ```
  {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "kms:Decrypt",
      "Resource": "*"
  }
  ```
+ You must provide Amazon AppFlow with the following information:
  + the name of the stage and the S3 bucket for the stage
  + the user name and password for your Snowflake account
  + the S3 bucket prefix
  + the warehouse that you want to use to move the data
