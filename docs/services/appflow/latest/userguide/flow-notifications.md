# Flow notifications

Amazon AppFlow is integrated with Amazon EventBridge to publish events related to the status of a flow.
The following flow events are published to your default event bus.

- **AppFlow Start Flow Run Report**: This event is published at the start
of a flow run.

- **AppFlow End Flow Run Report**: This event is published when a flow run
is complete.

- **AppFlow Event Flow Report**: This event is generated every five minutes
for an event-triggered flow, and provides a count of event triggers over the five minute
interval.

- **AppFlow Event Flow Deactivated**: This event is generated when
Amazon AppFlow deactivates an event-triggered flow due to a failure. The deactivation reason is
specified in the event payload.

- **AppFlow Scheduled Flow Deactivated**: This event is generated when
Amazon AppFlow deactivates a schedule-triggered flow due to a failure. The deactivation field is
specified in the event payload.

You can access these events in the EventBridge console by creating an appropriate rule. For the
steps to create a rule, see [Creating Amazon EventBridge rules that react to\
events](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.md).
