## Requirements

- To use Amazon AppFlow, you need to register the application to generate OAuth credentials that
your application can use to authenticate API calls to Zendesk. This is done in Zendesk
Support.

- In Zendesk, you must create an OAuth client with the following settings:

- Unique identifier: aws\_integration\_to\_Zendesk

- Redirect URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth (us-east-1) or
https:// `region`.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth (all other
Regions)

Now that you are connected to your Zendesk account, you can continue with the flow creation

###### Tip

[Requirements](#zendesk-requirements).

## Notes

- When you use Zendesk as a source, you can run schedule-triggered flows at a maximum
frequency of one flow run per minute.

- When you use Zendesk as a destination, the following additional settings are
available:

Setting nameDescription

**Insert new records**

- This is the default data transfer option.

- When you choose this setting, Amazon AppFlow inserts your source data into the chosen
Zendesk object as a new record.

**Update existing records**

- When you choose this setting, Amazon AppFlow uses your source data to update existing
records in Zendesk. For every source record, Amazon AppFlow looks for a matching record in
Zendesk based on your criteria. You can specify matching criteria on the Map data fields
page. To do so, select a field in the source application and map it to a Zendesk record ID
or external field using the dropdown list.

- When a matching record is found, Amazon AppFlow updates the record in Zendesk. If no
matching record is found, Amazon AppFlow ignores the record or fails the flow per your chosen
error handling option. You can specify your error handling preferences on the Configure
flow page.

**Upsert records**

- When you choose this setting, Amazon AppFlow performs an upsert operation in Zendesk. For
every source record, Amazon AppFlow looks for a matching record in Zendesk based on your
criteria. You can specify matching criteria on the Map data fields page. To do so, select
a field in the source application and map it to a Zendesk external field using the
dropdown list.

- When a matching record is found, Amazon AppFlow updates the record in Zendesk. If no
matching record is found, Amazon AppFlow inserts the data as a new record. Any errors in
performing the operation are handled per your chosen error handling option. You can
specify your error handling preferences on the Configure flow page.

## Supported destinations
