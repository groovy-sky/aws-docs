# Mailchimp connector for Amazon AppFlow

Mailchimp is a marketing automation platform and email marketing service. If you're
a Mailchimp user, your account contains data about your email campaigns, such as open and
click details, segments, and automations. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from
Mailchimp to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Mailchimp

Amazon AppFlow supports Mailchimp as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Mailchimp.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Mailchimp.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Mailchimp to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an account with Mailchimp that contains the data that you want to transfer. For more
information about the Mailchimp data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#mailchimp-objects).

- In your account, you've created an API key. For the steps to create one, see [About API Keys](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys) in the
Mailchimp Help Center.

Note the API key from your account settings. You provide it to Amazon AppFlow when you connect to
your Mailchimp account.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Mailchimp account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Mailchimp account, provide your API key so that Amazon AppFlow
can access your data. If you haven't yet configured your Mailchimp account for Amazon AppFlow
integration, see [Before you begin](#mailchimp-prereqs).

###### To connect to Mailchimp

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Mailchimp**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Mailchimp** window, enter the following
    information:

- **API Key** – The API key from your Mailchimp account
settings.

- **Instance URL** – The Mailchimp Marketing API URL that
provides access to your Mailchimp data. These URLs have the form
`https://data-center.api.mailchimp.com`,
where _data-center_ is the data center for your
account. For more information, see API structure in the
Mailchimp Marketing API documentation.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Mailchimp as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Mailchimp with a flow

To transfer data from Mailchimp, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Mailchimp as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose the data object that you want to transfer. For the objects
that Amazon AppFlow supports for Mailchimp, see [Supported objects](#mailchimp-objects).

Also, choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information about how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#mailchimp-destinations).
