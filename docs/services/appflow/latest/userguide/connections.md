# Managing Amazon AppFlow connections

To enable data flows in Amazon AppFlow, you provide access to your source and destination
applications by creating _connections_. Connections store the
configuration details and credentials that Amazon AppFlow requires to transfer data with
applications on your behalf. For example, these details include your user names, passwords,
secret keys, and API access tokens. After you create a connection, you can assign it to new or
existing flows without manually entering the configuration details anew.

Use the following sections to work with your connections by using the Amazon AppFlow console,
AWS CLI, or the Amazon AppFlow API. Connections are also called _connector_
_profiles_ in the AWS CLI and Amazon AppFlow API.

Complete the following steps to manage your connections by using the Amazon AppFlow
console.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

###### Note

If **multi-session support** is enabled, disable the **multi-session support** feature
in the AWS Management Console to enable the 3-leg OAuth process during connection setup. For more information, see
[Signing in to multiple accounts](../../../awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/multisession.md).

2. In the navigation pane, select **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for
    **Connectors**, choose the application that your connection accesses.
    For example, if your connection enables data to flow to Amazon Redshift, you would choose
    **Amazon Redshift**.

4. After you choose a connector, you can do any of the following:
   - To create a connection, choose **Create connection**, and
      provide the required details. These details vary for each type of connector
      application. For application-specific instructions, find your application under
      [Supported source and destination applications](app-specific.md).

   - To view the details for a connection, choose its name in the
      **Connection name** column.

   - To edit a connection, select it and choose **Edit**.

   - To copy a connection, select it and choose **Copy to new**
     **connection**. The console shows a window where you configure a new
      connection, and it copies the initial settings from the connection that you
      selected. You can modify these settings before you create the new connection.

     Amazon AppFlow doesn't copy OAuth credentials, such as client secret and client ID. For
      connections that require those credentials, you must provide them anew.

   - To delete a connection, select it and choose **Delete**.

You can manage your connections in Amazon AppFlow by running commands with the AWS CLI.

###### To create a connection

- Run the [`create-connector-profile`](../../../cli/latest/reference/appflow/create-connector-profile.md) command. In this command, you provide
configuration details and credentials for the `--connector-profile-config`
parameter. The required details vary for each type of connector application.

The following example creates a connection for SAP OData, and it provides the
configuration details in a JSON file:

```nohighlight

$ aws appflow create-connector-profile \
> --connector-profile-name sap-odata-connection \
> --connector-type SAPOData \
> --connection-mode Public \
> --connector-profile-config file://sap-odata-connector-profile-config.json
```

The `sap-odata-connector-profile-config.json` file contains the
following configuration details:

```json

{
    "connectorProfileProperties":
    {
      "SAPOData":
      {
        "applicationHostUrl": "https://example.connection.url",
        "applicationServicePath": "/sap/opu/odata/example/path;v=2",
        "portNumber": 443,
        "clientNumber": "100",
        "logonLanguage": "EN"
      }
    },
    "connectorProfileCredentials":
    {
      "SAPOData":
      {
        "basicAuthCredentials":
        {
          "username": "username",
          "password": "password"
        }
      }
    }
}
```

The command response provides the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the new
connection:

```
{
      "connectorProfileArn": "arn:aws:appflow:us-east-1:111122223333:connectorprofile/sap-odata-connection"
}
```

###### To view the details for all of your connections

- Run the [`describe-connector-profiles`](../../../cli/latest/reference/appflow/describe-connector-profiles.md) command:

```nohighlight

$ aws appflow describe-connector-profiles
```

The command response is a JSON body with details for each of your connections. The
following example response shows the details for an SAP OData connection:

```json

{
      "connectorProfileDetails": [
          {
              "connectorProfileArn": "arn:aws:appflow:regionus-east-1:111122223333:connectorprofile/sap-odata-connection",
              "connectorProfileName": "sap-odata-connection",
              "connectorType": "SAPOData",
              "connectionMode": "Public",
              "credentialsArn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:secret:appflow!111122223333-sap-odata-connection",
              "connectorProfileProperties": {
                  "SAPOData": {
                      "applicationHostUrl": "https://example.connection.url",
                      "applicationServicePath": "/sap/opu/odata/example/path;v=2",
                      "portNumber": 443,
                      "clientNumber": "100",
                      "logonLanguage": "EN"
                  }
              },
              "createdAt": "2022-02-22T15:31:41.467000-08:00",
              "lastUpdatedAt": "2022-02-22T15:31:41.467000-08:00"
          }
      ]
}
```

###### To view the details for specific connections

- Run the `describe-connector-profiles` command, and filter the results by
using the `--connector-profile-names` or `--connector-type`
parameters. The following example gets the details for a single connection:

```nohighlight

$ aws appflow describe-connector-profiles --connector-profile-names sap-odata-connection
```

###### To edit a connection

- Run the [`update-connector-profile`](../../../cli/latest/reference/appflow/update-connector-profile.md) command. For this command, you
provide the updated configuration details for the
`--connector-profile-config` parameter. The following example provides the
updated configuration in a JSON file:

```nohighlight

$ aws appflow update-connector-profile \
> --connector-profile-name sap-odata-connection \
> --connection-mode Public \
> --connector-profile-config file://sap-odata-connector-profile-config.json
```

###### To delete a connection

- Run the [`delete-connector-profile`](../../../cli/latest/reference/appflow/delete-connector-profile.md) command.

```nohighlight

$ aws appflow delete-connector-profile --connector-profile-name sap-odata-connection
```

You can manage your connections by using the following actions in the Amazon AppFlow
API:

- [CreateConnectorProfile](../../../../reference/appflow/1-0/apireference/api-createconnectorprofile.md) – Creates a connection.

- [DescribeConnectorProfiles](../../../../reference/appflow/1-0/apireference/api-describeconnectorprofiles.md) – Provides details about your
connections.

- [UpdateConnectorProfile](../../../../reference/appflow/1-0/apireference/api-updateconnectorprofile.md) – Edits a connection.

- [DeleteConnectorProfile](../../../../reference/appflow/1-0/apireference/api-deleteconnectorprofile.md) – Deletes a connection.
