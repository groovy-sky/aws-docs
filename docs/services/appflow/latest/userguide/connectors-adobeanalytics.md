# Adobe Analytics connector for Amazon AppFlow

Adobe Analytics is a business analysis software as a service (SaaS) solution. If you’re an Adobe Analytics user, your account contains business data, analytics, and more. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Adobe Analytics to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Adobe Analytics

Amazon AppFlow supports Adobe Analytics as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Adobe Analytics.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Adobe Analytics.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Adobe Analytics to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an account with Adobe Analytics that contains the data that you want to transfer. For more
information about the Adobe Analytics data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#adobeanalytics-objects).

- In your Adobe Analytics account, you've created an app for Amazon AppFlow. The app provides the
client credentials that Amazon AppFlow uses to access your data securely when it makes authenticated
calls to your account. For information about how to create an app, see [Add a new app](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/mobile-services/using/manage-apps-ug/t-new-app.html?lang=en) in the Adobe Analytics documentation.

- You've configured the app with a redirect URL for Amazon AppFlow.

Redirect URLs have the following format:

```nohighlight

https://region.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

In this URL, _region_ is the code for the AWS Region
where you use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Adobe Analytics. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia)
Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the URL is the following:

```nohighlight

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
```

For the AWS Regions that Amazon AppFlow supports, and their codes, see [Amazon AppFlow endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/appflow.md)
in the _AWS General Reference._

Note the client ID and client secret from your app settings. You provide these values to
Amazon AppFlow when you create your connection.

### Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Adobe Analytics account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Adobe Analytics account, provide the client credentials from
your Adobe Analytics app so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured
your Adobe Analytics account for Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#adobeanalytics-prereqs).

###### To connect to Adobe Analytics

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Adobe Analytics**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Adobe Analytics** window, enter the following
    information:

- **Connection name** — A name for the connection.

- **Client ID** — The client ID in your Adobe Analytics
app.

- **Client secret** — The client secret in your
Adobe Analytics app.

- **X-API-KEY** — Re-enter the client ID in this field.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. Choose **Connect**.

8. In the window that appears, sign in to your Adobe Analytics account, and grant access
    to Amazon AppFlow.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Adobe Analytics as the data source, you can select this connection.

### Transferring data from Adobe Analytics with a flow

To transfer data from Adobe Analytics, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Adobe Analytics as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose the data object that you want to transfer. For the objects
that Amazon AppFlow supports for Adobe Analytics, see [Supported objects](#adobeanalytics-objects).

Also, choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information about how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#adobeanalytics-destinations).
