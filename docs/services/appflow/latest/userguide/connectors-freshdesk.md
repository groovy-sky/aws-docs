# Freshdesk connector for Amazon AppFlow

Freshdesk is an online customer service solution. If you're a Freshdesk
user, your account contains data about your customer engagements, including agents, conversations,
and satisfaction ratings. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from
Freshdesk to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Freshdesk

Amazon AppFlow supports Freshdesk as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Freshdesk.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Freshdesk.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Freshdesk to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an account with Freshdesk that contains the data that you want to transfer. For more
information about the Freshdesk data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#freshdesk-objects).

Note the following values because you specify them in the connection settings in
Amazon AppFlow.

- The API key from the profile settings of your Freshdesk account. The API key
authenticates third-party services like Amazon AppFlow to access your account. For the steps to find
the key, see [How to find your API key](https://support.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/215517-how-to-find-your-api-key) at the Freshdesk support site.

- Your Freshdesk address.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Freshdesk account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Freshdesk account, provide your API key and
Freshdesk address.

###### To connect to Freshdesk

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Freshdesk**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Freshdesk**
    window, enter the following information:

- **API key** – The API key from your Freshdesk profile
settings.

- **Instance URL** – Your Freshdeskaddress, such as
`https:my-company-name.freshdesk.com`.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Freshdesk as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Freshdesk with a flow

To transfer data from Freshdesk, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Freshdesk as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose the data object that you want to transfer. For the objects
that Amazon AppFlow supports for Freshdesk, see [Supported objects](#freshdesk-objects).

Also, choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information about how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#freshdesk-destinations).
