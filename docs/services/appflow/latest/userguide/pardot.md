## Requirements

- Your Salesforce account must be enabled for API access. API access is enabled by default
for Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance editions.

- Your Salesforce account must allow you to install connected apps. If this option is
disabled, contact your Salesforce administrator.

- After you create a Pardot connection in Amazon AppFlow, verify that the connected app named
_Amazon AppFlow Pardot Embedded Login App_ is installed in your
Salesforce account. For instructions on how to create a connected app in Salesforce, see [Requirements for using your own connected app](salesforce.md#salesforce-global-connected-app-instructions). For more information about
connected apps in Salesforce, see [Connected\
Apps](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_overview.htm) in the Salesforce documentation.

- The refresh token policy for the **Amazon AppFlow Pardot Embedded Login**
**App** must be set to **Refresh token is valid until**
**revoked**. Otherwise, your flows will fail when your refresh token expires.

- If your Pardot app enforces IP address restrictions, you must grant access to the
addresses used by Amazon AppFlow. For more information, see [AWS IP address ranges](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.md) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

###### Pardot version support

Amazon AppFlow supports Pardot version 4 only. If you are still using version 3, you must
upgrade to version 4 to use Amazon AppFlow. For more information, see [Transitioning from version 3 to version 4](https://developer.pardot.com/kb/api-version-4) in the Pardot documentation.

###### Authentication and Pardot business ID

- Amazon AppFlow supports authentication via OAuth2 with Pardot. For more information, see
[Authentication Via Salesforce OAuth](https://developer.pardot.com/kb/authentication) in the Pardot documentation.

- You must have the Pardot Business Unit ID that you are trying to authenticate with. To
find the Pardot Business Unit ID in Salesforce, go to **Setup** and enter
`Pardot Account Setup` in the **Quick Find** box. Your
Pardot Business Unit ID begins with _0Uv_ and is 18 characters
long. If you cannot access the Pardot account setup information, ask your Salesforce
administrator to provide you with the Pardot Business Unit ID.

## Setup instructions

###### To connect to Pardot while creating a flow

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. Choose **Create flow**.

3. For **Flow details**, enter a name and description for the flow.

4. (Optional) To use a customer managed CMK instead of the default AWS managed CMK, choose
    **Data encryption**, **Customize encryption settings** and
    then choose an existing CMK or create a new one.

5. (Optional) To add a tag, choose **Tags**, **Add tag**
    and then enter the key name and value.

6. Choose **Next**.

7. Choose **Pardot** from the **Source name** dropdown
    list.

8. Choose **Connect** to open the **Connect to Pardot**
    dialog box. If you are connecting to Pardot for the first time, follow the instructions to
    complete the OAuth workflow and create a connection profile.

9. You will be redirected to the Pardot login page. When prompted, grant Amazon AppFlow
    permissions to access your Pardot account.

Now that you are connected to your Pardot account, you can continue with the flow creation
steps as described in [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

###### Tip

If you aren’t connected successfully, ensure that you have followed the instructions in the
[Requirements](#pardot-requirements) section.

## Notes

- When you use Pardot as a source, you can run schedule-triggered flows at a maximum
frequency of one flow run per minute.

- You can connect Amazon AppFlow to your Pardot [sandbox\
account](https://pi.demo.pardot.com/) in addition to your Pardot [production\
account](http://pi.pardot.com/).

- Amazon AppFlow inherits quotas from Pardot. Quotas are enforced on daily requests and
concurrent requests at the customer level. _Pardot Pro_
customers are allocated 25,000 API requests a day. _Pardot_
_Ultimate_ customers can make up to 100,000 API requests a day. These limits reset at
the beginning of the day based on your account time zone settings. Any request that exceeds
these quotas results in an [error code\
122](http://developer.pardot.com/kb/error-codes-messages). Amazon AppFlow handles these error codes transparently.

## Supported destinations

When you create a flow that uses Salesforce Pardot as the data source, you can set the destination to any of the following connectors:

- Amazon Connect

- Amazon EventBridge

- Amazon Honeycode

- Lookout for Metrics
