## Mixpanel support

Amazon AppFlow supports Mixpanel as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from your Mixpanel account.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to your Mixpanel account.

## Before you begin

Before you can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Mixpanel, you need the following:

- A Mixpanel project that contains the data that you want to transfer.

- A _service account_ for your Mixpanel project. In
Mixpanel, a service account is a type of user that you authorize to access a project
programmatically with the Mixpanel API. Amazon AppFlow needs this account to access your data. For more
information, see [Service\
Accounts](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/service-accounts) in the Mixpanel documentation.

When you create a Mixpanel connection in Amazon AppFlow, you provide the following properties from
your service account:

- Username

- Secret

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Mixpanel account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Mixpanel project, provide details about the service account that
enables Amazon AppFlow to access your data. To create a service account, see [Before you begin](#mixpanel-prereqs).

###### To connect to Mixpanel

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Mixpanel**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Mixpanel** window, enter the following:

- **User name** – The user name of the Mixpanel service account
that provides access to your project.

- **Password** – The service account secret.

- **MixPanel Instance URL** – Choose
**https://mixpanel.com/api/app/me**.

- **MixPanel API version** – Choose
**2.0**.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Mixpanel as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Mixpanel with a flow

To transfer data from Mixpanel, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Mixpanel as the data
source. To learn how to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose which data object that you want to transfer. For more
information about the objects that Amazon AppFlow supports for Mixpanel, see [Supported objects](#mixpanel-reference-objects).

###### Required filters for Mixpanel data objects

When you create a flow and use Mixpanel as the data source, most data objects require you
to specify one or more _filters_. Filters are typically
optional criteria that you use to transfer data objects selectively. Specifically for flows that
transfer from Mixpanel, you must specify filters to provide Amazon AppFlow with parameter values that it
needs to query your data.

For the filters that are required for each Mixpanel data object, see [Supported objects](#mixpanel-reference-objects).

Also choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information on how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#mixpanel-reference-destinations).

## Supported objects

When you create a flow that uses Mixpanel as the data source, you can transfer any of the
data objects shown in the following table. To retrieve each object, Amazon AppFlow sends a query to the
URI in the _Mixpanel endpoint_ column. Most data objects support
one or more filters that appear under _Supported filters_. Flows
that transfer from Mixpanel require certain filters.

ObjectMixpanel endpoint

The following paths are appended to the base URI:
`https://mixpanel.com/api/2.0`.
