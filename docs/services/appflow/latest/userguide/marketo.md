2. Choose **Create flow**.

3. For **Flow details**, enter a name and description for the flow.

4. (Optional) To use a customer managed CMK instead of the default AWS managed CMK, choose
    **Data encryption**, **Customize encryption settings**. Then
    choose an existing CMK or create a new one.

5. (Optional) To add a tag, choose **Tags**, **Add tag**,
    and then enter the key name and value.

6. Choose **Next**.

7. Choose **Marketo** from the **Source name** or
    **Destination name** dropdown list.

8. Choose **Connect** to open the **Connect to Marketo**
    dialog box.

9. You will be redirected to the Marketo login page. When prompted, grant Amazon AppFlow
    permissions to access your Marketo account.

Now that you are connected to your Marketo account, you can continue with the flow creation
steps as described in [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

###### Tip

If you aren’t connected successfully, ensure that you have followed the instructions in
[Requirements](#marketo-requirements).

## Notes

- When you use Marketo as a source, you can run schedule-triggered flows at a maximum
frequency of one flow run per hour.

- Depending on your instance, Marketo might queue requests for data extraction. This can
result in longer flow run times. If you want to avoid queueing, contact your Marketo
administrator for assistance. We recommend that you avoid running concurrent flows using
Marketo if your use case does not benefit from it.

- Depending on your Marketo instance, you can submit more than one bulk import request (with
limitations). Each request is added as a job to be processed in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
queue. A maximum of two jobs are processed at the same time. A maximum of ten jobs are allowed
in the queue at any given time, including the two currently being processed. If you exceed the
ten job maximum, a **`1016: Too many imports`** error is returned. If you want
to avoid queueing, contact your Marketo administrator for assistance.

- There is a soft quota of 1 GB per flow when extracting data from Marketo. If you need to
process more records in a single flow, you can submit a request to Amazon AppFlow through the
Amazon AppFlow support channel. For more information, see [Creating a support\
case](../../../awssupport/latest/user/case-management.md#creating-a-support-case) in the _AWS Support User Guide_.

## Supported destinations

When you create a flow that uses Marketo as the data source, you can set the destination to any of the following connectors:

- Amazon Connect

- Amazon Honeycode

- Lookout for Metrics
