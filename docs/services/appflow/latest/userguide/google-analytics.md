# Google Analytics
<a name="google-analytics"></a>

The following are the requirements and connection instructions for using Google Analytics with Amazon AppFlow.

**Notes**
The Google Analytics connector transfers data only from Universal Analytics properties. If you want to transfer data from Google Analytics 4 properties instead, use the [Google Analytics 4 connector](connectors-google-analytics-4.md).
In time, Google Analytics will end support for Universal Analytics properties, and that platform will fully support only Google Analytics 4 properties. For more information, see [Introducing the next generation of Analytics, Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en).
You can use Google Analytics as a source only.

## Requirements
<a name="googleanalytics-requirements"></a>

You must log in to the Google API Console at [https://console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com) and do the following:
+ Activate the Analytics API.
+ Create a new app named **AppFlow**. Set the user type as **Internal**. Add the scope for read-only access and add `amazon.com` as an authorized domain.
+ Create a new OAuth 2.0 client. Set the application type as **Web application**.
+ Set the authorized JavaScript origins URL to `https://console.aws.amazon.com`.
+  Set the authorized redirect URL to `https://{{region}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth`. For example, if you use Amazon AppFlow in the US East (N. Virginia) Region, set the URL to `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth`.
+ Provide Amazon AppFlow with your client ID and client secret. After you provide them, you are redirected to the Google login page. When prompted, grant Amazon AppFlow permissions to access your Google Analytics account. Note that your Google Analytics user account must also be a Google Workspaces user account.

For more information, see [Management API - Authorization](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3/authorization) in the Google Analytics documentation.

1. You will be redirected to the Google Analytics login page. When prompted, grant Amazon AppFlow permissions to access your Google Analytics account.

Now that you are connected to your Google Analytics account, you can continue with the flow creation steps as described in [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

**Tip**
If you aren’t connected successfully, ensure that you have followed the instructions in the [Requirements](#googleanalytics-requirements) section.

## Notes
<a name="googleanalytics-notes"></a>
+ When you use Google Analytics as a source, you can run schedule-triggered flows at a maximum frequency of one flow run per day.
+ Google Analytics can process 9 dimension and 10 metrics (including custom ones) as part of a single flow run.
+ If you choose Google Analytics, you can only specify JSON as the data format for the Amazon S3 destination file.
+ You can import custom dimensions and metrics from Google Analytics into Amazon S3. To specify custom dimensions or metrics, choose the **upload a .csv file with mapped field** option in the **Map data fields** step of the flow configuration. In the source field name in the CSV file, specify the custom dimension or the metric as `ga:dimension{{XX}}` or `ga:metric{{XX}}`, with {{XX}} containing the actual index (numerical value) that you provided to Google Analytics.

  The following is an example row in the CSV file:

  `ga:dimension24|DIMENSION, PriceDimension`

  This imports the custom dimension in Google Analytics to a field named `PriceDimension` in the destination Amazon S3 file.
**Note**
The option to specify custom dimensions and metrics is available only when you upload a CSV file with mapped fields, and not when you manually map fields using the console.

## Supported destinations
<a name="google-analytics-destinations"></a>

When you create a flow that uses Google Analytics as the data source, you can set the destination to any of the following connectors:
+ Lookout for Metrics
+ Amazon S3
+ Upsolver

You can also set the destination to any custom connectors that you create with the Amazon AppFlow Custom Connector SDKs for [ Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-appflow-custom-connector-python) or [Java ](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-appflow-custom-connector-java). You can download these SDKs from GitHub.
