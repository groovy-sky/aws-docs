## Before you begin
<a name="linkedin-pages-prereqs"></a>

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from LinkedIn Pages to supported destinations, you must meet these requirements:
+ You have a LinkedIn account and a LinkedIn Page. For the steps to create a page, see [Create a LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543852/create-a-linkedin-page?lang=en) on LinkedIn Help.
+ In LinkedIn Developers, you've created an app, and you've configured it as follows:
  + The app is associated with your LinkedIn Page.
  + The app includes the Marketing Developer Platform product.
  + The app Auth settings include one or more redirect URLs for Amazon AppFlow.

    Redirect URLs have the following format:

    ```
    https://{{region}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
    ```

    In this URL, *region* is the code for the AWS Region where you use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from LinkedIn Pages. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the URL is the following:

    ```
    https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/oauth
    ```

    For the AWS Regions that Amazon AppFlow supports, and their codes, see [Amazon AppFlow endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/appflow.html) in the *AWS General Reference.*

From the Auth settings for your app, note the client ID and client secret. You provide these values to Amazon AppFlow when you connect to LinkedIn Pages.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow LinkedIn Pages
<a name="linkedin-pages-connecting"></a>

To connect Amazon AppFlow to LinkedIn Pages, provide the client credentials from your LinkedIn Developers app so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured your LinkedIn account for Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#linkedin-pages-prereqs).

**To connect to LinkedIn Pages**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/).

1. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

1. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**, choose **LinkedIn Pages**.

1. Choose **Create connection**.

1. In the **Connect to LinkedIn Pages** window, enter the following information:
   + **Client ID** – The client ID from the Auth settings of your LinkedIn Developers app.
   + **Client secret** – The client secret from the Auth settings of your LinkedIn Developers app.

1. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

   By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

   Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

   If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

1. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

1. Choose **Connect**.

1. In the window that appears, sign in to your LinkedIn account, and grant access to Amazon AppFlow.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the **Connections** table. When you create a flow that uses LinkedIn Pages as the data source, you can select this connection.
