# Domo connector for Amazon AppFlow

Domo is a business intelligence solution. If you're a Domo user,
your account contains data about your Domo resources, such as your datasets and data
permissions policies. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from
Domo to certain AWS services or other supported applications.

## Amazon AppFlow support for Domo

Amazon AppFlow supports Domo as follows.

**Supported as a data source?**

Yes. You can use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Domo.

**Supported as a data destination?**

No. You can't use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data to Domo.

## Before you begin

To use Amazon AppFlow to transfer data from Domo to supported destinations, you must meet these
requirements:

- You have an account with Domo that contains the data that you want to transfer. For more
information about the Domo data objects that Amazon AppFlow supports, see [Supported objects](#domo-objects).

- On the Domo for Developers site, you've created a client for Amazon AppFlow. The
client provides the credentials that Amazon AppFlow uses to access your data securely when it makes
authenticated calls to your account. For the steps to create a client, see [API Authentication\
Quickstart](https://developer.domo.com/docs/authentication/quickstart-5) in the Domo for Developers documentation.

From the client settings, note client ID and secret because you provide these values in the
connection settings in Amazon AppFlow.

## Connecting Amazon AppFlow to your Domo account

To connect Amazon AppFlow to your Domo account, provide the client ID and secret from
your client so that Amazon AppFlow can access your data. If you haven't yet configured your
Domo account for Amazon AppFlow integration, see [Before you begin](#domo-prereqs).

###### To connect to Domo

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow).

2. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Connections**.

3. On the **Manage connections** page, for **Connectors**,
    choose **Domo**.

4. Choose **Create connection**.

5. In the **Connect to Domo** window, enter the following
    information:

- **Client ID** – The client ID from your Domo
client.

- **Client secret** – The secret from your Domo
client.

6. Optionally, under **Data encryption**, choose **Customize**
**encryption settings (advanced)** if you want to encrypt your data with a customer
    managed key in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

By default, Amazon AppFlow encrypts your data with a KMS key that AWS creates, uses, and manages
    for you. Choose this option if you want to encrypt your data with your own KMS key instead.

Amazon AppFlow always encrypts your data during transit and at rest. For more information, see
    [Data protection in Amazon AppFlow](data-protection.md).

If you want to use a KMS key from the current AWS account, select this key under
    **Choose an AWS KMS key**. If you want to use a KMS key from a different
    AWS account, enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for that key.

7. For **Connection name**, enter a name for your connection.

8. Choose **Connect**.

On the **Manage connections** page, your new connection appears in the
**Connections** table. When you create a flow
that uses Domo as the data source, you can select this connection.

## Transferring data from Domo with a flow

To transfer data from Domo, create an Amazon AppFlow flow, and choose Domo as the data
source. For the steps to create a flow, see [Creating flows in Amazon AppFlow](create-flow.md).

When you configure the flow, choose the data object that you want to transfer. For the objects
that Amazon AppFlow supports for Domo, see [Supported objects](#domo-objects).

Also, choose the destination where you want to transfer the data object that you selected.
For more information about how to configure your destination, see [Supported destinations](#domo-destinations).

When transferring dataset data objects, the limit is 1000 records per page. Pagination is not supported for data-permission-policy data objects, and the lambda limit is 5.5 MB.
