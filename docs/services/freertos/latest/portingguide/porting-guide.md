# FreeRTOS Porting

## What is FreeRTOS

Developed in partnership with the world's leading chip companies over a 20-year
period, and now downloaded every 170 seconds, FreeRTOS is a market-leading real-time operating
system (RTOS) for microcontrollers and small microprocessors. Distributed freely under the MIT
open source license, FreeRTOS includes a kernel and a growing set of libraries suitable for use
across all industry sectors. FreeRTOS is built with an emphasis on reliability and ease of
use. FreeRTOS includes libraries for connectivity, security, and over-the-air (OTA) updates, and
demo applications that demonstrate FreeRTOS features on [qualified boards](https://devices.amazonaws.com/search?page=1&sv=freertos).

## Porting FreeRTOS to your IoT board

You will need to port FreeRTOS software libraries to your microcontroller-based board based on its
features and your application.

###### To port FreeRTOS to your device

1. Follow the instructions in [Downloading FreeRTOS for Porting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/portingguide/porting-download.html) to download the
    latest version of FreeRTOS for porting.

2. Follow the instructions in [Setting up your workspace and project for porting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/portingguide/porting-set-up-project.html) to configure
    the files and folders in your FreeRTOS download for porting and testing.

3. Follow the instructions in [Porting the FreeRTOS libraries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/portingguide/afr-porting.html) to port
    the FreeRTOS libraries to your device. Each porting topic includes instructions on testing the ports.

### Porting FAQs

_What is a FreeRTOS port?_

A FreeRTOS port is a board-specific implementation of APIs for the required FreeRTOS libraries
and the FreeRTOS kernel that your platform supports. The port enables the APIs to work on the board,
and implements the required integration with the device drivers and BSPs that are provided
by the platform vendor. Your port should also include any configuration adjustments (e.g.
clock rate, stack size, heap size) that are required by the board.

If you have questions about porting that are not answered on this page or in the rest of the FreeRTOS
Porting Guide, please [see the available FreeRTOS \
support options](https://freertos.org/RTOS-contact-and-support.html).
