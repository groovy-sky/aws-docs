# Create an OTA user policy

You must grant your user permission to perform over-the-air updates.
Your user must have permissions to:

- Access the S3 bucket where your firmware updates are stored.

- Access certificates stored in AWS Certificate Manager.

- Access the AWS IoT MQTT-based file delivery feature.

- Access FreeRTOS OTA updates.

- Access AWS IoT jobs.

- Access IAM.

- Access Code Signing for AWS IoT. See [Grant access to code signing for AWS IoT](code-sign-policy.md).

- List FreeRTOS hardware platforms.

- Tag and untag AWS IoT resources.

To grant your user the required permissions, see [IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html). Also see [Authorizing \
users and cloud services to use AWS IoT Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iam-policy-users-jobs.html).

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:

- Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:

Create a permission set. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.html) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

- Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

Create a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for a third-party identity provider (federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

- IAM users:

- Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the _IAM User Guide_.
