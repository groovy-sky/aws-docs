# FreeRTOS demo application

###### Important

This page refers to the Amazon-FreeRTOS repository which is deprecated. We recommend
that you [start here](freertos-getting-started-modular.md) when you
create a new project. If you already have an existing FreeRTOS project based on the now
deprecated Amazon-FreeRTOS repository, see the [Amazon-FreeRTOS Github Repository Migration Guide](github-repo-migration.md).

The demo application in this tutorial is the coreMQTT Agent demo defined in the
`freertos/demos/coreMQTT_Agent/mqtt_agent_task.c` file. It uses
the [coreMQTT library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/coremqtt.html) to connect to the AWS Cloud and then periodically
publish messages to an MQTT topic hosted by the [AWS IoT MQTT broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html).

Only a single FreeRTOS demo application can run at a time. When you build a FreeRTOS demo project, the first demo
enabled in the
`freertos/vendors/vendor/boards/board/aws_demos/config_files/aws_demo_config.h`
header file is the application that runs. For this tutorial, you do not need to enable or disable any demos. The
coreMQTT Agent demo is enabled by default.

For more information about the demo applications included with FreeRTOS, see
[FreeRTOS demos](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-next-steps.html).
