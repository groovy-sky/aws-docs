# Mobile SDKs for FreeRTOS Bluetooth devices

###### Important

This library is hosted on the Amazon-FreeRTOS repository which is deprecated. We recommend
that you [start here](freertos-getting-started-modular.md) when you
create a new project. If you already have an existing FreeRTOS project based on the now
deprecated Amazon-FreeRTOS repository, see the [Amazon-FreeRTOS Github Repository Migration Guide](github-repo-migration.md).

You can use the Mobile SDKs for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices to create mobile applications
that interact with your microcontroller over Bluetooth Low Energy. The Mobile SDKs can also
communicate with AWS services, using Amazon Cognito for user authentication.

## Android SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth devices

Use the Android SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices to build Android mobile applications that interact with
your microcontroller over Bluetooth Low Energy. The SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk).

To install the Android SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth devices, follow the instructions for "Setting up the SDK"
in the project's [README.md](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos-ble-android-sdk/blob/master/README.md) file.

For information about setting up and running the demo mobile application that is included with the SDK, see [Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ble-demo.html#ble-demo-prereqs)
and [FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy Mobile SDK demo application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ble-demo.html#ble-sdk-app).

## iOS SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth devices

Use the iOS SDK for FreeRTOS Bluetooth Devices to build iOS mobile applications that interact with your
microcontroller over Bluetooth Low Energy. The SDK is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos-ble-ios-sdk).

###### To install the iOS SDK

1. Install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

```bash

$ gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

###### Note

You might need to use `sudo` to install CocoaPods.

2. Install the SDK with CocoaPods (add this to your podfile):

```bash

$ pod 'FreeRTOS', :git => 'https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos-ble-ios-sdk.git'
```

For information about setting up and running the demo mobile application that is included with the SDK, see [Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ble-demo.html#ble-demo-prereqs)
and [FreeRTOS Bluetooth Low Energy Mobile SDK demo application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ble-demo.html#ble-sdk-app).
