# Download, build, flash and run the FreeRTOS OTA demo on the Renesas RX65N

###### Important

This reference integration is hosted on the Amazon-FreeRTOS repository which is deprecated.
We recommend that you [start here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-getting-started-modular.html) when
you create a new project. If you already have an existing FreeRTOS project based on the now
deprecated Amazon-FreeRTOS repository, see the [Amazon-FreeRTOS Github Repository Migration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/github-repo-migration.html).

This chapter shows you how download, build, flash and run the FreeRTOS OTA demo applications on the Renesas RX65N.

###### Topics

- [Set up your operating environment](#download-rx65n-ota-environment)

- [Set up your AWS resources](#download-rx65n-ota-setup)

- [Import, configure the header file and build aws\_demos and boot\_loader](#download-rx65n-ota-import-configure)

## Set up your operating environment

The procedures in this section use the following environments:

- **IDE**: e2 studio 7.8.0,
e2 studio 2020-07

- **Toolchains**: CCRX Compiler v3.0.1

- **Target devices**: RSKRX65N-2MB

- **Debuggers**: E2, E2
Lite emulator

- **Software**: Renesas Flash Programmer, Renesas Secure Flash Programmer.exe,
Tera Term

###### To set up your hardware

1. Connect the E2 Lite emulator and USB serial port to your RX65N board and PC.

2. Connect the power source to the RX65N.

## Set up your AWS resources

1. To run the FreeRTOS demos, you must have an AWS account with an IAM user that has permission
    to access AWS IoT services. If you haven't already, follow the steps in [Setting up your AWS account and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-prereqs.html#freertos-account-and-permissions).

2. To set up for OTA updates, follow the steps in [OTA update prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ota-prereqs.html).
    In particular, follow the steps in [Prerequisites for OTA updates using MQTT](ota-mqtt-freertos.md).

3. Open the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home).

4. In the left navigation pane, choose **Manage**, then choose **Things** to
    create a thing.

A thing is a representation of a device or logical entity in AWS IoT. It can be a physical device or sensor
    (for example, a light bulb or a switch on a wall). It can also be a logical entity like an instance of an
    application or physical entity that doesn't connect to AWS IoT, but is related to devices that do (for example,
    a car that has engine sensors or a control panel). AWS IoT provides a thing registry that helps you manage your
    things.
1. Choose **Create**, then choose **Create a single thing**.

2. Enter a **Name** for your thing, then choose **Next**.

3. Choose **Create certificate**.

4. Download the three files that are created and then choose **Activate**.

5. Choose **Attach a policy**.

      ![console screen showing files to be downloaded](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/freertos/latest/userguide/images/download-these-files-rx65n.png)

6. Select the policy that you created in [Device policy](ota-mqtt-freertos.md#ota-mqtt-freertos-device-policy).

      Each device that receives an OTA update using MQTT must be registered as a thing in AWS IoT and the
       thing must have an attached policy like the one listed. You can find more information about the items
       in the `"Action"` and `"Resource"` objects at [AWS IoT Core Policy Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-policy-actions.html)
       and [AWS IoT Core Action \
       Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-action-resources.html).

      ###### Notes

- The `iot:Connect` permissions allow your device to connect to AWS IoT over
MQTT.

- The `iot:Subscribe` and `iot:Publish` permissions on the topics of
AWS IoT jobs ( `.../jobs/*`) allow the connected device to receive job notifications
and job documents, and to publish the completion state of a job execution.

- The `iot:Subscribe` and `iot:Publish` permissions on the topics
of AWS IoT OTA streams ( `.../streams/*`) allow the connected device to fetch OTA
update data from AWS IoT. These permissions are required to perform firmware updates over
MQTT.

- The `iot:Receive` permissions allow AWS IoT Core to publish messages on those
topics to the connected device. This permission is checked on every delivery of an MQTT
message. You can use this permission to revoke access to clients that are currently
subscribed to a topic.
5. To create a code-signing profile and register a code-signing certificate on AWS.
1. To create the keys and certification, see section 7.3 "Generating ECDSA-SHA256 Key Pairs with OpenSSL"
       in [Renesas MCU Firmware Update Design Policy](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/apn/renesas-mcu-firmware-update-design-policy).

2. Open the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home). In the left navigation
       pane, select **Manage**, then **Jobs**. Select **Create**
      **a job** then **Create OTA update Job**.

3. Under **Select devices to update** choose **Select** then
       choose the thing you created previously. Select **Next**.

4. On the **Create a FreeRTOS OTA update job** page, do the following:
      1. For **Select the protocol for firmware image transfer**, choose
          **MQTT**.

      2. For **Select and sign your firmware image**, choose
          **Sign a new firmware image for me**.

      3. For **Code signing profile**, choose **Create**.

      4. In the **Create a code signing profile** window, enter a
          **Profile name**. For the **Device hardware platform** select
          **Windows Simulator**. For the **Code signing certificate**
          choose **Import**.

      5. Browse to select the certificate ( `secp256r1.crt`), the certificate
          private key ( `secp256r1.key`), and the certificate chain
          ( `ca.crt`).

      6. Enter a **Pathname of code signing certificate on device**.
          Then choose **Create**.
6. To grant access to code signing for AWS IoT, follow the steps in [Grant access to code signing for AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/code-sign-policy.html).

If don't have Tera Term installed on your PC, you can download it from [https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en) and set it up as shown here.
Make sure that you plug in the USB Serial port from your device to your PC.

17. **Task B: Update the version of your firmware**
    1. Open the `demos/include/aws_application_version.h` file and increment the
        `APP_VERSION_BUILD` token value to `0.9.3`.

    2. Rebuild the project.
18. Create the `userprog.rsu` file with the Renesas Secure Flash Programmer to update
     the version of your firmware.
    1. Open the `Amazon-FreeRTOS-Tools\Renesas Secure Flash Programmer.exe` file.

    2. Choose the **Update Firm** tab and set the following parameters:

- **File Path** – The location of the
`aws_demos.mot` file
( `projects\renesas\rx65n-rsk\e2studio\aws_demos\HardwareDebug`).

    3. Create a directory named `update _firmware`. Generate
        `userprog.rsu` and save it to the `update_firmware`
        directory. Verify that the generate succeeded.

19. Upload the firmware update, `userproj.rsu`, into an Amazon S3 bucket as described in [Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store your update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/dg-ota-bucket.html).

    ![Amazon S3 bucket management interface with folders, uploads, versions, and permissions options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/freertos/latest/userguide/images/upload-firmware-rx65n.png)

20. Create a job to update firmware on the RX65N-RSK.

    AWS IoT Jobs is a service that notifies one or more connected devices of a pending [Job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html). A job can be used to manage
     a fleet of devices, update firmware and security certificates on devices, or perform administrative tasks
     such as restarting devices and performing diagnostics.
    1. Sign in to the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotv2). In the navigation
        pane, choose **Manage**, and choose **Jobs**.

    2. Choose **Create a job**, then choose **Create OTA Update job**.
        Select a thing, then choose **Next**.

    3. Create a FreeRTOS OTA update job as follows:

- Choose **MQTT**.

- Select the code signing profile you created in the previous section.

- Select the firmware image that you uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.

- For **Pathname of firmware image on device**, enter
`test`.

- Choose the IAM role that you created in the previous section.

    4. Choose **Next**.

       ![Firmware image sign and OTA update settings with options to sign new firmware, select previously signed firmware, use custom signed firmware, specify code signing profile, firmware image file, path on device, and IAM role for OTA update job.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/freertos/latest/userguide/images/create-job-next-rx65n.png)

    5. Enter an ID and then choose **Create**.
21. Reopen Tera Term to verify that the firmware was updated successfully to OTA demo version 0.9.3.

    ![Command line output showing initialization and connection of a thread to a broker.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/freertos/latest/userguide/images/update-successful-rx65n.png)

22. On the AWS IoT console, verify that the
     job
     status is
     **Succeeded**.
