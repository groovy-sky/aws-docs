# Amazon-FreeRTOS Github Repository Migration Guide

If you have an existing FreeRTOS project based on the now deprecated amazon-freertos repository, follow these steps:

1. Stay up to date with the latest, publicly available security fixes. Check the
    [FreeRTOS LTS libraries](https://www.freertos.org/lts-libraries.html) page
    for updates, or subscribe to the [FreeRTOS-LTS](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-LTS)
    GitHub repository to receive the latest LTS patches with critical and security bug fixes. You can download
    or clone the latest FreeRTOS LTS patches required directly from the individual GitHub repositories.

2. Consider refactoring the network transport interface implementation to optimize your hardware platform.
    The abstract APIs like [secure sockets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/secure-sockets.html)
    and [Wifi APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-wifi.html)
    are not required by the latest [coreMQTT](https://www.freertos.org/mqtt/index.html) library.
    See [Transport Interface](https://www.freertos.org/network-interface.html)
    for further details.

## Appendix

The following table provides recommendations for all demo projects, legacy libraries, and
abstract APIs within the Amazon-FreeRTOS repository.

Deprecated libraries and demosNameTypeRecommendations

BLE

demos and libraries

The FreeRTOS BLE library implements the proprietary MQTT protocol and
supports publishing and subscribing to MQTT topics over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
through a proxy device such as a mobile phone. This is no longer mandated. Use
either your own BLE stack or a third-party option such as
[NimBLE](https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/network) to best
optimize your project.

dev\_mode\_key\_provisioning

demos

The Featured FreeRTOS IoT reference integrations on the
[NXP i.MX RT1060](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/iot-reference-nxp-rt1060/blob/main/examples/common/cli/cli.c),
[STM32U5](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/iot-reference-stm32u5/blob/main/Common/cli/cli_pki.c), or
[ESP32-C3](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/iot-reference-esp32c3/blob/main/GettingStartedGuide.md) platforms provide examples of crucial provisioning using a CLI.

posix

abstraction and demo

Not recommended for use.

wifi\_provisioning

example

This example demonstrated how to provision WiFi credentials on a device
using the Amazon-FreeRTOS BLE library. Refer to the FreeRTOS Featured IoT reference on the
[ESP32C3 platform](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/iot-reference-esp32c3)
for an example of WiFi provisioning via BLE.

Legacy abstract APIs

code

These are APIs that were created to provide an abstract interface for
various third-party software stacks, connectivity modules, and MCU platforms
from a variety of vendors. For example, there are interfaces for WiFi abstraction,
secure sockets, and so on. They are supported in the Amazon-FreeRTOS repository
and are in the folder `/libraries/abstractions/`. These APIs
are not required when using the [FreeRTOS LTS libraries](https://www.freertos.org/lts-libraries.html).

The libraries and demos in the table above will not get security patches or bug fixes.

**Third-party libraries**

When demos in Amazon-FreeRTOS use third-party libraries, we recommend that you sub-module them
directly from their third-party repositories.

- **CMock**: clone it (submodule if you use git)
directly from the [Cmock](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/CMock)
repository.

- **jsmn**: not recommended and no longer supported.

- **lwip**: clone it (submodule if you use git) directly
from the [lwip-tcpip](https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip) repository.

- **lwip\_osal**: refer to the FreeRTOS Featured Reference Integrations
on [i.MX RT1060](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/iot-reference-nxp-rt1060) or
[STM32U5](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/iot-reference-stm32u5) for how
to implement lwip\_osal on your hardware platform/board.

- **mbedtls**: clone it (submodule if you use git) directly
from the [Mbed-TLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls) repository.
The mbedtls config and utilities can be reused; make a local copy in this case.

- **pkcs11**: clone it (submodule if you use git) directly
from either the [corePKCS11](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/corePKCS11)
library or the [OASIS PKCS 11](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/pkcs11)
repository.

- **tinycbor**: clone it (submodule if you use git) directly
from the [tinycbor](https://github.com/intel/tinycbor) repository.

- **tinycrypt**: we recommend that you use crypto accelerators
from your MCU platform, if available. If you want to continue to use tinycrypt, clone it
(submodule if you use git) directly from the [tinycrypt](https://github.com/intel/tinycrypt) repository.

- **tracealyzer\_recorder**: clone it (submodule if you use git)
directly from Percepio's [trace \
recorder](https://github.com/percepio/TraceRecorderSource) repository.

- **unity**: clone it (submodule if you use git) directly from the
[ThrowTheSwitch/Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) repository.

- **win\_pcap**: win\_pcap is no longer maintained. We recommend
that you use libslirp, libpcap (posix), or npcap instead.

**Porting tests and integration tests**

All tests under the `/tests` folder that are required to validate integration
of FreeRTOS libraries were migrated to the
[FreeRTOS-Libraries-Integration-Tests](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Libraries-Integration-Tests) repository. These can be used to test PAL implementation
and library integration. The same tests are used by AWS IoT Device Tester (IDT) for the
[AWS Device Qualification Program for FreeRTOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/qualificationguide/afr-qualification.html).
