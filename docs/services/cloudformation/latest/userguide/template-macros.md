# Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros
<a name="template-macros"></a>

With macros, you can perform custom processing on templates, from simple actions like find-and-replace operations to extensive transformations of entire templates.

To get an idea of the breadth of possibilities, consider the `AWS::Include` and `AWS::Serverless` transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation:
+ [AWS::Include transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/transform-aws-include.html) enables you to insert boilerplate template snippets into your templates.
+ [AWS::Serverless transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/transform-aws-serverless.html) takes an entire template written in the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) syntax and transforms and expands it into a compliant CloudFormation template. For more information about serverless applications and AWS SAM, see [AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html).

## Billing
<a name="template-macros-billing"></a>

When a macro runs, the owner of the Lambda function is billed for any charges related to the execution of that function.

The `AWS::Include` and `AWS::Serverless` transforms are macros hosted by CloudFormation. There is no charge for using them.

## Macro examples

In addition to the examples in this section, you can find example macros, including source code and templates, in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/tree/main/CloudFormation/MacrosExamples). These examples are provided 'as-is' for instructional purposes.
