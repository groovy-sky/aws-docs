# Use modules from the CloudFormation private registry

This topic explains how to use modules in CloudFormation templates. Think of modules as
pre-made bundles of resources that you can add to your templates.

To use a module, the steps are as follows:

- Register the module – You register modules in
the CloudFormation registry as private extensions. Make sure it's registered in the
AWS account and Region you’re working in. For more information, see [CloudFormation registry concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-concepts.html).

- Include it in your template – Add the module to
the [Resources](resources-section-structure.md) section of your CloudFormation template,
just like you would with other resources. You'll also need to provide any required
properties for the module.

- Create or update the stack – When you initiate a
stack operation, CloudFormation generates a processed template that resolves any included
modules into the appropriate resources.

- Preview changes – Before making changes, you can
use a change set to see what resources will be added or changed. For more information, see
[Update CloudFormation stacks using change sets](using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.md).

Consider the following example: you have a template that contains both resources and
modules. The template contains one individual resource, `ResourceA`, as well as a
module, `ModuleParent`. That module contains two resources, `ResourceB`
and `ResourceC`, as well as a nested module, `ModuleChild`.
`ModuleChild` contains a single resource, `ResourceD`. If you create a
stack from this template, CloudFormation processes the template and resolves the modules to the
appropriate resources. The resulting stack has four resources: `ResourceA`,
`ResourceB`, `ResourceC`, and `ResourceD`.

![During a stack operation, CloudFormation resolves the two modules included in the stack template into the appropriate four resources.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/modules-resource-inclusion.png)

CloudFormation keeps track of which resources in a stack were created from modules. You can
view this information on the **Events**, **Resources**, and
**Drifts** tabs for a given stack, and it's also included in change set
previews.

Modules are distinguishable from resources in a template because they adhere to the
following four-part naming convention, as opposed to the typical three-part convention used by
resources:

```text

organization::service::use-case::MODULE
```
