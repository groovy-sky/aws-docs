# CloudFormation custom resource request and response reference
<a name="crpg-ref"></a>

CloudFormation manages custom resources through a request-response protocol that communicates with your custom resource provider. Each request includes a request type (`Create`, `Update`, or `Delete`) and follows this high-level workflow:

1. A template developer defines a custom resource with a `ServiceToken` and `ServiceTimeout` in the template and initiates a stack operation.

1. CloudFormation sends a JSON request to the custom resource provider through SNS or Lambda.

1. The custom resource provider processes the request and returns a JSON response to a presigned Amazon S3 bucket URL before the timeout period expires.

1. CloudFormation reads the response and proceeds with the stack operation. If no response is received before the timeout period ends, the request is considered unsuccessful, and the stack operation fails.

For more information, see [How custom resources work](template-custom-resources.md#how-custom-resources-work).

This section describes the structure, parameters, and expected responses for each request type.

**Note**
The total size of the response body can't exceed 4096 bytes.

## Template setup
<a name="crpg-ref-template-setup"></a>

When defining a custom resource in a template, the template developer uses [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-customresource.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-customresource.html) with the following properties:

`ServiceToken`
An Amazon SNS topic ARN or Lambda function ARN from the same Region as the stack.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`ServiceTimeout`
The maximum time, in seconds, before a custom resource operation times out. It must be a value between 1 and 3600. Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour).
*Required*: No
*Type*: String

Additional resource properties are supported. Resource properties will be included as `ResourceProperties` in the request. The custom resource provider must determine which properties are valid and their acceptable values.

## Request object
<a name="crpg-ref-requesttypes"></a>

------
#### [ Create ]

When the template developer creates a stack containing a custom resource, CloudFormation sends a request with `RequestType` set to `Create`.

Create requests contain the following fields:

`RequestType`
`Create`.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`RequestId`
A unique ID for the request.
Combining the `StackId` with the `RequestId` forms a value that you can use to uniquely identify a request on a particular custom resource.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`StackId`
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the stack that contains the custom resource.
Combining the `StackId` with the `RequestId` forms a value that you can use to uniquely identify a request on a particular custom resource.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`ResponseURL`
The response URL identifies a presigned S3 bucket that receives responses from the custom resource provider to CloudFormation.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`ResourceType`
The template developer-chosen resource type of the custom resource in the CloudFormation template. Custom resource type names can be up to 60 characters long and can include alphanumeric and the following characters: `_@-`.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`LogicalResourceId`
The template developer-chosen name (logical ID) of the custom resource in the CloudFormation template.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`ResourceProperties`
This field contains the contents of the `Properties` object sent by the template developer. Its contents are defined by the custom resource provider.
*Required*: No
*Type*: JSON object

*Example*

```
{
   "RequestType" : "Create",
   "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
   "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/id",

   }
}
```

------
#### [ Update ]

When the template developer makes changes to the properties of a custom resource within the template and updates the stack, CloudFormation sends a request to the custom resource provider with `RequestType` set to `Update`. This means that your custom resource code doesn't have to detect changes in resources because it knows that its properties have changed when the request type is `Update`.

Update requests contain the following fields:

`RequestType`
`Update`.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`RequestId`
A unique ID for the request.
Combining the `StackId` with the `RequestId` forms a value that you can use to uniquely identify a request on a particular custom resource.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`StackId`
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the stack that contains the custom resource.
Combining the `StackId` with the `RequestId` forms a value that you can use to uniquely identify a request on a particular custom resource.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`ResponseURL`
The response URL identifies a presigned S3 bucket that receives responses from the custom resource provider to CloudFormation.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`ResourceType`
The template developer-chosen resource type of the custom resource in the CloudFormation template. Custom resource type names can be up to 60 characters long and can include alphanumeric and the following characters: `_@-`. You can't change the type during an update.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`LogicalResourceId`
The template developer-chosen name (logical ID) of the custom resource in the CloudFormation template.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`PhysicalResourceId`
A custom resource provider-defined physical ID that is unique for that provider.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`ResourceProperties`
This field contains the contents of the `Properties` object sent by the template developer. Its contents are defined by the custom resource provider.
*Required*: No
*Type*: JSON object

`OldResourceProperties`
Used only for `Update` requests. The resource property values that were previously declared by the template developer in the CloudFormation template.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: JSON object

*Example*

```
{
   "RequestType" : "Update",
   "RequestId" : "unique-request-id",
   "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/id",
   "ResponseURL" : "pre-signed-url-for-update-response",
   "ResourceType" : "Custom::MyCustomResourceType",
   "LogicalResourceId" : "resource-logical-id",
   "PhysicalResourceId" : "provider-defined-physical-id",
   "ResourceProperties" : {
      "key1" : "new-string",
      "key2" : [ "new-list" ],
      "key3" : { "key4" : "new-map" }
   },
   "OldResourceProperties" : {
      "key1" : "string",
      "key2" : [ "list" ],
      "key3" : { "key4" : "map" }
   }
}
```

------
#### [ Delete ]

When the template developer deletes the stack or removes the custom resource from the template and then updates the stack, CloudFormation sends a request with `RequestType` set to `Delete`.

Delete requests contain the following fields:

`RequestType`
`Delete`.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`RequestId`
A unique ID for the request.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`StackId`
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the stack that contains the custom resource.

*Type*: String

`LogicalResourceId`
The template developer-chosen name (logical ID) of the custom resource in the CloudFormation template.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`PhysicalResourceId`
A custom resource provider-defined physical ID that is unique for that provider.
*Required*: Yes

   "PhysicalResourceId" : "provider-defined-physical-id",
   "ResourceProperties" : {
      "key1" : "string",
      "key2" : [ "list" ],
      "key3" : { "key4" : "map" }
   }
}
```

## Response object
<a name="crpg-ref-responses"></a>

The custom resource provider sends a response to the pre-signed URL for all request types. If the custom resource provider doesn't send a response, CloudFormation waits until the operation times out.

The response must be a JSON object with the following fields:

`Status`
Must be either `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`RequestId`
A unique ID for the request. Copy this value exactly as it appears in the request.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`StackId`
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the stack that contains the custom resource. Copy this value exactly as it appears in the request.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`LogicalResourceId`
The template developer-chosen name (logical ID) of the custom resource in the CloudFormation template. Copy this value exactly as it appears in the request.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`PhysicalResourceId`
This value should be an identifier unique to the custom resource vendor, and can be up to 1 KB in size. The value must be a non-empty string and must be identical for all responses for the same resource.
When updating custom resources, the value returned for `PhysicalResourceId` determines the update behavior. If the value remains the same, CloudFormation considers it a normal update. If the value changes, CloudFormation interprets the update as a replacement and sends a delete request to the old resource. For more information, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-customresource.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-customresource.html).
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String

`Reason`
Describes the reason for a failure response.
Required if `Status` is `FAILED`. It's optional otherwise.
*Required*: Conditional
*Type*: String

`NoEcho`
Indicates whether to mask the output of the custom resource when retrieved by using the `Fn::GetAtt` function. If set to `true`, all returned values are masked with asterisks (\*\*\*\*\*), *except for those stored in the `Metadata` section of the template*. CloudFormation does not transform, modify, or redact any information you include in the `Metadata` section. The default value is `false`.
For more information about using `NoEcho` to mask sensitive information, see the [Do not embed credentials in your templates](security-best-practices.md#creds) best practice.
Available for `Create` and `Update` responses only. Not supported for `Delete` responses.
*Required*: No
*Type*: Boolean

`Data`
The custom resource provider-defined name-value pairs to send with the response. You can access the values provided here by name in the template with `Fn::GetAtt`.
Available for `Create` and `Update` responses only. Not supported for `Delete` responses.
If the name-value pairs contain sensitive information, you should use the `NoEcho` field to mask the output of the custom resource. Otherwise, the values are visible through APIs that surface property values (such as `DescribeStackEvents`).
*Required*: No
*Type*: JSON object
