# Split a template into reusable pieces using nested stacks
<a name="using-cfn-nested-stacks"></a>

As your infrastructure grows, you might find yourself repeatedly creating identical resource configurations across multiple templates. To avoid this redundancy, you can separate these common configurations into dedicated templates. Then, you can use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-stack.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-stack.html) resource in other templates to reference these dedicated templates, creating nested stacks.

For example, suppose you have a load balancer configuration that you use for most of your stacks. Instead of copying and pasting the same configurations into your templates, you can create a dedicated template for the load balancer. Then, you can reference this template from within other templates that require the same load balancer configuration.

Nested stacks can themselves contain other nested stacks, resulting in a hierarchy of stacks, as shown in the diagram below. The *root stack* is the top-level stack to which all nested stacks ultimately belong. Each nested stack has an immediate parent stack. For the first level of nested stacks, the root stack is also the parent stack.
+ Stack A is the root stack for all the other, nested, stacks in the hierarchy.
+ For stack B, stack A is both the parent stack, and the root stack.
+ For stack D, stack C is the parent stack; while for stack C, stack B is the parent stack.

## Before and after example of splitting a template
<a name="create-nested-stack-template"></a>

This example demonstrates how you can take a single, large CloudFormation template and reorganize it into a more structured and reusable design using nested templates. Initially, the "Before nesting stacks" template shows all the resources defined in one file. This can become messy and hard to manage as the number of resources grows. The "After nesting stacks" template splits up the resources into smaller, separate templates. Each nested stack handles a specific set of related resources, making the overall structure more organized and easier to maintain.

## Example of a nested stack architecture
<a name="nested-stack-examples"></a>

This section demonstrates a nested stack architecture consisting of a top-level stack that references a nested stack. The nested stack deploys a Node.js Lambda function, receives a parameter value from the top-level stack, and returns an output that's exposed through the top-level stack.

### Step 1: Create a template for the nested stack on your local system

39. Outputs:
40.   LambdaArn:
41.     Description: ARN of the created Lambda function
42.     Value: !GetAtt LambdaFunction.Arn
```

### Step 2: Create a template for the top-level stack on your local system
<a name="create-a-nested-stack-parent-template"></a>

The following example shows the format of the top-level stack template and the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-stack.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-cloudformation-stack.html) resource that references the stack you created in the previous step.

#### YAML
<a name="nested-stack-parent-example.yaml"></a>

```
 1. AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
 2. Description: Top-level stack template that deploys a nested stack
 3. Resources:
 4.   NestedStack:
 5.     Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
 6.     Properties:
 7.       TemplateURL: /path_to_template/nested-template.yaml
 8.       Parameters:
 9.         MemorySize: 256
10. Outputs:
11.   NestedStackLambdaArn:
12.     Description: ARN of the Lambda function from nested stack
13.     Value: !GetAtt NestedStack.Outputs.LambdaArn
```

### Step 3: Package and deploy the templates
<a name="create-a-nested-stack-parent-template"></a>

**Note**
When working with templates locally, the AWS CLI **package** command can help you prepare templates for deployment. It automatically handles the upload of local artifacts to Amazon S3 (including `TemplateURL`) and generates a new template file with updated references to these S3 locations. For more information, see [Upload local artifacts to an S3 bucket with the AWS CLI](using-cfn-cli-package.md).

Next, you can use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html) command to upload the nested template to an Amazon S3 bucket.

```
aws cloudformation package \
  --s3-bucket {{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} \
  --template {{/path_to_template/top-level-template.yaml}} \
  --output-template-file {{packaged-template.yaml}} \
  --output json
```

The command generates a new template at the path specified by `--output-template-file`. It replaces the `TemplateURL` reference with the Amazon S3 location, as shown below.

**Resulting template**

```
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: Top-level stack template that deploys a nested stack
Resources:
  NestedStack:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack
    Properties:
      TemplateURL: https://s3.{{us-west-2}}.amazonaws.com/{{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}}/{{8b3bb7aa7abfc6e37e2d06b869484bed}}.template
      Parameters:
        MemorySize: 256
Outputs:
  NestedStackLambdaArn:
    Description: ARN of the Lambda function from nested stack
    Value:
      Fn::GetAtt:
      - NestedStack
      - Outputs.LambdaArn
```

After you run the **package** command, you can deploy the processed template using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deploy/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deploy/) command. For nested stacks that contain IAM resources, you must acknowledge IAM capabilities by including the `--capabilities` option.

```
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file {{packaged-template.yaml}} \
  --stack-name {{stack-name}} \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## Performing stack operations on nested stacks
<a name="perform-stack-operations-on-nested-stacks"></a>

When working with nested stacks, you must handle them carefully during operations. Certain stack operations, such as stack updates, should be initiated from the root stack rather than performed directly on the nested stacks. When you update a root stack, only nested stacks with template changes will be updated.

Additionally, the presence of the nested stacks can affect operations on the root stack. For example, if one nested stack becomes stuck in `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` state, the root stack will wait until that nested stack completes its rollback before continuing. Before proceeding with update operations, make sure that you have IAM permissions to cancel a stack update in case it rolls back. For more information, see [Control CloudFormation access with AWS Identity and Access Management](control-access-with-iam.md).

Use the following procedures to find the root stack and nested stacks.

**To view the root stack of a nested stack**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the **Stacks** page, choose the name of the nested stack you want to view the root stack of.

   Nested stacks display **NESTED** above their stack name.

1. On the **Stack info** tab, in the **Overview** section, choose the stack name listed as **Root stack**.

**To view the nested stacks that belong to a root stack**

1. From the root stack whose nested stacks you want to view, choose the **Resources** tab.

1. In the **Type** column, look for resources of type **AWS::CloudFormation::Stack**.

## Express mode and nested stacks
<a name="nested-stacks-express-mode"></a>

When you use express mode on a parent stack, the setting propagates to all nested stacks in the hierarchy. You don't need to specify express mode for each nested stack separately. All resources across the hierarchy complete as soon as CloudFormation applies their configuration.

For more information about express mode, see [Express mode](cloudformation-express-mode.md).
