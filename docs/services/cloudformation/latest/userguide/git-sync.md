# Syncing stacks with source code stored in a Git repository with Git sync

With Git sync, you can manage your CloudFormation stacks with source control. You do this by
configuring CloudFormation to monitor a Git repository. The repository is monitored for changes to
two files:

- A CloudFormation template file that defines a stack

- A stack deployment file that contains parameters that configure the stack

With Git sync, you can use pull requests and version tracking to configure, deploy, and
update your CloudFormation stacks from a centralized location. When you commit changes to the
template or the deployment file, CloudFormation automatically updates the stack. If you use pull
requests, CloudFormation can leave a comment on the pull request explaining what changes will be
made to your stack before actually updating it. However, you need to enable this feature first.

Git sync provides a console interface that you can use to link to a repository, generate a
stack deployment file, update a CloudFormation template, and submit a pull request to your
repository. Git sync also provides a status dashboard that you can use to monitor, edit, and
troubleshoot active Git sync stack deployments. Git sync is accessed through the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) when you [create a stack](cfn-console-create-stack.md). You can also access Git sync using
CodeConnections. For more information, see [Working with sync configurations for\
linked repositories](../../../dtconsole/latest/userguide/configurations.md) in the _Developer Tools Console User_
_Guide_.

Git sync supports [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), and [GitLab self-managed](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/self_managed) repositories.
