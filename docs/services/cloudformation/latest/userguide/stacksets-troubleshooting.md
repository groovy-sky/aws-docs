## Common reasons for stack operation failure

Problem: A stack operation failed, and the stack
instance status is `OUTDATED`.

Cause: There can be several common causes for stack
operation failure.

- Insufficient permissions in a target account for creating resources that are
specified in your template.

- The CloudFormation template might have errors. Validate the template in CloudFormation
and fix errors before trying to create your StackSet.

- The template could be trying to create global resources that must be unique
but aren't, such as S3 buckets.

- A specified target account number doesn't exist. Check the target account
numbers that you specified on the **Set deployment options**
page of the wizard.

- The administrator account does not have a trust relationship with the target
account.

- The maximum number of a resource that is specified in your template already
exists in your target account. For example, you might have reached the limit of
allowed IAM roles in a target account, but the template creates more IAM
roles.

- You have reached the maximum number of stacks that are allowed in a StackSet. For
the maximum number of stacks per StackSet, see [Understand CloudFormation quotas](cloudformation-limits.md).

Solution: For more information about the permissions
required of target and administrator accounts before you can create StackSets, see
[Give all users of the administrator account permissions to manage stacks in all target accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html#stacksets-prereqs-accountsetup).

## Retrying failed stack creation or update operations

Problem: A stack creation or update failed, and the
stack instance status is `OUTDATED`. To troubleshoot why a stack creation or
update failed, open the CloudFormation console, and view the events for the stack, which
will have a status of `DELETED` (for failed create operations) or
`FAILED` (for failed update operations). Browse the stack events, and
find the **Status reason** column. The value of **Status**
**reason** explains why the stack operation failed.

After you have fixed the underlying cause of the stack creation failure, and you are
ready to retry stack creation, perform the following steps.

Solution: Perform the following steps to retry your
stack operation.

1. In the console, select the StackSet that contains the stack on which the operation
    failed.

2. In the **Actions** menu, choose **Edit StackSet**
**details** to retry creating or updating stacks.

3. On the **Specify template** page, to use the same CloudFormation
    template, keep the default option, **Use current template**. If
    your stack operation failed because the template required changes, and you want
    to upload a revised template, choose **Upload a template to Amazon**
**S3** instead, and then choose **Browse** to select
    your updated template. When you are finished uploading your revised template,
    choose **Next**.

4. On the **Specify stack details** page, if you are not
    changing any parameters that are specific to your template, choose
    **Next**.

5. On the **Set deployment options** page, change defaults for
    **Maximum concurrent accounts** and **Failure**
**tolerance**, if desired. For more information about these settings,
    see [StackSet operation options](stacksets-concepts.md#stackset-ops-options).

6. On the **Review** page, review your selections, and fill the
    checkbox to acknowledge required IAM capabilities. Choose
    **Submit**.

7. If your stack is not successfully updated, repeat this procedure, after you've
    resolved any underlying issues that are preventing stack creation.

## Stack instance deletion fails

Problem: A stack deletion has failed.

Cause: Stack deletion will fail for any stacks on which
termination protection has been enabled.

Solution: Determine if termination protection has been
enabled for the stack. If it has, disable termination protection and then perform the
stack instance deletion again.

## Stack import operation fails

Problem: A stack import operation fails to import
existing stacks into new or existing StackSets. The stack instance is in an
`INOPERABLE` status.

Solution: Revert the stack import operation, by
completing the following tasks.

1. Use **Delete Stacks from StackSets** option and enable
    **RetainStacks** during configuration, then proceed to
    delete stack instances from your StackSet. For more information, For more
    information, see [Delete stacks from CloudFormation StackSets](stackinstances-delete.md).

2. You will see the stack instances of the StackSet are updated to remove the
    `INOPERABLE` stack instance.

3. Fix the stack instances according to the import failure error and retry the
    stack import operation.

## Stack instance failure count for StackSets operations

The stack instance failure count alerts you if stack instances fail to provision or
update. These stack instances didn't deploy because of one or more of the following
reasons:

- Existing resource(s) with a similar configuration

- Missing dependencies, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles

- Other conflicting factors

If you want to deploy with maximum concurrency, max concurrency count is one more than
the failure tolerance count, at most. For example, if the failure tolerance count is 9,
then max concurrency count can’t be more than 10. This will cause the operation to
return `SUCCEEDED` even if some stack instances fail to update. The new stack
instance failure count enables you to determine if the operation only conditionally
succeeded because the failure tolerance count is set to allow all failures.

You can use the AWS Management Console, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI to get the failure count and filter
stack instances to determine which instances need to be redeployed.

### Using the console

###### To view the number of failed stack instances:

1. Open the [CloudFormation\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) and choose **StackSets**.

2. Choose your StackSet, and then choose the **Operations**
    tab.

3. Choose a status in the **Status** column to view the
    status details. You will find the number of failed stack instances for a
    particular operation in the status details.

###### To view the account, region, and status of stack instances for the operation:

1. In the status details, choose the failed stack instances count.
    _Example:_ **Stack instances: `<number of failed stack**
**instances>`**.

2. Expand the side panel by choosing the panel header. The results in the
    side panel are the statuses of the stack instances after the completion of
    the selected operation.

###### To view the current stack instance details for an operation:

1. Choose the **Stack Instances** tab.

2. Filter by **Last operation ID**. The results are the
    current statuses and status reasons from the last operation to modify the
    instance. You can use this filter in combination with **AWS**
**account**, **AWS region**,
    **Detailed Status**, and **Drift**
**status** to further refine your search results.

### Using the AWS CLI

To get the number of failed stack instances, call
`describe-stack-set-operation` or
`list-stack-set-operations` and see
`StatusDetails`.

To get a historical overview for a particular operation, use
`list-stack-set-operation-results` to view the status and status
reason for each stack instance after the operation completed. See the following
example to find the `Status` and `StatusReason`:

```nohighlight

Use `list-stack-instances` with the `DETAILED_STATUS` and
`LAST_OPERATION_ID` filters to get a list of stack instances that
failed in the last operation that tried to deploy the stack instance. See the
`--filters` flag in the example with `DETAILED_STATUS` and
`LAST_OPERATION_ID`:

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation list-stack-instances --stack-set-name ss1 \
  --filters Name=DETAILED_STATUS,Values=FAILED Name=LAST_OPERATION_ID,Values=5550e62f-c822-4331-88fa-21c1d7bafc60
