# Register a delegated administrator member account

In addition to your organization's management account, member accounts with
delegated administrator permissions can create and manage StackSets with
service-managed permissions for the organization. StackSets with service-managed
permissions are created in the management account, including StackSets created by
delegated administrators. To be registered as a delegated administrator for your
organization, your member account must be in the organization. For more information
about joining an organization, see [Inviting\
an AWS account to join your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html).

Your organization can have up to five registered delegated administrators at one
time. Delegated administrators can choose to deploy to all accounts in your
organization or specific OUs. Trusted access with AWS Organizations must be activated before
delegated administrators can deploy to accounts managed by Organizations. For more
information, see [Activate trusted access for StackSets with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.html).

###### Important

Please be aware of the following:

- Delegated administrators have full permissions to deploy to accounts
in your organization. The management account can't limit delegated
administrator permissions to deploy to specific OUs or to perform
specific StackSet operations.

- Make sure your delegated administrators have
`organizations:ListDelegatedAdministrators` permissions
to avoid any potential errors.

You can register delegated administrators for your organization in the following
Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California),
US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul),
