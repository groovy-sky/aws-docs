# Roll back your CloudFormation stack on alarm breach with rollback triggers

With rollback triggers, you can have CloudFormation monitor the state of your application during
stack creation and updating, and roll back that operation if the application breaches the
threshold of the alarms you've specified. For each rollback trigger you create, you specify
the CloudWatch alarm that CloudFormation should monitor. CloudFormation monitors the specified alarms
during the stack create or update operation, and for the specified amount of time after all
resources have been deployed. If any of the alarms goes to `ALARM` state during
the stack operation or the monitoring period, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack
operation.

You can set a monitoring time from the default of 0 up to 180 minutes. During this time,
CloudFormation monitors all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation
deploys all necessary resources. If any of the alarms goes to `ALARM` state
during the stack operation or this monitoring period, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack
operation. Then, for update operations, if the monitoring period expires without any alarms
going to `ALARM` state, CloudFormation proceeds to dispose of old resources as usual.
If you set a monitoring time but don't specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits
the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources for update operations. You can
use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually
cancel the stack creation or update as necessary. If you set a monitoring time of 0 minutes,
CloudFormation still monitors the rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations
and rolls back the operation if an alarm goes to `ALARM` state. Then, for update
operations with no breaching alarms, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once
the operation completes.

By default, CloudFormation only rolls back stack operations if an alarm goes to
`ALARM` state, not `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state. To have CloudFormation
roll back the stack operation if an alarm goes to `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state as
well, edit the CloudWatch alarm to treat missing data as `breaching`. For more
information, see [Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing data](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/alarmthatsendsemail.md#alarms-and-missing-data) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

CloudFormation doesn't monitor rollback triggers when it rolls back a stack during an update
operation.

You can add a maximum of 5 rollback triggers. To add a rollback trigger, specify the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch alarm. Currently, `AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm`
and `AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm` types can be used as rollback triggers. For
more information about CloudWatch alarms, see [Using CloudWatch\
alarms](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/alarmthatsendsemail.md) in _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

If a given CloudWatch alarm is missing, the entire stack operation fails and rolls back.

Be aware that access to CloudWatch requires credentials. Those credentials must have permissions
to access AWS resources, such as retrieving CloudWatch metric data about your resources. For
more information, see [Authentication and access control for CloudWatch](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/auth-and-access-control-cw.md) in
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

## Add rollback triggers during stack creation or updating

###### To add rollback triggers during stack creation or update (console)

1. When creating or updating a stack, on the **Configure stack**
**options** page, under **Advanced options**, expand
    the **Rollback configuration** section.

2. Enter a monitoring time between `0` – `180`
    minutes. The default value is `0`.

3. Specify the ARN of the CloudWatch alarm or composite alarm you want to use as a
    rollback trigger, and choose **Add CloudWatch alarm ARN**.

For example, the following is an ARN for a CloudWatch alarm or composite alarm,
    `arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-east-1:123456789012:alarm:MyAlarmName`.

4. Choose **Next** and review the details of your stack.

5. When you're ready, choose **Submit** to create or update the
    stack.

###### To add rollback triggers during stack creation or update (AWS CLI)

Use the [create-stack](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.md) or [update-stack](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.md) command with the
`--rollback-configuration` option.

For example, the following **update-stack** command sets
`MyCompositeAlarm` as a rollback trigger with a 5-minute
monitoring period:

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name MyStack \
  --use-previous-template \
  --rollback-configuration \
  "RollbackTriggers=[{Arn=arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-east-1:123456789012:alarm:MyCompositeAlarm,Type=AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm}],MonitoringTimeInMinutes=5"
```

## Add rollback triggers to a change set

To add rollback triggers to a change set (console)

1. When creating a change set, on the **Configure stack**
**options** page, under **Advanced options**, expand
    the **Rollback configuration** section.

2. Enter a monitoring time between `0` – `180`
    minutes. The default value is `5`.

3. Specify the ARN of the CloudWatch alarm or composite alarm you want to use as a
    rollback trigger, and choose **Add CloudWatch alarm ARN**.

For example, the following is an ARN for a CloudWatch alarm or composite alarm,
    `arn:aws:cloudwatch:us-east-1:123456789012:alarm:MyAlarmName`.

4. Choose **Next** and review the details of your change
    set.

5. When you're ready, choose **Create change set** to create the
    change set.

###### To add rollback triggers to a change set (AWS CLI)

Use the [create-change-set](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-change-set.md) command with the
`--rollback-configuration` option.

**configuration** section to view the rollback triggers.

## View rollback triggers for a change set

To view rollback triggers for a change set, see the **Rollback**
**configuration** section.

1. On the **Stacks** page, choose the stack you want to view
    from the list on the left.

2. Choose the **Change sets** tab, and then choose the change set you
    want to view.

3. Choose the **Input** tab, and view the **Rollback**
**configuration** section.
