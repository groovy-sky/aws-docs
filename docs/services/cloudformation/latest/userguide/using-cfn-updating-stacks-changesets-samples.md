# Example change sets for CloudFormation stacks

This section provides examples of the change sets that CloudFormation would create for common
stack changes. They show how to edit a template directly; modify a single input parameter;
plan for resource recreation (replacements), which prevents you from losing data that wasn't
backed up or interrupting applications that are running in your stack; and add and remove
resources. To illustrate how change sets work, we'll walk through the changes that were
submitted and discuss the resulting change set. Because each example builds on and assumes
that you understand the previous example, we recommend that you read them in order. For a
description of each field in a change set, see the [Change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Change.html) data type in the _AWS CloudFormation API Reference_.

You can use the [console](using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets-view.md),
AWS CLI, or CloudFormation [DescribeChangeSet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeChangeSet.html) API operation to view change set details.

We generated each of the following change sets from a stack with the
following [sample template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/user-guide/changesets/ec2-instance.txt):

```json

{
  "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09",
  "Description" : "A sample EC2 instance template for testing change sets.",
  "Parameters" : {
    "Purpose" : {
      "Type" : "String",
      "Default" : "testing",
      "AllowedValues" : ["testing", "production"],
      "Description" : "The purpose of this instance."
    },
    "KeyPairName" : {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName",
      "Description" : "Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instance"
    },
    "InstanceType" : {
      "Type" : "String",
      "Default" : "t2.micro",
      "AllowedValues" : ["t2.micro", "t2.small", "t2.medium"],
      "Description" : "The EC2 instance type."
    }
  },
  "Resources" : {
    "MyEC2Instance" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::EC2::Instance",
      "Properties" : {
        "KeyName" : { "Ref" : "KeyPairName" },
        "InstanceType" : { "Ref" : "InstanceType" },
        "ImageId" : "ami-8fcee4e5",
        "Tags" : [
          {
            "Key" : "Purpose",
            "Value" : { "Ref" : "Purpose" }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Directly editing a template

When you directly modify resources in the stack's template to generate a change set,
CloudFormation classifies the change as a direct modification, as opposed to changes initiated
by an updated parameter value. The following change set, which added a new tag to the
`i-1abc23d4` instance, is an example of a direct modification. All other input
values, such as the parameter values and capabilities, are unchanged, so we'll focus on the
`Changes` structure.

```json

            "ParameterKey": "InstanceType"
        }
    ],
    "Changes": [
        {
            "ResourceChange": {
                "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                "PhysicalResourceId": "i-1abc23d4",
                "Details": [
                    {
                        "ChangeSource": "DirectModification",
                        "Evaluation": "Static",
                        "Target": {
                            "Attribute": "Tags",
                            "RequiresRecreation": "Never"
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "Action": "Modify",
                "Scope": [
                    "Tags"
                ],
                "LogicalResourceId": "MyEC2Instance",
                "Replacement": "False"
            },
            "Type": "Resource"
        }
    ],
    "CreationTime": "2020-11-18T23:35:25.813Z",
    "Capabilities": [],
    "StackName": "MyStack",
    "NotificationARNs": [],
    "ChangeSetId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:changeSet/SampleChangeSet-direct/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000"
}
```

In the `Changes` structure, there's only one `ResourceChange`
structure. This structure describes information such as the type of resource CloudFormation will
change, the action CloudFormation will take, the ID of the resource, the scope of the change,
and whether the change requires a replacement (where CloudFormation creates a new resource and
then deletes the old one). In the example, the change set indicates that CloudFormation will
modify the `Tags` attribute of the `i-1abc23d4` EC2 instance, and
doesn't require the instance to be replaced.

In the `Details` structure, CloudFormation labels this change as a direct
modification that will never require the instance to be recreated (replaced). You can
confidently execute this change, knowing that CloudFormation won't replace the instance.

CloudFormation shows this change as a `Static` evaluation. A static evaluation
means that CloudFormation can determine the tag's value before executing the change set. In some
cases, CloudFormation can determine a value only after you execute a change set. CloudFormation
labels those changes as `Dynamic` evaluations. For example, if you reference an
updated resource that's conditionally replaced, CloudFormation can't determine whether the
reference to the updated resource will change.

## Modifying an input parameter value

When you modify an input parameter value, CloudFormation generates two changes for each
resource that uses the updated parameter value. In this example, we want to highlight what
those changes look like and which information you should focus on. The following example was
generated by changing the value of the `Purpose` input parameter only.

The `Purpose` parameter specifies a tag key value for the EC2 instance. In
the example, the parameter value was changed from `testing` to
`production`. The new value is shown in the `Parameters`
structure.

                        }

}
```

The `Changes` structure functions similar to way it does in the [Directly editing a template](#using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets-samples-directly-editing-a-template)
example. There's only one `ResourceChange` structure; it describes a change to
the `Tags` attribute of the `i-1abc23d4` EC2 instance.

However, in the `Details` structure, the change set shows two changes for the
`Tags` attribute, even though only a single parameter value was changed.
Resources that reference a changed parameter value (using the `Ref` intrinsic
function) always result in two changes: one with a `Dynamic` evaluation and
another with a `Static` evaluation. You can see these types of changes by viewing
the following fields:

- For the `Static` evaluation change, view the `ChangeSource`
field. In this example, the `ChangeSource` field equals
`ParameterReference`, meaning that this change is a result of an updated
parameter reference value. The change set must contain a similar `Dynamic`
evaluation change.

- You can find the matching `Dynamic` evaluation change by comparing the
`Target` structure for both changes, which will contain the same
information. In this example, the `Target` structures for both changes
contain the same values for the `Attribute` and
`RequireRecreation` fields.

For these types of changes, focus on the static evaluation, which gives you the most
detailed information about the change. In this example, the static evaluation shows that the
change is the result of a change in a parameter reference value
( `ParameterReference`). The exact parameter that was changed is indicated by
the `CauseEntity` field (the `Purpose` parameter).

## Determining the value of the replacement field

The `Replacement` field in a `ResourceChange` structure indicates
whether CloudFormation will recreate the resource. Planning for resource recreation
(replacements) prevents you from losing data that wasn't backed up or interrupting
applications that are running in your stack.

The value in the `Replacement` field depends on whether a change requires a
replacement, indicated by the `RequiresRecreation` field in a change's
`Target` structure. For example, if the `RequiresRecreation` field
is `Never`, the `Replacement` field is `False`. However, if
there are multiple changes on a single resource and each change has a different value for
the `RequiresRecreation` field, CloudFormation updates the resource using the most
intrusive behavior. In other words, if only one of the many changes requires a replacement,
CloudFormation must replace the resource and, therefore, sets the `Replacement` field
to `True`.

The following change set was generated by changing the values for every parameter
( `Purpose`, `InstanceType`, and `KeyPairName`), which are
all used by the EC2 instance. With these changes, CloudFormation will be required to replace the
instance because the `Replacement` field is equal to `True`.

Identify the change that requires the resource to be replaced by viewing each change
(the static evaluations in the `Details` structure). In this example, each change
has a different value for the `RequireRecreation` field, but the change to the
`KeyName` property has the most intrusive update behavior, always requiring a
recreation. CloudFormation will replace the instance because the key name was changed.

If the key name were unchanged, the change to the `InstanceType` property
would have the most intrusive update behavior ( `Conditionally`), so the
`Replacement` field would be `Conditionally`. To find the conditions
in which CloudFormation replaces the instance, view the update behavior for the
`InstanceType` property of the [AWS::EC2::Instance](../templatereference/aws-resource-ec2-instance.md) resource type.

## Adding and removing resources

The following example was generated by submitting a modified template that removes the
EC2 instance and adds an Auto Scaling group and launch configuration.

In the `Changes` structure, there are three `ResourceChange`
structures, one for each resource. For each resource, the `Action` field
indicates whether CloudFormation adds or removes the resource. The `Scope` and
`Details` fields are empty because they apply only to modified
resources.

For new resources, CloudFormation can't determine the value of some fields until you execute
the change set. For example, CloudFormation doesn't provide the physical IDs of the Auto Scaling group
and launch configuration because they don't exist yet. CloudFormation creates the new resources
when you execute the change set.

## Viewing property-level changes

The following example shows property-level changes to the `Tag` property of
an Amazon EC2 instance. The tag `Value` and `Key` will change to
`Test`.

            }
        }
    ]
```

The `Details` structure shows the values for `Key` and
`Value` before the change set is executed, and what they will be after the
change set is executed.
