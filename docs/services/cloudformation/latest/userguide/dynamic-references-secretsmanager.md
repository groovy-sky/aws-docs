# Get a secret or secret value from Secrets Manager

Secrets Manager is a service that allows you to securely store and manage secrets like database
credentials, passwords, and third-party API keys. Using Secrets Manager, you can store and control
access to these secrets centrally, so that you can replace hardcoded credentials in your
code (including passwords), with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret
programmatically. For more information, see [What\
is AWS Secrets Manager?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html) in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

To use entire secrets or secret values that are stored in Secrets Manager within your CloudFormation
templates, you use `secretsmanager` dynamic references.

## Best practices

Follow these best practices when using Secrets Manager dynamic references in your CloudFormation
templates:

- Use versionless references for your CloudFormation
templates – Store credentials in Secrets Manager and use dynamic
references without specifying `version-stage` or
`version-id` parameters to support proper secret rotation
workflows.

- Leverage automatic rotation – Use
Secrets Manager's automatic rotation feature with versionless dynamic references for
credential management. This ensures your credentials are regularly updated
without requiring template changes. For more information, see [Rotate\
AWS Secrets Manager secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html).

- Use versioned references sparingly –
Only specify explicit `version-stage` or `version-id`
parameters for specific scenarios like testing or rollback
situations.

## Considerations

When using `secretsmanager` dynamic references, there are important
considerations to keep in mind:

- CloudFormation doesn't track which version of a secret was used in previous
deployments. Plan your secret management strategy carefully before
implementing dynamic references. Use versionless references when possible to
leverage automatic secret rotation. Monitor and validate resource updates
when making changes to dynamic reference configurations, such as when
transitioning from unversioned to versioned dynamic references, and vice
versa.

- Updating only the secret value in Secrets Manager doesn't automatically cause
CloudFormation to retrieve the new value. CloudFormation retrieves the secret value
only during resource creation or updates that modify the resource containing
the dynamic reference.

For example, suppose your template includes an [AWS::RDS::DBInstance](../templatereference/aws-resource-rds-dbinstance.md) resource where the
`MasterPassword` property is set to a Secrets Manager dynamic
reference. After creating a stack from this template, you update the
secret's value in Secrets Manager. However, the `MasterPassword` property
retains the old password value.

To apply the new secret value, you'll need to modify the
`AWS::RDS::DBInstance` resource in your CloudFormation template
and perform a stack update.

To avoid this manual process in the future, consider using Secrets Manager to
automatically rotate the secret.

- Dynamic references for secure values, such as `secretsmanager`,
aren't currently supported in custom resources.

- The `secretsmanager` dynamic reference can be used in all
resource properties. Using the `secretsmanager` dynamic reference
indicates that neither Secrets Manager nor CloudFormation logs should persist any resolved
secret value. However, the secret value may show up in the service whose
resource it's being used in. Review your usage to avoid leaking secret
data.

## Permissions

To specify a secret stored in Secrets Manager, you must have permission to call [GetSecretValue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_GetSecretValue.html) for the secret.

## Reference pattern

To reference Secrets Manager secrets in your CloudFormation template, use the following
`secretsmanager` reference pattern.

```nohighlight

{{resolve:secretsmanager:secret-id:secret-string:json-key:version-stage:version-id}}
```

`secret-id`

The name or ARN of the secret.

To access a secret in your AWS account, you need only specify the
secret name. To access a secret in a different AWS account, specify
the complete ARN of the secret.

Required.

`secret-string`

The only supported value is `SecretString`. The default is
`SecretString`.

`json-key`

The key name of the key-value pair whose value you want to retrieve.
If you don't specify a `json-key`, CloudFormation retrieves the
entire secret text.

This segment may not include the colon character (
`:`).

`version-stage`

The staging label of the version of the secret to use. Secrets Manager uses
staging labels to keep track of different versions during the rotation
process. If you use `version-stage` then don't specify
`version-id`. If you don't specify either
`version-stage` or `version-id`, then the
default is the `AWSCURRENT` version.

This segment may not include the colon character (
`:`).

`version-id`

The unique identifier of the version of the secret to use. If you
specify `version-id`, then don't specify
`version-stage`. If you don't specify either
`version-stage` or `version-id`, then the
default is the `AWSCURRENT` version.

This segment may not include the colon character (
`:`).

### Retrieving user name and password values from a secret

The following [AWS::RDS::DBInstance](../templatereference/aws-resource-rds-dbinstance.md) example retrieves the user
name and password values stored in the
`MySecret` secret. This example shows
the recommended pattern for versionless dynamic references, which automatically
uses the `AWSCURRENT` version and supports Secrets Manager rotation workflows
without requiring template changes.

#### JSON

```json

{
    "MyRDSInstance": {
        "Type": "AWS::RDS::DBInstance",
        "Properties": {
            "DBName": "MyRDSInstance",
            "AllocatedStorage": "20",
            "DBInstanceClass": "db.t2.micro",
            "Engine": "mysql",
            "MasterUsername": "{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret:SecretString:username}}",
            "MasterUserPassword": "{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret:SecretString:password}}"
        }
    }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

  MyRDSInstance:
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    Properties:
      DBName: MyRDSInstance
      AllocatedStorage: '20'
      DBInstanceClass: db.t2.micro
      Engine: mysql
      MasterUsername: '{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret:SecretString:username}}'
      MasterUserPassword: '{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret:SecretString:password}}'
```

### Retrieving the entire SecretString

The following dynamic reference retrieves the `SecretString` for
`MySecret`.

```nohighlight

{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret}}
```

Alternatively:

```nohighlight

{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret::::}}
```

### Retrieving a value from a specific version of a secret

The following dynamic reference retrieves the
`password` value for the
`AWSPREVIOUS` version of
`MySecret`.

```nohighlight

{{resolve:secretsmanager:MySecret:SecretString:password:AWSPREVIOUS}}
```

### Retrieving secrets from another AWS account

The following dynamic reference retrieves the `SecretString` for
`MySecret` that's in another
AWS account. You must specify the complete secret ARN to access secrets in
another AWS account.

```nohighlight

{{resolve:secretsmanager:arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MySecret}}
```

The following dynamic reference retrieves the
`password` value for
`MySecret` that's in another
AWS account. You must specify the complete secret ARN to access secrets in
another AWS account.

```nohighlight

{{resolve:secretsmanager:arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MySecret:SecretString:password}}
```
