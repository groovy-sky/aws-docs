# Managing extensions with the CloudFormation registry

The CloudFormation registry serves as a centralized hub for managing extensions that can be
integrated into the CloudFormation templates in your AWS account. Extensions include resource
types, modules, and Hooks from AWS and third-party publishers, and your own custom
extensions. The registry makes it easier to discover and provision extensions in your
CloudFormation templates in the same manner you use AWS-provided resources.

This section describes how to use the CloudFormation registry to activate third-party
extensions in your account, including:

- Activating public extensions

- Registering and activating private extensions

If you are a developer interested in creating your own extensions, see the following
documentation:

using the CloudFormation CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/modules.html) in the _CloudFormation Command Line_
_Interface User Guide_

- [Creating\
resource types using the CloudFormation CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html) in the _CloudFormation_
_Command Line Interface User Guide_

- [Developing custom Hooks using the CloudFormation CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/hooks-userguide/hooks-develop.html) in the
_CloudFormation Hooks User Guide_

Additionally, all provisionable AWS resource types available in the CloudFormation
registry can be used with the AWS Cloud Control API, with their attributes and properties defined
in a standard JSON schema. For more information, see the [Cloud Control API User\
Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html). When using Cloud Control API to perform CRUDL (Create, Read, Update, Delete,
List) operations on AWS resources, you can only do so on AWS resources within your
own AWS account.
