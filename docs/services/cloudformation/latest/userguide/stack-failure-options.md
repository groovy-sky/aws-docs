# Choose how to handle failures when provisioning resources
<a name="stack-failure-options"></a>

If your stack operation fails, you don't have to roll back resources that were already successfully provisioned and start over from the beginning every time. Instead, you can troubleshoot resources in a `CREATE_FAILED` or `UPDATE_FAILED` status, and then resume provisioning from the point where the problem occurred.

To do this, you must enable the preserve successfully provisioned resources option. This option is available for all stack deployments and change set operations.
+ For stack creation, if you choose the **Preserve successfully provisioned resources** option, CloudFormation preserves the state of resources that were successfully created and leaves the failed ones in a failed state until the next update operation is performed.
+ During update and change set operations, choosing **Preserve successfully provisioned resources** preserves the state of successful resources while rolling back failed resources to their last known stable state. Failed resources will be in an `UPDATE_FAILED` state. Resources without a last known stable state will be deleted upon the next stack operation.

## Overview of stack failure options
<a name="stack-failure-options-overview"></a>

Before issuing an operation from the CloudFormation console, API, or AWS CLI, specify the behavior for provisioned resource failure. Then, proceed with the deployment process of your resources without any other modifications. In the event of an operational failure, CloudFormation stops at the first failure in each independent provisioning path. CloudFormation identifies dependencies between resources to parallelize independent provisioning actions. Then it proceeds to provision resources on each independent provisioning path until it encounters a failure. A failure in one path doesn’t affect other provisioning paths. CloudFormation will continue to provision the resources until completion or stop on a different failure.

Remediate any issues to continue the deployment process. CloudFormation performs the necessary updates before retrying provisioning actions on resources that couldn’t be successfully provisioned earlier. You remediate issues by submitting a **Retry**, **Update**, or **Roll back** operations. For example, if you're provisioning an Amazon EC2 instance and the EC2 instance fails during a create operation, you might want to investigate the error, rather than rolling back the failed resource right away. You can review system status checks and instances status checks, and then select the **Retry** operation once the issues is resolved.

When a stack operation fails, and you've specified **Preserve successfully provisioned resources** from the **Stack failure options** menu, you can select the following options.
+ **Retry** – Retries provisioning operation on failed resources and continues provisioning the template until the successful completion of the stack operation or the next failure. Select this option if the resource failed to provision due to an issue that doesn't require template modifications, such as an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission.
+ **Update** – Resources that have been provisioned are updated on template updates. Resources that failed to create or update will be retried. Select this option if the resource failed to provision due to template errors, and you've modified the template. When you update a stack that's in a `FAILED` state, you must select **Preserve successfully provisioned resources** for the **Stack failure options** to continue updating your stack.
+ **Roll back** – CloudFormation rolls back the stack to the last known stable state.

## Required conditions for pausing stack rollback
<a name="stack-failure-options-conditions"></a>

To prevent CloudFormation from automatically rolling back and deleting the resources that were successfully created, the following conditions must be met.

1. When you create or update the stack, you must choose the option to **Preserve successfully provisioned resources**. This tells CloudFormation not to delete the resources that were created successfully, even if the overall stack operation fails.

1. The stack operation must have failed, meaning the stack status is either `CREATE_FAILED` or `UPDATE_FAILED`.

**Note**
Immutable update types aren't supported.

------
#### [ Create stack ]

**To preserve successfully provisioned resources during a create stack operation**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. From the **Stacks** page, choose **Create stack** at top right, and then choose **With new resources (standard)**.

1. For **Prerequisite - Prepare template**, choose **Choose an existing template**.

1. Under **Specify template**, choose to either specify the URL for the S3 bucket that contains your stack template or upload a stack template file. Then, choose **Next**.

1. On the **Specify stack details** page, enter a stack name in the **Stack name** box.

1. In the **Parameters** section, specify parameters that are defined in your stack template.

   You can use or change any parameters with default values.

1. When you're satisfied with the parameter values, choose **Next**.

1. On the **Configure stack options** page, you can set additional options for your stack.

1. For **Stack failure options**, select **Preserve successfully provisioned resources**.

1. When you're satisfied with the stack options, choose **Next**.

1. Review your stack on the **Review** page and select **Create stack**.

*Results*: Resources that failed to create transition the stack status to `CREATE_FAILED` to prevent the stack from rolling back when the stack operation encounters a failure. Resources that are successfully provisioned are in a `CREATE_COMPLETE` state. You can monitor the stack in the **Stack events** tab.

------
#### [ Update stack ]

**To preserve successfully provisioned resources during an update stack operation**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. Select the stack you want to update and then choose **Update**.

1. On the **Update stack** page, choose a stack template by using one of the following options:
   + **Use existing template**
   + **Replace current template**
   + **Edit template in Infrastructure Composer**

   Accept your settings and select **Next**.

1. On the **Specify stack details** page, specify parameters that are defined in your stack template.

   You can use or change any parameters with default values.

1. When you're satisfied with the parameter values, choose **Next**.

1. On the **Configure stack options** page, you can set additional options for your stack.

1. For the **Behavior on provisioning failure**, select **Preserve successfully provisioned resources**.

1. When you're satisfied with the stack options, choose **Next**.

1. Review your stack on the **Review** page and select **Update stack**.

*Results*: Resources that failed to update transition the stack status to `UPDATE_FAILED` and roll back to the last known stable state. Resources without a last known stable state will be deleted by CloudFormation upon the next stack operation. Resources that are successfully provisioned are in a `CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE` state. You can monitor the stack in the **Stack events** tab.

------
#### [ Change set ]

**Note**
You can initiate a change set for a stack with a status of `CREATE_FAILED` or `UPDATE_FAILED`, but not for a status of `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED`.

**To Preserve successfully provisioned resources during a change set operation**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. Select the stack that contains the change set you want to initiate, and then choose the **Change sets** tab.

1. Select the change set and then choose **Execute**.

1. For **Execute change set**, select the **Preserve successfully provisioned resources** option.

1. Select **Execute change set**.

*Results*: Resources that failed to update transition the stack status to `UPDATE_FAILED` and roll back to the last known stable state. Resources without a last known stable state will be deleted by CloudFormation upon the next stack operation. Resources that are successfully provisioned are in a `CREATE_COMPLETE` or `UPDATE_COMPLETE` state. You can monitor the stack in the **Stack events** tab.

### Rolling back a stack
<a name="roll-back-stack-cli"></a>

You can use the [rollback-stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/rollback-stack.html) command to roll back a stack with a `CREATE_FAILED` or `UPDATE_FAILED` stack status to its last stable state.

The following **rollback-stack** command rolls back the specified stack.

```
aws cloudformation rollback-stack --stack-name {{myteststack}}
```

The command returns the following output.

```
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stack/myteststack/466df9e0-0dff-08e3-8e2f-5088487c4896"
}
```

**Note**
The **rollback-stack** operation will delete a stack if it doesn't contain a last known stable state.

### Express mode and rollback
<a name="express-mode-and-rollback"></a>

When you use express mode, CloudFormation disables rollback by default. If a resource operation fails, CloudFormation does not automatically roll back previously completed changes. Instead, the stack enters a failed state and you can troubleshoot the issue before retrying.

To re-enable rollback with express mode, set `disableRollback` to `false` in the `--deployment-config` parameter when issuing the stack operation:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name {{myteststack}} \
    --template-body {{file://sampletemplate.json}} \
    --deployment-config '{"mode": "EXPRESS", "disableRollback": false}'
```

**Note**
Disabling rollback isn't supported for immutable update operations. If an update requires replacing a resource and the operation fails, the failed state can't be preserved for retry.

For more information about express mode, see [Express mode](cloudformation-express-mode.md).
