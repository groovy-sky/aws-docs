# Troubleshooting CloudFormation

When you use CloudFormation, you might encounter issues when you create, update, or delete
CloudFormation stacks. The following sections can help you troubleshoot some common issues that
you might encounter.

For general questions about CloudFormation, see the [CloudFormation FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/faqs). You can also search for
answers and post questions in the [CloudFormation community](https://repost.aws/tags/TAm3R3LNU3RfSX9L23YIpo3w) on AWS re:Post.

## Troubleshooting guide

If CloudFormation fails to create, update, or delete your stack, you can view error
messages or logs to help you learn more about the issue. The following tasks describe
general methods for troubleshooting a CloudFormation issue. For information about specific
errors and solutions, see the [Troubleshooting errors](#troubleshooting-errors) section.

- Use operation IDs and failure filtering for targeted troubleshooting.
CloudFormation assigns unique operation IDs to deployment events, making it easier
to track and correlate related events. You can filter stack events by operation
ID to focus on specific deployment phases and use failure filters to quickly
identify the root cause of deployment failures. See [View stack events by operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/view-stack-events-by-operation.html)

- Use the CloudFormation console to view the status of your stack. In the console,
you can view a list of stack events while your stack is being created, updated,
or deleted. Stack events include operation IDs that help you correlate related
events and track individual operation. You can click on the operation ID for a
focused troubleshooting. From the operation event list, find the failure event
and then view the status reason for that event. The status reason might contain
an error message from CloudFormation or from a particular service that can help you
troubleshoot your problem. For more information about viewing stack events with
operation IDs, see [View stack events by operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/view-stack-events-by-operation.html).

- For Amazon EC2 issues, view the `cloud-init` and cfn logs. These logs
are published on the Amazon EC2 instance in the `/var/log/`
directory. These logs capture processes and command outputs while CloudFormation is
setting up your instance. For Windows, view the EC2Configure service in
`%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService`, EC2 Launch in
`%ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Logs`, EC2
Launch v2 in `%ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2Launch\log`, and cfn
logs in `C:\cfn\log`.

You can also configure your CloudFormation template so that the logs are published
to Amazon CloudWatch, which displays logs in the AWS Management Console so you don't have to connect
to your Amazon EC2 instance. For more information, see [View CloudFormation logs in the console](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/view-cloudformation-logs-in-the-console) in the Application Management
Blog.

### Delete stack fails

To resolve this situation, try the following:

- Some resources must be empty before they can be deleted. For example, you
must delete all objects in an Amazon S3 bucket or remove all instances in an
Amazon EC2 security group before you can delete the bucket or security
group.

- Ensure that you have the necessary IAM permissions to delete the
resources in the stack. In addition to CloudFormation permissions, you must be
allowed to use the underlying services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon EC2.

- When stacks are in the `DELETE_FAILED` state because CloudFormation
couldn't delete a resource, rerun the [deletion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteStack.html) with the
`RetainResources` parameter and specify the resource that
CloudFormation can't delete. CloudFormation deletes the stack without deleting the
retained resource. Retaining resources is useful when you can't delete a
resource, such as an S3 bucket that contains objects that you want to keep,
but you still want to delete the stack.

After you delete the stack, you can manually delete retained resources by
using their associated AWS service.

Alternatively, you may consider using the `FORCE_DELETE_STACK`
option with the `DeletionMode` parameter. For more information on
force deleting a stack, see [Delete a stack from the CloudFormation console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html).

- You can't delete stacks that have termination protection enabled. If you
attempt to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion
fails and the stack--including its status--remains unchanged. Disable
termination protection on the stack, then perform the delete operation
again.

This includes [nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html)
whose root stacks have termination protection enabled. Deactivate
termination protection on the root stack, then perform the delete operation
again. It's strongly recommended that you don't delete nested stacks
directly, but only delete them as part of deleting the root stack and all
its resources.

For more information, see [Protect CloudFormation stacks from being deleted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html).

- For all other issues, if you have AWS Support, you can create a Support case.
See [Contacting support](#contacting-support).

### Dependency error

To resolve a dependency error, add a `DependsOn` attribute to resources
that depend on other resources in your template. In some cases, you must explicitly
declare dependencies so that CloudFormation can create or delete resources in the
correct order. For example, if you create an Elastic IP and a VPC with an Internet
gateway in the same stack, the Elastic IP must depend on the Internet gateway
attachment. For more information, see [DependsOn\
attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-attribute-dependson.html).

### AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager conflicts

AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager can automate infrastructure management tasks which can
cause conflict with the deployment of a CloudFormation stack. Do the following to avoid
any potential conflicts:

- Review the configuration of AWS Config and Systems Manager in the associated AWS account
and AWS Region.

- Check for active rules or automation documents that might be triggered
during a CloudFormation deployment. These may potentially cause conflicts or
resource dependencies that conflict with your deployment.

- Check your CloudFormation template for any resources managed by AWS Config and
Systems Manager. Check for potential overlaps or interdependencies and consider
adjusting the template or automation configuration to avoid
conflicts.

- Temporarily disable or suspend any related AWS Config rules or Systems Manager automations
during CloudFormation deployment. Remember to restore the original
configurations after the successful deployment to maintain the desired level
of automation and compliance.

- Review the CloudFormation logs and error messages for any reference to AWS Config
and Systems Manager-related issues to help pinpoint the source of the conflict.

For more information on AWS Config rules, see [Evaluating Resources\
with AWS Config Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html).

For more information on Systems Manager automations, see [AWS Systems Manager\
Automation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html).

### Error parsing parameter when passing a list

When you use the AWS CLI or CloudFormation to pass in a list, add the escape character
( `\`) before each comma. The following sample shows how you specify
an input parameter when using the AWS CLI.

```text

ParameterKey=CIDR,ParameterValue='10.10.0.0/16\,10.10.0.0/24\,10.10.1.0/24'
```

### Insufficient IAM permissions

When you work with a CloudFormation stack, you not only need permissions to use
CloudFormation, you must also have permission to use the underlying services that are
described in your template. For example, if you're creating an Amazon S3 bucket or
starting an Amazon EC2 instance, you need permissions to Amazon S3 or Amazon EC2. Review your IAM
policy and verify that you have the necessary permissions before you work with
CloudFormation stacks. For more information see, [Control CloudFormation access with AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/control-access-with-iam.html).

### Invalid value or unsupported resource property

When you create or update a CloudFormation stack, your stack can fail due to invalid
input parameters, unsupported resource property names, or unsupported resource
property values. For input parameters, verify that the resource exists. For example,
when you specify an Amazon EC2 key pair or VPC ID, the resource must exist in your
account and in the region in which you are creating or updating your stack. You can
use [AWS-specific parameter\
types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-supplied-parameter-types.html) to ensure that you use valid values.

For resource property names and values, update your template to use valid names
and values. For more information, see the [AWS resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html).

### Quota exceeded

Verify that you didn't reach a resource quota. For example, the default maximum
number of Amazon EC2 On-Demand instances that you can launch is 5. If try to create more
Amazon EC2 On-Demand instances than your account quota, the instance creation fails and
you receive the error `Status=start_failed`. To view the default AWS
quotas by service, see [AWS\
service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the _AWS General Reference_.

For CloudFormation quotas and tweaking strategies, see [Understand CloudFormation quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html).

Also, during an update, if a resource is replaced, CloudFormation creates new resource
before it deletes the old one. This replacement might put your account over the
resource quota, which would cause your update to fail. You can delete excess
resources or request a [quota\
increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

### Nested stacks are stuck in `UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS`, `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS`, or `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS`

A nested stack failed to roll back. Because of potential resource dependencies
between nested stacks, CloudFormation doesn't start cleaning up nested stack resources
until all nested stacks have been updated or have rolled back. When a nested stack
fails to roll back, CloudFormation cancels all operations, regardless of the state that
the other nested stacks are in. A nested stack that completed updating or rolling
back but didn't receive a signal from CloudFormation to start cleaning up because
another nested failed to roll back is in an
`UPDATE_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS` or
`UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS` state. A nested stack
that failed to update but didn't receive a signal to start rolling back is in an
`UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` state.

A nested stack might fail to roll back because of changes that were made outside
of CloudFormation, when the stack template doesn't accurately reflect the state of the
stack. A nested stack might also fail if an Auto Scaling group in a nested stack had an
insufficient resource signal timeout period when the group was created or
updated.

To fix the stack, contact [AWS Support](#contacting-support).

### No updates to perform

To update a CloudFormation stack, you must submit template or parameter value changes
to CloudFormation. However, CloudFormation won't recognize some template changes as an
update, such as changes to a deletion policy, update policy, condition declaration,
or output declaration. If you need to make such changes without making any other
change, you can add or modify a metadata attribute for any of your resources. The
metadata attribute can be any arbitrary value, as CloudFormation does not interpret its
content. For more information, see [Metadata\
attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-attribute-metadata.html).

### Resource failed to stabilize during a create, update, or delete stack operation

A resource didn't respond because the operation exceeded the CloudFormation timeout
period or an AWS service was interrupted. For service interruptions, [check](http://status.aws.amazon.com/) that the relevant AWS service is
running, and then retry the stack operation.

If the AWS services have been running successfully, check if your stack contains
one of the following resources:

- `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup` for create, update, and
delete operations

- `AWS::CertificateManager::Certificate` for create
operations

- `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` for create, update, and delete
operations

- `AWS::ElasticSearch::Domain` for update operations

- `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` for create and update operations

- `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` for create, update, and delete
operations

- `AWS::Redshift::Cluster` for update operations

Operations for these resources might take longer than the default timeout period.
The timeout period depends on the resource and credentials that you use. To extend
the timeout period, specify a [service\
role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-servicerole.html) when you perform the stack operation. If you're already using a
service role, or if your stack contains a resource that isn't listed, contact [AWS Support](#contacting-support).

If your stack is in the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state, see [Update Rollback\
Failed](#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed).

### Security group does not exist in VPC

Verify that the security group exists in the VPC that you specified. If the
security group exists, ensure that you specify the security group ID and not the
security group name. For example, the `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress`
resource has a `SourceSecurityGroupName` and
`SourceSecurityGroupId` properties. For VPC security groups, you must
use the `SourceSecurityGroupId` property and specify the security group
ID.

### Update rollback failed

A dependent resource can't return to its original state, causing the rollback to
fail ( `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state). For example, you might have a
stack that's rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of
CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes
that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the
update rollback to fail.

Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually fix the error and continue
the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working
state (the `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` state), and then try to update the
stack again. The following list describes solutions to common errors that cause
update rollback failures:

- Failed to receive the required number of signals

Use the [signal-resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/signal-resource.html) command to manually send the
required number of successful signals to the resource that's
waiting for them, and then continue rolling back the update. For
example, during an update rollback, instances in an Auto Scaling group
might fail to signal success within the specified timeout
duration. Manually send success signals to the Auto Scaling group. When
you continue the update rollback, CloudFormation sees your signals
and proceeds with the rollback.

- Changes to a resource were made outside of CloudFormation

Manually sync resources so that they match the original
stack's template, and then continue rolling back the update. For
example, if you manually deleted a resource that CloudFormation is
attempting to roll back to, you must manually create that
resource with the same name and properties it had in the
original stack.

- Insufficient permissions

Check that you have sufficient IAM permissions to modify
resources, and then continue the update rollback. For example,
your IAM policy might allow you to create an S3 bucket, but
not modify the bucket. Add the modify actions to your
policy.

- Invalid security token

CloudFormation requires a new set of credentials. No change is
required. Continue rolling back the update, which refreshes the
credentials.

- Limitation error

Delete resources that you don't need or request a [quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html), and then
continue rolling back the update. For example, if your account
quota for the number of EC2 On-Demand instances is 5 and the
update rollback exceeds that quota, it will fail.

- Resource didn't stabilize

A resource didn't respond because the operation might have
exceeded the CloudFormation timeout period or an AWS service might
have been interrupted. No change is required. After the resource
operation is complete or the AWS service is back in operation,
continue rolling back the update.

To continue rolling back an update, you can use the CloudFormation console or AWS
command line interface (AWS CLI). For more information, see [Continue rolling back an update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.html).

If none of these solutions work, you can skip the resources that CloudFormation can't
successfully roll back. For more information, see the `ResourcesToSkip`
parameter for the [ContinueUpdateRollback](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ContinueUpdateRollback.html) API operation in the
_AWS CloudFormation API Reference_. CloudFormation sets the status of the
specified resources to `UPDATE_COMPLETE` and continues to roll back the
stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be
inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before you
perform another stack update, you must modify the resources or update the stack to
be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail and
make your stack unrecoverable.

### Wait condition didn't receive the required number of signals from an Amazon EC2 instance

To resolve this situation, try the following:

- Ensure that the AMI you're using has the CloudFormation helper scripts
installed. If the AMI doesn't include the helper scripts, you can also
download them to your instance. For more information, see the [CloudFormation helper scripts reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/cfn-helper-scripts-reference.html) in the
_CloudFormation Template Reference Guide_.

- Verify that the `cfn-signal` command was successfully run on
the instance. You can view logs, such as
`/var/log/cloud-init.log` or
`/var/log/cfn-init.log`, to help you debug the
instance launch. You can retrieve the logs by logging in to your instance,
but you must [disable rollback on\
failure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html#configure-stack-options) or else CloudFormation deletes the instance after your stack
fails to create. You can also [publish the logs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/view-cloudformation-logs-in-the-console) to Amazon CloudWatch. For Windows, you can view cfn
logs in `C:\cfn\log` and EC2Config service logs in
`%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService`.

- Verify that the instance has a connection to the Internet. If the instance
is in a VPC, the instance should be able to connect to the Internet through
a NAT device if it's is in a private subnet or through an Internet gateway
if it's in a public subnet. To test the instance's Internet connection, try
to access a public web page, such as `http://aws.amazon.com`. For
example, you can run the following command on the instance. It should return
an HTTP 200 status code.

```sh

curl -I https://aws.amazon.com
```

For information about configuring a NAT device, see [NAT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat.html) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

### Resource removed from stack but not deleted

During a stack update, CloudFormation has removed a resource from a stack but not
deleted the resource. The resource still exists, but is no longer accessible through
CloudFormation. This may occur during stack updates where:

- CloudFormation needs to replace an existing resource, so it first creates a
new resource, then attempts to delete the old resource.

- You have removed the resource from the stack template, so CloudFormation
attempts to delete the resource from the stack.

However, there may be cases where CloudFormation can't delete the resource. For
example, if the user doesn't have permissions to delete a resource of a given
type.

CloudFormation attempts to delete the old resource three times. If CloudFormation can't
delete the old resource, it removes the old resource from the stack and continues
updating the stack. When the stack update is complete, CloudFormation issues an
`UPDATE_COMPLETE` stack event, but includes a
`StatusReason` that states that one or more resources couldn't be
deleted. CloudFormation also issues a `DELETE_FAILED` event for the specific
resource, with a corresponding `StatusReason` providing more detail on
why CloudFormation failed to delete the resource.

To resolve this situation, delete the resource directly using the console or API
for the underlying service.

## Contacting support

If you have AWS Support, you can create a technical support case at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home). Before you contact
support, gather the following information:

- The ID of the stack. You can find the stack ID in the
**Overview** tab of the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation). For more information, see
[View stack information from the CloudFormation console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-view-stack-data-resources.html).

###### Important

Don't make changes to the resources in the stack outside of CloudFormation.
Making changes to the resources in your stack outside of CloudFormation might
put your stack in an unrecoverable state.

- Any stack error messages. For information about viewing stack error messages,
see the [Troubleshooting guide](#basic-ts-guide)
section.

- For Amazon EC2 issues, gather the `cloud-init` and cfn logs. These logs
are published on the Amazon EC2 instance in the `/var/log/`
directory. These logs capture processes and command outputs while your instance
is setting up. For Windows, gather the EC2Configure service and cfn logs in
`%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and
`C:\cfn\log`.
