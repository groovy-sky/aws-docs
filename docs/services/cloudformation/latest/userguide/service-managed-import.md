# Service-managed stack import for CloudFormation StackSets

The CloudFormation stack import operation can import existing stacks into new or existing StackSets,
so that you can migrate existing stacks to a StackSet in one operation. StackSets extends the
functionality of stacks, so you can create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and
Regions with a single operation.

###### Considerations for service-managed stack imports

- The stack import operation requires a management account or delegated admin account in
which you can manage the associated AWS Organizations such as enabling trust access with
StackSets.

- The target accounts must be members of the AWS Organizations managed by the management account or
delegated admin account.

- Target stack exists in one of the target OUs.

- The target account should be a member of AWS Organizations.

- AWS Organizations access should be in the `ACTIVATED` state for the Organizations.

- Stacks being imported should be present in any of the member accounts, and not the
management account.

## Import a service-managed stack into a new StackSet (console)

Import a stack into a new StackSet using the AWS Management Console

To import a new stack into a StackSet, identify a stack that contains the resource you
want to import.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**.

3. At the top of the **StackSets** page, choose **Create**
**StackSet**.

1. For **StackSet permission model** choose **Service-managed**
      **permissions**.

2. For **Prerequisite - Prepare template**, choose **Template is**
      **ready**, and choose your template by using one of the following options:

- For **Amazon S3 URL**, enter your Amazon S3 URL in the **Amazon S3**
**URL** field.

- For **Upload a template file**, choose a CloudFormation template on your
local computer.

Accept your settings and choose **Next**.

5. On the **Specify StackSet details** page, do the following:

## Importing a service-managed stack into a StackSet (AWS CLI)

Once a StackSet is created, you can import your stacks by passing the stack ID's of the
stacks being imported. You may also pass the OU ID list to which you want to map it to.

CloudFormation will import user provided stacks within those OUs and use those OUs as
deployment targets for the StackSet. Stack IDs presented in the input will map to the nearest
OU in OU ID list input internally. If a stack doesn't belong to an existing OU ID in the input
list, then the AWS CLI will return the `StackNotFoundException` error.

The `import-stacks-to-stack-set` operation creates stack instances for the
stacks in the OU ID input. The following AWS CLI examples use the
`import-stacks-to-stack-set` operation to import a stack into a StackSet.

- To use the `import-stacks-to-stack-sets` operation, specify
`stack-ids` or `stack-ids-url` you want to import to your stack
set.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation import-stacks-to-stack-set \
    --stack-set-name ServiceMangedStackSet \
    --stack-ids "arn:123456789012:us-east-1:Stack1" \
    --organizational-unit-ids ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111
```

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation import-stacks-to-stack-set \
    --stack-set-name ServiceMangedStackSet \
    --stack-ids-url https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/file-name.json \
    --organizational-unit-ids ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111
```

###### Note

The `import-stacks-to-stack-sets` operation, requires you to specify at least
one organizational unit ID (OU ID) so that it can associate the stack being imported to that
particular OU. This operation doesn't create stack instances for other member accounts in the
associated OUs. To update member accounts for the associated OUs, use
`create-stack-instances` or `update-stack-instances`.

`create-stack-set` creates stack instances for all the accounts under the OUs
with a user provided template, either from direct upload or Amazon S3. The following AWS CLI examples
use the `create-stack-set` operation to import a stack into a new StackSet.

- To use the `create-stack-set` operation, specify your StackSet name and
import a stack to a newly created StackSet.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
    --template-url https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/file-name.json \
    --permission-model SERVICE_MANAGED \
    --auto-deployment Enabled=true
```
