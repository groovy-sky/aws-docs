# Performing drift detection on CloudFormation StackSets

Even as you manage your stacks and the resources they contain through CloudFormation, users
can change those resources outside of CloudFormation. Users can edit resources directly by using
the underlying service that created the resource. By performing drift detection on a StackSet, you can determine if any of the stack instances belonging to that StackSet differ, or
have _drifted_, from their expected configuration.

## How CloudFormation performs drift detection on a StackSet

When CloudFormation performs drift detection on a StackSet, it performs drift detection
on the stack associated with each stack instance in the StackSet. To do this,
CloudFormation compares the current state of each resource in the stack with the
expected state of that resource, as defined in the stack's template and any specified
input parameters. If the current state of a resource varies from its expected state,
that resource is considered to have drifted. If one or more resources in a stack have
drifted, then the stack itself is considered to have drifted, and the stack instances
that the stack is associated with is considered to have drifted as well. If one or more
stack instances in a StackSet have drifted, the StackSet itself is considered to have
drifted.

Drift detection identifies unmanaged changes; that is, changes made to stacks outside
of CloudFormation. Changes made through CloudFormation to a stack directly, rather than
at the StackSet level, aren't considered drift. For example, suppose you have a stack
that is associated with a stack instance of a StackSet. If you use CloudFormation to
update that stack to use a different template, that is not considered drift, even though
that stack now has a different template than any other stacks belonging to the StackSet. This is because the stack still matches its expected template and parameter
configuration in CloudFormation.

For detailed information on how CloudFormation performs drift detection on a stack, see
[Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks and resources with drift detection](using-cfn-stack-drift.md).

Because CloudFormation performs drift detection on each stack individually, it takes
any overridden parameter values into account when determining whether a stack has
drifted. For more information on overriding template parameters in stack instances, see
[Override parameter values on stacks within your CloudFormation StackSet](stackinstances-override.md).

If you perform drift detection [directly on a\
stack](using-cfn-stack-drift.md) that is associated with a stack instance, those drift results aren't
available from the **StackSets** console page.

## Detect drift on a StackSet (console)

###### To detect drift on a StackSet

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the **StackSets** page, select the StackSet on which you
    want to perform drift detection.

3. From the **Actions** menu, select **Detect**
**drifts**.

CloudFormation displays an information bar stating that drift detection has
    been initiated for the selected StackSet.

4. Optional: To monitor the progress of the drift detection operation:

1. Select the StackSet name to display the **Stackset**
      **details** page.

2. Select the **Operations** tab, select the drift
       detection operation, and then select **View drift**
      **details**.

CloudFormation displays the **Operation details** dialog
box.

5. Wait until CloudFormation completes the drift detection operation. When the
    drift detection operation completes, CloudFormation updates **Drift**
**status** and **Last drift check time** for your
    StackSet. These fields are listed on the **Overview** tab of
    the **StackSet details** page for the selected StackSet.

The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on the number of
    stack instances included in the StackSet, and the number of resources included
    in the StackSet. You can only run a single drift detection operation on a given
    StackSet at one time. CloudFormation continues the drift detection operation
    even after you dismiss the information bar.

6. To review the drift detection results for the stack instances in a StackSet,
    select the **Stack instances** tab.

The **Stack name** column lists the name of the stack
    associated with each stack instance, and the **Drift status**
    column lists the drift status of that stack. A stack is considered to have
    drifted if one or more of its resources have drifted.

7. To review the drift detection results for the stack associated with a specific
    stack instance:
1. Choose the **Operations** tab.

2. Select the drift operation you want to view drift detection results
       for. A split panel will display the stack instance status and reason for
       the selected operation. For a drift operation, the status reason column
       shows the drift status of a stack instance.

3. Choose the stack instance you want to view drift details for, and
       choose **View resource drifts**. In the
       **Resource drift status** table on the
       **Resource Drifts** page, each stack resource is
       listed with its drift status and the last time drift detection was
       initiated on the resource. The logical ID and physical ID of each
       resource is displayed to help you identify them.
8. You can sort the resources based on their drift status using the
    **Drift status** column.

To view the details on a modified resource:
1. With the resource selected, choose **View drift**
      **details**.

      CloudFormation displays the drift detail page for that particular
       resource. This page lists the resource's differences. It also lists the
       resource's expected and current property values.

      ###### Note

      If the stack belongs to a different Region and account than the
      one you're currently signed into, the **Detect**
      **drift** button will be disabled and you will be unable
      to view the details.

## Detect drift on a StackSet (AWS CLI)

To detect drift on an entire stack using the AWS CLI, use the following procedure:

###### To detect drift on a StackSet

1. Use the [detect-stack-set-drift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/detect-stack-set-drift.html) command to detect drift on an entire StackSet
    and its associated stack instances.

The following example initiates drift detection on the StackSet
    `stack-set-drift-example`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation detect-stack-set-drift \
       --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example
```

Output:

```json

{
       "OperationId": "c36e44aa-3a83-411a-b503-cb611example"
}
```

2. Because StackSet drift detection operations can be a long-running operation,
    use the [describe-stack-set-operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html) command to monitor the status of drift
    operation. This command takes the StackSet operation ID returned by the
    **detect-stack-set-drift** command.

The following examples uses the operation ID from the previous example to
    return information on the StackSet drift detection operation. In this example,
    the operation is still running. Of the seven stack instances associated with
    this StackSet, one stack instance has already been found to have drifted, two
    instances are in sync , and drift detection for the remaining four stack
    instances is still in progress. Because one instance has drifted, the drift
    status of the StackSet itself is now `DRIFTED`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
       --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example \
       --operation-id c36e44aa-3a83-411a-b503-cb611example
```

Output:

```json

{
       "StackSetOperation": {
           "Status": "RUNNING",
           "AdministrationRoleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole",
           "OperationPreferences": {
               "RegionOrder": []
           },
           "ExecutionRoleName": "AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",
           "StackSetDriftDetectionDetails": {
               "DriftedStackInstancesCount": 1,
               "TotalStackInstancesCount": 7,
               "LastDriftCheckTimestamp": "2019-12-04T20:34:28.543Z",
               "InSyncStackInstancesCount": 2,
               "InProgressStackInstancesCount": 4,
               "DriftStatus": "DRIFTED",
               "FailedStackInstancesCount": 0
           },
           "Action": "DETECT_DRIFT",
           "CreationTimestamp": "2019-12-04T20:33:13.673Z",
           "StackSetId": "stack-set-drift-example:bd1f4017-d4f9-432e-a73f-8c22example",
           "OperationId": "c36e44aa-3a83-411a-b503-cb611example"
       }
}
```

Performing the same command later, this example shows the information returned
    once the drift detection operation has completed. Two of the seven total stack
    instances associated with this StackSet have drifted, rendering the drift
    status of the StackSet itself as `DRIFTED`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
       --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example \
       --operation-id c36e44aa-3a83-411a-b503-cb611example
```

Output:

```json

       "StackSetOperation": {
           "Status": "SUCCEEDED",
           "AdministrationRoleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole",
           "OperationPreferences": {
               "RegionOrder": []
           }
           "ExecutionRoleName": "AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",
           "EndTimestamp": "2019-12-04T20:37:32.829Z",

               "InSyncStackInstancesCount": 5,
               "InProgressStackInstancesCount": 0,
               "DriftStatus": "DRIFTED",
               "FailedStackInstancesCount": 0
           },
           "Action": "DETECT_DRIFT",
           "CreationTimestamp": "2019-12-04T20:33:13.673Z",
           "StackSetId": "stack-set-drift-example:bd1f4017-d4f9-432e-a73f-8c22example",
           "OperationId": "c36e44aa-3a83-411a-b503-cb611example"
       }
}
```

3. When the StackSet drift detection operation is complete, use the
    **describe-stack-set**, **list-stack-instances**,
    **describe-stack-instance**, and
    **list-stack-instance-resource-drifts** commands to review the
    results.

The [describe-stack-set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set.html) command includes the same detailed drift
    information returned by the **describe-stack-set-operation**
    command.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-set \
       --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example
```

Output:

```json

       "StackSet": {
           "Status": "ACTIVE",
           "Description": "Demonstration of drift detection on stack sets.",

               "LastDriftCheckTimestamp": "2019-12-04T20:36:55.612Z",
               "InProgressStackInstancesCount": 0,
               "DriftStatus": "DRIFTED",
               "DriftDetectionStatus": "COMPLETED",
               "InSyncStackInstancesCount": 5,
               "FailedStackInstancesCount": 0
           },
           "StackSetARN": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:stackset/stack-set-drift-example:bd1f4017-d4f9-432e-a73f-8c22example",

           "StackSetName": "stack-set-drift-example"
       }
}
```

You can use the [list-stack-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-instances.html) command to return summary
    information about the stack instances associated with a StackSet, including the
    drift status of each stack instance.

In this example, executing **list-stack-instances** on the example
    StackSet with the drift status filter set to `DRIFTED` enables you
    to identify which two stack instances have a drift status of
    `DRIFTED`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation list-stack-instances \
       --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example \
       --filters Name=DRIFT_STATUS,Values=DRIFTED

           },

           [additional stack instances omitted]

       ]
}
```

The [describe-stack-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-instance.html) command also returns this
    information, but for a single stack instance, as in the example below.

```nohighlight

       --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example \
       --stack-instance-account 012345678910 --stack-instance-region us-east-1
```

Output:

           "LastOperationId": "c36e44aa-3a83-411a-b503-cb611example"
       }
}
```

4. Once you've identified which stack instances have drifted, you can use the
    information about the stack instances that is returned by the
    **list-stack-instances** or **describe-stack-instance**
    commands to run the [list-stack-instance-resource-drifts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-instance-resource-drifts.html) command. This
    command returns detailed information about which resources in the stack have
    drifted for a particular drift operation.

The following example uses the
    `--stack-instance-resource-drift-statuses` parameter to request
    stack drift information for the resources that have been modified or deleted in
    the previous drift operation example. The request returns information on the one
    resource that has been modified, including details about two of its properties
    and their changed values. No resources have been deleted.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation list-stack-instance-resource-drifts \
       --stack-set-name my-stack-set-with-resource-drift \
       --stack-instance-account 123456789012 \
       --stack-instance-region us-east-1 \
       --operation-id c36e44aa-3a83-411a-b503-cb611example \
       --stack-instance-resource-drift-statuses MODIFIED DELETED
```

Output:

## Stopping drift detection on a StackSet

Because drift detection on a StackSet can be a long-running operation, there may be
instances when you want to stop a drift detection operation that is currently running on
a StackSet.

###### To stop drift detection on a StackSet (console)

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the **StackSets** page, select the name of the StackSet.

CloudFormation displays the **StackSets details** page for the
    selected StackSet.

3. On the **StackSets details** page, select the
    **Operations** tab, and then select the drift detection
    operation.

4. Select **Stop operation**.

###### To stop drift detection on a StackSet (AWS CLI)

- Use the [stop-stack-set-operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/stop-stack-set-operation.html) command. You must
supply both the StackSet name and the operation ID of the drift detection StackSet operation.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation stop-stack-set-operation \
      --stack-set-name stack-set-drift-example \
      --operation-id 624af370-311a-11e8-b6b7-500cexample
```
