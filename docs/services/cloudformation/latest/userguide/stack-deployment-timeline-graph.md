# View a timeline of a CloudFormation stack deployment
<a name="stack-deployment-timeline-graph"></a>

The stack deployment timeline graph provides a visual representation of a stack deployment timeline. This view shows the deployment statuses for the stack and each of its resources, and the times that each status changed. Stack deployment statuses are represented by a corresponding color.

## Understanding the stack deployment timeline graph
<a name="understanding-stack-deployment-timeline-graph"></a>

The following image shows the timeline graph for a stack deployment that failed due to an Amazon EC2 instance resource that failed to launch.

The names of the stack resources are found on the left side of the graph, and the date and time relative to the deployment times are found at the top of the graph.

Each resource starts with the **In progress** status. The status bar changes to **Complete** for each successful deployment. The status bar changes to **Failed** when a resource fails to deploy. When a resource fails to deploy and the stack deployment also fails, the resource responsible for the stack deployment failure receives the **Likely root failure** status.

After the stack deployment operation failed, the successfully deployed resource begin rolling back and change to the **Rollback in progress** status. The statuses change to **Rollback complete** after the resource finish rolling back.

Choosing each resource provides more granular detail on the deployment timeline:

Choosing a resource shows the **Type**, deployment **Start time**, deployment **End time**, and **Total duration** of the deployment. You will also find the **Start time**, **End time**, and **Duration** of each deployment status in the drop-down menus below. If the resource failed to deploy, a **Failure reason** will be provided.

## Viewing the stack deployment timeline graph (console)
<a name="viewing-stack-deployment-timeline-graph"></a>

To view a stack deployment timeline graph:

1. Open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region you created the stack in.

1. On the **Stacks** page of the CloudFormation console, choose the stack name. CloudFormation displays the stack details for the selected stack.

1. Choose the **Events** tab to view the stack events CloudFormation has generated for your stack.

1. Choose the **Timeline graph** button to view the timeline graph for your stack.
