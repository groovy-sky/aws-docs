# Delete a change set for a CloudFormation stack
<a name="using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets-delete"></a>

Deleting a change set removes it from the list of change sets for the stack. Deleting a change set prevents you or another user from accidentally executing a change set that shouldn't be applied. Unless you delete them, CloudFormation retains all change sets until you update the stack.

------
#### [ Delete a change set ]

**To delete a change set (console)**

1. Open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

1. On the **Stacks** page, select the name of the stack that contains the change set that you want to delete.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Change sets** to view a list of the stack's change sets.

1. Select the name of the change set that you want to delete.

1. On the change set's details page, choose **Delete change set**.

   CloudFormation immediately starts to delete the change set from the stack's list of change sets, and you're redirected to the **Stacks** page.

------
#### [ Delete a change set for nested stacks (console) ]

**To delete a change set for nested stacks**

1. Open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

1. On the **Stacks** page, select the stack name associated with the root change set.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Change sets** to view a list of the stack's change sets.

1. Select the name of the change set that you want to delete.

1. On the change set's details page, choose **Delete**. By choosing **Delete change set**, you will delete the whole hierarchy of nested change sets.
**Note**
The delete operation for change sets for nested stacks is asynchronous and will show a `DELETE_PENDING` status, followed by a `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` status. Upon completion of the delete change set operation, the change sets will be removed from the list. Nested stacks in the `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` status will also be deleted if they were created during the change set creation.

   CloudFormation immediately starts to delete the change set from the stack's list of change sets.
**Note**
If you have nested stacks that are stuck in an in-progress operation, see Troubleshooting Errors in [Nested stacks rollback failure](troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-errors-nested-stacks-are-stuck).

**To delete a change set (AWS CLI)**
+ Run the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/delete-change-set.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/delete-change-set.html) command, specifying the ID of the change set that you want to delete, as shown in the following example:

  ```
  aws cloudformation delete-change-set \
      --change-set-name \
        {{arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:changeSet/SampleChangeSet/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000}}
