## Deactivate a public extension in your account (console)

###### To deactivate a public extension in your account

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your
    AWS Region.

3. From the navigation pane, under **Registry**, choose
    **Activated extensions**.

4. Find the extension you want to deactivate and select it. For more
    information, see [View the available and activated extensions in the CloudFormation registry](registry-view.md).

5. From the **Actions** menu, choose
    **Deactivate**.

6. Choose **Deactivate**.

## Deactivate a public extension in your account (AWS CLI)

Use the following [deactivate-type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deactivate-type.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation deactivate-type --type MODULE \
  --type-name Example::Test::Type::MODULE \
  --region us-west-2
```

## Disable a Hook in your account (AWS CLI)

Disabling a Hook prevents the Hook from running in your AWS account without
removing it.

Use the [set-type-configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/set-type-configuration.html) command and specify
`HookInvocationStatus` as `DISABLED` to disable a
Hook.

The following example specifies the AWS Region and the Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) of the Hook that's being disabled.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation set-type-configuration \
  --configuration "{"CloudFormationConfiguration":{"HookConfiguration":{"HookInvocationStatus": "DISABLED", "FailureMode": "FAIL", "Properties":{}}}}" \
  --type-arn "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/MyTestHook" --region us-west-2
```

For more information, see [Disable and enable CloudFormation Hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/hooks-userguide/hooks-disable-enable.html) in the _CloudFormation Hooks User_
_Guide_.
