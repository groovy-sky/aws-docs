## Deactivate a public extension in your account (AWS CLI)
<a name="registry-public-deactivate-extension-cli"></a>

Use the following [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deactivate-type.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deactivate-type.html) command.

```
aws cloudformation deactivate-type --type {{MODULE}} \
  --type-name {{Example::Test::Type::MODULE}} \
  --region {{us-west-2}}
```

## Disable a Hook in your account (AWS CLI)
<a name="registry-public-deactivate-extension-cli-hook"></a>

Disabling a Hook prevents the Hook from running in your AWS account without removing it.

Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/set-type-configuration.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/set-type-configuration.html) command and specify `HookInvocationStatus` as `DISABLED` to disable a Hook.

The following example specifies the AWS Region and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Hook that's being disabled.

```
aws cloudformation set-type-configuration \
  --configuration {{"{"CloudFormationConfiguration":{"HookConfiguration":{"HookInvocationStatus": "DISABLED", "FailureMode": "FAIL", "Properties":{}}}}"}} \
  --type-arn {{"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/MyTestHook"}} --region {{us-west-2}}
```

For more information, see [Disable and enable CloudFormation Hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/hooks-userguide/hooks-disable-enable.html) in the *CloudFormation Hooks User Guide*.
