# Use third-party private extensions that have been shared with you
<a name="registry-private"></a>

To use third-party private extensions that have been shared with you, you must first *register* them with CloudFormation, in the accounts and Regions where you want to use them. Registering the extension uploads a copy of it to the CloudFormation registry in your account, and activates it. Once you're registered a private extension, it will appear in the CloudFormation registry for that AWS account and Region, and you can use it in your stack templates.

## IAM permissions for registering a third-party private extension
<a name="registry-register-permissions"></a>

As part of registering a private extension, you might specify an Amazon S3 bucket that contains the extension project package. This package contains any source files necessary for the extension you want to register. The user registering the extension must be able to access the project package in that Amazon S3 bucket. To do so, the user must have [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html) permissions for the extension package.

This is true whether you're either using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/register-type.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/register-type.html) command of the AWS CLI, or the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-cli-submit.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-cli-submit.html) command of the CloudFormation CLI.

For more information, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html) in the *Service Authorization Reference*.
