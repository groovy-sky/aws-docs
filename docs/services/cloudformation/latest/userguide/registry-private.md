# Use third-party private extensions that have been shared with you

To use third-party private extensions that have been shared with you, you must first
_register_ them with CloudFormation, in the accounts and Regions
where you want to use them. Registering the extension uploads a copy of it to the
CloudFormation registry in your account, and activates it. Once you're registered a private
extension, it will appear in the CloudFormation registry for that AWS account and Region,
and you can use it in your stack templates.

## IAM permissions for registering a third-party private extension

As part of registering a private extension, you might specify an Amazon S3 bucket that
contains the extension project package. This package contains any source files
necessary for the extension you want to register. The user registering the extension
must be able to access the project package in that Amazon S3 bucket. To do so, the user
must have [GetObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md) permissions for the extension
package.

This is true whether you're either using the [register-type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/register-type.html) command of the AWS CLI, or the [submit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-cli-submit.html) command of the CloudFormation CLI.

For more information, see [Actions,\
Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-amazons3.md) in the
_Service Authorization Reference_.
