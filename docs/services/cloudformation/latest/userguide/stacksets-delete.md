**To delete a StackSet**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region you created the StackSet in.

1. On the **StackSets** page, select the StackSet.

1. With the StackSet selected, choose **Delete StackSet** from the **Actions** menu.

1. When you are prompted to confirm that you want to delete the StackSet, choose **Delete StackSet**.

## Delete a StackSet (AWS CLI)

**Note**
When acting as a delegated administrator, you must include `--call-as DELEGATED_ADMIN` in the command.

**To delete a StackSet**

1. Use the following **delete-stack-set** command. When you are prompted to confirm, type **y**, and then press **Enter**.

   ```
   aws cloudformation delete-stack-set --stack-set-name {{my-stackset}}
   ```

1. Verify that the StackSet was deleted by running the **list-stack-sets** command. The results of the list-stack-sets command should show your stack with a status of `DELETED`.

   ```
   aws cloudformation list-stack-sets
   ```

## Delete service roles (optional)
<a name="stacksets-delete-roles"></a>

If you no longer need the IAM service roles that CloudFormation requires to perform StackSet operations, we recommend that you delete the roles.

*For self-managed StackSets*, the roles you created. For more information about these roles, see [Grant self-managed permissions](stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.md).

*For service-managed StackSets*, the roles that were automatically created for StackSets have the suffix `CloudFormationStackSetsOrgAdmin` in the organization management account, and `CloudFormationStackSetsOrgMember` in each target account. For more information, see [Service-linked roles](stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.md#stacksets-orgs-service-linked-roles).

**To delete a service role (console)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, and then fill the check box next to the role that you want to delete.

1. In the **Role actions** menu at the top of the page, choose **Delete role**.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, choose **Yes, Delete**. If you are sure, you can proceed with the deletion even if the service last accessed data is still loading.

**To delete a service role (AWS CLI)**
+ Use the following **delete-role** command. When you are prompted to confirm, type **y**, and then press Enter.

  ```
  aws iam delete-role --role-name {{role name}}
  ```

For more information about deleting roles, see [Delete roles or instance profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_delete.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
