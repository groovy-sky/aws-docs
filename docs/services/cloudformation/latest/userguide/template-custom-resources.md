# Create custom provisioning logic with custom resources

Custom resources provide a way for you to write custom provisioning logic into your
CloudFormation templates and have CloudFormation run it anytime you create, update (if you changed
the custom resource), or delete a stack. This can be useful when your provisioning
requirements involve complex logic or workflows that can't be expressed with CloudFormation's
built-in resource types.

For example, you might want to include resources that aren't available as CloudFormation
resource types. You can include those resources by using custom resources. That way, you can
still manage all your related resources in a single stack.

To define a custom resource in your CloudFormation template, you use the
`AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` or
`Custom::MyCustomResourceTypeName` resource
type. Custom resources require one property, the service token, which specifies where
CloudFormation sends requests to, such as an Amazon SNS topic or a Lambda function.

The following topics provide information on how to use custom resources.

###### Note

The CloudFormation registry and custom resources each offer their own benefits. Custom
resources offer the following benefits:

- You don't need to register the resource.

- You can include an entire resource as part of a template without
registering.

- Supports the `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete`
operations

Advantages that registry based resources offer include the following:

- Supports the modeling, provisioning, and managing of third-party application
resources

- Supports the `Create`, `Read`, `Update`,
`Delete`, and `List` ( `CRUDL`)
operations

- Supports drift detection on private and third-party resource types

Unlike custom resources, registry based resources won't need to associate an Amazon SNS
topic or a Lambda function to perform `CRUDL` operations. For more
information, see [Managing extensions with the CloudFormation registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html).

## How custom resources work

The general process for setting up a new custom resource includes the following steps.
These steps involve two roles: the _custom resource provider_ who owns the custom
resource and the _template developer_ who creates a template that includes
a custom resource type. This can be the same person, but if not, the custom resource provider should
work with the template developer.

1. The custom resource provider writes logic that determines how to handle requests from
    CloudFormation and perform actions on the custom resource.

2. The custom resource provider creates the Amazon SNS topic or Lambda function where CloudFormation can
    send requests to. The Amazon SNS topic or Lambda function must be in the same Region
    where the stack will be created.

3. The custom resource provider gives the Amazon SNS topic ARN or Lambda function ARN to the
    template developer.

4. The template developer defines the custom resource in their CloudFormation template.
    This includes a service token and any input data parameters. The service token
    and the structure of the input data are defined by the custom resource provider. The service
    token specifies the Amazon SNS topic ARN or Lambda function ARN and is always
    required, but the input data is optional depending on the custom
    resource.

Now, whenever anyone uses the template to create, update, or delete the custom
resource, CloudFormation sends a request to the specified service token, and then waits for
a response before proceeding with the stack operation.

The following summarizes the flow for creating a stack from the template:

1. CloudFormation sends a request to the specified service token. The request
    includes information such as the request type and a pre-signed Amazon S3 bucket URL,
    where the custom resource sends responses to. For more information about what's
    included in the request, see [CloudFormation custom resource request and response reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/crpg-ref.html).

The following sample data shows what CloudFormation includes in a
    `Create` request. In this example,
    `ResourceProperties` allows CloudFormation to create a custom payload
    to send to the Lambda function.

```json

{
      "RequestType" : "Create",
      "RequestId" : "unique id for this create request",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "ResponseURL" : "http://pre-signed-S3-url-for-response",
      "ResourceType" : "Custom::TestResource",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MyTestResource",
      "ResourceProperties" : {
         "Name" : "Value",
         "List" : [ "1", "2", "3" ]
      }
}
```

2. The custom resource provider processes the CloudFormation request and returns a response of
    `SUCCESS` or `FAILED` to the pre-signed URL. The
    custom resource provider provides the response in a JSON-formatted file and uploads it to the
    pre-signed S3 URL. For more information, see [Uploading\
    objects with presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html) in the
    _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

In the response, the custom resource provider can also include name-value pairs that the
    template developer can access. For example, the response can include output data if
    the request succeeded or an error message if the request failed. For more
    information about responses, see [CloudFormation custom resource request and response reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/crpg-ref.html).

###### Important

If the name-value pairs contain sensitive information, you should use the `NoEcho` field to mask the output of the custom resource.
Otherwise, the values are visible through APIs that surface property values (such as `DescribeStackEvents`).

For more information about using `NoEcho` to mask sensitive
information, see the [Do not embed credentials in your templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/security-best-practices.html#creds) best
practice.

The custom resource provider is responsible for listening and responding to the request. For
    example, for Amazon SNS notifications, the custom resource provider must listen and respond to
    notifications that are sent to a specific topic ARN. CloudFormation waits and
    listens for a response in the pre-signed URL location.

The following sample data shows what a custom resource might include in a
    response:

```json

{
      "Status" : "SUCCESS",
      "RequestId" : "unique id for this create request",
      "StackId" : "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/mystack/5b918d10-cd98-11ea-90d5-0a9cd3354c10",
      "LogicalResourceId" : "MyTestResource",
      "PhysicalResourceId" : "TestResource1",
      "Data" : {
         "OutputName1" : "Value1",
         "OutputName2" : "Value2",
      }
}
```

3. After getting a `SUCCESS` response, CloudFormation proceeds with the
    stack operation. If a `FAILED` response or no response is returned,
    the operation fails. Any output data from the custom resource is stored in the
    pre-signed URL location. The template developer can retrieve that data by using the
    [Fn::GetAtt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html#resource-properties-getatt)
    function.

###### Note

If you use AWS PrivateLink, custom resources in the VPC must have access to
CloudFormation-specific S3 buckets. Custom resources must send responses to a pre-signed
Amazon S3 URL. If they can't send responses to Amazon S3, CloudFormation won't receive a response
and the stack operation fails. For more information, see [Access CloudFormation using an interface endpoint (AWS PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/vpc-interface-endpoints.html).

## Response timeout

The default timeout for your custom resource is 3600 seconds (1 hour). If no response
is received during this time, the stack operation fails.

You can adjust the timeout value based on how long you expect the response from the
custom resource will take. For example, when provisioning a custom resource that invokes
a Lambda function that's expected to respond within five minutes, you can set a timeout
of five minutes in the stack template by specifying the `ServiceTimeout`
property. For more information, see [CloudFormation custom resource request and response reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/crpg-ref.html).
This way, if there's an error in the Lambda function that causes it to get stuck,
CloudFormation will fail the stack operation after five minutes instead of waiting the full
hour.

However, be careful not to set the timeout value too low. To avoid unexpected
timeouts, make sure that your custom resource has enough time to perform the necessary
actions and return a response.
