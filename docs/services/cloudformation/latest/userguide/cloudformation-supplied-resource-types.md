# Extend your template's capabilities with CloudFormation-supplied resource types

CloudFormation offers several resource types that you can use in your stack template to extend
its capabilities beyond those of a simple stack template.

These resource types include:

Resource typeDescriptionDocumentation

Custom resources

The `AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource` resource type
allows you to create custom resources that can perform specific
provisioning tasks or include resources that aren't available as
CloudFormation resource types.

[Custom resources](template-custom-resources.md)

Macros

The `AWS::CloudFormation::Macro` resource type defines a
reusable piece of code that can perform custom processing on CloudFormation
templates. Macros can modify your templates, generate additional
resources, or perform other custom operations during stack creation or
updates.

[Template macros](template-macros.md)

Nested stacks

The `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` resource type allows you
to create nested stacks within your CloudFormation templates for a more
modular and reusable stack architectures.

[Nested stacks](using-cfn-nested-stacks.md)

StackSet

The `AWS::CloudFormation::StackSet` resource type creates
or updates a CloudFormation StackSet, which is a container for stacks that
can be deployed across multiple AWS accounts and Regions.

StackSets](what-is-cfnstacksets.md)

Wait condition

The `AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition` resource type
pauses stack creation or update until a specific condition is met, such
as the successful completion of a long-running process or the
availability of external resources.

Wait condition handle

The `AWS::CloudFormation::WaitConditionHandle` resource
type works together with the
`AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition` resource type. It
provides a presigned URL that's used to send signals indicating that a
specific condition has been met. These signals allow the stack creation
or update process to proceed.
