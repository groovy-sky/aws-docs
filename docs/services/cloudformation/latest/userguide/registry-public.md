# Use third-party public extensions from the CloudFormation registry

To use a third-party public extension in your template, you must first
_activate_ the extension for the account and Region where you
want to use it. Activating an extension makes it usable in stack operations in the
account and Region where it's activated.

When you activate a third-party public extension, CloudFormation creates an entry in your
account's extension registry for the activated extension as a private extension. This
allows you to set any configuration properties the extension includes. Configuration
properties define how the extension is configured for a given AWS account and
Region.

In addition to setting configuration properties, you can also customize the extension
in the following ways:

- Specify the execution role CloudFormation uses to activate the extension, in
addition to configure logging for the extension.

- Specify whether the extension is automatically updated when a new minor or
patch version becomes available.

- Specify an alias to use rather than the third-party public extension name.
This can help avoid naming collisions between third-party extensions.

## Configure an execution role with IAM permissions and a trust policy for public extension access

When you activate a public extension from the CloudFormation registry, you can provide
an execution role that gives CloudFormation the necessary permissions to invoke that
extension in your AWS account and Region.

The permissions required for the execution role are defined in the handler section
of the extension schema. You must create an IAM policy that grants the specific
permissions needed by the extension and attach it to the execution role.

In addition to the permissions policy, the execution role must also have a trust
policy that allows CloudFormation to assume the role. Follow the guidance at [Create a role using custom trust policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-custom.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_ to create a role with a custom trust
policy.

### Trust relationship

The following shows example trust policies you can use.

You can optionally restrict the scope of the permission for cross-service
confused deputy prevention by using one or more global condition context keys
with the `Condition` field. For more information, see [Cross-service confused deputy prevention](cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention.md).

- Set the `aws:SourceAccount` value to your account
ID.

- Set the `aws:SourceArn` value to your extension's
ARN.

###### Example trust policy 1

The following is an example IAM role trust policy for a resource type
extension.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "123456789012"
                },
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Organization-Service-Resource"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Example trust policy 2

The following is an example IAM role trust policy for a Hook
extension.

    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com",
                    "hooks.cloudformation.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "123456789012"
                },
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/Organization-Service-Hook"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Automatically use new versions of extensions

When you activate an extension, you can also specify the extension type to use the
latest minor version. Your extension type updates the minor version, whenever the
publisher releases a new version on your activated extension.

For example, the next time you perform a stack operation, such as creating or
updating a stack, using a template that includes that extension, CloudFormation uses the
new minor version.

Updating to a new extension version, either automatically or manually and doesn't
affect any extension instances already provisioned in stacks.

CloudFormation treats major version updates of extensions as potentially containing
breaking changes, and so requires you to manually update to a new major version of
an extension.

Extensions published by AWS are activated by default for all accounts and
Regions where they're available, and always use the latest version available in each
AWS Region.

###### Important

Because you control if and when extensions gets updated to the latest version
in your account, you could end up with different versions of the same extension
deployed in different accounts and Regions.

This might potentially lead to unexpected results when using the same
template, containing that extension, across those accounts and Regions.

## Use aliases to refer to extensions

You can't activate more than one extension with a given name in a given
AWS account and Region. Because different publishers may offer public extensions
with the same extension name, CloudFormation lets you specify an alias for any
third-party public extension you activate.

If you specify an alias for the extension, CloudFormation treats the alias as the
extension type name within the account and Region. You must use the alias to refer
to the extension in your templates, API calls, and CloudFormation console.

Extension aliases must be unique within a given account and Region. You can
activate the same public resource multiple times in the same account and Region,
using different type name aliases.

###### Important

While extension aliases are only required to be unique in a given account and
Region, we strongly suggest that users _not_ assign the same
alias to different third-party public extensions across accounts and Regions.
Doing so could lead to unexpected results when using a template that contains
the extension alias across multiple accounts or Regions.

## Commonly used AWS CLI commands for working with public extensions

The commonly used commands for working with public extensions include:

- [activate-type](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/activate-type.md) to activate a public
third-party module or resource type in your account.

- [set-type-configuration](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/set-type-configuration.md) to specify the
configuration data for an extension in your account and to disable and
enable Hooks.

- [list-types](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-types.md) to list the extensions in your
account.

- [describe-type](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-type.md) to return detailed information
about a specific extension or specific extension version, including current
configuration data.

- [set-type-default-version](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/set-type-default-version.md) to specify which
version of an extension is the default version.

- [deactivate-type](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deactivate-type.md) to deactivate a public
third-party module or resource type that was previously activated in your
account.
