# Use third-party public extensions from the CloudFormation registry
<a name="registry-public"></a>

To use a third-party public extension in your template, you must first *activate* the extension for the account and Region where you want to use it. Activating an extension makes it usable in stack operations in the account and Region where it's activated.

When you activate a third-party public extension, CloudFormation creates an entry in your account's extension registry for the activated extension as a private extension. This allows you to set any configuration properties the extension includes. Configuration properties define how the extension is configured for a given AWS account and Region.

In addition to setting configuration properties, you can also customize the extension in the following ways:
+ Specify the execution role CloudFormation uses to activate the extension, in addition to configure logging for the extension.
+ Specify whether the extension is automatically updated when a new minor or patch version becomes available.
+ Specify an alias to use rather than the third-party public extension name. This can help avoid naming collisions between third-party extensions.

## Configure an execution role with IAM permissions and a trust policy for public extension access
<a name="registry-public-enable-execution-role"></a>

When you activate a public extension from the CloudFormation registry, you can provide an execution role that gives CloudFormation the necessary permissions to invoke that extension in your AWS account and Region.

The permissions required for the execution role are defined in the handler section of the extension schema. You must create an IAM policy that grants the specific permissions needed by the extension and attach it to the execution role.

In addition to the permissions policy, the execution role must also have a trust policy that allows CloudFormation to assume the role. Follow the guidance at [Create a role using custom trust policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html) in the *IAM User Guide* to create a role with a custom trust policy.

### Trust relationship
<a name="registry-public-enable-execution-role-trust-policy"></a>

The following shows example trust policies you can use.

You can optionally restrict the scope of the permission for cross-service confused deputy prevention by using one or more global condition context keys with the `Condition` field. For more information, see [Cross-service confused deputy prevention](cross-service-confused-deputy-prevention.md).
+ Set the `aws:SourceAccount` value to your account ID.
+ Set the `aws:SourceArn` value to your extension's ARN.

## Automatically use new versions of extensions
<a name="registry-public-enable-auto"></a>

When you activate an extension, you can also specify the extension type to use the latest minor version. Your extension type updates the minor version, whenever the publisher releases a new version on your activated extension.

For example, the next time you perform a stack operation, such as creating or updating a stack, using a template that includes that extension, CloudFormation uses the new minor version.

Updating to a new extension version, either automatically or manually and doesn't affect any extension instances already provisioned in stacks.

CloudFormation treats major version updates of extensions as potentially containing breaking changes, and so requires you to manually update to a new major version of an extension.

Extensions published by AWS are activated by default for all accounts and Regions where they're available, and always use the latest version available in each AWS Region.

**Important**
Because you control if and when extensions gets updated to the latest version in your account, you could end up with different versions of the same extension deployed in different accounts and Regions.
This might potentially lead to unexpected results when using the same template, containing that extension, across those accounts and Regions.

## Use aliases to refer to extensions
<a name="registry-public-enable-alias"></a>

You can't activate more than one extension with a given name in a given AWS account and Region. Because different publishers may offer public extensions with the same extension name, CloudFormation lets you specify an alias for any third-party public extension you activate.

If you specify an alias for the extension, CloudFormation treats the alias as the extension type name within the account and Region. You must use the alias to refer to the extension in your templates, API calls, and CloudFormation console.

Extension aliases must be unique within a given account and Region. You can activate the same public resource multiple times in the same account and Region, using different type name aliases.

**Important**
While extension aliases are only required to be unique in a given account and Region, we strongly suggest that users *not* assign the same alias to different third-party public extensions across accounts and Regions. Doing so could lead to unexpected results when using a template that contains the extension alias across multiple accounts or Regions.
