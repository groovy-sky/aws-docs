# Cancel a stack update

After a stack update has begun, you can cancel the stack update if the stack is still in
the `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` state. After an update has finished, you can't cancel it.
You can, however, update a stack again with any previous settings.

If you cancel a stack update, the stack is rolled back to the stack configuration that
existed before initiating the stack update.
