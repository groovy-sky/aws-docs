## Key concepts

When you use CloudFormation, you work with _templates_ and
_stacks_. You create templates to describe your AWS resources and their
properties. Whenever you create a stack, CloudFormation provisions the resources that are described
in your template.

### Templates

A CloudFormation template is a YAML or JSON formatted text file. You can save these files with
any extension, such as `.yaml`, `.json`,
`.template`, or `.txt`. CloudFormation uses these
templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources. For example, in a template, you can
describe an Amazon EC2 instance, such as the instance type, the AMI ID, block device mappings, and
its Amazon EC2 key pair name. Whenever you create a stack, you also specify a template that
CloudFormation uses to create whatever you described in the template.

For example, if you created a stack with the following template, CloudFormation provisions an
instance with an `ami-0ff8a91507f77f867` AMI ID, `t2.micro` instance
type, `testkey` key pair name, and an Amazon EBS volume.

#### YAML

```yaml

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: A sample template
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      KeyName: testkey
      BlockDeviceMappings:
        - DeviceName: /dev/sdm
          Ebs:
            VolumeType: io1
            Iops: 200
            DeleteOnTermination: false
            VolumeSize: 20

```

#### JSON

```json

{
    "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09",
    "Description": "A sample template",
    "Resources": {
        "MyEC2Instance": {
            "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
            "Properties": {
                "ImageId": "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867",
                "InstanceType": "t2.micro",
                "KeyName": "testkey",
                "BlockDeviceMappings": [
                    {
                        "DeviceName": "/dev/sdm",
                        "Ebs": {
                            "VolumeType": "io1",
                            "Iops": 200,
                            "DeleteOnTermination": false,
                            "VolumeSize": 20
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can also specify multiple resources in a single template and configure these resources
to work together. For example, you can modify the previous template to include an Elastic IP
address (EIP) and associate it with the Amazon EC2 instance, as shown in the following
example:

#### YAML

```yaml

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: A sample template
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      KeyName: testkey
      BlockDeviceMappings:
        - DeviceName: /dev/sdm
          Ebs:
            VolumeType: io1
            Iops: 200
            DeleteOnTermination: false
            VolumeSize: 20
  MyEIP:
    Type: AWS::EC2::EIP
    Properties:
      InstanceId: !Ref MyEC2Instance

```

#### JSON

```json

{
    "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09",
    "Description": "A sample template",
    "Resources": {
        "MyEC2Instance": {
            "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
            "Properties": {
                "ImageId": "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867",
                "InstanceType": "t2.micro",
                "KeyName": "testkey",
                "BlockDeviceMappings": [
                    {
                        "DeviceName": "/dev/sdm",
                        "Ebs": {
                            "VolumeType": "io1",
                            "Iops": 200,
                            "DeleteOnTermination": false,
                            "VolumeSize": 20
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        "MyEIP": {
            "Type": "AWS::EC2::EIP",
            "Properties": {
                "InstanceId": {
                    "Ref": "MyEC2Instance"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The previous templates are centered around a single Amazon EC2 instance; however, CloudFormation
templates have additional capabilities that you can use to build complex sets of resources and
reuse those templates in multiple contexts. For example, you can add input parameters whose
values are specified when you create a CloudFormation stack. In other words, you can specify a
value like the instance type when you create a stack instead of when you create the template,
making the template easier to reuse in different situations.

### Stacks

When you use CloudFormation, you manage related resources as a single unit called a stack. You
create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting
stacks. All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's CloudFormation template. Suppose
you created a template that includes an Auto Scaling group, Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, and an Amazon Relational Database Service
(Amazon RDS) database instance. To create those resources, you create a stack by submitting the
template that you created, and CloudFormation provisions all those resources for you.

### Change sets

If you need to make changes to the running resources in a stack, you update the stack.
Before making changes to your resources, you can generate a change set, which is a summary of
your proposed changes. Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running
resources, especially for critical resources, before implementing them.

For example, if you change the name of an Amazon RDS database instance, CloudFormation will create
a new database and delete the old one. You will lose the data in the old database unless
you've already backed it up. If you generate a change set, you will see that your change will
cause your database to be replaced, and you will be able to plan accordingly before you update
your stack.

## How CloudFormation works

When you use CloudFormation to create your stack, CloudFormation makes underlying service calls to
AWS to provision and configure the resources described in your template. You need permission
to create these resources. For example, to create EC2 instances by using CloudFormation, you need
permissions to create instances. You manage these permissions with [AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide) (IAM).

The calls that CloudFormation makes are all declared by your template. For example, suppose you
have a template that describes an EC2 instance with a `t2.micro` instance type. When
you use that template to create a stack, CloudFormation calls the Amazon EC2 create instance API and
specifies the instance type as `t2.micro`. The following diagram summarizes the
CloudFormation workflow for creating stacks.

![A created or existing template that is saved locally, or in a bucket, that's used to create a stack.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/create-stack-diagram.png)

###### To create a stack

1. Use a text editor to create a CloudFormation template in YAML or JSON format. The CloudFormation
    template describes the resources you want and their settings. Use [Infrastructure Composer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/infrastructure-composer-for-cloudformation.html) to visualize and
    validate your template. This helps you make sure that your template is properly structured
    and free of syntax errors. For more information, see [Working with CloudFormation templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-guide.html).

2. Save the template locally or in an Amazon S3 bucket.

3. Create a CloudFormation stack by specifying the location of your template file, such as a
    path on your local computer or an Amazon S3 URL. If the template contains parameters, you can
    specify input values when you create the stack. Parameters allow you to pass in values to
    your template so that you can customize your resources each time you create a stack.

###### Note

If you specify a template file stored locally, CloudFormation uploads it to an S3 bucket
in your AWS account. CloudFormation creates a bucket for each region in which you upload a
template file. The buckets are accessible to anyone with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) permissions in
your AWS account. If a bucket created by CloudFormation is already present, the template is
added to that bucket.

You can use your own bucket and manage its permissions by manually uploading templates
to Amazon S3. Then whenever you create or update a stack, specify the Amazon S3 URL of a template
file.

After all the resources have been created, CloudFormation reports that your stack has been
created. You can then start using the resources in your stack. If stack creation fails,
CloudFormation rolls back your changes by deleting the resources that it created.

### Updating a stack with a change set

When you need to update your stack's resources, you can modify the stack's template. You
don't need to create a new stack and delete the old one. To update a stack, create a change
set by submitting a modified version of the original stack template, different input parameter
values, or both. CloudFormation compares the modified template with the original template and
generates a change set. The change set lists the proposed changes. After reviewing the
changes, you can start the change set to update your stack or you can create a new change set.
The following diagram summarizes the workflow for updating a stack.

![A template using a change set to view the modified value before executing the change set to update the stack.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/update-stack-diagram.png)

###### To update a stack with a change set

1. You can modify a CloudFormation stack template by using [Infrastructure Composer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/infrastructure-composer-for-cloudformation.html) or a text editor. For
    more information, see [Update your stack template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-get-template.html).

As you update your template, keep in mind that updates can cause interruptions.
    Depending on the resource and properties that you are updating, an update might interrupt
    or even replace an existing resource. For more information, see [Understand update behaviors of stack resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html).

2. Save the CloudFormation template locally or in an S3 bucket.

3. Create a change set by specifying the stack that you want to update and the location
    of the modified template, such as a path on your local computer or an Amazon S3 URL. For more
    information about creating change sets, see [Update CloudFormation stacks using change sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html).

###### Note

If you specify a template that's stored on your local computer, CloudFormation
automatically uploads your template to an S3 bucket in your AWS account.

4. View the change set to check that CloudFormation will perform the changes that you expect.
    For example, check whether CloudFormation will replace any critical stack resources. You can
    create as many change sets as you need until you have included the changes that you
    want.

###### Important

Change sets don't indicate whether your stack update will be successful. For
example, a change set doesn't check if you will surpass an account [quota](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html), if you're updating a resource that
doesn't support updates, or if you have insufficient [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/control-access-with-iam.html) to modify a resource, which can
cause a stack update to fail.

5. Initiate the change set that you want to apply to your stack. CloudFormation updates your
    stack by updating only the resources that you modified and signals that your stack has
    been successfully updated. If the stack updates fails, CloudFormation rolls back changes to
    restore the stack to the last known working state.
