# Import AWS resources into a CloudFormation stack manually
<a name="import-resources-manually"></a>

With resource import, you can import existing AWS resources into a new or existing CloudFormation stack. During an import operation, you create a change set that imports your existing resources into a stack or creates a new stack from your existing resources. You provide the following during import.
+ A template that describes the entire stack, including both the original stack resources and the resources you're importing. Each resource to import must have a [DeletionPolicy attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html).
+ Identifiers for the resources you're importing that CloudFormation can use to map the logical IDs in the template with the existing resources.

**Note**
CloudFormation only supports one level of nesting using resource import. This means that you can't import a stack into a child stack or import a stack that has children.

## Resource identifiers
<a name="resource-import-identifiers-unique-ids"></a>

You provide two values to identify each resource you're importing.
+ An identifier property. This is a resource property that can be used to identify each resource type. For example, an `AWS::S3::Bucket` resource can be identified using its `BucketName`.

  The resource property that you use to identify the resource you're importing varies with the resource type. You can find the resource property in the CloudFormation console. After you create a template that includes the resource to import, you can initiate the import process, where you'll find the identifier properties for the resources you're importing. For some resource types, there might be multiple ways to identify them, and you can select which property to use in the drop-down lists.

  Alternatively, you can get the identifier properties for the resources you're importing by calling the [get-template-summary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/get-template-summary.html) CLI command and specifying the S3 URL of the stack template as the value for the `--template-url` option.
+ An identifier value. This is the resource's actual property value. For example, the actual value for the `BucketName` property might be `MyS3Bucket`.

  You can get the value of the identifier property from the service console for the resource.

## Resource import validation
<a name="resource-import-validation"></a>

During an import operation, CloudFormation performs the following validations.
+ The resource to import exists.
+ The properties and configuration values for each resource to import adhere to the resource type schema, which defines its accepted properties, required properties, and supported property values.
+ The required properties are specified in the template. Required properties for each resource type are described in the [AWS resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html).
+ The resource to import doesn't belong to another stack in the same Region. This check applies per Region, but some resource types aren't Region-specific, such as IAM roles, Route 53 hosted zones, or CloudFront distributions. For these types, make sure that the resource isn't already managed by a stack in another Region before importing it.

CloudFormation doesn't check that the template configuration matches the actual configuration of resource properties.

**Important**
Verify that resources and their properties defined in the template match the intended configuration of the resource import to avoid unexpected changes.

## Resource import status codes
<a name="resource-import-status-codes"></a>

This table describes the various status types used with the resource import feature.

| Import operation status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS` | The import operation is in progress. |
| `IMPORT_COMPLETE` | The import operation completed for all resources in the stack. |
| `IMPORT_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` | The rollback import operation is rolling back the previous template configuration. |
| `IMPORT_ROLLBACK_FAILED` | The import rollback operation failed. |
| `IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` | The import rolled back to the previous template configuration. |

## Considerations during an import operation
<a name="resource-import-considerations"></a>
+ After the import is complete and before performing subsequent stack operations, we recommend running drift detection on imported resources. Drift detection ensures that the template configuration matches the actual configuration. For more information, see [Detect drift on an entire CloudFormation stack](detect-drift-stack.md).
+ Import operations don't allow new resource creations, resource deletions, or changes to property configurations.
+ Each resource to import must have a `DeletionPolicy` attribute for the import operation to succeed. The `DeletionPolicy` can be set to any possible value. Only the resources you're importing need a `DeletionPolicy`. Resources that are already part of the stack don't need a `DeletionPolicy`.
+ You can't import the same resource into multiple stacks in the same Region.
+ You can use the `cloudformation:ImportResourceTypes` IAM policy condition to control which resource types users can work with during an import operation. For more information, see [Policy condition keys for CloudFormation](control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-conditions).
+ The CloudFormation stack limits apply when importing resources. For more information on limits, see [Understand CloudFormation quotas](cloudformation-limits.md).
