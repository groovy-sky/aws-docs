## How Git sync works

To use Git sync, you first must connect a Git provider to CloudFormation using the [CodeConnections](../../../../reference/codeconnections/latest/apireference/welcome.md)
service. In the procedures in this guide, the connection is created through the CodeConnections console.
Alternatively, you can create the connection with the AWS CLI. You can use any of the following
Git providers:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise)

- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

- [GitLab\
self-managed](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/self_managed)

Next, you create a CloudFormation template that defines your stack and add it to your
repository. This template file is monitored. CloudFormation updates the stack automatically when
changes are committed to it.

In the CloudFormation console, you create a new stack and choose **Sync from**
**Git** to tell CloudFormation to use Git sync. You'll specify the repository and branch
you want CloudFormation to monitor, and specify the CloudFormation template in your repository that
defines the stack.

During configuration, you can either provide your own stack deployment file from your
repository, or have Git sync generate one for you. The stack deployment file contains
parameters and values that configure the resources in your stack. This stack deployment file
is monitored. CloudFormation updates the stack automatically when changes are committed to
it.

Git sync creates a pull request in your repository to sync your stack with the CloudFormation
template file and stack deployment file. If Git sync generates the stack deployment file for
you, it's submitted to your repository by Git sync.

You then merge the pull request to your repository so that CloudFormation provisions the
stack, configures it with your deployment parameters, and begins monitoring your repository
for changes.

From then on, whenever you make changes to your template file or stack deployment file and
commit them to your repository, CloudFormation will automatically detect the changes. If your team
uses pull requests, your team members can then review and approve the changes before they're
deployed. Once the pull request is accepted, CloudFormation deploys your changes.

You can monitor the status of your Git sync configuration for the stack and see a history
of commits applied to the stack in the CloudFormation console. The console also provides tools for
reconfiguring Git sync and troubleshooting issues.

## Comments on pull requests

You can choose to have CloudFormation create a summary of the code changes in pull requests
through the CodeConnections service by turning on the **Enable comment on pull**
**request** option in the console. Providing a summary of the changes in pull
requests means that team members can easily review and understand the impact of the proposed
modifications before merging the pull request. For more information, see [Enable CloudFormation to post a summary of stack changes in pull requests](gitsync-enable-comments-on-pull-requests.md).

## Stack deployment file

A stack deployment file is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or YAML standard formatted
file that contains parameters and values that manage your CloudFormation stack. It is monitored
for changes. When changes to the file are committed to the repository, the associated stack is
automatically updated.

The stack deployment file contains a key-value pair and two dictionaries:

- `template-file-path`

This is the full repository path for the CloudFormation template file. The template file
declares the resources for the CloudFormation stack associated with this deployment
file.

- `parameters`

The parameters dictionary contains key-value pairs that configure the resources in the
stack. A stack deployment file can have up to 50 parameters.

- `tags`

The tags dictionary contains optional key-value pairs that you can use to identify and
categorize resources in the stack. A stack deployment file can have up to 50 tags.

You can provide your own stack deployment file, or have Git sync create one for you and
automatically submit a pull request to your repository. You can manage the parameters and tags
by editing the stack deployment file and committing changes to the repository.

The following is an example of a Git sync stack deployment file:

```yaml

template-file-path: fargate-srvc/my-stack-template.yaml

parameters:
    image: public.ecr.aws/lts/nginx:latest
    task_size: x-small
    max_capacity: 5
    port: 8080
    env: production
tags:
    cost-center: '123456'
    org: 'AWS'
```

## CloudFormation template file

A template file contains a declaration of the AWS resources that make up a CloudFormation
stack. With Git sync, the template file is stored in your Git repository and referenced by
the stack deployment file. You can manage the stack by editing the template file and
committing changes to the repository.

For more information, see [Working with CloudFormation templates](template-guide.md).

## Template definition repository

The template definition repository is the Git repository that is linked to CloudFormation
through Git sync. The repository is monitored for changes to the CloudFormation template and
stack deployment file. When you commit changes to the file, the associated stack is updated
automatically.

###### Important

When you configure the template definition repository in the Git sync console, select
the correct _repository_ and _branch_ from the Git
connection. Git sync only monitors the configured repository and branch for changes to the
CloudFormation template and the stack deployment file.
