# Protect CloudFormation stacks from being deleted

You can prevent a stack from being accidentally deleted by enabling termination protection
on the stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the
deletion fails and the stack, including its status, remains unchanged. You can enable
termination protection on a stack when you create it. Termination protection on stacks is
disabled by default. You can set termination protection on a stack with any status except
`DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` or `DELETE_COMPLETE`.

Enabling or disabling termination protection on a stack passes the same choice on to any
nested stacks belonging to that stack as well. You can't enable or disable termination
protection directly on a nested stack. If a user attempts to directly delete a nested stack
belonging with a stack that has termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the
nested stack remains unchanged.

However, if a user performs a stack update that would delete the nested stack, CloudFormation
deletes the nested stack accordingly.

Termination protection is different than disabling rollback. Termination protection
applies only to attempts to delete stacks, while disabling rollback applies to auto rollback
when stack creation fails.

###### To enable termination protection when creating a stack

On the **Specify stack options** page of the **Create**
**stack** wizard, under **Advanced options**, expand the
**Termination Protection** section and select
**Enable**. For more information, see [Configure stack options](cfn-console-create-stack.md#configure-stack-options).

###### To enable or disable termination protection on an existing stack

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

3. Select the stack that you want.

###### Note

If **NESTED** is displayed next to the stack name, the stack
is a nested stack. You can only change termination protection on the root stack
to which the nested stack belongs.

4. In the stack details pane, select **Stack actions** and then
    **Edit termination protection**.

CloudFormation displays the **Edit termination protection** dialog
    box.

5. Choose **Enable** or **Disable**, and then
    select **Save**.

###### To enable or disable termination protection on a nested stack

If **NESTED** is displayed next to the stack name, the stack is a
nested stack. You can only change termination protection on the root stack to which the
nested stack belongs. To change termination protection on the root stack:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

3. Select the nested stack that you want.

4. In the **Stack info** pane, in the **Overview**
    section, select the stack name listed as **Root stack**.

CloudFormation displays the stack details for the root stack.

5. Choose **Stack actions** and then choose **Edit**
**Termination Protection**.

CloudFormation displays the **Edit termination protection** dialog
    box.

6. Choose **Enable** or **Disable**, and then
    select **Save**.

###### To enable or disable termination protection using the command line

Use the [update-termination-protection](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-termination-protection.md) command.

## Controlling who can change termination protection on stacks

To enable or disable termination protection on stacks, a user requires permission to
the `cloudformation:UpdateTerminationProtection` action. For example, the
policy below allows users to enable or disable termination protection on stacks.

For more information on specifying permissions in CloudFormation, see [Control CloudFormation access with AWS Identity and Access Management](control-access-with-iam.md).

###### Example A sample policy that grants permissions to change stack termination protection

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[{
        "Effect":"Allow",
        "Action":[

        ],
        "Resource":"*"
    }]
}
