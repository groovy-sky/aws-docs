# Create a stack from the CloudFormation console

You can create a stack template and then use it to create a stack using either the
CloudFormation console or a command line tool. The console provides a wizard-driven interface with
predefined options, which streamlines the stack creation process.

## Creating a stack

Follow the steps in this section to deploy your template and create a stack.

###### Prerequisites

- You must have created a stack template. For more information, see [Working with CloudFormation templates](template-guide.md).

###### To create a stack (console)

01. Open the CloudFormation console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

02. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region to create
     the stack in.

03. On the **Stacks** page, choose **Create stack**
     at top right, and then choose **With new resources**
    **(standard)**.

    Alternatively, you can choose the **With existing resources (import**
    **resources)** option to import existing AWS resources that are described
     in your template. For more information on this option, see [Import AWS resources into a CloudFormation stack](import-resources.md).

04. On the **Create stack** page, do one of the following:

- To use an existing template, for **Prerequisite - Prepare**
**template**, choose **Choose an existing**
**template**. Then, under **Specify template**, choose
either **Amazon S3 URL** or **Upload a template**
**file** based on the template's location.

- If you choose **Amazon S3 URL**, provide a URL to the
template file in an S3 bucket.

If your template includes nested stacks (for example, stacks described
in other template documents located in subdirectories), make sure that
your S3 bucket contains the necessary files and directories.

If you have a template from a versioning-enabled bucket, you can
specify a specific version of the template by appending
`?versionId=version-id` to
the URL. For more information about versioning-enabled buckets, see
[Working\
with objects in a versioning-enabled bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/manage-objects-versioned-bucket.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

The URL must point to a template with a maximum size of 1 MB that is stored
in an S3 bucket that you have read permissions to. The URL can be a maximum of 1024 characters long. Some
resources may require that the bucket be in the same Region as the stack.

- If you choose **Upload a template file**, choose
**Choose File** to choose a template file from your
local computer. The template file size must be 1 MB or less.

Once you have chosen your template, CloudFormation uploads the file and
displays the S3 URL. CloudFormation uploads it to an Amazon S3 bucket in your
AWS account. If you already have an S3 bucket that was created by
CloudFormation in your AWS account, CloudFormation adds the template to that
bucket. If you don't already have an existing CloudFormation-created bucket,
it creates a unique bucket for each Region where you upload a template
file.

The following are considerations when using the S3 buckets created by
CloudFormation:

- The buckets are accessible to anyone with Amazon S3 permissions in
your AWS account.

- CloudFormation creates the buckets with server-side encryption
enabled by default, thereby encrypting all objects stored in the
bucket.

You can directly manage encryption options for buckets that
CloudFormation has created, for example, using the Amazon S3 console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3), or the AWS CLI. For more
information, see [Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3\
buckets](../../../s3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

- You can use your own bucket and manage its permissions by
manually uploading templates to Amazon S3. When you create or update a
stack, specify the Amazon S3 URL of a template file.

- If you don't have a template ready, you can choose **Build from**
**Infrastructure Composer** to create a template with Infrastructure Composer. For more information, see
[Infrastructure Composer](infrastructure-composer-for-cloudformation.md).

05. Choose **Next** to continue and to validate the template.

    Before continuing, CloudFormation validates your template to catch syntactic and some
     semantic errors, such as circular dependencies. During validation, CloudFormation first
     checks if the template is valid JSON. If it isn't, CloudFormation checks if the template
     is valid YAML. If both checks fail, CloudFormation returns a template validation
     error.

06. On the **Specify stack details** page, type a stack name in the
     **Stack name** box.

    The stack name is an identifier that helps you find a particular stack from a list
     of stacks. A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an
     alphabetic character and can't be longer than 128 characters.

07. In the **Parameters** section, specify values for the parameters
     that were defined in the template.

08. Choose **Next** to continue creating the stack.

09. (Optional) On the **Configure stack options** page, change the
     default stack options. For more information, see [Configure stack options](#configure-stack-options).

10. If your template contains IAM resources, for **Capabilities**,
     choose **I acknowledge that this template may create IAM**
    **resources** to specify that you want to use IAM resources in the
     template. For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

11. Choose **Next** to continue.

12. On the **Review and create** page, review the details of your
     stack.

    To change any of the values before launching the stack, choose
     **Edit** on the section that has the setting that you want to
     change.

13. (Optional) You can create a change set to preview the configuration of the stack
     before creating it. On the **Review and create** page, choose
     **Create change set** and follow the directions. For more
     information, see [Preview the configuration of your stack](#cfn-console-create-stacks-changesets).

14. Choose **Submit** to launch your stack.

CloudFormation will then proceed to create all the resources defined in the template.

You can monitor the progress and status of the stack creation on the
**Events** tab for your new stack. For more information, see [Monitor stack progress](monitor-stack-progress.md).

###### To create a stack using the command line

You can use one of the following commands:

- [create-stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html) (AWS CLI)

- [New-CFNStack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-CFNStack.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

For examples of using the command line to create a stack, see [Examples of CloudFormation stack operation commands for the AWS CLI and PowerShell](service-code-examples.md).

## Configure stack options

On the **Configure stack options** page, you can configure options for
your CloudFormation stacks like tags, notification of stack events, or a stack policy.

You can set the following stack options:

**Tags**

You can add up to 50 tag key pairs to your stack and to any resources that
CloudFormation supports tagging for. A tag is a customer-defined key and value that
can be assigned to AWS resources for purposes such as cost tracking.

A **Key** consists of any alphanumeric characters or spaces.
Tag keys can be up to 127 characters long.

A **Value** consists of any alphanumeric characters or spaces.
Tag values can be up to 255 characters long.

After stack creation, adding, updating, or removing stack-level tags will
initiate a stack update. All resources that support stack-level tag propagation
will be updated accordingly.

**Permissions**

An existing IAM service role that CloudFormation can assume. Instead of using
your account credentials, CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to create your
stack. For more information, see [CloudFormation service role](using-iam-servicerole.md).

**Stack failure options**

Specifies the provision failure options for all stack deployments and change
set operations. For more information, see [Choose how to handle failures when provisioning resources](stack-failure-options.md).

The **Roll back all stack resources** option will roll back
all resources specified in the template when the stack status is
`CREATE_FAILED` or `UPDATE_FAILED`.

For create operations, the **Preserve successfully provisioned**
**resources** option preserves the state of successful resources, while
failed resources will stay in a failed state until the next update operation is
performed.

For update and change set operations, the **Preserve successfully**
**provisioned resources** option preserve the state of successful
resources while rolling back failed resources to the last known stable state.
Failed resources will be in an `UPDATE_FAILED` state. Resources without
a last known stable state will be deleted upon the next stack operation.

You can also set the following advanced options for stack creation:

**Stack policy**

Defines the resources that you want to protect from unintentional updates
during a stack update. By default, all resources can be updated during a stack
update.

You can enter the stack policy directly as JSON, or upload a JSON file
containing the stack policy. For more information, see [Prevent updates to stack resources](protect-stack-resources.md).

**Rollback configuration**

You can have CloudFormation monitor the state of your stack during stack creation
and updating, and roll back that operation if the stack breaches the threshold of
any of the alarms you've specified. Specify the CloudWatch alarms that CloudFormation should
monitor. If any of the alarms goes to `ALARM` state during the stack
operation or the monitoring period, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack
operation. For more information, see [Roll back your CloudFormation stack on alarm breach with rollback triggers](using-cfn-rollback-triggers.md).

**Notification options**

You can specify a new or existing Amazon Simple Notification Service topic where notifications about
stack events are sent.

If you create an Amazon SNS topic, you must specify a name and an email address
where stack event notifications are to be sent.

**Stack creation options**

The following options are included for stack creation, but aren't available as
part of stack updates.

**Timeout**

Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, that CloudFormation should allot
before timing out stack creation operations. If CloudFormation can't create
the entire stack in the time allotted, it fails the stack creation due to
timeout and rolls back the stack.

By default, there is no timeout for stack creation. However,
individual resources may have their own timeouts based on the nature of
the service they implement. For example, if an individual resource in
your stack times out, stack creation also times out even if the timeout
you specified for stack creation hasn't yet been reached.

**Termination protection**

Prevents a stack from being accidentally deleted. If a user attempts
to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion fails
and the stack, including its status, remains unchanged. For more
information, see [Protect CloudFormation stacks from being deleted](using-cfn-protect-stacks.md).

Termination protection is **Disabled** by
default.

## Preview the configuration of your stack

To preview how a CloudFormation stack will be configured before creating the stack, create a
change set. This functionality allows you to examine various configurations and make
corrections and changes to your stack before executing the change set. For more information
on change sets, see [Update CloudFormation stacks using change sets](using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.md).

### Creating a change set for a new stack

To create a change set for a new stack, select your stack template and specify the
configuration of your stack as you would if you were creating a new stack, then choose
to create a new change set rather than a new stack.

###### To create a change set for a new stack

1. On the **Review and create** page, choose **Create**
**change set**.

2. In the **Create change set** dialog box, enter a name for the
    change set, and a description if desired. Choose **Create change**
**set**.

When you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation does the
    following:

- Launches a new stack with a status of
`REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`.

- Creates a change set for the new stack that reflects the stack
configuration you specified in the previous steps.

CloudFormation displays the **Change sets** page for the proposed
stack. While CloudFormation creates the change set, its status is
`CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`, and its execution status is
`UNAVAILABLE`. When CloudFormation completes successfully creating the
change set, it sets the change set status to `CREATE_COMPLETE`, and its
execution status is `AVAILABLE`. The stack status is updated to
`REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`. At this point, you can execute the change set
to complete creating the new stack.

In the **Changes** pane, CloudFormation displays the proposed
configuration of your stack.

If CloudFormation fails to create the change set, it sets the changes set status to
`CREATE_FAILED`. Fix the error displayed in the **Status**
**reason** field, and then create a new change set. At this stage, you
can try various configurations and make corrections and changes to your stack
before executing the next change set.

3. To complete creating a new stack based on the change set, choose
    **Execute**, specify your rollback configuration, and then
    choose **Execute change set**.
