# Continuous delivery with CodePipeline

Continuous delivery is a release practice in which code changes are automatically built,
tested, and prepared for release to production. With CloudFormation and CodePipeline, you can use
continuous delivery to automatically build and test changes to your CloudFormation templates
before promoting them to production stacks. This release process lets you rapidly and reliably
make changes to your AWS infrastructure.

For example, you can create a workflow that automatically builds a test stack when you
submit an updated template to a code repository. After CloudFormation builds the test stack, you
can test it and then decide whether to push the changes to a production stack. For more
information about the benefits of continuous delivery, see [What is continuous\
delivery?](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery).

Use CodePipeline to build a continuous delivery workflow by building a pipeline for CloudFormation
stacks. CodePipeline has built-in integration with CloudFormation, so you can specify CloudFormation-specific
actions, such as creating, updating, or deleting a stack, within a pipeline. For more
information about CodePipeline, see the [AWS CodePipeline User Guide](../../../codepipeline/latest/userguide.md).
