# Create a stack from repository source code with Git sync

This topic explains how to create a CloudFormation stack that syncs to a Git repository with
Git sync.

###### Important

Before you continue, complete all [prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/git-sync-prereq.html)
in the previous section.

## Create a stack from repository source code

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

02. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region to
     create the stack in.

03. On the **Stacks** page, choose **Create**
    **stack**, and then choose **With new resources**
    **(standard)**.

04. On the **Create stack** page, do the following:
    1. For **Prerequisite - Prepare template**, keep
        **Choose an existing template** selected.

    2. For **Specify template**, choose **Sync from**
       **Git**, and then choose **Next**.
05. On the **Specify stack details** page, for **Stack**
    **name**, type a name for your stack. Stack names can include letters
     (A-Z and a-z), numbers (0-9), and dashes (-).

06. For **Stack deployment file**, **Deployment file**
    **creation**:

- If you _haven't_ created a stack deployment file
and added it to your repository, choose **Create the file using**
**the following parameters and place it in my**
**repository.**

- If you have a stack deployment file in your repository, choose
**I am providing my own file in my**
**repository.**

07. For **Template definition repository**, choose
     **Choose a linked Git repository** to choose a Git
     repository that's already linked to CloudFormation, or **Link a Git**
    **repository** to link a new one. If you choose **Link a Git**
    **repository**, do the following:
    1. For **Select repository provider**, choose one of the
        following:

- **GitHub**

- **GitHub Enterprise Server**

- **GitLab**

- **Bitbucket**

- **GitLab self-managed**

    2. For **Connection**, choose a connection from the
        list. If no options appear in the **Connection** list,
        choose **add a new connection** to go to the [Connections\
        console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections) and create a connection to your repository.
08. In the **Repository** list, select the Git repository that
     contains your stack template file.

09. In the **Branch** list, select the branch you'd like
     Git sync to monitor.

    ###### Note

    Git sync only monitors the selected branch for changes to the CloudFormation
    template and stack deployment files. Any changes you'd like to apply to your
    stack must be committed to this branch.

10. For the **Deployment file path**, specify the full path
     including the stack deployment file name from the root of your repository
     branch.

    If CloudFormation is generating the file for you, this is where the file will be
     committed in your repository. If you are providing the file, this is the
     location of the file in your repository.

11. Add an **IAM role**. The IAM role includes permissions
     that are required for CloudFormation to sync the stack from your Git repository. You
     can choose **New IAM role** to generate a new role, or choose
     **Existing IAM role** to select an existing role from
     your AWS account. If you choose to generate a new role, the required
     permissions are included in the role.

12. Enable or turn off comments on pull request:

- To have CloudFormation post change set information in pull requests for
stack updates, keep the **Enable comment on pull**
**request** toggle switched on.

- If you switch this toggle off, CloudFormation won't describe the
differences between the current stack configuration and the proposed
changes in pull requests when the repo files are updated.

13. For the **Template file path**, specify the full path from
     the root of your repository for the stack template file.

14. (Optional) To specify the stack parameters, choose **Add**
    **parameter**, provide a key and value for each parameter, and then
     choose **Next**. For more information, see [Stack deployment file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/git-sync-concepts-terms.html#git-sync-concepts-terms-depoyment-file).

    For example, to specify a `port=8080` parameter in your
     stack deployment file, do the following:
    1. Choose **Add parameter**.

    2. For **Key**, enter
        `port`.

    3. For **Value**, enter
        `8080`.
15. (Optional) To specify stack tags, choose **Add new tag**,
     provide a tag key and value for each tag, and then choose
     **Next**. For more information, see [Stack deployment file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/git-sync-concepts-terms.html#git-sync-concepts-terms-depoyment-file).

16. Choose **Next** to continue to **Configure stack**
    **options**. For information about configuring stack options, see
     [Configure stack options](cfn-console-create-stack.md#configure-stack-options).

    When you've completed your stack configuration, choose **Next** to
     continue.

17. Review your stack settings and confirm the following:

- The stack template is configured correctly and set to **Sync**
**from Git**.

- The deployment file is configured correctly.

- The template definition repository is configured correctly, in
particular, that the correct **Repository** and
**Branch name** are selected.

- The preview of the deployment file is correct and contains the
expected parameters and values.

18. Choose **Submit** to create the stack.

    After you choose **Submit**, a pull request is automatically
     created in your Git repository. You must merge this pull request into your Git
     repository to create your stack. After the stack is created, CloudFormation monitors
     your Git repository for changes.

## Update your stack from your Git repository

To update the stack, make changes directly to your template file or stack deployment
file in your Git repository. After you commit your changes to the monitored branch,
CloudFormation automatically updates the stack. If you use pull requests, a pull request is
automatically created in your Git repository before the stack is updated. You must merge
this pull request into your Git repository to update your stack.

In the CloudFormation console, you can select the stack and choose the
**Git sync** tab to view information about the status of the stack
and sync events. For more information, see [Git sync status dashboard](git-sync-status.md).
