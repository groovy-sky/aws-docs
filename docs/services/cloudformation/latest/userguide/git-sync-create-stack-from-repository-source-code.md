# Create a stack from repository source code with Git sync
<a name="git-sync-create-stack-from-repository-source-code"></a>

This topic explains how to create a CloudFormation stack that syncs to a Git repository with Git sync.

**Important**
Before you continue, complete all [prerequisites](git-sync-prereq.md) in the previous section.

## Create a stack from repository source code
<a name="create-stack-from-repository-source-code"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region to create the stack in.

1. On the **Stacks** page, choose **Create stack**, and then choose **With new resources (standard)**.

1. On the **Create stack** page, do the following:

   1. For **Prerequisite - Prepare template**, keep **Choose an existing template** selected.

   1. For **Specify template**, choose **Sync from Git**, and then choose **Next**.

1. On the **Specify stack details** page, for **Stack name**, type a name for your stack. Stack names can include letters (A-Z and a-z), numbers (0-9), and dashes (-).

1. For **Stack deployment file**, **Deployment file creation**:
   + If you *haven't* created a stack deployment file and added it to your repository, choose **Create the file using the following parameters and place it in my repository.**
   + If you have a stack deployment file in your repository, choose **I am providing my own file in my repository.**

1. For **Template definition repository**, choose **Choose a linked Git repository** to choose a Git repository that's already linked to CloudFormation, or **Link a Git repository** to link a new one. If you choose **Link a Git repository**, do the following:

   1. For **Select repository provider**, choose one of the following:
      + **GitHub**
      + **GitHub Enterprise Server**
      + **GitLab**
      + **Bitbucket**
      + **GitLab self-managed**

   1. For **Connection**, choose a connection from the list. If no options appear in the **Connection** list, choose **add a new connection** to go to the [Connections console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections) and create a connection to your repository.

1. In the **Repository** list, select the Git repository that contains your stack template file.

1. In the **Branch** list, select the branch you'd like Git sync to monitor.
**Note**
Git sync only monitors the selected branch for changes to the CloudFormation template and stack deployment files. Any changes you'd like to apply to your stack must be committed to this branch.

1. For the **Deployment file path**, specify the full path including the stack deployment file name from the root of your repository branch.

   If CloudFormation is generating the file for you, this is where the file will be committed in your repository. If you are providing the file, this is the location of the file in your repository.

1. Add an **IAM role**. The IAM role includes permissions that are required for CloudFormation to sync the stack from your Git repository. You can choose **New IAM role** to generate a new role, or choose **Existing IAM role** to select an existing role from your AWS account. If you choose to generate a new role, the required permissions are included in the role.
**Note**
If role manager is enabled in your account, CloudFormation attaches a service role for you, and the **Existing IAM role** selection described here is replaced by a **Customize** option. To use a different role, choose **Customize**. For more information, see [IAM role creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

1. Enable or turn off comments on pull request:
   + To have CloudFormation post change set information in pull requests for stack updates, keep the **Enable comment on pull request** toggle switched on.
   + If you switch this toggle off, CloudFormation won't describe the differences between the current stack configuration and the proposed changes in pull requests when the repo files are updated.

1. For the **Template file path**, specify the full path from the root of your repository for the stack template file.

1. (Optional) To specify the stack parameters, choose **Add parameter**, provide a key and value for each parameter, and then choose **Next**. For more information, see [Stack deployment file](git-sync-concepts-terms.md#git-sync-concepts-terms-depoyment-file).

   For example, to specify a **port=8080** parameter in your stack deployment file, do the following:

   1. Choose **Add parameter**.

   1. For **Key**, enter **port**.

   1. For **Value**, enter **8080**.

1. (Optional) To specify stack tags, choose **Add new tag**, provide a tag key and value for each tag, and then choose **Next**. For more information, see [Stack deployment file](git-sync-concepts-terms.md#git-sync-concepts-terms-depoyment-file).

1. Choose **Next** to continue to **Configure stack options**. For information about configuring stack options, see [Configure stack options](cfn-console-create-stack.md#configure-stack-options).

   When you've completed your stack configuration, choose **Next** to continue.

1. Review your stack settings and confirm the following:
   + The stack template is configured correctly and set to **Sync from Git**.
   + The deployment file is configured correctly.
   + The template definition repository is configured correctly, in particular, that the correct **Repository** and **Branch name** are selected.
   + The preview of the deployment file is correct and contains the expected parameters and values.

1. Choose **Submit** to create the stack.

   After you choose **Submit**, a pull request is automatically created in your Git repository. You must merge this pull request into your Git repository to create your stack. After the stack is created, CloudFormation monitors your Git repository for changes.

## Update your stack from your Git repository
<a name="update-stack-from-repository-source-code"></a>

To update the stack, make changes directly to your template file or stack deployment file in your Git repository. After you commit your changes to the monitored branch, CloudFormation automatically updates the stack. If you use pull requests, a pull request is automatically created in your Git repository before the stack is updated. You must merge this pull request into your Git repository to update your stack.

In the CloudFormation console, you can select the stack and choose the **Git sync** tab to view information about the status of the stack and sync events. For more information, see [Git sync status dashboard](git-sync-status.md).
