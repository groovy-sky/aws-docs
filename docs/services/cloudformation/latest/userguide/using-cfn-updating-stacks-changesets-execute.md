# Execute a change set for a CloudFormation stack

To make the changes described in a change set to your stack, execute the change
set.

###### Important

After you execute a change set, CloudFormation deletes any additional change sets that are
associated with the stack because they're no longer valid for the updated stack. If an
update fails, you need to create a new change set.

###### Stack Policies and Executing a Change Set

If you execute a change set on a stack that has a stack policy associated with it,
CloudFormation enforces the policy when it updates the stack. You can't specify a temporary
stack policy that overrides the existing policy when you execute a change set. To update a
protected resource, you must update the stack policy or use the direct update method. For
more information, see [Update stacks directly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-direct.html).

Execute a change set (console)

###### To execute a change set

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

3. On the **Stacks** page, choose the name the stack that you want
    to update.

4. In the navigation pane, choose **Change sets** to view a list
    of the stack's change sets.

5. Choose the name of the change set that you want to execute.

6. On the change set's details page, choose **Execute change**
**set**.

CloudFormation immediately starts updating the stack. The CloudFormation console directs
    you to the **Events** tab, where you can monitor the progress of
    the stack update. For more information, see [Monitor stack progress](monitor-stack-progress.md).

Execute a change set for nested stacks (console)

###### To execute a change set for nested stacks

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose your AWS Region.

3. On the **Stacks** page, choose the name the stack that you want
    to update. You must choose the stack name associated with the root change
    set.

4. In the navigation pane, choose **Change sets** to view a list
    of the stack's change sets.

5. Choose the name of the root change set that you want to execute.

6. On the change set's details page, choose **Execute change**
**set**.

###### Note

CloudFormation executes the changes described in your root change set and nested
change sets, if **Enabled** for change sets for nested stacks was
selected during the [Create a change set for a CloudFormation stack](using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets-create.md) process.

CloudFormation immediately starts updating the stack. The CloudFormation console directs
    you to the **Events** tab, where you can monitor the progress of
    the stack update. For more information, see [Monitor stack progress](monitor-stack-progress.md).

###### To execute a change set (AWS CLI)

- Run the [execute-change-set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/execute-change-set.html) command.

Specify the change set ID of the change set that you want to execute, as shown in the
following example:

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation execute-change-set \
      --change-set-name \
        arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:changeSet/SampleChangeSet/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000
```

The command in the example executes a change set with the ID
`arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789012:changeSet/SampleChangeSet/1a2345b6-0000-00a0-a123-00abc0abc000`.

After you run the command, CloudFormation starts updating the stack. To view the stack's
progress, use the [describe-stacks](service-code-examples.md#describe-stacks-sdk)
command.
