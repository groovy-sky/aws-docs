# Resolve write-only properties

With the CloudFormation IaC generator, you can generate a template using resources provisioned in
your account that are not already managed by CloudFormation. However, certain resource properties are
designated as _write-only_, meaning they can be written but can't be read by
CloudFormation, for example, a database password.

When generating CloudFormation templates from existing resources, write-only properties pose a
challenge. In most cases, CloudFormation converts these properties into parameters in the generated
template. This allows you to enter the properties as parameter values during import operations.
However, there are scenarios where this conversion is not possible, and CloudFormation handles these
cases differently.

## Mutually exclusive properties

Some resources have multiple sets of mutually exclusive properties, at least some of which
are write-only. In these cases, the IaC generator can't determine which set of exclusive
properties was applied to the resource during creation. For example, you can provide the code for
a [AWS::Lambda::Function](../templatereference/aws-resource-lambda-function.md) using one of these sets of properties.

- `Code/S3Bucket`, `Code/S3Key`, and optionally
`Code/S3ObjectVersion`

- `Code/ImageUri`

- `Code/ZipFile`

All of these properties are write-only. The IaC generator selects one of the exclusive sets
of properties and adds them to the generated template. Parameters are added for each of the
write-only properties. The parameter names include `OneOf` and the parameter
descriptions indicate that the corresponding property can be replaced with other exclusive
properties. The IaC generator sets a warning type of `MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE_PROPERTIES`
for the included properties.

## Mutually exclusive types

In some cases, a write-only property can be of multiple data types. For example, the
`Body` property of [AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi](../templatereference/aws-resource-apigateway-restapi.md) can be either an `object` or a
`string`. When this is the case, the IaC generator includes the property in the
generated template using the type of `string` and sets a warning type of
`MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE_TYPES`.

## Array properties

If a write-only property has a type of `array`, the IaC generator can't include
it in the generated template because parameters can only be scalar values. In this case, the
property is omitted from the template, and a warning type of `UNSUPPORTED_PROPERTIES`
is set.

## Optional properties

For optional write-only properties, the IaC generator can’t detect if the property was used
when setting up the resource. In this case, the property is omitted from the generated template,
and a warning type of `UNSUPPORTED_PROPERTIES` is set.

## Warnings and next steps

To determine which properties are write-only, you must look at the warnings returned by the
IaC generator console. The [AWS resource and property types reference](../templatereference/aws-template-resource-type-ref.md) doesn't indicate if a property is
write-only, or if it supports multiple types.

Alternatively, you can see which properties are write-only from the resource provider
schemas. To download the resource provider schemas, see the [CloudFormation resource provider schemas](../templatereference/resource-type-schemas.md).

###### To resolve issues with write-only properties

1. Open the [IaC generator\
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?) of the CloudFormation console.

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region for your
    template.

3. Choose the **Templates** tab, and then choose the name of the template
    you created.

4. On the **Template definition** tab, when the generated template includes
    resources with write-only properties, the IaC generator console displays a warning with a
    summary of the type of issues. For example:

![IaC generator console warning about write-only properties in generated template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/IaC-generator-write-only-property-warning.png)

5. Choose **View warning details** for more details. The resources with
    write-only properties are identified by the logical ID used in the generated template and
    resource type.

Use the list of warnings to identify resources with write-only properties and look at each
    resource to determine what changes (if any) need to be made to the generated template.

6. If your template must be updated to resolve issues with write-only properties, do the
    following:
1. Choose **Download** to download a copy of the template.

2. Edit your template.

3. When the changes are complete, you can choose the **Import edited**
      **template** button to continue the import process.
