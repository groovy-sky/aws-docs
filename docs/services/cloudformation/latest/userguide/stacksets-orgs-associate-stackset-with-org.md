# Create CloudFormation StackSets with service-managed permissions

With _service-managed_ permissions, you can deploy stacks to
accounts managed by AWS Organizations in specific Regions. With this model, you don't need to
create IAM roles in each target account and AWS Region. CloudFormation creates the IAM
roles on your behalf. For more information, see [Activate trusted\
access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.html).

## Considerations

Before you create a StackSet with service-managed permissions, consider the
following:

- StackSets with service-managed permissions can be initiated by either
your organization's management account or delegated administrator accounts,
but all operations are performed by the management account.

- CloudFormation doesn't deploy stacks to the management account, even if that
account is part of your organization or belongs to an organizational unit
(OU).

- Your StackSet can target your entire organization (includes all accounts) or
specified OUs. When a StackSet targets a parent OU, it automatically includes
any child OUs. By default, when a StackSet targets specific OUs, it includes all
accounts within those OUs. However, you can target specific accounts using
account filter options.

- Multiple StackSets can target the same organization or OU.

- Your can't target accounts outside your organization.

- Your authorization to deploy StackSets depends on the permissions
assigned to the IAM principal (user, role, or group) you use to sign in to
the management account. For an example IAM policy that grants permissions
to deploy to an organization, see [Restrict stack set operations based on Region and resource types](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#resource-level-permissions-service-managed-stack-set).

- Delegated administrators have full permissions to deploy to any account in
your organization. The management account can't limit delegated administrator
permissions to deploy to specific OUs or StackSet operations.

- Automatic deployment settings apply at the StackSet level. You can't adjust
automatic deployments selectively for OUs, accounts, or Regions.

- StackSets that use service-managed permissions don't support nested
stacks or templates that contain macros or transforms.

## Create a StackSet with service-managed permissions (console)

###### To create a StackSet

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

02. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region
     that you want to manage the StackSet from.

03. From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**.

04. From the top of the **StackSets** page, choose
     **Create StackSet**.

05. Under **Permissions**, choose **Service-managed**
    **permissions**.

    ###### Note

    If trusted access with AWS Organizations is disabled, a banner displays.
    Trusted access is required to create or update a StackSet with
    service-managed permissions. Only the administrator in the
    organization's management account has permissions to [Activate trusted access for StackSets with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.html).

06. Under **Prerequisite - Prepare template**, choose
     **Template is ready**.

07. Under **Specify template**, choose to either specify the
     URL for the S3 bucket that contains your stack template or upload a stack
     template file. Then, choose **Next**.

08. On the **Specify StackSet details** page, provide a name
     for the StackSet, specify any parameters, and then choose
     **Next**.

09. On the **Configure StackSet options** page, under
     **Tags**, specify any tags to apply to resources in
     your stack. For more information about how tags are used in AWS, see
     [Organizing\
     and tracking costs using AWS cost allocation tags](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.md) in the
     _AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide_.

10. For **Execution configuration**, choose
     **Active** to enable CloudFormation's optimized operation
     handling:

- Non-conflicting operations run concurrently for faster deployment
times.

- Conflicting operations are automatically queued and processed in
the order they were requested.

While operations are running or queued, CloudFormation queues all incoming
operations even if they're non-conflicting. You can't change execution
settings during this time.

11. If your template contains IAM resources, for
     **Capabilities**, choose **I acknowledge that**
    **this template may create IAM resources** to specify that you
     want to use IAM resources in the template. For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

12. Choose **Next** to proceed and to activate trusted access
     if not already activated.

13. On the **Set deployment options** page, under
     **Deployment targets**, do one of the following:

- To deploy to all accounts in your organization, choose
**Deploy to organization**.

- To deploy to all accounts in specific OUs, choose **Deploy**
**to organizational units (OUs)**. Choose **Add**
**an OU**, and then paste the target OU ID in the text
box. Repeat for each new target OU.

If you chose **Deploy to organizational units (OUs)**,
for **Account filter type**, you can set your deployment
targets to be specific individual accounts by choosing one of the following
options and providing account numbers.

- **None** (default) – Deploy stacks to all
accounts in the specified OUs.

- **Intersection** – Deploy stacks to
specific individual accounts within the selected OUs.

- **Difference** – Deploy stacks to all
accounts in the selected OUs except for specific accounts.

- **Union** – Deploy stacks to the specified
OUs plus additional individual accounts.

14. Under **Automatic deployment**, choose whether to
     automatically deploy to accounts that are added to the target organization
     or OUs in the future. For more information, see [Enable or disable automatic deployments for StackSets in AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-manage-auto-deployment.html).

15. If you enabled automatic deployment, under **Account removal**
    **behavior**, choose whether stack resources are retained or
     deleted when an account is removed from a target organization or OU.

    ###### Note

    With **Retain stacks** selected, stacks are removed
    from your StackSet, but the stacks and their associated resources are
    retained. The resources stay in their current state, but will no longer
    be part of the StackSet.

16. Under **Specify regions**, choose the Regions you want to
     deploy stacks in.

17. For **Deployment options**, do the following:

- For **Maximum concurrent accounts**, specify how
many accounts are processed concurrently.

- For **Failure tolerance**, specify the maximum
number of account failures allowed per Region. The operation will
stop and won't proceed to other Regions once this limit is
reached.

- For **Region concurrency**, choose how to process
Regions: **Sequential** (one Region at a time) or
**Parallel** (multiple Regions
concurrently).

- For **Concurrency mode**, choose how concurrency
behaves during operation execution.

- **Strict failure tolerance** –
Reduces account concurrency level when failures occur,
staying within **Failure tolerance**
+1.

- **Soft failure tolerance** –
Maintains your specified concurrency level (the value of
**Maximum concurrent accounts**)
regardless of failures.

- For StackSet **dependencies**, add dependent StackSet
ARNs, staying within 10 dependencies maximum. For more information,
see [Enable or disable automatic deployments for StackSets in AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-manage-auto-deployment.html).

18. Choose **Next** to continue.

19. On the **Review** page, verify that your StackSet will deploy
     to the correct accounts in the correct Regions, and then choose
     **Create StackSet**.

    The **StackSet details** page opens. You can view the
     progress and status of the creation of the stacks in your StackSet.

## Create a StackSet with service-managed permissions (AWS CLI)

Follow the steps in this section to use the AWS CLI to:

- Create the StackSet container.

- Deploy stack instances.

###### Note

When acting as a delegated administrator, you must include `--call-as
                        DELEGATED_ADMIN` in the command.

Deploy to your organization

###### To create a StackSet

1. Use the [create-stack-set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-set.html) command to
    create a new StackSet named
    `my-stackset`. The
    following example uses a template stored in an S3 bucket,
    enables automatic deployments, and preserves stacks when
    accounts are removed. For more information, see [Enable or disable automatic deployments for StackSets in AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-manage-auto-deployment.html).

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
     --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --template-url https://s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/MyApp.template \
     --permission-model SERVICE_MANAGED \
     --auto-deployment Enabled=true,RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval=true,DependsOn=ARN1,ARN2
```

2. Use the [list-stack-sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-sets.html) command to
    confirm that your StackSet was created. Your new StackSet is listed in
    the results.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation list-stack-sets
```

- If you set the `--call-as` option to
`DELEGATED_ADMIN` while signed in to your
member account, **list-stack-sets**
returns all StackSets with service-managed
permissions in the organization's
management account.

- If you set the `--call-as` option to
`SELF` while signed in to your
AWS account, **list-stack-sets**
returns all self-managed StackSets in your
AWS account.

- If you set the `--call-as` option to
`SELF` while signed in to the
organization's management account,
**list-stack-sets** returns all
StackSets in the organization's
management account.

3. Use the [create-stack-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-instances.html) command
    to add stacks to your StackSet. For the
    `--deployment-targets` option, specify the
    organization root ID to deploy to all accounts in your
    organization.

Set concurrent account processing and other deployment
    preferences using the `--operation-preferences`
    option. This example uses count-based settings. Note that
    `MaxConcurrentCount` must not exceed
    `FailureToleranceCount` \+ 1\. For percentage-based
    settings, use `FailureTolerancePercentage` or
    `MaxConcurrentPercentage` instead.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=r-a1b2c3d4e5 \
     --regions us-west-2 us-east-1 \
     --operation-preferences MaxConcurrentCount=1,FailureToleranceCount=0
```

For more information, see [CreateStackInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStackInstances.html) in the
    _AWS CloudFormation API Reference_.

4. Using the `operation-id` that was returned as part
    of the **create-stack-instances** output, use the
    following [describe-stack-set-operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html)
    command to verify that your stacks were created
    successfully.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
     --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --operation-id operation_ID
```

Deploy to organizational units (OUs)

###### To create a StackSet

1. Use the [create-stack-set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-set.html) command to
    create a new StackSet named
    `my-stackset`. The
    following example uses a template stored in an S3 bucket and
    includes a parameter that sets a
    `KeyPairName` with
    the value `TestKey`

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
     --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --template-url https://s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/MyApp.template \
     --permission-model SERVICE_MANAGED \
     --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=TestKey
```

2. Use the [list-stack-sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-sets.html) command to
    confirm that your StackSet was created. Your new StackSet is listed in
    the results.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation list-stack-sets
```

- If you set the `--call-as` option to
`DELEGATED_ADMIN` while signed in to your
member account, **list-stack-sets**
returns all StackSets with service-managed
permissions in the organization's
management account.

- If you set the `--call-as` option to
`SELF` while signed in to your
AWS account, **list-stack-sets**
returns all self-managed StackSets in your
AWS account.

- If you set the `--call-as` option to
`SELF` while signed in to the
organization's management account,
**list-stack-sets** returns all
StackSets in the organization's
management account.

3. Use the [create-stack-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-instances.html) command
    to add stacks to your StackSet. For the
    `--deployment-targets` option, specify the OU IDs
    to deploy to.

Set concurrent account processing and other deployment
    preferences using the `--operation-preferences`
    option. This example uses count-based settings. Note that
    `MaxConcurrentCount` must not exceed
    `FailureToleranceCount` \+ 1\. For percentage-based
    settings, use `FailureTolerancePercentage` or
    `MaxConcurrentPercentage` instead.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=ou-rcuk-1x5j1lwo,ou-rcuk-slr5lh0a \
     --regions us-west-2 us-east-1 \
     --operation-preferences MaxConcurrentCount=1,FailureToleranceCount=0
```

For more information, see [CreateStackInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStackInstances.html) in the
    _AWS CloudFormation API Reference_.

4. Using the `operation-id` that was returned as part
    of the **create-stack-instances** output, use the
    following [describe-stack-set-operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html)
    command to verify that your stacks were created
    successfully.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
     --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --operation-id operation_ID
```

Deploy to specific accounts in OUs

You can target specific organizational units (OUs) and use account
filtering to precisely control which accounts receive stack deployments.
By default, stacks deploy to all accounts within specified OUs if no
account filtering is specified.

In the AWS CLI, you specify account filtering with the
`--deployment-targets` option. For more information, see
[DeploymentTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentTargets.html).

After you create the StackSet container with the
**create-stack-set** command, use one of the
following examples to deploy stacks to specific accounts.

###### Target specific accounts in an OU

The following example deploys stacks only to accounts A1 and A2 in
OU1.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
  --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=OU1,Accounts=A1,A2,AccountFilterType=INTERSECTION \
  --regions us-west-2 us-east-1
```

###### Exclude accounts from an OU

The following example deploys stacks to all accounts in OU1 except
accounts A1 and A2.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
  --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=OU1,Accounts=A1,A2,AccountFilterType=DIFFERENCE \
  --regions us-west-2 us-east-1
```
