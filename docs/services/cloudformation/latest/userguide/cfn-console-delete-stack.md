# Delete a stack from the CloudFormation console

If you no longer need the resources in a stack, you can delete the entire stack.

When deleting a stack, CloudFormation deletes all resources in that stack unless you used a
deletion policy to retain specific resources. For more information, see [DeletionPolicy attribute](../templatereference/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.md).

###### To delete a stack (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region where the
    stack is located.

3. On the **Stacks** page, choose the stack that you want to delete.
    The stack must be currently running.

4. Choose **Delete**.

5. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Delete**.

###### Note

The stack deletion operation can't be stopped once the stack deletion has begun.
The stack proceeds to the `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` state.

After the stack deletion is complete, the stack will be in the
`DELETE_COMPLETE` state. Stacks in the `DELETE_COMPLETE`
state aren't displayed in the CloudFormation console by default. To display deleted
stacks, you must change the stack view filter as described in [View deleted stacks from the CloudFormation console](cfn-console-view-deleted-stacks.md).

###### To force delete a stack (console)

A stack deletion might fail because a resource in the stack fails to delete. For
example, CloudFormation will fail the deletion of a resource that another stack also depends
on. Any resources that haven't been deleted will remain until you can successfully delete
the stack. If the deletion fails and returns a `DELETE_FAILED` state, you can
choose to retry using one of two methods.

1. On the **Stacks** page in the CloudFormation console, choose the stack
    that you want to force delete.

2. In the stack details pane, choose **Retry delete**.

3. Choose between the following options:

- **Delete this stack but retain resources**: This option allows
you to select the specific resources that originally failed to delete, but you
want to retain during the force stack deletion.

- **Force delete this entire stack**: This option retains all resources that failed
to delete, and retains dependencies of those resources.

4. Choose **Delete** to begin the force delete process with your
    selections.

###### To review retained resources (console)

After deleting the stack, you can view the resources that were retained in the
console.

1. In the stacks list, choose the **Filter status** and select
    **Deleted**.

2. Choose the deleted stack.

3. Choose the **Resources** tab.

4. All retained resources show the `DELETE_SKIPPED` **Status**.

5. Choose the retained resource you want to review.

###### To delete a stack using the command line

You can use one of the following commands:

- [delete-stack](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/delete-stack.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Remove-CFNStack](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/remove-cfnstack.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

For examples of using the command line to delete a stack, see [Examples of CloudFormation stack operation commands for the AWS CLI and PowerShell](service-code-examples.md).
