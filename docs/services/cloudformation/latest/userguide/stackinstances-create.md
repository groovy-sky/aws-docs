# Add stacks to CloudFormation StackSets

When you create a StackSet, you can create the stacks for that StackSet. CloudFormation also
enables you to add more stacks, for additional accounts and Regions, at any point after
the StackSet is created. You can add stacks using either the CloudFormation console or the
AWS CLI.

## Add stacks to a StackSet (console)

###### To add stacks to a StackSet

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region
    you created the StackSet in.

3. From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**. On the
    StackSets page, select the StackSet that you created.

4. With the StackSet selected, choose **Add stacks to StackSet**
    from the **Actions** menu.

5. On the **Set deployment options** page, do the
    following:
1. For **Add stacks to StackSet**, choose
       **Deploy new stacks**.

2. Next, do the following depending on your StackSet's permissions
       configuration:

- \[Self-managed permissions\] For
**Accounts**, **Deployment**
**locations**, choose **Deploy stacks in**
**accounts**. Paste your target account numbers
in the text box, separating multiple numbers with
commas.

- \[Service-managed permissions\] For **Deployment**
**targets**, do one of the following:

- Choose **Deploy to organization**
to deploy to all accounts in your
organization.

- Choose **Deploy to organizational units**
**(OUs)** to deploy to all accounts in
specific OUs. Choose **Add another**
**OU**, and then paste the target OU ID in
the text box. Repeat for each new target OU.
CloudFormation also targets any child OUs of your
selected targets.

###### Note

If you add an OU that your StackSet already targets,
CloudFormation creates new stacks in any accounts in the OU
that don't already have stacks from your StackSet (for
example, accounts that were added to the OU after your
StackSet was created and with automatic deployments
disabled).

3. For **Specify regions**, specify which
       AWS Regions to deploy to in the target accounts you specified in
       the previous step. By default, CloudFormation will deploy stacks in the
       specified accounts within the first Region, then moves on to the
       next, and so on, as long as a Region's deployment failures don't
       exceed a specified failure tolerance.

4. For **Deployment options**, do the
       following:

- For **Maximum concurrent accounts**,
specify how many accounts are processed concurrently.

- For **Failure tolerance**, specify the
maximum number of account failures allowed per Region. The
operation will stop and won't proceed to other Regions once
this limit is reached.

- For **Region concurrency**, choose how to
process Regions: **Sequential** (one Region
at a time) or **Parallel** (multiple
Regions concurrently).

- For **Concurrency mode**, choose how
concurrency behaves during operation execution.

- **Strict failure tolerance**
– Reduces account concurrency level when
failures occur, staying within **Failure**
**tolerance** +1.

- **Soft failure tolerance**
– Maintains your specified concurrency level
(the value of **Maximum concurrent**
**accounts**) regardless of failures.

5. Choose **Next**.
6. On the **Specify Overrides** page, leave the property
    values as specified. You won't be overriding any property values for the
    stacks you're going to create. Choose **Next**.

7. On the **Review** page, review your choices. To make
    changes, choose **Edit** on the related section.

8. When you're ready to proceed, choose **Submit**.

CloudFormation starts creating your stacks. View the progress and status of
    the creation of the stacks in your StackSet in the StackSet details page that opens
    when you choose **Submit**. When complete, your new stacks
    should be listed on the **Stack instances** tab.

## Add stacks to a StackSet (AWS CLI)

###### Note

When acting as a delegated administrator, you must include `--call-as
                        DELEGATED_ADMIN` in the command.

###### To add stacks to a StackSet with self-managed permissions

Use the **create-stack-instances** CLI command. For the
`--accounts` option, provide the accounts IDs for which you want
to create stacks.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
  --accounts account_id --regions eu-west-1 us-west-2
```

###### To add stacks to a StackSet with service-managed permissions

Use the **create-stack-instances** CLI command. For the
`--deployment-targets` option, provide the organization (root) ID
or OU IDs for which you want to create stacks. For example commands that target
specific accounts, see [Create a StackSet with service-managed permissions (AWS CLI)](stacksets-orgs-associate-stackset-with-org.md#stacksets-orgs-associate-stackset-with-org-cli).

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-instances --stack-set-name my-stackset \
  --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=ou-rcuk-r1qi0wl7 --regions eu-west-1 us-west-2
```

###### Note

If you add an OU that your StackSet already targets, CloudFormation creates new stacks
in any accounts in the OU that don't already have stacks from your StackSet (for
example, accounts that were added to the OU after your StackSet was created and with
automatic deployments disabled).
