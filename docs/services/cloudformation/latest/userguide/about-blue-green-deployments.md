## How it works
<a name="blue-green-how-it-works"></a>

When using CloudFormation to perform ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy, you start by creating a stack template that defines the resources for both your blue and green application environments, including specifying the traffic routing and stabilization settings to use. Next, you create a stack from that template. This generates your blue (current) application. CloudFormation only creates the blue resources during stack creation. Resources for a green deployment aren't created until they're required.

Then, if in a future stack update you update the task definition or task set resources in your blue application, CloudFormation does the following:
+ Generates all the necessary green application environment resources
+ Shifts the traffic based on the specified traffic routing parameters
+ Deletes the blue resources

If an error occurs at any point before the green deployment is successful and finalized, CloudFormation rolls the stack back to its state before the entire green deployment was initiated.

## Resource updates that initiate green deployments
<a name="blue-green-resources"></a>

When you perform a stack update that updates certain properties of specific ECS resources, CloudFormation initiates a green deployment process. The resources that initiate this process are:
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html)
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskset.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskset.html)

However, if the updates to these resources don't involve property changes that require replacement, a green deployment won't be initiated. For more information, see [Understand update behaviors of stack resources](using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md).

It's important to note that you can't combine updates to the above resources with updates to other resources in the same stack update operation. If you need to update both the listed resources and other resources within the same stack, you have two options:
+ Perform two separate stack update operations: one that includes only the updates to the above resources, and a separate stack update that includes changes to any other resources.
+ Remove the `Transform` and `Hooks` sections from your template and then perform the stack update. In this case, CloudFormation won't perform a green deployment.

## Preparing your template to perform ECS blue/green deployments
<a name="blue-green-setup"></a>

To enable blue/green deployments on your stack, include the following sections in your stack template before performing a stack update.
+ Add a reference to the `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform to your template:

  ```
  "Transform": [
    "AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen"
  ],
  ```
+ Add a `Hooks` section that invokes the `AWS::CodeDeploy::BlueGreen` hook and specifies the properties for your deployment. For more information, see [`AWS::CodeDeploy::BlueGreen` hook syntax](blue-green-hook-syntax.md).
+ In the `Resources` section, define the blue and green resources for your deployment.

You can add these sections when you first create the template (that's, before creating the stack itself), or you can add them to an existing template before performing a stack update. If you specify the blue/green deployment for a new stack, CloudFormation only creates the blue resources during stack creation — resources for the green deployment aren't created until they're required during a stack update.

## Modeling your blue/green deployment using CloudFormation resources
<a name="blue-green-required"></a>

To perform CodeDeploy blue/green deployment on ECS, your CloudFormation template needs to include the resources that model your deployment, such as an Amazon ECS service and load balancer. For more details on what these resources represent, see [Before you begin an Amazon ECS deployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-steps-ecs.html#deployment-steps-prerequisites-ecs) in the *AWS CodeDeploy User Guide*.

## Change sets
<a name="blue-green-changesets"></a>

We strongly recommend that you create a change set before performing a stack update that will initiate a green deployment. This allows you to see the actual changes that will be made to your stack before performing stack update. Be aware that resource changes may not be listed in the order in which they will be performed during the stack update. For more information, see [Update CloudFormation stacks using change sets](using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.md).

Whether you use change sets or direct stack operations for your blue/green deployments, CloudFormation automatically runs pre-deployment validation to catch common template errors before any resources are provisioned. This includes property syntax validation and resource name conflict detection on all stack operations, plus additional checks (service quota limits, Recorder conflicts, and ECR repository delete readiness) available as warnings during change set creation.

## Monitoring stack events
<a name="blue-green-events"></a>

You can view the stack events generated at each step of the ECS deployment on the **Events** tab of the **Stack** page, and using the AWS CLI. For more information, see [Monitor stack progress](monitor-stack-progress.md).

## IAM permissions for blue/green deployments
<a name="blue-green-iam"></a>

In order for CloudFormation to successfully perform the blue-green deployments, you must have the following CodeDeploy permissions:
+ `codedeploy:Get*`
+ `codedeploy:CreateCloudFormationDeployment`

For more information, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awscodedeploy.html) in the *Service Authorization Reference*.
