## Properties
<a name="cfn-blue-green-hook-properties"></a>

Logical ID (also called *logical name*)
The logical ID of a hook declared in the `Hooks` section of the template. The logical ID must be alphanumeric (A-Za-z0-9) and unique within the template.
*Required*: Yes
`Type`
The type of hook. `AWS::CodeDeploy::BlueGreen`
*Required*: Yes
`Properties`
Properties of the hook.
*Required*: Yes
`TrafficRoutingConfig`
Traffic routing configuration settings.
*Required*: No
The default configuration is time-based canary traffic shifting, with a 15% step percentage and a five minute bake time.
`Type`
The type of traffic shifting used by the deployment configuration.
Valid values: AllAtOnce \| TimeBasedCanary \| TimeBasedLinear
*Required*: Yes
`TimeBasedCanary`
Specifies a configuration that shifts traffic from one version of the deployment to another in two increments.
*Required*: Conditional: If you specify `TimeBasedCanary` as the traffic routing type, you must include the `TimeBasedCanary` parameter.
`StepPercentage`
The percentage of traffic to shift in the first increment of a `TimeBasedCanary` deployment. The step percentage must be 14% or greater.
*Required*: No
`BakeTimeMins`
The number of minutes between the first and second traffic shifts of a `TimeBasedCanary` deployment.
*Required*: No
`TimeBasedLinear`
Specifies a configuration that shifts traffic from one version of the deployment to another in equal increments, with an equal number of minutes between each increment.
*Required*: Conditional: If you specify `TimeBasedLinear` as the traffic routing type, you must include the `TimeBasedLinear` parameter.
`StepPercentage`
The percentage of traffic that's shifted at the start of each increment of a `TimeBasedLinear` deployment. The step percentage must be 14% or greater.
*Required*: No
`BakeTimeMins`
The number of minutes between each incremental traffic shift of a `TimeBasedLinear` deployment.
*Required*: No
`AdditionalOptions`
Additional options for the blue/green deployment.
*Required*: No
`TerminationWaitTimeInMinutes`
Specifies time to wait, in minutes, before terminating the blue resources.
*Required*: No
`LifecycleEventHooks`
Use lifecycle event hooks to specify a Lambda function that CodeDeploy can call to validate a deployment. You can use the same function or a different one for deployment lifecyle events. Following completion of the validation tests, the Lambda `AfterAllowTraffic` function calls back CodeDeploy and delivers a result of `Succeeded` or `Failed`. For more information, see [AppSpec 'hooks' section](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.html) in the *AWS CodeDeploy User Guide.*
*Required*: No
`BeforeInstall`
Function to use to run tasks before the replacement task set is created.
*Required*: No
`AfterInstall`
Function to use to run tasks after the replacement task set is created and one of the target groups is associated with it.
*Required*: No
`AfterAllowTestTraffic`
Function to use to run tasks after the test listener serves traffic to the replacement task set.
*Required*: No
`BeforeAllowTraffic`
Function to use to run tasks after the second target group is associated with the replacement task set, but before traffic is shifted to the replacement task set.
*Required*: No
`AfterAllowTraffic`
Function to use to run tasks after the second target group serves traffic to the replacement task set.
*Required*: No
`ServiceRole`
The execution role for CloudFormation to use to perform the blue-green deployments. For a list of the necessary permissions, see [IAM permissions for blue/green deployments](about-blue-green-deployments.md#blue-green-iam).
*Required*: No
`Applications`
Specifies properties of the Amazon ECS application.
*Required*: Yes
`Target`

*Required*: Yes
`Type`
The type of the resource.
*Required*: Yes
`LogicalID`
The logical id of the resource.
*Required*: Yes
`ECSAttributes`
The resources that represent the various requirements of your Amazon ECS application deployment.
*Required*: Yes
`TaskDefinitions`
The logical ID of the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html) resource to run the Docker container that contains your Amazon ECS application.
*Required*: Yes
`TaskSets`
The logical IDs of the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskset.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-ecs-taskset.html) resources to use as task sets for the application.
*Required*: Yes
`TrafficRouting`
Specifies resources used for traffic routing.
*Required*: Yes
`ProdTrafficRoute`
The listener to be used by your load balancer to direct traffic to your target groups.
*Required*: Yes
`Type`
The type of the resource. `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener`
*Required*: Yes
`LogicalID`
The logical ID of the resource.
*Required*: Yes
`TestTrafficRoute`
The listener to be used by your load balancer to direct traffic to your target groups.
*Required*: Yes
`Type`
The type of the resource. `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener`
*Required*: Yes
`LogicalID`
The logical ID of the resource.
*Required*: No
`TargetGroups`
Logical ID of resources to use as target groups to route traffic to the registered target.
*Required*: Yes
