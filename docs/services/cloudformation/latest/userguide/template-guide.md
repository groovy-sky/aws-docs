# Working with CloudFormation templates

An AWS CloudFormation template defines the AWS resources you want to create, update, or delete as
part of a stack. It consists of several sections, but the only required section is the [Resources](resources-section-structure.md)
section, which must declare at least one resource.

You can create templates using the following methods:

- AWS Infrastructure Composer – A visual interface for designing
templates.

- Text Editor – Write templates directly in JSON or
YAML syntax.

- IaC generator – Generate templates from resources
provisioned in your account that are not currently managed by CloudFormation. The IaC generator
works with a wide range of resource types that are supported by the Cloud Control API in your
Region.

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the different sections of a
CloudFormation template and how to start creating stack templates. It covers the following
topics:

## Where templates get stored

###### Amazon S3 bucket

You can store CloudFormation templates in an Amazon S3 bucket. When creating or updating a stack,
you can specify the S3 URL of the template instead of uploading it directly.

If you upload templates directly through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI, an S3 bucket is
automatically created for you. For more information, see [Create a stack from the CloudFormation console](cfn-console-create-stack.md).

###### Git repository

With [Git sync](git-sync.md), you can store templates in a Git
repository. When creating or updating a stack, you can specify the Git repository location
and branch containing the template instead of uploading it directly or referencing an S3
URL. CloudFormation automatically monitors the specified repository and branch for template
changes. For more information, see [Create a stack from repository source code with Git sync](git-sync-create-stack-from-repository-source-code.md).

## Validating templates

###### Syntax validation

You can verify the JSON or YAML syntax of your template by using the [validate-template](service-code-examples.md#validate-template-sdk) CLI command or by
specifying your template on the console. The console performs validation automatically. For
more information, see [Create a stack from the CloudFormation console](cfn-console-create-stack.md).

However, these methods only verify the syntax of your template and don't validate the
property values that you specified for a resource.

###### Additional validation tools

For more complex validations and best practice checks, you can use additional tools
like:

- [CloudFormation Linter\
(cfn-lint)](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint) – Validate templates against the [CloudFormation resource provider schemas](../templatereference/resource-type-schemas.md).
Includes checking valid values for resource properties and best practices.

- [CloudFormation Rain (rain\
fmt)](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/rain) – Format your CloudFormation templates to a consistent standard or
reformat a template from JSON to YAML (or YAML to JSON). It preserves comments when using
YAML and switches the use of intrinsic functions to the short syntax where
possible.

## Getting started with templates

To get started with creating a CloudFormation template, follow these steps:

1. Choose resources – Identify the AWS resources
    you want to include in your stack, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, security groups, and
    more.

2. Write the template – Write the template in JSON
    or YAML format, defining the resources and their properties.

3. Save the template – Save the template locally
    with a file extension like: `.json`, `.yaml`, or
    `.txt`.

4. Validate the template – Validate the template
    using the methods described in the [Validating templates](#template-validation) section.

5. Create a stack – Create a stack using the
    validated template.

### Plan to use the CloudFormation template reference

As you write your templates, you can find documentation for the detailed syntax for
different resource types in the [AWS resource and property types reference](../templatereference/aws-template-resource-type-ref.md).

Often, your stack templates will require intrinsic functions to assign property values
that are not available until runtime and special attributes to control the behavior of
resources. As you write your template, refer to the following resources for guidance:

- [Intrinsic function reference](../templatereference/intrinsic-function-reference.md) – Some commonly used intrinsic functions
include:

- `Ref` – Retrieves the value of a parameter or the physical ID
of a resource.

- `Sub` – Substitutes placeholders in strings with actual
values.

- `GetAtt` – Returns the value of an attribute from a resource
in the template.

- `Join` – Joins a set of values into a single string.

- [Resource attribute reference](../templatereference/aws-product-attribute-reference.md) – Some commonly used special attributes
include:

- `DependsOn` – Use this attribute to specify that one resource
must be created after another.

- `DeletionPolicy` – Use this attribute to specify how
CloudFormation should handle the deletion of a resource.

## Sample templates

CloudFormation provides open-source stack templates that you can use to get started. For more
information, see [CloudFormation Sample\
Templates](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates) on the GitHub website.

Keep in mind that these templates are not meant to be production-ready. You should take
the time to learn how they work, adapt them to your needs, and make sure that they meet your
company's compliance standards.

Each template in this repository passes [CloudFormation Linter](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint)
(cfn-lint) checks, and also a basic set of AWS CloudFormation Guard rules based on the Center for
Internet Security (CIS) Top 20, with exceptions for some rules where it made sense
to keep the sample focused on a single use case.
