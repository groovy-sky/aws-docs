# Deploy Windows-based stacks using CloudFormation

This page provides links to technical reference documentation for CloudFormation resources
commonly used in Windows-based deployments.

CloudFormation provides support for deploying and managing Microsoft Windows
stacks through Infrastructure as Code (IaC). You can use CloudFormation for
automated provisioning of Windows-based EC2 instances, SQL Server on Amazon RDS,
and Microsoft Active Directory through Directory Service.

AWS provides pre-configured Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) specifically designed for
Windows platforms to help you quickly deploy applications on Amazon EC2. These AMIs include
default Microsoft settings and AWS-specific customizations. With CloudFormation, you can
choose an appropriate AMI, launch an instance, and access it using Remote Desktop Connection,
just as you would with any other Windows Server. The AMIs contain essential software
components, including EC2Launch (versions vary by Windows Server edition),
AWS Systems Manager, CloudFormation, AWS Tools for PowerShell, and various network, storage, and graphics drivers to
ensure optimal performance and compatibility with AWS services. For more information, see
the [AWS Windows AMI Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/windows-ami-reference/windows-amis.html).

CloudFormation also supports software configuration tools, such as `UserData`
scripts, which can run PowerShell or batch commands when an EC2 instance first boots up. It
also offers helper scripts ( `cfn-init`, `cfn-signal`,
`cfn-get-metadata`, and `cfn-hup`) and supports the
`AWS::CloudFormation::Init` metadata for managing packages, files, and services
on Windows instances.

For enterprise environments, CloudFormation enables domain joining, Windows license
management through EC2 licensing models, and secure credential handling with AWS Secrets Manager.
Combined with version-controlled templates and repeatable deployments, CloudFormation helps
organizations maintain consistent, secure, and scalable Windows environments across
multiple AWS Regions and accounts.
