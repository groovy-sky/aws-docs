# CloudFormation template Transform section

The optional `Transform` section specifies one or more macros that CloudFormation
uses to process your template in some way.

Macros can perform simple tasks like finding and replacing text, or they can make more
extensive transformations to the entire template. CloudFormation executes macros in the order
that they're specified. When you create a change set, CloudFormation generates a change set that
includes the processed template content. You can then review the changes and execute the
change set. For more information about how macros work, see [Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros](template-macros.md).

CloudFormation also supports _transforms_, which are macros hosted by
CloudFormation. CloudFormation treats these transforms the same as any macros you create in terms of
execution order and scope. For more information, see [Transform reference](../templatereference/transform-reference.md).

To declare multiple macros, use a list format and specify one or more macros.

For example, in the template sample below, CloudFormation evaluates `MyMacro` and
then `AWS::Serverless`, both of which can process the contents of the entire
template because of their inclusion in the `Transform` section.

```yaml

# Start of processable content for MyMacro and AWS::Serverless
Transform:
  - MyMacro
  - 'AWS::Serverless'
Resources:
  WaitCondition:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition
  MyBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: amzn-s3-demo-bucket
      Tags: [{"key":"value"}]
      CorsConfiguration: []
  MyEc2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-1234567890abcdef0
# End of processable content for MyMacro and AWS::Serverless
```
