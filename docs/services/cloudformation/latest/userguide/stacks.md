# Managing AWS resources as a single unit with CloudFormation stacks

A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. In other
words, you can create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and
deleting stacks.

Creating a stack involves deploying a CloudFormation template
that specifies the resources and their configurations, which CloudFormation then provisions and
configures.

Updating a stack involves making changes to the template or
parameters. CloudFormation compares the changes you submit with the current state of your stack and
updates only the changed resources. CloudFormation might interrupt resources or replace updated
resources, depending on which properties you update. For more information about resource update
behaviors, see [Understand update behaviors of stack resources](using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md).

CloudFormation provides two methods for updating stacks:

- Change sets – With change sets, you can preview
the changes CloudFormation will make to your stack, and then decide whether to apply those
changes. Change sets are JSON-formatted documents that summarize the changes CloudFormation will
make to a stack. Use change sets when you want to make sure that CloudFormation doesn't make
unintentional changes or when you want to consider several options. For example, you can use
a change set to verify that CloudFormation won't replace your stack's database instances during
an update.

- Direct update – When you directly update a stack,
you submit changes and CloudFormation immediately deploys them. Use direct updates when you want
to quickly deploy your updates.

Deleting a stack deletes the resources associated with it. A
stack, for instance, can include all the resources required to run a web application, such as a
web server, a database, and networking rules. If you no longer require that web application, you
can simply delete the stack, and all of its related resources are deleted.

###### Note

You are charged for the stack resources for the time they were operating (even if you
deleted the stack right away).

CloudFormation ensures all stack resources are created or deleted as appropriate. Because
CloudFormation treats the stack resources as a single unit, they must all be created or deleted
successfully for the stack to be created or deleted. If a resource can't be created, CloudFormation
rolls the stack back and automatically deletes any resources that were created. If a resource
can't be deleted, any remaining resources are retained until the stack can be successfully
deleted.

## Interfaces for managing your stacks

You can manage your CloudFormation stacks using the following interfaces:

- CloudFormation console – Provides a web interface
that you can use to access your stacks. You can access the CloudFormation console by signing
into the AWS Management Console, using the search box on the navigation bar to search for
**CloudFormation**, and then choosing **CloudFormation** from
the search results.

- AWS Command Line Interface – Provides commands for a broad set of
AWS services, including CloudFormation, and is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux. For
information about the CloudFormation commands, see [cloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

- AWS Tools for PowerShell – A set of PowerShell modules that
are built on the functionality exposed by the SDK for .NET. The Tools for PowerShell enable you to script
operations on your AWS resources from the PowerShell command line. You can find the
cmdlets for CloudFormation in the [AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/Index.html).

- Query API – Provides low-level API actions that
you call using HTTPS requests. If you make API calls in your application, you must write
the code to handle low-level details, such as generating the hash to sign the request. For
more information about the API actions for CloudFormation, see [Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html) in the
_AWS CloudFormation API Reference_.

- AWS SDKs – Provides language-specific APIs and
takes care of many of the connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling
request retries, and error handling. For more information, see [Tools to Build on\
AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools).

- AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) – The AWS CDK is an
open-source software development framework that allows you to define AWS infrastructure
using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET. With the
CDK, you can model your application resources and then provision them using CloudFormation
directly from your integrated development environment (IDE). For more information, see
[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk).
