# Understand CloudFormation stack creation events

During stack deployment, several events occur to create, configure, and validate the
resources defined in the stack template. Understanding these events can help you optimize your
stack creation process and streamline deployments.

- Resource creation events – When each resource
starts the creation process, a **Status** of
`CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` event is set. This event indicates that the resource is
being provisioned.

- Eventual consistency check – A significant portion
of the stack creation time is spent performing an eventual consistency check against the
resources created by the stack. During this phase, the service performs internal consistency
checks, ensuring the resource is fully operational and meets service stabilization criteria
defined by each AWS service.

- Configuration complete event – When each resource
has finished the eventual consistency check phase of the provisioning, a **Detailed**
**status** of `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` event is set.

- Resource creation complete event – After the
resource has been created and configured as specified, and the configuration matches what is
specified in the template, the **Status** of `CREATE_COMPLETE`
event is set.

You can leverage the `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` event to streamline your stack
creation process in scenarios where resource eventual consistency check is not required, such as
validating a pre-production stack configuration or cross-stack provisioning. You can use this
event in multiple ways. For example, you can use it as a visual signal to skip waiting for the
resource or stack consistency check to finish. Or you could use it to create an automated
mechanism using continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to trigger additional
actions.

###### Important

While leveraging the `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` event accelerates stack creation
times, you should be aware of its trade-offs. First, it's only supported for a subset of
resource type that support drift detection. For a list of resource types that support drift
detection, see [Resource type support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html). This approach may not be suitable for all
scenarios, especially where resources require thorough eventual consistency checks to ensure
full operational readiness across the cloud environment (for example, in production
environments). We recommend carefully assessing your deployment requirements and the
criticality of the consistency checks for each resource. Use the
`CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` event to optimize deployment speeds without compromising
the integrity and reliability of your infrastructure.

Because the `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` event is not guaranteed to be set, any
scenarios that use it should be prepared to handle a `CREATE_COMPLETE` event when
no `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE` event was set.

When the stack deployment starts, both the `AWS::ECR::Repository` and
`AWS::ECS::Cluster` resources start the creation process
( `ResourceStatus` = `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`. When the
`AWS::ECR::Repository` resource type has started the eventual consistency check
( `DetailedStatus` = `CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE`), then the
`AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition` resource can start the creation process. Similarly, once
the `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition` resource begins the eventual consistency check, the
`AWS::ECS::Service` resource start the creation process.
