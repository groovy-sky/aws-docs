# Detect drift on an entire CloudFormation stack

Performing a drift detection operation on a stack determines whether the stack has
drifted from its expected template configuration, and returns detailed information about
the drift status of each resource in the stack that supports drift detection.

###### To detect drift on an entire stack using the AWS Management Console

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. From the list of stacks, select the stack on which you want to perform drift
    detection. In the stack details pane, choose **Stack actions**,
    and then choose **Detect drift**.

![The Detect drift for current stack command selected on the Stack actions menu for the selected stack.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-stacks-actions-detect-drift-1.png)

CloudFormation displays an information bar stating that drift detection has been
    initiated for the selected stack.

3. Wait until CloudFormation completes the drift detection operation. When the drift
    detection operation completes, CloudFormation updates **Drift**
**status** and **Last drift check time** for your
    stack. These fields are listed in the **Overview** section of
    the **Stack info** pane of the stack details page.

The drift detection operation may take several minutes, depending on the
    number of resources included in the stack. You can only run a single drift
    detection operation on a given stack at the same time. CloudFormation continues the
    drift detection operation even after you dismiss the information bar.

4. Review the drift detection results for the stack and its resources. With your
    stack selected, from the **Stack actions** menu select
    **View drift results**.

CloudFormation lists the overall drift status of the stack, in addition to the
    last time drift detection was initiated on the stack or any of its individual
    resources. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources
    have drifted.

In the **Resource drift status** section, CloudFormation lists
    each stack resource, its drift status, and the last time drift detection was
    initiated on the resource. The logical ID and physical ID of each resource is
    displayed to help you identify them. In addition, for resources with a status of
    **MODIFIED**, CloudFormation displays resource drift
    details.

You can sort the resources based on their drift status using the
    **Drift status** column.

1. To view the details on a modified resource.
      1. With the modified resource selected, select **View**
         **drift details**.

         CloudFormation displays the drift detail page for that resource.
          This page lists the resource's expected and current property
          values, and any differences between the two.

         To highlight a difference, in the
          **Differences** section select the property
          name.

- Added properties are highlighted in green in the
**Current** column of the
**Details** section.

- Deleted properties are highlighted in red in the
**Expected** column of the
**Details** section.

- Properties whose value have been changed are
highlighted in yellow in the both
**Expected** and
**Current** columns.

Details include drift status and expected and current property values.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-stacks-drifts-drift-details-differences-1.png)

###### To detect drift on an entire stack using the AWS CLI

###### Important

Review the **Last drift check time** for the stack and confirm that it's earlier than the timestamp shown in the resource drift results to prevent the use of stale data.

To detect drift on an entire stack using the AWS CLI, use the following AWS CLI commands:

- **detect-stack-drift** to initiate a drift detection operation on
a stack.

- **describe-stack-drift-detection-status** to monitor the status
of the stack drift detection operation.

- **describe-stack-resource-drifts** to review the details of the
stack drift detection operation.

1. Use the **detect-stack-drift** to detect drift on an entire stack.
    Specify the stack name or ARN. You can also specify the logical IDs of any
    specific resources that you want to use as filters for this drift detection
    operation.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift --stack-name my-stack-with-resource-drift
```

Output:

```json

{
       "StackDriftDetectionId": "624af370-311a-11e8-b6b7-500cexample"
}
```

2. Because stack drift detection operations can be long-running, use
    **describe-stack-drift-detection-status** to monitor the status of
    drift operation. This command takes the stack drift detection ID returned by the
    **detect-stack-drift** command.

In the example below, we've taken the stack drift detection ID returned by the
    **detect-stack-drift** example above and passed it as a parameter
    to **describe-stack-drift-detection-status**. The parameter returns
    operation details that show that the drift detection operation has completed, a
    single stack resource has drifted, and that the entire stack is considered to
    have drifted as a result.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status --stack-drift-detection-id 624af370-311a-11e8-b6b7-500cexample
```

Output:

```json

{
       "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:099908667365:stack/my-stack-with-resource-drift/489e5570-df85-11e7-a7d9-50example",
       "StackDriftDetectionId": "624af370-311a-11e8-b6b7-500cexample",
       "StackDriftStatus": "DRIFTED",
       "Timestamp": "2018-03-26T17:23:22.279Z",
       "DetectionStatus": "DETECTION_COMPLETE",
       "DriftedStackResourceCount": 1
}
```

3. When the stack drift detection operation is complete, use the
    **describe-stack-resource-drifts** command to review the results,
    including actual and expected property values for resources that have
    drifted.

The example below uses the `--stack-resource-drift-status-filters`
    option to request stack drift information for those resources that have been
    modified or deleted. The request returns information on the one resource that
    has been modified, including details about two of its properties whose values
    have been changed. No resources have been deleted.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource-drifts --stack-name my-stack-with-resource-drift --stack-resource-drift-status-filters MODIFIED DELETED
```

Output:

```json

       "StackResourceDrifts": [

}
