# Enable or disable automatic deployments for StackSets in AWS Organizations
<a name="stacksets-orgs-manage-auto-deployment"></a>

CloudFormation can automatically deploy additional stacks to new AWS Organizations accounts when they're added to your target organization or organizational units (OUs). You can enable automatic deployments and choose whether to delete or retain stacks and their associated resources when accounts are removed from target OUs. These settings can be modified anytime for StackSets that use service-managed permissions.

## How automatic deployments work
<a name="stacksets-orgs-auto-deployment-example"></a>

When automatic deployments are enabled, they're triggered when accounts are added to a target organization or OU, removed from a target organization or OU, or moved between target OUs.

For example, consider `StackSet1` that targets `OU1` in the `us-east-1` Region and `StackSet2` that targets `OU2` in the `us-east-1` Region. `OU1` contains `AccountA`.

If you move `AccountA` from `OU1` to `OU2` with automatic deployments enabled, CloudFormation automatically runs a delete operation to remove the `StackSet1` stack from `AccountA` and queues a create operation that adds the `StackSet2` stack to `AccountA`.

## Considerations
<a name="stacksets-orgs-auto-deployment-considerations"></a>

The following are considerations when using automatic deployments:
+ The automatic deployments feature is enabled at the StackSet level. You can't adjust automatic deployments selectively for OUs, accounts, or Regions.
+ Overridden parameter values only apply to the accounts that are currently in the target OUs and their child OUs. Accounts added to the target OUs and their child OUs in the future will use the StackSet default values and not the overridden values.
+ Automatic deployments do not consider account level targeting filters. If you target specific accounts and enable automatic deployments, your StackSet will continue to deploy to any newly added accounts within the deployed organization. To prevent deployments to newly added accounts, disable automatic deployments.
+ Dependency management: Define up to 10 dependencies per StackSet, with up to 100 dependencies per account. For example, if you have five StackSets with five dependencies each, you have 25 dependencies counting towards the 100 dependency limit. You can request a limit increase through [service quota console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home). Dependencies are removed when StackSets are deleted or Organizations are deactivated.
+ It is recommended to enable managed execution when using auto-deployments. Managed execution will allow auto-deployment operations in multiple target accounts to execute concurrently within a StackSet, increasing processing velocity, especially for larger Organizations.

## Enable or disable automatic deployments (console)
<a name="stacksets-orgs-manage-auto-deployment-console"></a>

**To enable or disable automatic deployments**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region you created the StackSet in.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**.

1. On the **StackSets** page, select the option next to the name of the StackSet to update.

1. Choose **Edit automatic deployment** from the **Actions** menu in the upper right corner.

1. From the dialog box that opens, do the following:

   1. For **Automatic deployment**, choose **Activated** or **Deactivated**.

   1. For **Account removal behavior**, choose **Delete stacks** or **Retain stacks**. Retained resources stay in their current state, but will no longer be part of the StackSet.

   1. For StackSet **dependencies**, add dependent StackSet ARNs, staying within 10 dependencies maximum.

1. Choose **Save**.

## Enable or disable automatic deployments (AWS CLI)
<a name="stacksets-orgs-manage-auto-deployment-cli"></a>

**To enable or disable automatic deployments**

1. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack-set.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack-set.html) command with the `--auto-deployment` option.

   The following command enables automatic deployments.

   ```
   aws cloudformation update-stack-set --stack-set-name {{my-stackset}} \
     --use-previous-template --auto-deployment Enabled=true,RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval={{true}},DependsOn={{ARN1,ARN2}}
   ```

   Alternatively, to disable automatic deployments, specify `Enabled=false` as the value for the `--auto-deployment` option, as in the following example.

   ```
   aws cloudformation update-stack-set --stack-set-name {{my-stackset}} \
     --use-previous-template --auto-deployment Enabled=false
   ```

1. Using the operation ID that was returned as part of the **update-stack-set** output, run [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html) to verify that your StackSet was updated successfully.

   ```
   aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation --operation-id {{operation_ID}}
   ```
