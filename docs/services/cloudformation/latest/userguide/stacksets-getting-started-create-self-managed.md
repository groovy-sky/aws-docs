# Create CloudFormation StackSets with self-managed permissions

This topic describes how to create StackSets with
_self-managed_ permissions to deploy stacks across AWS accounts
and Regions.

###### Note

Before you continue, create the IAM service roles required by StackSets to
establish a trusted relationship between the account you're administering the StackSet
from and the account you're deploying stacks to. For more information, see [Grant self-managed permissions](stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.md).

## Create a StackSet with self-managed permissions (console)

###### To create a StackSet

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

02. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region
     that you want to manage the StackSet from.

03. From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**.

04. From the top of the **StackSets** page, choose
     **Create StackSet**.

05. Under **Permissions**, choose **Self-service**
    **permissions** and choose the IAM roles you created.

06. Under **Prerequisite - Prepare template**, choose
     **Template is ready**.

07. Under **Specify template**, choose to either specify the
     URL for the S3 bucket that contains your stack template or upload a stack
     template file. Then, choose **Next**.

08. On the **Specify StackSet details** page, provide a name
     for the StackSet, specify any parameters, and then choose
     **Next**.

09. Choose **Next** to continue.

10. On the **Configure StackSet options** page, under
     **Tags**, specify any tags to apply to resources in
     your stack. For more information about how tags are used in AWS, see
     [Organizing\
     and tracking costs using AWS cost allocation tags](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.md) in the
     _AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide_.

11. For **Execution configuration**, choose
     **Active** to enable CloudFormation's optimized operation
     handling:

- Non-conflicting operations run concurrently for faster deployment
times.

- Conflicting operations are automatically queued and processed in
the order they were requested.

While operations are running or queued, CloudFormation queues all incoming
operations even if they're non-conflicting. You can't change execution
settings during this time.

12. If your template contains IAM resources, for
     **Capabilities**, choose **I acknowledge that**
    **this template may create IAM resources** to specify that you
     want to use IAM resources in the template. For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

13. Choose **Next**.

14. On the **Set deployment options** page, for **Add**
    **stacks to StackSet**, choose **Deploy new**
    **stacks**.

15. For **Accounts**, choose **Deploy stacks in**
    **accounts**. Paste your target AWS account numbers in the text
     box, separating multiple numbers with commas.

    ###### Note

    You can include your administrator account ID if you want to deploy
    stacks in that account as well.

16. Under **Specify regions**, choose the Regions you want to
     deploy stacks in.

17. For **Deployment options**, do the following:

- For **Maximum concurrent accounts**, specify how
many accounts are processed concurrently.

- For **Failure tolerance**, specify the maximum
number of account failures allowed per Region. The operation will
stop and won't proceed to other Regions once this limit is
reached.

- For **Region concurrency**, choose how to process
Regions: **Sequential** (one Region at a time) or
**Parallel** (multiple Regions
concurrently).

- For **Concurrency mode**, choose how concurrency
behaves during operation execution.

- **Strict failure tolerance** –
Reduces account concurrency level when failures occur,
staying within **Failure tolerance**
+1.

- **Soft failure tolerance** –
Maintains your specified concurrency level (the value of
**Maximum concurrent accounts**)
regardless of failures.

18. Choose **Next**.

19. On the **Review** page, review your choices. To make
     changes, choose **Edit** on the related section.

20. When you are ready to create your StackSet, choose
     **Submit**.

    CloudFormation starts creating your StackSet. View the progress and status of the
     creation of the stacks in your StackSet in the StackSet details page that opens when
     you choose **Submit**.

## Create a StackSet with self-managed permissions (AWS CLI)

Follow the steps in this section to use the AWS CLI to:

- Create the StackSet container.

- Deploy stack instances.

###### To create a StackSet

1. Use the [create-stack-set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-set.html) command to create a new
    StackSet named `my-stackset`. The
    following example uses a template stored in an S3 bucket and includes a
    parameter that sets a `KeyPairName`
    with the value `TestKey`.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
     --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --template-url https://s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/MyApp.template \
     --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=TestKey
```

2. After your **create-stack-set** command is finished, run
    the [list-stack-sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-sets.html) command to see that your
    StackSet has been created. You should see your new StackSet in the results.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation list-stack-sets
```

3. Use the [create-stack-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-instances.html) command to deploy
    stacks within your StackSet. The following example deploys stacks in two
    AWS accounts ( `account_ID_1` and
    `account_ID_2`) across two
    Regions ( `us-west-2` and
    `us-east-1`).

Set concurrent account processing and other deployment preferences using
    the `--operation-preferences` option. This example uses
    count-based settings. Note that `MaxConcurrentCount` must not
    exceed `FailureToleranceCount` \+ 1\. For percentage-based
    settings, use `FailureTolerancePercentage` or
    `MaxConcurrentPercentage` instead.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
     --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --accounts account_ID_1 account_ID_2 \
     --regions us-west-2 us-east-1 \
     --operation-preferences MaxConcurrentCount=1,FailureToleranceCount=0
```

For more information, see [CreateStackInstances](../../../../reference/awscloudformation/latest/apireference/api-createstackinstances.md) in the
    _AWS CloudFormation API Reference_.

4. Use the [describe-stack-set-operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html) command to
    verify that your stacks were created successfully. For the
    `--operation-id` option, specify the operation ID that was
    returned as part of the **create-stack-instances**
    output.

```nohighlight

aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
     --stack-set-name my-stackset \
     --operation-id operation_ID
```
