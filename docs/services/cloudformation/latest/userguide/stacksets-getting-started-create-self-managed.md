# Create CloudFormation StackSets with self-managed permissions
<a name="stacksets-getting-started-create-self-managed"></a>

This topic describes how to create StackSets with *self-managed* permissions to deploy stacks across AWS accounts and Regions.

**Note**
Before you continue, create the IAM service roles required by StackSets to establish a trusted relationship between the account you're administering the StackSet from and the account you're deploying stacks to. For more information, see [Grant self-managed permissions](stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.md).

## Create a StackSet with self-managed permissions (console)
<a name="stacksets-getting-started-create-self-managed-console"></a>

**To create a StackSet**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region that you want to manage the StackSet from.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**.

1. From the top of the **StackSets** page, choose **Create StackSet**.

1. Under **Permissions**, choose **Self-service permissions** and choose the IAM roles you created.

1. Under **Prerequisite - Prepare template**, choose **Template is ready**.

1. Under **Specify template**, choose to either specify the URL for the S3 bucket that contains your stack template or upload a stack template file. Then, choose **Next**.

1. On the **Specify StackSet details** page, provide a name for the StackSet, specify any parameters, and then choose **Next**.

1. Choose **Next** to continue.

1. On the **Configure StackSet options** page, under **Tags**, specify any tags to apply to resources in your stack. For more information about how tags are used in AWS, see [Organizing and tracking costs using AWS cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.

1. For **Execution configuration**, choose **Active** to enable CloudFormation's optimized operation handling:
   + Non-conflicting operations run concurrently for faster deployment times.
   + Conflicting operations are automatically queued and processed in the order they were requested.

   While operations are running or queued, CloudFormation queues all incoming operations even if they're non-conflicting. You can't change execution settings during this time.

1. If your template contains IAM resources, for **Capabilities**, choose **I acknowledge that this template may create IAM resources** to specify that you want to use IAM resources in the template. For more information, see [Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates](control-access-with-iam.md#using-iam-capabilities).

1. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Set deployment options** page, for **Add stacks to StackSet**, choose **Deploy new stacks**.

1. For **Accounts**, choose **Deploy stacks in accounts**. Paste your target AWS account numbers in the text box, separating multiple numbers with commas.
**Note**
You can include your administrator account ID if you want to deploy stacks in that account as well.

1. Under **Specify regions**, choose the Regions you want to deploy stacks in.

1. For **Deployment options**, do the following:
   + For **Maximum concurrent accounts**, specify how many accounts are processed concurrently.
   + For **Failure tolerance**, specify the maximum number of account failures allowed per Region. The operation will stop and won't proceed to other Regions once this limit is reached.
   + For **Region concurrency**, choose how to process Regions: **Sequential** (one Region at a time) or **Parallel** (multiple Regions concurrently).
   + For **Concurrency mode**, choose how concurrency behaves during operation execution.
     + **Strict failure tolerance** – Reduces account concurrency level when failures occur, staying within **Failure tolerance** \+1.
     + **Soft failure tolerance** – Maintains your specified concurrency level (the value of **Maximum concurrent accounts**) regardless of failures.

1. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Review** page, review your choices. To make changes, choose **Edit** on the related section.

1. When you are ready to create your StackSet, choose **Submit**.

   CloudFormation starts creating your StackSet. View the progress and status of the creation of the stacks in your StackSet in the StackSet details page that opens when you choose **Submit**.

## Create a StackSet with self-managed permissions (AWS CLI)
<a name="stacksets-getting-started-self-managed-cli"></a>

Follow the steps in this section to use the AWS CLI to:
+ Create the StackSet container.
+ Deploy stack instances.

**To create a StackSet**

1. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-set.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-set.html) command to create a new StackSet named `{{my-stackset}}`. The following example uses a template stored in an S3 bucket and includes a parameter that sets a `{{KeyPairName}}` with the value `{{TestKey}}`.

   ```
   aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
     --stack-set-name {{my-stackset}} \
     --template-url {{https://s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/MyApp.template}} \
     --parameters {{ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=TestKey}}
   ```

1. After your **create-stack-set** command is finished, run the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-sets.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-stack-sets.html) command to see that your StackSet has been created. You should see your new StackSet in the results.

   ```
   aws cloudformation list-stack-sets
   ```

1. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack-instances.html) command to deploy stacks within your StackSet. The following example deploys stacks in two AWS accounts (`{{account_ID_1}}` and `{{account_ID_2}}`) across two Regions (`{{us-west-2}}` and `{{us-east-1}}`).

   Set concurrent account processing and other deployment preferences using the `--operation-preferences` option. This example uses count-based settings. Note that `MaxConcurrentCount` must not exceed `FailureToleranceCount` \+ 1. For percentage-based settings, use `FailureTolerancePercentage` or `MaxConcurrentPercentage` instead.

   ```
   aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
     --stack-set-name {{my-stackset}} \
     --accounts {{account_ID_1 account_ID_2}} \
     --regions {{us-west-2 us-east-1}} \
     --operation-preferences {{MaxConcurrentCount=1,FailureToleranceCount=0}}
   ```

   For more information, see [CreateStackInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStackInstances.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation API Reference*.

1. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/describe-stack-set-operation.html) command to verify that your stacks were created successfully. For the `--operation-id` option, specify the operation ID that was returned as part of the **create-stack-instances** output.

   ```
   aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
     --stack-set-name {{my-stackset}} \
     --operation-id {{operation_ID}}
   ```
