# AWS::SecurityLake::Subscriber AwsLogSource
<a name="aws-properties-securitylake-subscriber-awslogsource"></a>

Adds a natively supported AWS service as an Amazon Security Lake source. Enables source types for member accounts in required AWS Regions, based on the parameters you specify. You can choose any source type in any Region for either accounts that are part of a trusted organization or standalone accounts. Once you add an AWS service as a source, Security Lake starts collecting logs and events from it.
