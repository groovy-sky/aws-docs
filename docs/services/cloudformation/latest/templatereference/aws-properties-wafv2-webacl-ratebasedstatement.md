# AWS::WAFv2::WebACL RateBasedStatement

A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

###### Note

If you change any of these settings in a rule that's currently in use, the change resets the rule's rate limiting counts. This can pause the rule's rate limiting activities for up to a minute.

You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition.

For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

The rule would create different aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

- If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each individual address is an aggregation instance, and AWS WAF counts requests separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:

- IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

- IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

- If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:

- HTTP method POST: count 2

- HTTP method GET: count 2

- If the aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1

- IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2

- IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys defines a separate aggregation instance, which AWS WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

You cannot nest a `RateBasedStatement` inside another statement, for example inside a `NotStatement` or `OrStatement`. You can define a `RateBasedStatement` inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

For additional information about the options, see [Rate limiting web requests using rate-based rules](../../../waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.md)
in the _AWS WAF Developer Guide_.

If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that AWS WAF
is currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call `GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys`. This option is not available
for other aggregation configurations.

AWS WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by AWS WAF.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "AggregateKeyType" : String,
  "CustomKeys" : [ RateBasedStatementCustomKey, ... ],
  "EvaluationWindowSec" : Integer,
  "ForwardedIPConfig" : ForwardedIPConfiguration,
  "Limit" : Integer,
  "ScopeDownStatement" : Statement
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  AggregateKeyType: String
  CustomKeys:
    - RateBasedStatementCustomKey
  EvaluationWindowSec: Integer
  ForwardedIPConfig:
    ForwardedIPConfiguration
  Limit: Integer
  ScopeDownStatement:
    Statement

```

## Properties

`AggregateKeyType`

Setting that indicates how to aggregate the request counts.

###### Note

Web requests that are missing any of the components specified in the aggregation keys
are omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and handling.

- `CONSTANT` \- Count and limit the requests that match the rate-based rule's scope-down
statement. With this option, the counted requests aren't further aggregated. The scope-down statement
is the only specification used. When the count of all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement
goes over the limit, AWS WAF applies the rule action to all requests that satisfy the scope-down statement.

With this option, you must configure the `ScopeDownStatement` property.

- `CUSTOM_KEYS` \- Aggregate the request counts using one or more web request components as the aggregate keys.

With this option, you must specify the aggregate keys in the `CustomKeys` property.

To aggregate on only the IP address or only the forwarded IP address, don't use custom keys. Instead, set the aggregate
key type to `IP` or `FORWARDED_IP`.

- `FORWARDED_IP` \- Aggregate the request counts on the first IP address in an HTTP header.

With this option, you must specify the header to use in the `ForwardedIPConfig` property.

To aggregate on a combination of the forwarded IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS`.

- `IP` \- Aggregate the request counts on the IP address from the web request
origin.

To aggregate on a combination of the IP address with other aggregate keys, use `CUSTOM_KEYS`.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `CONSTANT | IP | FORWARDED_IP | CUSTOM_KEYS`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`CustomKeys`

Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a rate-base rule.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [RateBasedStatementCustomKey](aws-properties-wafv2-webacl-ratebasedstatementcustomkey.md)

_Maximum_: `5`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`EvaluationWindowSec`

The amount of time, in seconds, that AWS WAF
should include in its request counts, looking back from the current time. For example,
for a setting of 120, when AWS WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the 2 minutes immediately preceding
the current time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

This setting doesn't determine how often AWS WAF checks the rate, but how far back it looks each
time it checks. AWS WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

Default: `300` (5 minutes)

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Allowed values_: `60 | 120 | 300 | 600`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`ForwardedIPConfig`

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address that's reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

###### Note

If the specified header isn't present in the request, AWS WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web request at all.

This is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the rule's aggregate key settings.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [ForwardedIPConfiguration](aws-properties-wafv2-webacl-forwardedipconfiguration.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`Limit`

The limit on requests during the specified evaluation window for a single aggregation instance for the rate-based rule.
If the rate-based statement includes a `ScopeDownStatement`, this limit is applied only to the
requests that match the statement.

Examples:

- If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the limit on requests from any single IP address.

- If you aggregate on the HTTP method and the query argument name "city", then this is the limit on
requests for any single method, city pair.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: Integer

_Minimum_: `10`

_Maximum_: `2000000000`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`ScopeDownStatement`

An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of the web requests that are
evaluated and managed by the rate-based statement. When you use a scope-down statement,
the rate-based rule only tracks and rate limits
requests that match the scope-down statement. You can use any nestable [Statement](../userguide/aws-properties-wafv2-webacl-notstatement.md#cfn-wafv2-webacl-notstatement-statement) in the scope-down statement, and you can nest statements at any
level, the same as you can for a rule statement.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [Statement](aws-properties-wafv2-webacl-statement.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

### Rate limit all requests that match a scope-down statement

The following example listing shows a rate-based rule statement that counts and
rate limits all requests that match a scope-down statement. Rate-based rules that
count all requests together are required to include a scope-down statement. In this
example, the rule counts all requests coming from a specific country, and limits
those requests to 100,000 for any five minute period.

#### YAML

```yaml

Rules:
- Name: rbrCountAll
  Priority: 0
  Statement:
    RateBasedStatement:
      Limit: 100000

    {
      "Name": "rbrCountAll",
      "Priority": 0,
      "Statement": {
        "RateBasedStatement": {
          "Limit": 100000,

              ],
              "ForwardedIPConfig": {
                "HeaderName": "X-Forwarded-For",
                "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "Action": {
        "Block": {}
      },
      "VisibilityConfig": {

        "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true,
        "MetricName": "rbrCountAll"
      }
    }
 ]

```

### Rate limit requests based on an IP address

The following example listing shows a rate-based rule statement that uses the
value in a forwarded IP address to aggregate and rate limit requests. The forwarded
IP address used in this example is the one in the header
`X-Forwarded-For`.

When you rate limit on only the IP address or only a forwarded IP address, you
specify the aggregation in the aggregate key type and you don't use custom
aggregation keys.

#### YAML

```yaml

Rules:
- Name: rbrNoCustomKeys
  Priority: 1
  Statement:
    RateBasedStatement:
      Limit: 1000
      AggregateKeyType: FORWARDED_IP
      ForwardedIPConfig:
        HeaderName: X-Forwarded-For
        FallbackBehavior: MATCH
  Action:
    Block: {}
  VisibilityConfig:
    SampledRequestsEnabled: true
    CloudWatchMetricsEnabled: true
    MetricName: rbrNoCustomKeys

```

#### JSON

```json

 "Rules": [
    {
      "Name": "rbrNoCustomKeys",
      "Priority": 1,
      "Statement": {
        "RateBasedStatement": {
          "Limit": 1000,
          "AggregateKeyType": "FORWARDED_IP",
          "ForwardedIPConfig": {
            "HeaderName": "X-Forwarded-For",
            "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"
          }
        }
      },
      "Action": {
        "Block": {}
      },
      "VisibilityConfig": {
        "SampledRequestsEnabled": true,
        "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true,
        "MetricName": "rbrNoCustomKeys"
      }
    }
 ]

```

### Rate limit requests based on an IP address and a header

The following example listing shows a rate-based rule statement that aggregates
and rate limits requests based on the paired values of a forwarded IP address and a
header. The IP address used is the one in the header `X-Forwarded-For` and
the header value used is in the header `Content-Type`.

To rate limit using a combination of an IP address with one or more other keys,
you provide all key specifications in the custom aggregation key settings. Anytime
you use a forwarded IP address, you specify the header name of the address in the
rate-based statement's `ForwardedIPConfig` setting.

#### YAML

```yaml

Rules:
- Name: rbrCustomKeysA
  Priority: 2
  Statement:
    RateBasedStatement:
      Limit: 2000
      AggregateKeyType: CUSTOM_KEYS
      ForwardedIPConfig:
        HeaderName: X-Forwarded-For
        FallbackBehavior: MATCH
      CustomKeys:
      - Header:
          Name: Content-Type
          TextTransformations:
          - Priority: 0
            Type: NONE
      - ForwardedIP: {}
  Action:
    Block: {}
  VisibilityConfig:
    SampledRequestsEnabled: true
    CloudWatchMetricsEnabled: true
    MetricName: rbrCustomKeysA

```

#### JSON

```json

 "Rules": [
    {
      "Name": "rbrCustomKeysA",
      "Priority": 2,
      "Statement": {
        "RateBasedStatement": {
          "Limit": 2000,
          "AggregateKeyType": "CUSTOM_KEYS",
          "ForwardedIPConfig": {
            "HeaderName": "X-Forwarded-For",
            "FallbackBehavior": "MATCH"
          },
          "CustomKeys": [
            {
              "Header": {
                "Name": "Content-Type",
                "TextTransformations": [
                  {
                    "Priority": 0,
                    "Type": "NONE"
                  }
                ]
              }
            },
            {
              "ForwardedIP": {}
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "Action": {
        "Block": {}
      },
      "VisibilityConfig": {
        "SampledRequestsEnabled": true,
        "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true,
        "MetricName": "rbrCustomKeysA"
      }
    }
 ]

```

### Rate limit requests based on three custom aggregate keys

The following example listing shows a rate-based rule statement that aggregates
and rate limits requests based on the trio of values from the query string, the HTTP
method, and the URI path.

#### YAML

```yaml

Rules:
- Name: rbrCustomKeysB
  Priority: 3
  Statement:
    RateBasedStatement:
      Limit: 3000
      AggregateKeyType: CUSTOM_KEYS
      CustomKeys:
      - QueryString:
          TextTransformations:
          - Priority: 0
            Type: NONE
      - HTTPMethod: {}
      - UriPath:
          TextTransformations:
          - Priority: 0
            Type: NONE
  Action:
    Block: {}
  VisibilityConfig:
    SampledRequestsEnabled: true
    CloudWatchMetricsEnabled: true
    MetricName: rbrCustomKeysB

```

#### JSON

```json

 "Rules": [
    {
      "Name": "rbrCustomKeysB",
      "Priority": 3,
      "Statement": {
        "RateBasedStatement": {
          "Limit": 3000,
          "AggregateKeyType": "CUSTOM_KEYS",
          "CustomKeys": [
            {
              "QueryString": {
                "TextTransformations": [
                  {
                    "Priority": 0,
                    "Type": "NONE"
                  }
                ]
              }
            },
            {
              "HTTPMethod": {}
            },
            {
              "UriPath": {
                "TextTransformations": [

                    "Type": "NONE"
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "Action": {
        "Block": {}
      },
      "VisibilityConfig": {
        "SampledRequestsEnabled": true,
        "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true,
        "MetricName": "rbrCustomKeysB"
      }
    }
 ]

```

### Rate limit requests from individual states in a country

The following example listing combines a geo match statement with a rate based
rule, to limit the number of requests coming from any individual U.S. state.

The geo match statement matches on all requests coming from the U.S. and it has
its rule action set to Count. For all matching requets, the geo match statement adds
a country label and a region label, so after being evaluated by this rule, requests
from the U.S. are labeled by state. For more information, see the
`AWS::WAFv2::WebACL` `GeoMatchStatement` property.

Following the geo match statement, the rate-based rule uses a scope-down statement
to also only match on requests from the U.S.. The rate-based rule aggregates on
values for the geo match region label namespace, so the requests from each state are
counted in their own aggregation instance. The rate-based rule limits each state to
500 requests in any five minute period.

#### YAML

```yaml

Rules:
- Name: labelUSStates
  Priority: 4
  Statement:
    GeoMatchStatement:
      CountryCodes:
      - US
  Action:
