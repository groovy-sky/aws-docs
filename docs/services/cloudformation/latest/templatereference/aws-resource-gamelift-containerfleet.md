+ `NONE` -- Don't collect container logs.
*Required*: No
*Type*: [LogConfiguration](aws-properties-gamelift-containerfleet-logconfiguration.md)

Determines whether Amazon GameLift Servers can shut down game sessions on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Amazon GameLift Servers might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down fleet capacity or when retiring unhealthy instances. You can also set game session protection for individual game sessions using [UpdateGameSession](gamelift/latest/apireference/API_UpdateGameSession.html).
+ **NoProtection** -- Game sessions can be shut down during active gameplay.
+ **FullProtection** -- Game sessions in `ACTIVE` status can't be shut down.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Allowed values*: `FullProtection | NoProtection`
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-containerfleet-perinstancecontainergroupdefinitionname"></a>

`PlayerGatewayMode`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-containerfleet-playergatewaymode"></a>
Configures player gateway for your fleet. Player gateway provides benefits such as DDoS protection by rate limiting and validating traﬃc before it reaches game servers, hiding game server IP addresses from players, and providing updated endpoints when relay endpoints become unhealthy.
**How it works:** When enabled, game clients connect to relay endpoints instead of to your game servers. Player gateway validates player gateway tokens and routes traffic to the appropriate game server. Your game backend calls [GetPlayerConnectionDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetPlayerConnectionDetails.html) to retrieve relay endpoints and player gateway tokens for your game clients. To learn more about this topic, see [DDoS protection with Amazon GameLift Servers player gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftservers/latest/developerguide/ddos-protection-intro.html).
Possible values include:
+ `DISABLED` (default) -- Game clients connect to the game server endpoint. Use this when you do not intend to integrate your game with player gateway.
+ `ENABLED` -- Player gateway is available in fleet locations where it is supported. Your game backend can call [GetPlayerConnectionDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetPlayerConnectionDetails.html) to obtain a player gateway token and endpoints for game clients.
+ `REQUIRED` -- Player gateway is available in fleet locations where it is supported, and the fleet can only use locations that support this feature. Attempting to add a remote location to your fleet which does not support player gateway will result in an `InvalidRequestException`.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Allowed values*: `DISABLED | ENABLED | REQUIRED`
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`ScalingPolicies`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-containerfleet-scalingpolicies"></a>
Rule that controls how a fleet is scaled. Scaling policies are uniquely identified by the combination of name and fleet ID.
*Required*: No
*Type*: Array of [ScalingPolicy](aws-properties-gamelift-containerfleet-scalingpolicy.md)
*Maximum*: `50`
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`Tags`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-containerfleet-tags"></a>
A list of labels to assign to the new fleet resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see [ Tagging AWS Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the *AWS General Reference*.
*Required*: No
*Type*: Array of [Tag](aws-properties-gamelift-containerfleet-tag.md)
*Maximum*: `200`
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)
