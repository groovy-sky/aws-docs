# AWS::GameLiftStreams::StreamGroup
<a name="aws-resource-gameliftstreams-streamgroup"></a>

 Stream groups manage how Amazon GameLift Streams allocates resources and handles concurrent streams, allowing you to effectively manage capacity and costs. Within a stream group, you specify an application to stream, streaming locations and their capacity, and the stream class you want to use when streaming applications to your end-users. A stream class defines the hardware configuration of the compute resources that Amazon GameLift Streams will use when streaming, such as the CPU, GPU, and memory.

Stream capacity represents the number of concurrent streams that can be active at a time. You set stream capacity per location, per stream group. The following capacity settings are available:
+ **Always-on capacity**: This setting, if non-zero, indicates minimum streaming capacity which is allocated to you and is never released back to the service. You pay for this base level of capacity at all times, whether used or idle.
+ **Maximum capacity**: This indicates the maximum capacity that the service can allocate for you. Newly created streams may take a few minutes to start. Capacity is released back to the service when idle. You pay for capacity that is allocated to you until it is released.
+ **Target-idle capacity**: This indicates idle capacity which the service pre-allocates and holds for you in anticipation of future activity. This helps to insulate your users from capacity-allocation delays. You pay for capacity which is held in this intentional idle state.

Values for capacity must be whole number multiples of the tenancy value of the stream group's stream class.

**Note**
Application association is not currently supported in CloudFormation. To link additional applications to a stream group, use the Amazon GameLift Streams console or the AWS CLI.

### Ref
<a name="aws-resource-gameliftstreams-streamgroup-return-values-ref"></a>

When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic `Ref` function, `Ref` returns an [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html) that uniquely identifies the stream group resource across all AWS Regions. For example:

 `arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:123456789012:streamgroup/sg-1AB2C3De4`

For more information about using the `Ref` function, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html).
