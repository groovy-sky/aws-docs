# `AWS::CloudFormation::Init`

Use the `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` type to include metadata on an Amazon EC2
instance for the `cfn-init` helper script. If your template calls the
`cfn-init` script, the script looks for resource metadata rooted in the
`AWS::CloudFormation::Init` metadata key. For more information, see [cfn-init](cfn-init.md).

`cfn-init` supports all metadata types for Linux systems. It supports metadata
types for Windows with conditions that are described in the sections that follow.

## Syntax

The configuration is separated into sections. The following template snippet shows how
you can attach metadata for `cfn-init` to an EC2 instance resource within the
template.

The metadata is organized into config keys, which you can group into configsets. You can
specify a configset when you call `cfn-init` in your template. If you don't
specify a configset, `cfn-init` looks for a single config key named
`config`.

###### Note

The `cfn-init` helper script processes these configuration sections in the
following order: packages, groups, users, sources, files, commands, and then services.
If you require a different order, separate your sections into different config keys, and
then use a configset that specifies the order in which the config keys should be
processed.

###### Note

The following sections contain examples for scripts written in Unix-like shell
scripting languages, such as Bash. To create scripts for PowerShell instead, make
sure you're familiar with the PowerShell language. PowerShell syntax is different
from Unix-like shells, so you'll need to have familiarity with the PowerShell way of
doing things.

## Configsets

If you want to create more than one config key and to have `cfn-init` process
them in a specific order, create a configset that contains the config keys in the desired
order.

### Single configset

The following template snippet creates configsets named `ascending` and
`descending` that each contain two config keys.

#### JSON

```json

"AWS::CloudFormation::Init" : {
    "configSets" : {
        "ascending" : [ "config1" , "config2" ],
        "descending" : [ "config2" , "config1" ]
    },
    "config1" : {
        "commands" : {
            "test" : {
                "command" : "echo \"$CFNTEST\" > test.txt",
                "env" : { "CFNTEST" : "I come from config1." },
                "cwd" : "~"
            }
        }
    },
    "config2" : {
        "commands" : {
            "test" : {
                "command" : "echo \"$CFNTEST\" > test.txt",
                "env" : { "CFNTEST" : "I come from config2" },
                "cwd" : "~"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
  configSets:
    ascending:
      - "config1"
      - "config2"
    descending:
      - "config2"
      - "config1"
  config1:
    commands:
      test:
        command: "echo \"$CFNTEST\" > test.txt"
        env:
          CFNTEST: "I come from config1."
        cwd: "~"
  config2:
    commands:
      test:
        command: "echo \"$CFNTEST\" > test.txt"
        env:
          CFNTEST: "I come from config2"
        cwd: "~"
```

#### Related `cfn-init` calls

The following example calls to `cfn-init` refer to the preceding
example configsets. The example calls are abbreviated for clarity. See [cfn-init](cfn-init.md) for the
complete syntax.

- If a call to `cfn-init` specifies the `ascending`
configset:

```sh

cfn-init -c ascending
```

The script processes `config1` and then processes
`config2` and the `test.txt` file would
contain the text `I come from config2`.

- If a call to `cfn-init` specifies the `descending`
configset:

```sh

cfn-init -c descending
```

The script processes `config2` and then processes
`config1` and the `test.txt` file would
contain the text `I come from config1`.

### Multiple configsets

You can create multiple configsets, and call a series of them using your
`cfn-init` script. Each configset can contain a list of config keys or
references to other configsets. For example, the following template snippet creates
three configsets. The first configset, `test1`, contains one config key named
`1`. The second configset, `test2`, contains a reference to the
`test1` configset and one config key named `2`. The third
configset, default, contains a reference to the configset `test2`.

#### JSON

```json

"AWS::CloudFormation::Init" : {
    "configSets" : {
        "test1" : [ "1" ],
        "test2" : [ { "ConfigSet" : "test1" }, "2" ],
        "default" : [ { "ConfigSet" : "test2" } ]
    },
    "1" : {
        "commands" : {
            "test" : {
                "command" : "echo \"$MAGIC\" > test.txt",
                "env" : { "MAGIC" : "I come from the environment!" },
                "cwd" : "~"
            }
        }
    },
    "2" : {
        "commands" : {
            "test" : {
                "command" : "echo \"$MAGIC\" >> test.txt",
                "env" : { "MAGIC" : "I am test 2!" },
                "cwd" : "~"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

AWS::CloudFormation::Init:
  1:
    commands:
      test:
        command: "echo \"$MAGIC\" > test.txt"
        env:
          MAGIC: "I come from the environment!"
        cwd: "~"
  2:
    commands:
      test:
        command: "echo \"$MAGIC\" >> test.txt"
        env:
          MAGIC: "I am test 2!"
        cwd: "~"
  configSets:
    test1:
      - "1"
    test2:
      - ConfigSet: "test1"
      - "2"
    default:
      - ConfigSet: "test2"
```

#### Related `cfn-init` calls

The following calls to `cfn-init` refer to the `configSets`
declared in the preceding template snippet. The example calls are abbreviated for
clarity. See [cfn-init](cfn-init.md) for the complete syntax.

- If you specify `test1` only:

```sh

cfn-init -c test1
```

`cfn-init` processes config key `1` only.

- If you specify `test2` only:

```sh

cfn-init -c test2
```

`cfn-init` processes config key `1` and then processes
config key `2`.

- If you specify the `default` configset (or no configsets at
all):

```sh

cfn-init -c default
```

You'll get the same behavior that you would if you specify configset
`test2`.

## Commands

You can use the commands key to run commands on the EC2 instance. The commands are
processed in alphabetical order by name.

KeyRequiredDescription

`command`

Required

Either an array or a string specifying the command to run. If you use an
array, you don't need to escape space characters or enclose command
parameters in quotes. Don't use the array to specify multiple
commands.

`env`

Optional

Sets environment variables for the command. This property overwrites,
rather than appends, the existing environment.

`cwd`

Optional

The working directory.

`test`

Optional

A test command that determines whether `cfn-init` runs
commands that are specified in the command key. If the test passes,
`cfn-init` runs the commands. The `cfn-init` script
runs the test in a command interpreter, such as Bash or
`cmd.exe`. Whether a test passes depends on the exit
code that the interpreter returns.

For Linux, the test command must return an exit code of `0`
for the test to pass. For Windows, the test command must return an
%ERRORLEVEL% of `0`.

`ignoreErrors`

Optional

A Boolean value that determines whether `cfn-init` continues
to run if the command contained in the command key fails (returns a non-zero
value). Set to `true` if you want `cfn-init` to
continue running even if the command fails. Set to `false` if you
want `cfn-init` to stop running if the command fails. The default
value is `false`.

`waitAfterCompletion`

Optional

For Windows systems only. Specifies how long to wait (in seconds) after a
command has finished in case the command causes a reboot. The default value
is 60 seconds and a value of "forever" directs `cfn-init` to exit
and resume only after the reboot is complete. Set this value to
`0` if you don't want to wait for every command.

### Example

The following example snippet calls the echo command if the
`~/test.txt` file doesn't exist.

#### JSON

```json

"commands" : {
    "test" : {
        "command" : "echo \"$MAGIC\" > test.txt",
        "env" : { "MAGIC" : "I come from the environment!" },
        "cwd" : "~",
        "test" : "test ! -e ~/test.txt",
        "ignoreErrors" : "false"
    },
    "test2" : {
        "command" : "echo \"$MAGIC2\" > test2.txt",
        "env" : { "MAGIC2" : "I come from the environment!" },
        "cwd" : "~",
        "test" : "test ! -e ~/test2.txt",
        "ignoreErrors" : "false"
    }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

commands:
  test:
    command: "echo \"$MAGIC\" > test.txt"
    env:
      MAGIC: "I come from the environment!"
    cwd: "~"
    test: "test ! -e ~/test.txt"
    ignoreErrors: "false"
  test2:
    command: "echo \"$MAGIC2\" > test2.txt"
    env:
      MAGIC2: "I come from the environment!"
    cwd: "~"
    test: "test ! -e ~/test2.txt"
    ignoreErrors: "false"
```

## Files

You can use the `files` key to create files on the EC2 instance. The content
can be either inline in the template or the content can be pulled from a URL. The files are
written to disk in lexicographic order. The following table lists the supported
keys.

KeyDescription

`content`

Either a string or a properly formatted JSON object. If you use a JSON
object as your content, the JSON will be written to a file on disk. Any
intrinsic functions such as `Fn::GetAtt` or `Ref` are
evaluated before the JSON object is written to disk. When you create a
symlink, specify the symlink target as the content.

###### Note

If you create a symlink, the helper script modifies the permissions of
the target file. Currently, you can't create a symlink without modifying
the permissions of the target file.

`source`

A URL to load the file from. This option can't be specified with the
content key.

`encoding`

The encoding format. Only used if the content is a string. Encoding isn't
applied if you are using a source.

Valid values: `plain` \| `base64`

`group`

The name of the owning group for this file. Not supported for Windows
systems.

`owner`

The name of the owning user for this file. Not supported for Windows
systems.

`mode`

A six-digit octal value representing the mode for this file. Not
supported for Windows systems. Use the first three digits for symlinks and
the last three digits for setting permissions. To create a symlink, specify
`120xxx`, where
`xxx` defines the permissions of the target file. To specify
permissions for a file, use the last three digits, such as
`000644`.

`authentication`

The name of an authentication method to use. This overrides any default
authentication. You can use this property to select an authentication method
you define with the [AWS::CloudFormation::Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-authentication.html) resource.

`context`

Specifies a context for files that are to be processed as [Mustache\
templates](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html). To use this key, you must have installed
`aws-cfn-bootstrap` 1.3 –11 or later in addition to
[pystache](https://github.com/defunkt/pystache).

### Examples

The following example snippet creates a file named `setup.mysql`
as part of a larger installation.

#### JSON

```json

"files" : {
  "/tmp/setup.mysql" : {
    "content" : { "Fn::Join" : ["", [
      "CREATE DATABASE ", { "Ref" : "DBName" }, ";\n",
      "CREATE USER '", { "Ref" : "DBUsername" }, "'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '",
                       { "Ref" : "DBPassword" }, "';\n",
      "GRANT ALL ON ", { "Ref" : "DBName" }, ".* TO '", { "Ref" : "DBUsername" },
                       "'@'localhost';\n",
      "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n"
      ]]},
    "mode"  : "000644",
    "owner" : "root",
    "group" : "root"
  }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

files:
  /tmp/setup.mysql:
    content: !Sub |
      CREATE DATABASE ${DBName};
      CREATE USER '${DBUsername}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${DBPassword}';
      GRANT ALL ON ${DBName}.* TO '${DBUsername}'@'localhost';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    mode: "000644"
    owner: "root"
    group: "root"
```

The full template is available at: [https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-east-1/Drupal\_Single\_Instance.template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-east-1/Drupal_Single_Instance.template).

The following example snippet creates a symlink `/tmp/myfile2.txt`
that points at an existing file `/tmp/myfile1.txt`. The permissions
of the target file `/tmp/myfile1.txt` is defined by the mode value
`644`.

#### JSON

```json

"files" : {
  "/tmp/myfile2.txt" : {
    "content" : "/tmp/myfile1.txt",
    "mode" : "120644"
  }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

files:
  /tmp/myfile2.txt:
    content: "/tmp/myfile1.txt"
    mode: "120644"
```

Mustache templates are used primarily to create configuration files. For example, you
can store a configuration file in an S3 bucket and interpolate Refs and GetAtts from the
template, instead of using `Fn::Join`. The following example snippet outputs
`Content for test9` to `/tmp/test9.txt`.

#### JSON

```json

"files" : {
    "/tmp/test9.txt" : {
        "content" : "Content for {{name}}",
        "context" : { "name" : "test9" }
    }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

files:
  /tmp/test9.txt:
    content: "Content for {{name}}"
    context:
      name: "test9"
```

When working with Mustache templates, note the following:

- The context key must be present for the files to be processed.

- The context key must be a key-value map, but it can be nested.

- You can process files with inline content by using the content key and remote
files by using the source key.

- Mustache support depends on the pystache version. Version 0.5.2 supports the
[Mustache 1.1.2\
specification](https://github.com/mustache/spec/tree/v1.1.2).

## Groups

You can use the groups key to create Linux/UNIX groups and to assign group IDs. The
groups key isn't supported for Windows systems.

To create a group, add a new key-value pair that maps a new group name to an optional
group ID. The groups key can contain one or more group names. The following table lists the
available keys.

KeyDescription

`gid`

A group ID number.

If a group ID is specified, and the group already exists by name, the
group creation will fail. If another group has the specified group ID, the
OS may reject the group creation.

Example: `{ "gid" : "23" }`

### Example snippet

The following snippet specifies a group named `groupOne` without assigning
a group ID and a group named `groupTwo` that specified a group ID value of
`45`.

#### JSON

```json

"groups" : {
    "groupOne" : {},
    "groupTwo" : { "gid" : "45" }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

groups:
  groupOne: {}
  groupTwo:
    gid: "45"
```

## Packages

You can use the packages key to download and install pre-packaged applications and
components. On Windows systems, the packages key supports only the MSI installer.

### Supported package formats

The `cfn-init` script currently supports the following package formats:
apt, msi, python, rpm, rubygems, yum, and Zypper. Packages are processed in the
following order: rpm, yum/apt/zypper, and then rubygems and python. There is no ordering
between rubygems and python, and packages within each package manager aren't guaranteed
to be installed in any order.

### Specifying versions

Within each package manager, each package is specified as a package name and a list
of versions. The version can be a string, a list of versions, or an empty string or
list. An empty string or list indicates that you want the latest version. For rpm
manager, the version is specified as a path to a file on disk or a URL.

If you specify a version of a package, `cfn-init` will attempt to install
that version even if a newer version of the package is already installed on the
instance. Some package managers support multiple versions, but others may not. Verify
the documentation for your package manager for more information. If you don't specify a
version and a version of the package is already installed, the `cfn-init`
script won't install a new version— it will assume that you want to keep and use
the existing version.

### Example snippets

#### RPM, yum, Rubygems, and Zypper

The following snippet specifies a version URL for rpm, requests the latest
versions from yum and Zypper, and version 0.10.2 of chef from rubygems:

##### JSON

```json

"rpm" : {
  "epel" : "http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm"
},
"yum" : {
  "httpd" : [],
  "php" : [],
  "wordpress" : []
},
"rubygems" : {
  "chef" : [ "0.10.2" ]
},
"zypper" : {
  "git" : []
}
```

##### YAML

```yaml

rpm:
  epel: "http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm"
yum:
  httpd: []
  php: []
  wordpress: []
rubygems:
  chef:
    - "0.10.2"
zypper:
  git: []
```

#### MSI package

The following snippet specifies a URL for an MSI package:

##### JSON

```json

"msi" : {
  "awscli" : "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64.msi"
}
```

##### YAML

```yaml

msi:
  awscli: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64.msi"
```

## Services

You can use the services key to define which services should be enabled or disabled when
the instance is launched. Amazon Linux 2 systems and above running
`aws-cfn-bootstrap` version 2.0-29+ support this key by using systemd. Other
Linux systems support this key using sysvinit (by default) or systemd (by adding the
necessary configurations below). Windows systems support this key through Windows Service
Manager.

The services key also allows you to specify dependencies on sources, packages, and files
so that if a restart is needed due to files being installed, `cfn-init` will
take care of the service restart. For example, if you download the Apache HTTP Server
package, the package installation will automatically start the Apache HTTP Server during
the stack creation process. However, if the Apache HTTP Server configuration is updated
later in the stack creation process, the update won't take effect unless the Apache server
is restarted. You can use the services key to ensure that the Apache HTTP service is
restarted.

The following table lists the supported keys.

KeyDescription

`ensureRunning`

Set to true to ensure that the service is running after
`cfn-init` finishes.

Set to false to ensure that the service isn't running after
`cfn-init` finishes.

Omit this key to make no changes to the service state.

`enabled`

Set to true to ensure that the service will be started automatically upon
boot.

Set to false to ensure that the service won't be started automatically
upon boot.

Omit this key to make no changes to this property.

`files`

A list of files. If `cfn-init` changes one directly through
the files block, this service will be restarted.

sources

A list of directories. If `cfn-init` expands an archive into
one of these directories, this service will be restarted.

packages

A map of package manager to list of package names. If
`cfn-init` installs or updates one of these packages, this
service will be restarted.

commands

A list of command names. If `cfn-init` runs the specified
command, this service will be restarted.

### Examples

#### Linux

The following Linux snippet configures the services as follows:

- The nginx service will be restarted if either
`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/var/www/html` are
modified by `cfn-init`.

- The php-fastcgi service will be restarted if `cfn-init` installs
or updates php or spawn-fcgi using yum.

- The sendmail service will be stopped and disabled using systemd.

##### JSON

```json

"services" : {
  "sysvinit" : {
    "nginx" : {
      "enabled" : "true",
      "ensureRunning" : "true",
      "files" : ["/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"],
      "sources" : ["/var/www/html"]
    },
    "php-fastcgi" : {
      "enabled" : "true",
      "ensureRunning" : "true",
      "packages" : { "yum" : ["php", "spawn-fcgi"] }
    }
  },
  "systemd": {
    "sendmail" : {
      "enabled" : "false",
      "ensureRunning" : "false"
    }
  }
}
```

##### YAML

```yaml

services:
  sysvinit:
    nginx:
      enabled: "true"
      ensureRunning: "true"
      files:
        - "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
      sources:
        - "/var/www/html"
    php-fastcgi:
      enabled: "true"
      ensureRunning: "true"
      packages:
        yum:
          - "php"
          - "spawn-fcgi"
  systemd:
    sendmail:
      enabled: "false"
      ensureRunning: "false"
```

To use systemd with a service, the service must have a systemd unit file
configured. The following unit file allows systemd to start and stop the
`cfn-hup` daemon in the multi-user service target:

```conf

[Unit]
Description=cfn-hup daemon
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cfn-hup -v
PIDFile=/var/run/cfn-hup.pid
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This configuration assumes that `cfn-hup` is installed under the
`/usr/bin` directory. However, the actual location where
`cfn-hup` is installed might vary on different platforms. You can
override this configuration by creating an override file in
`/etc/systemd/system/cfn-hup.service.d/override.conf` as
follows:

```conf

# In this example, cfn-hup executable is available under /usr/local/bin
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cfn-hup -v
```

#### Windows

The following Windows snippet starts the `cfn-hup` service, sets it to
automatic, and restarts the service if `cfn-init` modifies the specified
configuration files:

##### JSON

```json

"services" : {
  "windows" : {
    "cfn-hup" : {
      "enabled" : "true",
      "ensureRunning" : "true",
      "files" : ["c:\\cfn\\cfn-hup.conf", "c:\\cfn\\hooks.d\\cfn-auto-reloader.conf"]
    }
  }
}
```

##### YAML

```yaml

services:
  windows:
    cfn-hup:
      enabled: "true"
      ensureRunning: "true"
      files:
        - "c:\\cfn\\cfn-hup.conf"
        - "c:\\cfn\\hooks.d\\cfn-auto-reloader.conf"
```

## Sources

You can use the sources key to download an archive file and unpack it in a target
directory on the EC2 instance. This key is fully supported for both Linux and Windows
systems.

###### Supported formats

Supported formats are:

- `tar`

- `tar+gzip`

- `tar+bz2`

- `zip`

### Examples

#### GitHub

If you use GitHub as a source control system, you can use `cfn-init`
and the sources package mechanism to pull a specific version of your application.
GitHub allows you to create a .zip or a .tar from a specific version through a URL as
follows:

```text

https://github.com/<your directory>/(zipball|tarball)/<version>
```

For example, the following snippet pulls down version `main` as
a `.tar` file.

##### JSON

```json

"sources" : {
  "/etc/puppet" : "https://github.com/user1/cfn-demo/tarball/main"
  }
```

##### YAML

```yaml

sources:
  /etc/puppet: "https://github.com/user1/cfn-demo/tarball/main"
```

#### S3 Bucket

The following example downloads a tarball from an S3 bucket and unpacks it into
`/etc/myapp`:

###### Note

You can use authentication credentials for a source. However, you can't put an
authentication key in the sources block. Instead, include a buckets key in your
`S3AccessCreds` block. For more information on Amazon S3 authentication
credentials, see [AWS::CloudFormation::Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-authentication.html).

For an example, see the [https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-east-1/S3Bucket\_SourceAuth.template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-templates-us-east-1/S3Bucket_SourceAuth.template).

##### JSON

```json

"sources" : {
  "/etc/myapp" : "https://s3.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myapp.tar.gz"
  }
```

##### YAML

```yaml

sources:
  /etc/myapp: "https://s3.amazonaws.com/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/myapp.tar.gz"
```

## Users

You can use the users key to create Linux/UNIX users on the EC2 instance. The
`users` key isn't supported for Windows systems.

The following table lists the supported keys.

KeyDescription

`uid`

A user ID. The creation process fails if the user name exists with a
different user ID. If the user ID is already assigned to an existing user
the operating system may reject the creation request.

`groups`

A list of group names. The user will be added to each group in the
list.

`homeDir`

The user's home directory.

### Example

Users are created as non-interactive system users with a shell of
`/sbin/nologin`. This is by design and can't be modified.

#### JSON

```json

"users" : {
    "myUser" : {
        "groups" : ["groupOne", "groupTwo"],
        "uid" : "50",
        "homeDir" : "/tmp"
    }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

users:
  myUser:
    groups:
      - "groupOne"
      - "groupTwo"
    uid: "50"
    homeDir: "/tmp"
```
