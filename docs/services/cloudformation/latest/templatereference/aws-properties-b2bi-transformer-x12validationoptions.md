# AWS::B2BI::Transformer X12ValidationOptions
<a name="aws-properties-b2bi-transformer-x12validationoptions"></a>

Contains configuration options for X12 EDI validation. This structure allows you to specify custom validation rules that will be applied during EDI document processing, including element length constraints, code list modifications, and element requirement changes. These validation options provide flexibility to accommodate trading partner-specific requirements while maintaining EDI compliance. The validation rules are applied in addition to standard X12 validation to ensure documents meet both standard and custom requirements.
