# AWS::EFS::AccessPoint RootDirectory

Specifies the directory on the Amazon EFS file system that the access point
provides access to. The access point exposes the specified file system path as the root
directory of your file system to applications using the access point. NFS clients using the
access point can only access data in the access point's `RootDirectory` and its
subdirectories.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "CreationInfo" : CreationInfo,
  "Path" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  CreationInfo:
    CreationInfo
  Path: String

```

## Properties

`CreationInfo`

(Optional) Specifies the POSIX IDs and permissions to apply to the access point's
`RootDirectory`. If the `RootDirectory` \> `Path`
specified does not exist, EFS creates the root directory using the
`CreationInfo` settings when a client connects to an access point. When
specifying the `CreationInfo`, you must provide values for all properties.

###### Important

If you do not provide `CreationInfo` and the specified `RootDirectory` \> `Path` does not exist,
attempts to mount the file system using the access point will fail.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [CreationInfo](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-efs-accesspoint-creationinfo.html)

`Path`

Specifies the path on the EFS file system to expose as the root directory to
NFS clients using the access point to access the EFS file system. A path can have
up to four subdirectories. If the specified path does not exist, you are required to provide
the `CreationInfo`.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Minimum_: `1`

_Maximum_: `100`
