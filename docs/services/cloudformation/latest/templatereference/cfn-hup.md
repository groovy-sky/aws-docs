# cfn-hup

The `cfn-hup` helper is a daemon that detects changes in resource metadata
and runs user-specified actions when a change is detected. This allows you to make
configuration updates on your running Amazon EC2 instances through the `UpdateStack`
API action.

For more information, see the [Updating a CloudFormation stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/updating.stacks.walkthrough.html) tutorial in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Syntax

```sh

cfn-hup --config|-c config.dir \
        --no-daemon \
        --verbose|-v
```

## Options

NameDescriptionRequired

`--config|-c config.dir`

Specifies the path that the `cfn-hup` script looks for the
`cfn-hup.conf` and the `hooks.d`
directories. On Windows, the default path is
`system_drive\cfn`. On Linux,
the default path is `/etc/cfn`.

No

`--no-daemon`

Specify this option to run the `cfn-hup` script once and
exit.

No

`-v, --verbose `

Specify this option to use verbose mode.

No

## cfn-hup.conf configuration file

The `cfn-hup.conf` file stores the name of the stack and the AWS
credentials that the `cfn-hup` daemon targets.

The `cfn-hup.conf` file uses the following format:

```conf

[main]
stack=<stack-name-or-id>
```

NameDescriptionRequired

`stack`

A stack name or ID.

_Type_: String

Yes

`credential-file`

An owner-only credential file, in the same format used for the command
line tools.

_Type_: String

_Condition_: The `role` parameter
supersedes this parameter.

No

`role`

The name of an IAM role that's associated with the instance.

_Type_: String

No

`region`

The name of the AWS Region containing the stack.

_Example_: us-east-2

No

`umask`

The `umask` used by the `cfn-hup` daemon.

This value can be specified with or without a leading 0. In both
cases, it's interpreted as an octal number (similar to the Linux
`umask` command). This parameter has no effect on
Windows.

_Type_: Octal integer between `0` and
`0777`

_Default_: `022`, version 1.4–22
and higher. The default value of `022` masks group and world
write permissions, so files created by the `cfn-hup` daemon
aren't group or world writable by default. The default value for versions
1.4 –21 and earlier is `0`, which masks nothing.

No

`interval`

The interval used to check for changes to the resource metadata in
minutes.

_Type_: Integer

_Default_: `15`

No

`verbose`

Specifies whether to use verbose logging.

_Type_: Boolean

_Default_: `false`

No

## `hooks.conf` configuration file

The user actions that the `cfn-hup` daemon calls periodically are defined
in the `hooks.conf` configuration file. The
`hooks.conf` file uses the following
_format_:

```conf

[hookname]
triggers=post.add or post.update or post.remove
path=Resources.<logicalResourceId> (.Metadata or .PhysicalResourceId)(.<optionalMetadatapath>)
action=<arbitrary shell command>
runas=<runas user>
```

When the operation is run, it is run in a copy of the current environment (that
`cfn-hup` is in), with `CFN_OLD_METADATA` set to the previous
metadata value specified by path, and `CFN_NEW_METADATA` set to the current
value.

The hooks configuration file is loaded at `cfn-hup` daemon start up only,
so new hooks will require the daemon to be restarted. A cache of previous metadata
values is stored at `/var/lib/cfn-hup/data/metadata_db`— you can
delete this cache to force `cfn-hup` to run all `post.add` actions
again.

NameDescriptionRequired

`hookname`

A unique name for this hook.

_Type_: String

Yes

`triggers`

A comma-delimited list of conditions to detect.

_Valid values_: `post.add`,
`post.update`, or `post.remove`

_Example_: `post.add,
                           post.update`

Yes

`path`

The path to the metadata object. Supports an arbitrarily deep path
within the Metadata block.

###### Path format options

- Resources. `<LogicalResourceId>`—
monitor the last updated time of the resource, triggering on any
change to the resource.

- Resources. `<LogicalResourceId>`.PhysicalResourceId—
monitor the physical ID of the resource, triggering only when the
associated resource identity changes (such as a new EC2
instance).

- Resources. `<LogicalResourceId>`.Metadata( `.optional
                                      path`)— monitor the metadata of a resource
for changes (a metadata subpath may be specified to an arbitrarily
deep level to monitor specific values).

Yes

`action`

An arbitrary shell command that is run as given.

Yes

`runas`

A user to run the commands as. `cfn-hup` uses the su
command to switch to the user.

Yes

## `hooks.d` directory

To support composition of several applications deploying change notification hooks,
`cfn-hup` supports a directory named `hooks.d` that is
located in the hooks configuration directory. You can place one or more additional hooks
configuration files in the `hooks.d` directory. The additional hooks
files must use the same layout as the `hooks.conf` file.

The `cfn-hup` daemon parses and loads each file in this directory. If any
hooks in the `hooks.d` directory have the same name as a hook in
`hooks.conf`, the hooks will be merged (meaning
`hooks.d` will overwrite `hooks.conf` for any
values that both files specify).

## Examples

In the following examples, CloudFormation triggers the
`cfn-auto-reloader.conf` hooks file when you change the
`AWS::CloudFormation::Init` resource that is associated with the
`LaunchConfig` resource.
