# AWS::EKS::Cluster KubernetesNetworkConfig

The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "ElasticLoadBalancing" : ElasticLoadBalancing,
  "IpFamily" : String,
  "ServiceIpv4Cidr" : String,
  "ServiceIpv6Cidr" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  ElasticLoadBalancing:
    ElasticLoadBalancing
  IpFamily: String
  ServiceIpv4Cidr: String
  ServiceIpv6Cidr: String

```

## Properties

`ElasticLoadBalancing`

Request to enable or disable the load balancing capability on your EKS Auto Mode
cluster. For more information, see EKS Auto Mode load balancing capability in the
_Amazon EKS User Guide_.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [ElasticLoadBalancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-eks-cluster-elasticloadbalancing.html)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`IpFamily`

Specify which IP family is used to assign Kubernetes pod and service IP addresses. If you
don't specify a value, `ipv4` is used by default. You can only specify an IP
family when you create a cluster and can't change this value once the cluster is
created. If you specify `ipv6`, the VPC and subnets that you specify for
cluster creation must have both `IPv4` and `IPv6` CIDR blocks
assigned to them. You can't specify `ipv6` for clusters in China
Regions.

You can only specify `ipv6` for `1.21` and later clusters that
use version `1.10.1` or later of the Amazon VPC CNI add-on. If you specify
`ipv6`, then ensure that your VPC meets the requirements listed in the
considerations listed in [Assigning IPv6 addresses to pods and\
services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-ipv6.html) in the _Amazon EKS User Guide_. Kubernetes assigns services `IPv6`
addresses from the unique local address range `(fc00::/7)`. You can't specify
a custom `IPv6` CIDR block. Pod addresses are assigned from the subnet's
`IPv6` CIDR.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `ipv4 | ipv6`

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`ServiceIpv4Cidr`

Don't specify a value if you select `ipv6` for **ipFamily**. The CIDR block to assign Kubernetes service IP addresses from. If
you don't specify a block, Kubernetes assigns addresses from either the
`10.100.0.0/16` or `172.20.0.0/16` CIDR blocks. We recommend
that you specify a block that does not overlap with resources in other networks that are
peered or connected to your VPC. The block must meet the following requirements:

- Within one of the following private IP address blocks:
`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, or
`192.168.0.0/16`.

- Doesn't overlap with any CIDR block assigned to the VPC that you selected for
VPC.

- Between `/24` and `/12`.

###### Important

You can only specify a custom CIDR block when you create a cluster. You can't
change this value after the cluster is created.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`ServiceIpv6Cidr`

The CIDR block that Kubernetes pod and service IP addresses are assigned from if you
created a 1.21 or later cluster with version 1.10.1 or later of the Amazon VPC CNI add-on and
specified `ipv6` for **ipFamily** when you
created the cluster. Kubernetes assigns service addresses from the unique local address range
( `fc00::/7`) because you can't specify a custom IPv6 CIDR block when you
create the cluster.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
