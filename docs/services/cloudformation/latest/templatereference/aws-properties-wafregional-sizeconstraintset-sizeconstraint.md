# AWS::WAFRegional::SizeConstraintSet SizeConstraint

###### Note

AWS WAF Classic support will end on September 30, 2025.

This is **AWS WAF Classic** documentation. For
more information, see [AWS WAF Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html) in the developer guide.

**For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html). With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

Specifies a constraint on the size of a part of the web request. AWS WAF uses the `Size`, `ComparisonOperator`, and `FieldToMatch` to build
an expression in the form of " `Size` `ComparisonOperator` size in bytes of `FieldToMatch`". If that expression is true, the
`SizeConstraint` is considered to match.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "ComparisonOperator" : String,
  "FieldToMatch" : FieldToMatch,
  "Size" : Integer,
  "TextTransformation" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  ComparisonOperator: String
  FieldToMatch:
    FieldToMatch
  Size: Integer
  TextTransformation: String

```

## Properties

`ComparisonOperator`

The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to perform. AWS WAF uses this in combination with the provided `Size` and `FieldToMatch`
to build an expression in the form of " `Size` `ComparisonOperator` size in bytes of `FieldToMatch`". If that expression
is true, the `SizeConstraint` is considered to match.

**EQ**: Used to test if the `Size` is equal to the size of the `FieldToMatch`

**NE**: Used to test if the `Size` is not equal to the size of the `FieldToMatch`

**LE**: Used to test if the `Size` is less than or equal to the size of the `FieldToMatch`

**LT**: Used to test if the `Size` is strictly less than the size of the `FieldToMatch`

**GE**: Used to test if the `Size` is greater than or equal to the size of the `FieldToMatch`

**GT**: Used to test if the `Size` is strictly greater than the size of the `FieldToMatch`

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`FieldToMatch`

The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as a specific header or a query string.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: [FieldToMatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-wafregional-sizeconstraintset-fieldtomatch.html)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`Size`

The size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified `FieldToMatch`. AWS WAF uses this in combination
with `ComparisonOperator` and `FieldToMatch` to build an expression in the form of " `Size` `ComparisonOperator` size
in bytes of `FieldToMatch`". If that expression is true, the `SizeConstraint` is considered to match.

Valid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).

If you specify `URI` for the value of `Type`, the / in the URI path that you specify counts as one character.
For example, the URI `/logo.jpg` is nine characters long.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`TextTransformation`

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF.
If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on `FieldToMatch` before inspecting a request for a match.

You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

Note that if you choose `BODY` for the value of `Type`, you must choose `NONE` for `TextTransformation`
because the API Gateway API or Application Load Balancer forward only the first 8192 bytes for inspection.

**NONE**

Specify `NONE` if you don't want to perform any text transformations.

**CMD\_LINE**

When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:

- Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

- Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

- Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

- Replace multiple spaces with one space

- Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)

**COMPRESS\_WHITE\_SPACE**

Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):

- \\f, formfeed, decimal 12

- \\t, tab, decimal 9

- \\n, newline, decimal 10

- \\r, carriage return, decimal 13

- \\v, vertical tab, decimal 11

- non-breaking space, decimal 160

`COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE` also replaces multiple spaces with one space.

**HTML\_ENTITY\_DECODE**

Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. `HTML_ENTITY_DECODE` performs
the following operations:

- Replaces `(ampersand)quot;` with `"`

- Replaces `(ampersand)nbsp;` with a non-breaking space, decimal 160

- Replaces `(ampersand)lt;` with a "less than" symbol

- Replaces `(ampersand)gt;` with `>`

- Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, `(ampersand)#xhhhh;`, with the corresponding
characters

- Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, `(ampersand)#nnnn;`, with the corresponding
characters

**LOWERCASE**

Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

**URL\_DECODE**

Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `NONE | COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE | HTML_ENTITY_DECODE | LOWERCASE | CMD_LINE | URL_DECODE`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
