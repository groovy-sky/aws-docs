`MetricName`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-scalingpolicy-metricname"></a>
Name of the Amazon GameLift Servers-defined metric that is used to trigger a scaling adjustment. For detailed descriptions of fleet metrics, see [Monitor Amazon GameLift Servers with Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html).
+ **ActivatingGameSessions** -- Game sessions in the process of being created.
+ **ActiveGameSessions** -- Game sessions that are currently running.
+ **ActiveInstances** -- Fleet instances that are currently running at least one game session.
+ **AvailableGameSessions** -- Additional game sessions that fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity.
+ **AvailablePlayerSessions** -- Empty player slots in currently active game sessions. This includes game sessions that are not currently accepting players. Reserved player slots are not included.
+ **CurrentPlayerSessions** -- Player slots in active game sessions that are being used by a player or are reserved for a player.
+ **IdleInstances** -- Active instances that are currently hosting zero game sessions.
+ **PercentAvailableGameSessions** -- Unused percentage of the total number of game sessions that a fleet could host simultaneously, given current capacity. Use this metric for a target-based scaling policy.
+ **PercentIdleInstances** -- Percentage of the total number of active instances that are hosting zero game sessions.
+ **QueueDepth** -- Pending game session placement requests, in any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority destination.
+ **WaitTime** -- Current wait time for pending game session placement requests, in any queue, where the current fleet is the top-priority destination.
*Required*: Yes

Metric value used to trigger a scaling event.
*Required*: No
