# AWS::SES::ReceiptRule S3Action

When included in a receipt rule, this action saves the received message to an Amazon
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and, optionally, publishes a notification to
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

To enable Amazon SES to write emails to your Amazon S3 bucket, use an AWS KMS key to encrypt your emails, or publish to an Amazon SNS topic of another account,
Amazon SES must have permission to access those resources. For information about
granting permissions, see the [Amazon SES Developer\
Guide](../../../ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-permissions.md).

###### Note

When you save your emails to an Amazon S3 bucket, the maximum email size
(including headers) is 30 MB. Emails larger than that bounces.

For information about specifying Amazon S3 actions in receipt rules, see the [Amazon SES\
Developer Guide](../../../ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-action-s3.md).

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "BucketName" : String,
  "IamRoleArn" : String,
  "KmsKeyArn" : String,
  "ObjectKeyPrefix" : String,
  "TopicArn" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  BucketName: String
  IamRoleArn: String
  KmsKeyArn: String
  ObjectKeyPrefix: String
  TopicArn: String

```

## Properties

`BucketName`

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for incoming email.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`IamRoleArn`

The ARN of the IAM role to be used by Amazon Simple Email Service while writing to the Amazon S3 bucket,
optionally encrypting your mail via the provided customer managed key, and publishing to
the Amazon SNS topic. This role should have access to the following APIs:

- `s3:PutObject`, `kms:Encrypt` and
`kms:GenerateDataKey` for the given Amazon S3 bucket.

- `kms:GenerateDataKey` for the given AWS KMS customer managed key.

- `sns:Publish` for the given Amazon SNS topic.

###### Note

If an IAM role ARN is provided, the role (and only the role) is used to access all
the given resources (Amazon S3 bucket, AWS KMS customer managed key and Amazon SNS topic).
Therefore, setting up individual resource access permissions is not required.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Pattern_: `arn:[\w-]+:iam::[0-9]+:role/[\w-]+`

_Minimum_: `20`

_Maximum_: `2048`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`KmsKeyArn`

The customer managed key that Amazon SES should use to encrypt your emails before saving
them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You can use the AWS managed key or a customer managed key
that you created in AWS KMS as follows:

- To use the AWS managed key, provide an ARN in the form of
`arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses`.
For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the
AWS managed key in the US West (Oregon) Region, the ARN of the AWS managed
key would be `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses`. If
you use the AWS managed key, you don't need to perform any extra steps to give
Amazon SES permission to use the key.

- To use a customer managed key that you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN
of the customer managed key and ensure that you add a statement to your key's
policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving
permissions, see the [Amazon SES Developer\
Guide](../../../ses/latest/dg/receiving-email-permissions.md).

For more information about key policies, see the [AWS KMS Developer Guide](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md). If
you do not specify an AWS KMS key, Amazon SES does not encrypt your emails.

###### Important

Your mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail
is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side
encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the
email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your
AWS KMS keys for decryption. This encryption client is currently available with
the [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java) and
[AWS SDK for Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby) only. For
more information about client-side encryption using AWS KMS managed keys, see the
[Amazon S3 Developer Guide](../../../s3/latest/dev/usingclientsideencryption.md).

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`ObjectKeyPrefix`

The key prefix of the Amazon S3 bucket. The key prefix is similar to a directory name that
enables you to store similar data under the same directory in a bucket.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`TopicArn`

The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the message is saved to the Amazon S3 bucket. You
can find the ARN of a topic by using the [ListTopics](../../../sns/latest/api/api-listtopics.md) operation in
Amazon SNS.

For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the [Amazon SNS Developer Guide](../../../sns/latest/dg/createtopic.md).

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
