# AWS::Backup::RestoreTestingPlan RestoreTestingRecoveryPointSelection
<a name="aws-properties-backup-restoretestingplan-restoretestingrecoverypointselection"></a>

`RecoveryPointSelection` has five parameters (three required and two optional). The values you specify determine which recovery point is included in the restore test. You must indicate with `Algorithm` if you want the latest recovery point within your `SelectionWindowDays` or if you want a random recovery point, and you must indicate through `IncludeVaults` from which vaults the recovery points can be chosen.

`Algorithm` (*required*) Valid values: "`LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW`" or "`RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW`".

`Recovery point types` (*required*) Valid values: "`SNAPSHOT`" and/or "`CONTINUOUS`". Include `SNAPSHOT` to restore only snapshot recovery points; include `CONTINUOUS` to restore continuous recovery points (point in time restore / PITR); use both to restore either a snapshot or a continuous recovery point. The recovery point will be determined by the value for `Algorithm`.

`IncludeVaults` (*required*). You must include one or more backup vaults. Use the wildcard ["\*"] or specific ARNs.

`SelectionWindowDays` (*optional*) Value must be an integer (in days) from 1 to 365. If not included, the value defaults to `30`.

`ExcludeVaults` (*optional*). You can choose to input one or more specific backup vault ARNs to exclude those vaults' contents from restore eligibility. Or, you can include a list of selectors. If this parameter and its value are not included, it defaults to empty list.
