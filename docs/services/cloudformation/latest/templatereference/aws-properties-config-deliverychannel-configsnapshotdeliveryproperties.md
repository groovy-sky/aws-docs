# AWS::Config::DeliveryChannel ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties

Provides options for how often AWS Config delivers
configuration snapshots to the Amazon S3 bucket in your delivery
channel.

###### Note

If you want to create a rule that triggers evaluations for
your resources when AWS Config delivers the configuration
snapshot, see the following:

The frequency for a rule that triggers evaluations for your
resources when AWS Config delivers the configuration snapshot is set
by one of two values, depending on which is less frequent:

- The value for the `deliveryFrequency`
parameter within the delivery channel configuration, which
sets how often AWS Config delivers configuration snapshots.
This value also sets how often AWS Config invokes
evaluations for AWS Config rules.

- The value for the
`MaximumExecutionFrequency` parameter, which
sets the maximum frequency with which AWS Config invokes
evaluations for the rule. For more information, see [ConfigRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ConfigRule.html).

If the `deliveryFrequency` value is less frequent
than the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value for a rule,
AWS Config invokes the rule only as often as the
`deliveryFrequency` value.

1. For example, you want your rule to run evaluations when
    AWS Config delivers the configuration snapshot.

2. You specify the `MaximumExecutionFrequency`
    value for `Six_Hours`.

3. You then specify the delivery channel
    `deliveryFrequency` value for
    `TwentyFour_Hours`.

4. Because the value for `deliveryFrequency` is
    less frequent than `MaximumExecutionFrequency`,
    AWS Config invokes evaluations for the rule every 24 hours.

You should set the `MaximumExecutionFrequency` value
to be at least as frequent as the `deliveryFrequency`
value. You can view the `deliveryFrequency` value by
using the `DescribeDeliveryChannnels` action.

To update the `deliveryFrequency` with which AWS Config delivers your configuration snapshots, use the `PutDeliveryChannel` action.
