# AWS::Batch::JobDefinition RuntimePlatform
<a name="aws-properties-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform"></a>

 An object that represents the compute environment architecture for AWS Batch jobs on Fargate.

## Syntax
<a name="aws-properties-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-syntax"></a>

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON
<a name="aws-properties-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-syntax.json"></a>

```
{
  "[CpuArchitecture](#cfn-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-cpuarchitecture)" : {{String}},
  "[OperatingSystemFamily](#cfn-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-operatingsystemfamily)" : {{String}}
}
```

### YAML
<a name="aws-properties-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-syntax.yaml"></a>

```
  [CpuArchitecture](#cfn-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-cpuarchitecture): {{String}}
  [OperatingSystemFamily](#cfn-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-operatingsystemfamily): {{String}}
```

## Properties
<a name="aws-properties-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-properties"></a>

`CpuArchitecture`  <a name="cfn-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-cpuarchitecture"></a>
The vCPU architecture. The default value is `X86_64`. Valid values are `X86_64` and `ARM64`.
This parameter must be set to `X86_64` for Windows containers.
Fargate Spot is not supported on Windows-based containers on Fargate. A job queue will be blocked if a Windows job is submitted to a job queue with only Fargate Spot compute environments. However, you can attach both `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` compute environments to the same job queue.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`OperatingSystemFamily`  <a name="cfn-batch-jobdefinition-runtimeplatform-operatingsystemfamily"></a>
The operating system for the compute environment. Valid values are: `LINUX` (default), `WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_CORE`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_FULL`, `WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_CORE`, and `WINDOWS_SERVER_2022_FULL`.
The following parameters can’t be set for Windows containers: `linuxParameters`, `privileged`, `user`, `ulimits`, `readonlyRootFilesystem`, and `efsVolumeConfiguration`.
The AWS Batch Scheduler checks the compute environments that are attached to the job queue before registering a task definition with Fargate. In this scenario, the job queue is where the job is submitted. If the job requires a Windows container and the first compute environment is `LINUX`, the compute environment is skipped and the next compute environment is checked until a Windows-based compute environment is found.
Fargate Spot is not supported on Windows-based containers on Fargate. A job queue will be blocked if a Windows job is submitted to a job queue with only Fargate Spot compute environments. However, you can attach both `FARGATE` and `FARGATE_SPOT` compute environments to the same job queue.
