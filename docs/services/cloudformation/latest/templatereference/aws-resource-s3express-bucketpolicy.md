# AWS::S3Express::BucketPolicy

The `AWS::S3Express::BucketPolicy` resource defines an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Amazon S3 directory bucket.

Permissions

If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must both have
the required permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's
account in order to use this operation. For more information about directory
bucket policies and permissions, see [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One\
Zone](../../../s3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Important

To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of
their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's AWS account can perform the `GetBucketPolicy`,
`PutBucketPolicy`, and `DeleteBucketPolicy` API
actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal's
access. Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing these
API actions by VPC endpoint policies and AWS Organizations
policies.

The required permissions for CloudFormation to use are based on the operations
that are performed on the stack.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "Type" : "AWS::S3Express::BucketPolicy",
  "Properties" : {
      "Bucket" : String,
      "PolicyDocument" : Json
    }
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

Type: AWS::S3Express::BucketPolicy
Properties:
  Bucket: String
  PolicyDocument: Json

```

## Properties

`Bucket`

The name of the S3 directory bucket to which the policy applies.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`PolicyDocument`

A policy document containing permissions to add to the specified bucket. In IAM, you
must provide policy documents in JSON format. However, in CloudFormation you can provide
the policy in JSON or YAML format because CloudFormation converts YAML to JSON before
submitting it to IAM. For more information, see the AWS::IAM::Policy [PolicyDocument](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html#cfn-iam-policy-policydocument) resource description in this guide and [Policies and Permissions in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-policy-language-overview.html) in the _Amazon S3 User_
_Guide_.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: Json

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
