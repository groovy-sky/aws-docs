# AWS::ECS::Service

The `AWS::ECS::Service` resource creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service
(Amazon ECS) service that runs and maintains the requested number of tasks and associated
load balancers.

###### Important

The stack update fails if you change any properties that require replacement and at
least one Amazon ECS Service Connect `ServiceConnectConfiguration`
property is configured. This is because AWS CloudFormation creates
the replacement service first, but each `ServiceConnectService` must have a
name that is unique in the namespace.

###### Note

Starting April 15, 2023, AWS; will not onboard new customers to Amazon
Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current customers migrate their workloads to
options that offer better price and performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers
will not be able to launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker,
Amazon ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI
at least once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and will be
able to continue using the service.

###### Important

On June 12, 2025, Amazon ECS launched support for updating capacity provider
configuration for Amazon ECS services. With this launch, Amazon ECS
also aligned the CloudFormation update behavior for
`CapacityProviderStrategy` parameter with the standard practice. For
more information, see [Amazon ECS adds support for updating capacity provider\
configuration for ECS services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/05/amazon-ecs-capacity-provider-configuration-ecs). Previously Amazon ECS ignored the
`CapacityProviderStrategy` property if it was set to an empty list
for example, `[]` in CloudFormation, because updating capacity
provider configuration was not supported. Now, with support for capacity provider
updates, customers can remove capacity providers from a service by passing an empty
list. When you specify an empty list ( `[]`) for the
`CapacityProviderStrategy` property in your CloudFormation
template, Amazon ECS will remove any capacity providers associated with the
service, as follows:

- For services created with a capacity provider strategy after the launch:

- If there's a cluster default strategy set, the service will revert
to using that default strategy.

- If no cluster default strategy exists, you will receive the
following error:

No launch type to fall back to for empty capacity provider
strategy. Your service was not created with a launch type.

- For services created with a capacity provider strategy prior to the launch:

- If `CapacityProviderStrategy` had
`FARGATE_SPOT` or `FARGATE` capacity
providers, the launch type will be updated to `FARGATE`
and the capacity provider will be removed.

- If the strategy included Auto Scaling group capacity providers,
the service will revert to EC2 launch type, and the Auto Scaling
group capacity providers will not be used.

Recommended Actions

If you are currently using `CapacityProviderStrategy: []` in your CloudFormation templates, you should take one of the following actions:

- If you do not intend to update the Capacity Provider Strategy:

- Remove the `CapacityProviderStrategy` property entirely from your CloudFormation template

- Alternatively, use `!Ref AWS::NoValue` for the `CapacityProviderStrategy` property in your template

- If you intend to maintain or update the Capacity Provider Strategy,
specify the actual Capacity Provider Strategy for the service in your
CloudFormation template.

If your CloudFormation template had an empty list (\[\]) for
`CapacityProviderStrategy` prior to the aforementioned launch on June
12, and you are using the same template with `CapacityProviderStrategy:
                    []`, you might encounter the following error:

Invalid request provided: When switching from launch type to capacity
provider strategy on an existing service, or making a change to a capacity
provider strategy on a service that is already using one, you must force a new
deployment. (Service: Ecs, Status Code: 400, Request ID: xxx) (SDK Attempt
Count: 1)" (RequestToken: xxx HandlerErrorCode: InvalidRequest)

Note that CloudFormation automatically initiates a new deployment when it detects a parameter change, but customers cannot choose to force a deployment through CloudFormation. This is an invalid input scenario that requires one of the remediation actions listed above.

If you are experiencing active production issues related to this change, contact AWS Support or your Technical Account Manager.

## Properties

`AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`

Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service.

For more information, see [Balancing an Amazon\
ECS service across Availability Zones](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-rebalancing.md) in the _Amazon_
_Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

The default behavior of `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` differs between
create and update requests:

- For create service requests, when no value is specified for
`AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults the value to
`ENABLED`.

- For update service requests, when no value is specified for
`AvailabilityZoneRebalancing`, Amazon ECS defaults to the
existing service’s `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value. If the
service never had an `AvailabilityZoneRebalancing` value set, Amazon
ECS treats this as `DISABLED`.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `ENABLED | DISABLED`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`CapacityProviderStrategy`

The capacity provider strategy to use for the service.

If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType`
parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or
`launchType` is specified, the
`defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used.

A capacity provider strategy can contain a maximum of 20 capacity providers.

###### Important

To remove this property from your service resource, specify an empty `CapacityProviderStrategyItem` array.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [CapacityProviderStrategyItem](aws-properties-ecs-service-capacityproviderstrategyitem.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

service on. If you do not specify a cluster, the default cluster is assumed.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`DeploymentConfiguration`

Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment
and the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`DesiredCount`

The number of instantiations of the specified task definition to place and keep running
in your service.

For new services, if a desired count is not specified, a default value of `1`
is used. When using the `DAEMON` scheduling strategy, the desired count is not
required.

For existing services, if a desired count is not specified, it is omitted from the
operation.

_Required_: Conditional

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`EnableECSManagedTags`

Specifies whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks within the service.
For more information, see [Tagging your Amazon ECS\
resources](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-using-tags.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

When you use Amazon ECS managed tags, you must set the `propagateTags`
request parameter.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Boolean

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`EnableExecuteCommand`

`true`, the execute command functionality is turned on for all containers
in tasks as part of the service.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Boolean

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`ForceNewDeployment`

Determines whether to force a new deployment of the service. By default, deployments
aren't forced. You can use this option to start a new deployment with no service
definition changes. For example, you can update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker
image with the same image/tag combination ( `my_image:latest`) or to roll
Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [ForceNewDeployment](aws-properties-ecs-service-forcenewdeployment.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`HealthCheckGracePeriodSeconds`

The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores
unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container health checks after a task
has first started. If you do not specify a health check grace period value, the default
value of 0 is used. If you do not use any of the health checks, then
`healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` is unused.

If your service has more running tasks than desired, unhealthy tasks in the grace
period might be stopped to reach the desired count.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`LaunchType`

The launch type on which to run your service. For more information, see [Amazon ECS\
Launch Types](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/launch-types.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Note

If you want to use Managed Instances, you must use the `capacityProviderStrategy` request parameter

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `EC2 | FARGATE | EXTERNAL`

_Update requires_: [Some interruptions](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-some-interrupt)

`LoadBalancers`

A list of load balancer objects to associate with the service. If you specify the
`Role` property, `LoadBalancers` must be specified as well. For
information about the number of load balancers that you can specify per service, see [Service Load Balancing](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service_
_Developer Guide_.

###### Important

To remove this property from your service resource, specify an empty `LoadBalancer` array.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [LoadBalancer](aws-properties-ecs-service-loadbalancer.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`NetworkConfiguration`

The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required for task
definitions that use the `awsvpc` network mode to receive their own elastic
network interface, and it is not supported for other network modes. For more information,
see [Task Networking](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/task-networking.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

_Required_: Conditional

_Type_: [NetworkConfiguration](aws-properties-ecs-service-networkconfiguration.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`PlacementConstraints`

An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum
of 10 constraints for each task. This limit includes constraints in the task definition and those
specified at runtime.

###### Important

To remove this property from your service resource, specify an empty `PlacementConstraint` array.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [PlacementConstraint](aws-properties-ecs-service-placementconstraint.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`PlacementStrategies`

The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can specify a maximum of 5
strategy rules for each service.

###### Important

To remove this property from your service resource, specify an empty `PlacementStrategy` array.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [PlacementStrategy](aws-properties-ecs-service-placementstrategy.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`PlatformVersion`

The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on. A platform version
is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If one isn't specified, the
`LATEST` platform version is used. For more information, see [AWS Fargate platform versions](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/platform-versions.md) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`PropagateTags`

Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no
value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task
during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the [TagResource](../../../../reference/amazonecs/latest/apireference/api-tagresource.md) API action.

You must set this to a value other than `NONE` when you use Cost Explorer.
For more information, see [Amazon ECS usage\
reports](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/usage-reports.md) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_.

The default is `NONE`.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `SERVICE | TASK_DEFINITION`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`Role`

The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to
make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you
are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition doesn't use the
`awsvpc` network mode. If you specify the `role` parameter,
you must also specify a load balancer object with the `loadBalancers`
parameter.

###### Important

If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role
is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is
required if your task definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode or if the
service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller,
multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don't
specify a role here. For more information, see [Using\
service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.md) in the _Amazon Elastic_
_Container Service Developer Guide_.

If your specified role has a path other than `/`, then you must either
specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.
For example, if a role with the name `bar` has a path of `/foo/`
then you would specify `/foo/bar` as the role name. For more information, see
[Friendly names and paths](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-identifiers.md#identifiers-friendly-names) in the _IAM User Guide_.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`SchedulingStrategy`

The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see [Services](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-services.md).

There are two service scheduler strategies available:

- `REPLICA`-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler
spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies
and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy
is required if the service uses the `CODE_DEPLOY` or
`EXTERNAL` deployment controller types.

- `DAEMON`-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints
that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task
placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the
placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to
specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service
Auto Scaling policies.

###### Note

Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the `CODE_DEPLOY` or
`EXTERNAL` deployment controller types don't support the
`DAEMON` scheduling strategy.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `DAEMON | REPLICA`

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`ServiceConnectConfiguration`

The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and be
discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the
namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace.
Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for
increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with
Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-connect.md)
in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [ServiceConnectConfiguration](aws-properties-ecs-service-serviceconnectconfiguration.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`ServiceName`

The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers,
underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be unique within a cluster, but
you can have similarly named services in multiple clusters within a Region or across
multiple Regions.

###### Important

The stack update fails if you change any properties that require replacement and the
`ServiceName` is configured. This is because AWS
CloudFormation creates the replacement service first, but each `ServiceName`
must be unique in the cluster.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`ServiceRegistries`

The details of the service discovery registry to associate with this service. For more
information, see [Service\
discovery](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.md).

###### Note

Each service may be associated with one service registry. Multiple service
registries for each service isn't supported.

###### Important

To remove this property from your service resource, specify an empty `ServiceRegistry` array.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [ServiceRegistry](aws-properties-ecs-service-serviceregistry.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`Tags`

The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and organize them.
Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. When a
service is deleted, the tags are deleted as well.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource - 50

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only
one value.

- Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters.
Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in
UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . \_ : / @.

- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

- Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase
combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with
this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource
limit.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [Tag](aws-properties-ecs-service-tag.md)

_Minimum_: `0`

_Maximum_: `50`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`TaskDefinition`

The `family` and `revision` ( `family:revision`) or
full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a `revision` isn't
specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.

A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the `ECS` or
`CODE_DEPLOY` deployment controllers.

For more information about deployment types, see [Amazon ECS deployment\
types](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.md).

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`VolumeConfigurations`

The configuration for a volume specified in the task definition as a volume that is configured at
launch time. Currently, the only supported volume type is an Amazon EBS volume.

###### Important

To remove this property from your service resource, specify an empty `ServiceVolumeConfiguration` array.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [ServiceVolumeConfiguration](aws-properties-ecs-service-servicevolumeconfiguration.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`VpcLatticeConfigurations`

The VPC Lattice configuration for the service being created.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [VpcLatticeConfiguration](aws-properties-ecs-service-vpclatticeconfiguration.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

## Return values

### Ref

When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic `Ref` function, `Ref` returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

In the following example, the `Ref` function returns the ARN of the
`MyECSService` service, such as
`arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789012:service/sample-webapp`.

`{ "Ref": "MyECSService" }`

For more information about using the `Ref` function, see [`Ref`](intrinsic-function-reference-ref.md).

### Fn::GetAtt

The `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.

For more information about using the `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic function, see [`Fn::GetAtt`](intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.md).

`Name`

The name of the Amazon ECS service, such as `sample-webapp`.

`ServiceArn`

The ARN that identifies the service. For more information about the ARN format, see
[Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.md#ecs-resource-ids) in the _Amazon ECS Developer_
_Guide_.

## Examples

- [Create a service that uses a task definition](#aws-resource-ecs-service--examples--Create_a_service_that_uses_a_task_definition)

- [Create a service with a volume configuration](#aws-resource-ecs-service--examples--Create_a_service_with_a_volume_configuration)

- [Associate an Application Load Balancer with a service](#aws-resource-ecs-service--examples--Associate_an_Application_Load_Balancer_with_a_service)

### Create a service that uses a task definition

The following example template creates a service, a cluster, and a task
definition. The cluster contains the service. The service — with a
`DesiredCount` of 1 — uses the task definition defined in the
template. Replace the `ExecutionRoleArn`, `SecurityGroups`, and
`Subnets` with your own information.

### Create a service with a volume configuration

The following example template creates a service that utilizes a pre-existing task
that defers volume configuration to service creation. This example template provides
volume configuration that Amazon ECS uses to create and attach an Amazon EBS volume to each
task in the service. For more information about defering volume configuration and using Amazon EBS volumes with Amazon ECS, see [Use Amazon EBS volumes with\
Amazon ECS](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ebs-volumes.md) in the _Amazon ECS Developer_
_Guide_. Replace `SubnetIDs`, `SecurityGroupIDs`, `TaskDefinition`, and `ManagedEBSVolume` with your own information.

### Associate an Application Load Balancer with a service

The following example associates an Application Load Balancer with an Amazon ECS
service by referencing an `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::TargetGroup`
resource. Replace the `SecurityGroupIDs`, `SubnetIDs`,
`VpcID`, `Cluster`, and `TaskDefinition` with
your own information. For more information about using Application Load Balancers
with Amazon ECS, see [Use an Application Load Balancer\
for Amazon ECS](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/alb.md) in the _Amazon ECS Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Note

The Amazon ECS service requires an explicit dependency on the Application Load
Balancer listener rule and the Application Load Balancer listener. This prevents
the service from starting before the listener is ready.
