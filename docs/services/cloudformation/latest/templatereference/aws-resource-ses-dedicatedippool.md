# AWS::SES::DedicatedIpPool
<a name="aws-resource-ses-dedicatedippool"></a>

Create a new pool of dedicated IP addresses. A pool can include one or more dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your AWS account. You can associate a pool with a configuration set. When you send an email that uses that configuration set, the message is sent from one of the addresses in the associated pool.

**Important**
You can't delete dedicated IP pools that have a `STANDARD` scaling mode with one or more dedicated IP addresses. This constraint doesn't apply to dedicated IP pools that have a `MANAGED` scaling mode.

    }
}
```

### YAML
<a name="aws-resource-ses-dedicatedippool-syntax.yaml"></a>

```
Type: AWS::SES::DedicatedIpPool
Properties:
  [PoolName](#cfn-ses-dedicatedippool-poolname): {{String}}
  [ScalingMode](#cfn-ses-dedicatedippool-scalingmode): {{String}}
