# AWS::Location::Map MapConfiguration

Specifies the map tile style selected from an available provider.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "CustomLayers" : [ String, ... ],
  "PoliticalView" : String,
  "Style" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  CustomLayers:
    - String
  PoliticalView: String
  Style: String

```

## Properties

`CustomLayers`

Specifies the custom layers for the style. Leave unset to not enable any custom layer, or, for styles that support custom layers, you can enable layer(s), such as the `POI` layer for the VectorEsriNavigation style.

###### Note

Currenlty only `VectorEsriNavigation` supports CustomLayers.
For more information, see [Custom Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/map-concepts.html#map-custom-layers).

Valid [Esri map styles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/esri.html):

- `VectorEsriDarkGrayCanvas` – The Esri Dark Gray Canvas map style. A
vector basemap with a dark gray, neutral background with minimal colors, labels,
and features that's designed to draw attention to your thematic content.

- `RasterEsriImagery` – The Esri Imagery map style. A raster basemap
that provides one meter or better satellite and aerial imagery in many parts of
the world and lower resolution satellite imagery worldwide.

- `VectorEsriLightGrayCanvas` – The Esri Light Gray Canvas map style,
which provides a detailed vector basemap with a light gray, neutral background
style with minimal colors, labels, and features that's designed to draw
attention to your thematic content.

- `VectorEsriTopographic` – The Esri Light map style, which provides
a detailed vector basemap with a classic Esri map style.

- `VectorEsriStreets` – The Esri Street Map style, which provides a
detailed vector basemap for the world symbolized with a classic Esri street map
style. The vector tile layer is similar in content and style to the World Street
Map raster map.

- `VectorEsriNavigation` – The Esri Navigation map style, which
provides a detailed basemap for the world symbolized with a custom navigation
map style that's designed for use during the day in mobile devices.

Valid [HERE Technologies map styles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/HERE.html):

- `VectorHereContrast` – The HERE Contrast (Berlin) map style is a
high contrast detailed base map of the world that blends 3D and 2D
rendering.

###### Note

The `VectorHereContrast` style has been renamed from
`VectorHereBerlin`. `VectorHereBerlin` has been
deprecated, but will continue to work in applications that use it.

- `VectorHereExplore` – A default HERE map style containing a
neutral, global map and its features including roads, buildings, landmarks, and
water features. It also now includes a fully designed map of Japan.

- `VectorHereExploreTruck` – A global map containing truck
restrictions and attributes (e.g. width / height / HAZMAT) symbolized with
highlighted segments and icons on top of HERE Explore to support use cases
within transport and logistics.

- `RasterHereExploreSatellite` – A global map containing high
resolution satellite imagery.

- `HybridHereExploreSatellite` – A global map displaying the road
network, street names, and city labels over satellite imagery. This style will
automatically retrieve both raster and vector tiles, and your charges will be
based on total tiles retrieved.

###### Note

Hybrid styles use both vector and raster tiles when rendering the map that
you see. This means that more tiles are retrieved than when using either
vector or raster tiles alone. Your charges will include all tiles
retrieved.

Valid [GrabMaps map styles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/grab.html):

- `VectorGrabStandardLight` – The Grab Standard Light map style
provides a basemap with detailed land use coloring, area names, roads,
landmarks, and points of interest covering Southeast Asia.

- `VectorGrabStandardDark` – The Grab Standard Dark map style
provides a dark variation of the standard basemap covering Southeast
Asia.

###### Note

Grab provides maps only for countries in Southeast Asia, and is only available in
the Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region ( `ap-southeast-1`). For more
information, see [GrabMaps\
countries and area covered](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/grab.html#grab-coverage-area).

Valid [Open Data map\
styles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/previous/developerguide/open-data.html):

- `VectorOpenDataStandardLight` – The Open Data Standard Light map
style provides a detailed basemap for the world suitable for website and mobile
application use. The map includes highways major roads, minor roads, railways,
water features, cities, parks, landmarks, building footprints, and
administrative boundaries.

- `VectorOpenDataStandardDark` – Open Data Standard Dark is a
dark-themed map style that provides a detailed basemap for the world suitable
for website and mobile application use. The map includes highways major roads,
minor roads, railways, water features, cities, parks, landmarks, building
footprints, and administrative boundaries.

- `VectorOpenDataVisualizationLight` – The Open Data Visualization
Light map style is a light-themed style with muted colors and fewer features
that aids in understanding overlaid data.

- `VectorOpenDataVisualizationDark` – The Open Data Visualization
Dark map style is a dark-themed style with muted colors and fewer features that
aids in understanding overlaid data.
