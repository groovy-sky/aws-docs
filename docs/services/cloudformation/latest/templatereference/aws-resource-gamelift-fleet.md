`BuildId`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-buildid"></a>
A unique identifier for a build to be deployed on the new fleet. If you are deploying the fleet with a custom game build, you must specify this property. The build must have been successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift and be in a `READY` status. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created.
*Required*: Conditional
*Type*: String
*Pattern*: `^build-\S+|^arn:.*:build/build-\S+`
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`CertificateConfiguration`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-certificateconfiguration"></a>
Prompts Amazon GameLift Servers to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. Amazon GameLift Servers uses the certificates to encrypt traffic between game clients and the game servers running on Amazon GameLift Servers. By default, the `CertificateConfiguration` is `DISABLED`. You can't change this property after you create the fleet.
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates expire after 13 months. Certificate expiration can cause fleets to fail, preventing players from connecting to instances in the fleet. We recommend you replace fleets before 13 months, consider using fleet aliases for a smooth transition.
ACM isn't available in all AWS regions. A fleet creation request with certificate generation enabled in an unsupported Region, fails with a 4xx error. For more information about the supported Regions, see [Supported Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html) in the *AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*.

`PlayerGatewayMode`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-playergatewaymode"></a>
Configures player gateway for your fleet. Player gateway provides benefits such as DDoS protection by rate limiting and validating traﬃc before it reaches game servers, hiding game server IP addresses from players, and providing updated endpoints when relay endpoints become unhealthy. Note, player gateway is only available for fleets using server SDK 5.x or later game server builds.
**How it works:** When enabled, game clients connect to relay endpoints instead of to your game servers. Player gateway validates player gateway tokens and routes traffic to the appropriate game server. Your game backend calls [GetPlayerConnectionDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetPlayerConnectionDetails.html) to retrieve relay endpoints and player gateway tokens for your game clients. To learn more about this topic, see [DDoS protection with Amazon GameLift Servers player gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftservers/latest/developerguide/ddos-protection-intro.html).
Possible values include:
+ `DISABLED` (default) -- Game clients connect to the game server endpoint. Use this when you do not intend to integrate your game with player gateway.
+ `ENABLED` -- Player gateway is available in fleet locations where it is supported. Your game backend can call [GetPlayerConnectionDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GetPlayerConnectionDetails.html) to obtain a player gateway token and endpoints for game clients.
+ `REQUIRED` -- Player gateway is available in fleet locations where it is supported, and the fleet can only use locations that support this feature. Attempting to add a remote location to your fleet which does not support player gateway will result in an `InvalidRequestException`.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Allowed values*: `DISABLED | ENABLED | REQUIRED`
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`ResourceCreationLimitPolicy`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-resourcecreationlimitpolicy"></a>
A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time.
*Required*: No
*Type*: [ResourceCreationLimitPolicy](aws-properties-gamelift-fleet-resourcecreationlimitpolicy.md)
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`RuntimeConfiguration`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-runtimeconfiguration"></a>
Instructions for how to launch and maintain server processes on instances in the fleet. The runtime configuration defines one or more server process configurations, each identifying a build executable or Realtime script file and the number of processes of that type to run concurrently.
The `RuntimeConfiguration` parameter is required unless the fleet is being configured using the older parameters `ServerLaunchPath` and `ServerLaunchParameters`, which are still supported for backward compatibility.
*Required*: Conditional
*Type*: [RuntimeConfiguration](aws-properties-gamelift-fleet-runtimeconfiguration.md)
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`ScalingPolicies`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-scalingpolicies"></a>
Rule that controls how a fleet is scaled. Scaling policies are uniquely identified by the combination of name and fleet ID.
*Required*: No
*Type*: Array of [ScalingPolicy](aws-properties-gamelift-fleet-scalingpolicy.md)
*Maximum*: `50`
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`ScriptId`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-scriptid"></a>
The unique identifier for a Realtime configuration script to be deployed on fleet instances. You can use either the script ID or ARN. Scripts must be uploaded to Amazon GameLift Servers prior to creating the fleet. This fleet property cannot be changed later.
You can't use the `!Ref` command to reference a script created with a CloudFormation template for the fleet property `ScriptId`. Instead, use `Fn::GetAtt Script.Arn` or `Fn::GetAtt Script.Id` to retrieve either of these properties as input for `ScriptId`. Alternatively, enter a `ScriptId` string manually.
*Required*: Conditional
*Type*: String
*Pattern*: `^script-\S+|^arn:.*:script/script-\S+`
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`Tags`  <a name="cfn-gamelift-fleet-tags"></a>
A list of labels to assign to the new fleet resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see [ Tagging AWS Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the *AWS General Reference*.
*Required*: No
*Type*: Array of [Tag](aws-properties-gamelift-fleet-tag.md)

## Return values
<a name="aws-resource-gamelift-fleet-return-values"></a>

### Ref
<a name="aws-resource-gamelift-fleet-return-values-ref"></a>

When you pass the logical ID of this resource to the intrinsic `Ref` function, `Ref` returns the fleet ID, such as `fleet-1111aaaa-22bb-33cc-44dd-5555eeee66ff`.

For more information about using the `Ref` function, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/intrinsic-function-reference-ref.html).

### Fn::GetAtt
<a name="aws-resource-gamelift-fleet-return-values-fn--getatt"></a>

The `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic function returns a value for a specified attribute of this type. The following are the available attributes and sample return values.

For more information about using the `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic function, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html).

####
<a name="aws-resource-gamelift-fleet-return-values-fn--getatt-fn--getatt"></a>

`FleetArn`  <a name="FleetArn-fn::getatt"></a>
The Amazon Resource Name ([ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html)) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift Servers fleet resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is `arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912`. In a GameLift fleet ARN, the resource ID matches the `FleetId` value.

`FleetId`  <a name="FleetId-fn::getatt"></a>
A unique identifier for the fleet.

### Create GameLift fleet with a Build
<a name="aws-resource-gamelift-fleet--examples--Create_GameLift_fleet_with_a_Build"></a>

The following example creates and configures a GameLift fleet for a custom game build. The fleet uses a `Ref` intrinsic function to specify a build, which can be declared elsewhere in the same template. The example syntax for log path and server launch path uses values for a Windows build.

Note: the JSON example shows how to escape the slashes (`\\`).

### Create GameLift fleet with a Script
<a name="aws-resource-gamelift-fleet--examples--Create_GameLift_fleet_with_a_Script"></a>

The following example creates and configures a GameLift fleet to run Realtime Servers. The fleet uses a `GetAtt` intrinsic function to specify a script, which can be declared elsewhere in the same template. Note that the syntax example for the log path and server launch path are for Linux, as all Realtime Servers are deployed with Linux.
