# AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable StreamSpecification
<a name="aws-properties-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification"></a>

Represents the DynamoDB Streams configuration for a table in DynamoDB.

You can only modify this value for a `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` resource configured for multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC, the default) if that resource contains only one entry in `Replicas`. You must specify a value for this property for a `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` resource configured for MREC with more than one entry in `Replicas`. For Multi-Region Strong Consistency (MRSC), Streams are not required and can be changed for existing tables.

## Syntax
<a name="aws-properties-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification-syntax"></a>

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON
<a name="aws-properties-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification-syntax.json"></a>

```
{
  "[StreamViewType](#cfn-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification-streamviewtype)" : {{String}}
}
```

### YAML
<a name="aws-properties-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification-syntax.yaml"></a>

```
  [StreamViewType](#cfn-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification-streamviewtype): {{String}}
```

## Properties
<a name="aws-properties-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification-properties"></a>

`StreamViewType`  <a name="cfn-dynamodb-globaltable-streamspecification-streamviewtype"></a>
 When an item in the table is modified, `StreamViewType` determines what information is written to the stream for this table. Valid values for `StreamViewType` are:
+ `KEYS_ONLY` - Only the key attributes of the modified item are written to the stream.
+ `NEW_IMAGE` - The entire item, as it appears after it was modified, is written to the stream.
+ `OLD_IMAGE` - The entire item, as it appeared before it was modified, is written to the stream.
+ `NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES` - Both the new and the old item images of the item are written to the stream.
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: String
*Allowed values*: `NEW_IMAGE | OLD_IMAGE | NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES | KEYS_ONLY`
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)
