# AWS::Transfer::WebApp EndpointDetails
<a name="aws-properties-transfer-webapp-endpointdetails"></a>

The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your file transfer protocol-enabled server. With a VPC endpoint, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC. To control incoming internet traffic, invoke the `UpdateServer` API and attach an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

**Note**
 After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your AWS account if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your AWS account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use `EndpointType`=`VPC`.
For more information, see [Discontinuing the use of VPC\_ENDPOINT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint).
It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with `EndpointType` set to `VPC_ENDPOINT`.
