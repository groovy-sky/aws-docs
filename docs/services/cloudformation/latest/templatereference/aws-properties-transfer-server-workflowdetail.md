# AWS::Transfer::Server WorkflowDetail
<a name="aws-properties-transfer-server-workflowdetail"></a>

Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution role that's used for executing the workflow.

 In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded completely, `WorkflowDetails` can also contain a workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when a file is open when the session disconnects.
