# CloudFormation resource custom naming
<a name="aws-properties-name"></a>

You can assign custom names to supported resource types in your CloudFormation template to make them more meaningful and easily identifiable. By default, CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID to name a resource. For example, CloudFormation might name an Amazon S3 bucket with the following physical ID `MyStack-MyBucket-abcdefghijk1`. With custom names, you can specify a name that's easier to read and identify, such as `production-app-logs` or `business-metrics`.

Not all resources support custom names. Each AWS service independently determines which resource types support custom names.

Resource names must be unique across all your active stacks. If you reuse templates to create multiple stacks, you must change or remove custom names from your template. If you don't specify a name, CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID to name the resource. Names must begin with a letter; contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; and not end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

Also, don't manage stack resources outside of CloudFormation. For example, if you rename a resource that's part of a stack without using CloudFormation, you might get an error any time you try to update or delete that stack.

**Important**
You can't perform an update that causes a custom-named resource to be replaced. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.

## Example
<a name="aws-properties-name-example"></a>

If you want to use a custom name, specify a name property for that resource in your CloudFormation template. Each resource that supports custom names has its own property that you specify. For example, to name an DynamoDB table, you use the `TableName` property, as shown in the following sample:

### JSON
<a name="aws-properties-name-example.json"></a>

```
"myDynamoDBTable" : {
   "Type" : "AWS::DynamoDB::Table",
   "Properties" : {
      "KeySchema" : {
         "HashKeyElement": {
            "AttributeName" : "AttributeName1",
            "AttributeType" : "S"
         },
         "RangeKeyElement" : {
            "AttributeName" : "AttributeName2",
            "AttributeType" : "N"
         }
      },
      "ProvisionedThroughput" : {
         "ReadCapacityUnits" : "5",
         "WriteCapacityUnits" : "10"
      },
      "TableName" : "SampleTable"
   }
}
```

### YAML
<a name="aws-properties-name-example.yaml"></a>

```
myDynamoDBTable:
  Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
  Properties:
    KeySchema:
      HashKeyElement:
        AttributeName: "AttributeName1"
        AttributeType: "S"
      RangeKeyElement:
        AttributeName: "AttributeName2"
        AttributeType: "N"
    ProvisionedThroughput:
      ReadCapacityUnits: "5"
      WriteCapacityUnits: "10"
    TableName: "SampleTable"
```
