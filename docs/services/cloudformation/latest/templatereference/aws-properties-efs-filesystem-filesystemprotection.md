`ReplicationOverwriteProtection`  <a name="cfn-efs-filesystem-filesystemprotection-replicationoverwriteprotection"></a>
The status of the file system's replication overwrite protection.
+ `ENABLED` – The file system cannot be used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is writeable. Replication overwrite protection is `ENABLED` by default.
+ `DISABLED` – The file system can be used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and can only be modified by EFS replication.
+ `REPLICATING` – The file system is being used as the destination file system in a replication configuration. The file system is read-only and is modified only by EFS replication.
If the replication configuration is deleted, the file system's replication overwrite protection is re-enabled, the file system becomes writeable.
