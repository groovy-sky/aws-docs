# AWS::Forecast::DatasetGroup Tag
<a name="aws-properties-forecast-datasetgroup-tag"></a>

The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
+ Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.
+ For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
+ Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
+ Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
+ If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: \+ - = . \_ : / @.
+ Tag keys and values are case sensitive.
+ Do not use `aws:`, `AWS:`, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has `aws` as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of `aws` do not count against your tags per resource limit.
