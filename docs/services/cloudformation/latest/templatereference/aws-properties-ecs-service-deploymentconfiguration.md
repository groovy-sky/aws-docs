    DeploymentAlarms
  BakeTimeInMinutes: Integer
  CanaryConfiguration:
    CanaryConfiguration
  DeploymentCircuitBreaker:
    DeploymentCircuitBreaker
  LifecycleHooks:
    - DeploymentLifecycleHook
  LinearConfiguration:
    LinearConfiguration

```

## Properties

`Alarms`

Information about the CloudWatch alarms.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [DeploymentAlarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ecs-service-deploymentalarms.html)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`BakeTimeInMinutes`

The duration waiting before terminating the previous service revision and marking a deployment complete.

The following rules apply when you don't specify a value:

- For blue/green, linear, and canary deployments, the value is set to 15 minutes.

- For rolling deployments, there is no bake time set by default.

- The external deployment controller ( `EXTERNAL`) and the CodeDeploy blue/green deployment controller ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) do not support the `BakeTimeInMinutes` parameter.

###### Note

If you provide a bake time for a rolling deployment, the CloudFormation handler timeout is increased to the maximum of 36 hours, matching the timeout for blue/green, linear, and canary deployments.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Minimum_: `0`

_Maximum_: `1440`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`CanaryConfiguration`

Configuration for canary deployment strategy. Only valid when the deployment strategy
is `CANARY`. This configuration enables shifting a fixed percentage of
traffic for testing, followed by shifting the remaining traffic after a bake
period.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [CanaryConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ecs-service-canaryconfiguration.html)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`DeploymentCircuitBreaker`

###### Note

The deployment circuit breaker can only be used for services using the rolling
update ( `ECS`) deployment type.

The **deployment circuit breaker** determines whether a
service deployment will fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If you use the
deployment circuit breaker, a service deployment will transition to a failed state and
stop launching new tasks. If you use the rollback option, when a service deployment
fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment that completed successfully.
For more information, see [Rolling\
update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer_
_Guide_

_Required_: No

_Type_: [DeploymentCircuitBreaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ecs-service-deploymentcircuitbreaker.html)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`LifecycleHooks`

An array of deployment lifecycle hook objects to run custom logic at specific stages of the deployment lifecycle.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of [DeploymentLifecycleHook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ecs-service-deploymentlifecyclehook.html)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`LinearConfiguration`

Configuration for linear deployment strategy. Only valid when the deployment strategy
is `LINEAR`. This configuration enables progressive traffic shifting in equal
percentage increments with configurable bake times between each step.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [LinearConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-properties-ecs-service-linearconfiguration.html)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`MaximumPercent`

If a service is using the rolling update ( `ECS`) deployment type, the
`maximumPercent` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of
your service's tasks that are allowed in the `RUNNING` or
`PENDING` state during a deployment, as a percentage of the
`desiredCount` (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter
enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using
the `REPLICA` service scheduler and has a `desiredCount` of four
tasks and a `maximumPercent` value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new
tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required
to do this are available). The default `maximumPercent` value for a service
using the `REPLICA` service scheduler is 200%.

The Amazon ECS scheduler uses this parameter to replace unhealthy tasks by starting
replacement tasks first and then stopping the unhealthy tasks, as long as cluster
resources for starting replacement tasks are available. For more information about how
the scheduler replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS\
services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).

If a service is using either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) or
`EXTERNAL` deployment types, and tasks in the service use the EC2 launch
type, the **maximum percent** value is set to the default
value. The **maximum percent** value is used to define the
upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the
`RUNNING` state while the container instances are in the
`DRAINING` state.

###### Note

You can't specify a custom `maximumPercent` value for a service that
uses either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types and has tasks that use the EC2 launch type.

If the service uses either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) or
`EXTERNAL` deployment types, and the tasks in the service use the Fargate
launch type, the maximum percent value is not used. The value is still returned when
describing your service.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`MinimumHealthyPercent`

If a service is using the rolling update ( `ECS`) deployment type, the
`minimumHealthyPercent` represents a lower limit on the number of your
service's tasks that must remain in the `RUNNING` state during a deployment,
as a percentage of the `desiredCount` (rounded up to the nearest integer).
This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For
example, if your service has a `desiredCount` of four tasks and a
`minimumHealthyPercent` of 50%, the service scheduler may stop two
existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks.

If any tasks are unhealthy and if `maximumPercent` doesn't allow the
Amazon ECS scheduler to start replacement tasks, the scheduler stops the unhealthy tasks
one-by-one — using the `minimumHealthyPercent` as a constraint — to clear up
capacity to launch replacement tasks. For more information about how the scheduler
replaces unhealthy tasks, see [Amazon ECS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).

For services that _do not_ use a load balancer, the following
should be noted:

- A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the tasks
in the service pass their health checks.

- If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service
scheduler will wait for 40 seconds after a task reaches a `RUNNING`
state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent
total.

- If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined,
the service scheduler will wait for the task to reach a healthy status before
counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered
healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health
checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by
the container health check settings.

For services that _do_ use a load balancer, the following should be
noted:

- If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service
scheduler will wait for the load balancer target group health check to return a
healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent
total.

- If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the service
scheduler will wait for both the task to reach a healthy status and the load
balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting
the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.

The default value for a replica service for `minimumHealthyPercent` is
100%. The default `minimumHealthyPercent` value for a service using the
`DAEMON` service schedule is 0% for the AWS CLI, the AWS SDKs, and the
APIs and 50% for the AWS Management Console.

The minimum number of healthy tasks during a deployment is the
`desiredCount` multiplied by the `minimumHealthyPercent`/100,
rounded up to the nearest integer value.

If a service is using either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) or
`EXTERNAL` deployment types and is running tasks that use the EC2 launch
type, the **minimum healthy percent** value is set to the
default value. The **minimum healthy percent** value is
used to define the lower limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in
the `RUNNING` state while the container instances are in the
`DRAINING` state.

###### Note

You can't specify a custom `minimumHealthyPercent` value for a service
that uses either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) or `EXTERNAL`
deployment types and has tasks that use the EC2 launch type.

If a service is using either the blue/green ( `CODE_DEPLOY`) or
`EXTERNAL` deployment types and is running tasks that use the Fargate
launch type, the minimum healthy percent value is not used, although it is returned when
describing your service.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`Strategy`

The deployment strategy for the service. Choose from these valid values:

- `ROLLING` \- When you create a service which uses the rolling update
( `ROLLING`) deployment strategy, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces
the currently running tasks with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or
removes from the service during a rolling update is controlled by the service
deployment configuration.

- `BLUE_GREEN` \- A blue/green deployment strategy
( `BLUE_GREEN`) is a release methodology that reduces downtime and risk
by running two identical production environments called blue and green. With Amazon ECS
blue/green deployments, you can validate new service revisions before directing
production traffic to them. This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with
the ability to quickly roll back if needed.

- `LINEAR` \- A _linear_ deployment strategy
( `LINEAR`) gradually shifts traffic from the current production
environment to a new environment in equal percentages over time. With Amazon ECS linear
deployments, you can control the pace of traffic shifting and validate new service
revisions with increasing amounts of production traffic.

- `CANARY` \- A _canary_ deployment strategy
( `CANARY`) shifts a small percentage of traffic to the new service
revision first, then shifts the remaining traffic all at once after a specified
time period. This allows you to test the new version with a subset of users before
full deployment.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `ROLLING | BLUE_GREEN | LINEAR | CANARY`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
