## Properties
<a name="aws-resource-ec2-capacityreservation-properties"></a>

`AvailabilityZone`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-availabilityzone"></a>
The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`AvailabilityZoneId`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-availabilityzoneid"></a>
The ID of the Availability Zone in which the capacity is reserved.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`EbsOptimized`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-ebsoptimized"></a>
Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.
*Required*: No
*Type*: Boolean
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`EndDate`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-enddate"></a>
The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to `expired` when it reaches its end date and time.
You must provide an `EndDate` value if `EndDateType` is `limited`. Omit `EndDate` if `EndDateType` is `unlimited`.
If the `EndDateType` is `limited`, the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.
If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you can't specify an end date and time that is within the commitment duration.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`EndDateType`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-enddatetype"></a>
Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:
+ `unlimited` - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an `EndDate` if the `EndDateType` is `unlimited`.
+ `limited` - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time. You must provide an `EndDate` value if the `EndDateType` value is `limited`.
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Allowed values*: `unlimited | limited`
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`EphemeralStorage`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-ephemeralstorage"></a>
 *Deprecated.*
*Required*: No
*Type*: Boolean
*Update requires*: [Replacement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement)

`InstanceCount`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-instancecount"></a>
The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.
You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for an instance count with a minimum of 32 vCPUs. For example, if you request a future-dated Capacity Reservation for `m5.xlarge` instances, you must request at least 8 instances (*8 \* m5.xlarge = 32 vCPUs*).
Valid range: 1 - 1000
*Required*: Yes
*Type*: Integer
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`InstanceMatchCriteria`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-instancematchcriteria"></a>
Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:
+ `open` - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
+ `targeted` - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.
If you are requesting a future-dated Capacity Reservation, you must specify `targeted`.
Default: `open`
*Required*: No
*Type*: String
*Allowed values*: `open | targeted`
*Update requires*: [No interruption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-no-interrupt)

`InstancePlatform`  <a name="cfn-ec2-capacityreservation-instanceplatform"></a>
