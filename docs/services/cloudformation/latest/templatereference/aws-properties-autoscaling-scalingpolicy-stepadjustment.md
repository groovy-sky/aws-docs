# AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy StepAdjustment

`StepAdjustment` specifies a step adjustment for the `StepAdjustments`
property of the [AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy](../userguide/aws-resource-autoscaling-scalingpolicy.md) resource.

For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

- To trigger a step adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less
than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.

- To trigger a step adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal
to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

- The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.

- At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a
negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

- At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a
positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

- The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

For more information, see [Step\
adjustments](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.md#as-scaling-steps) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

You can find a sample template snippet in the [Examples](../userguide/aws-resource-autoscaling-scalingpolicy.md#aws-resource-autoscaling-scalingpolicy--examples) section of the `AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy`
resource.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "MetricIntervalLowerBound" : Number,
  "MetricIntervalUpperBound" : Number,
  "ScalingAdjustment" : Integer
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  MetricIntervalLowerBound: Number
  MetricIntervalUpperBound: Number
  ScalingAdjustment: Integer

```

## Properties

`MetricIntervalLowerBound`

The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If
the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive (the metric
must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it is
exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null
value indicates negative infinity.

_Required_: Conditional

_Type_: Number

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`MetricIntervalUpperBound`

The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If
the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive (the metric
must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound). Otherwise, it is inclusive (the
metric must be less than or equal to the threshold plus the upper bound). A null value
indicates positive infinity.

The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

_Required_: Conditional

_Type_: Number

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`ScalingAdjustment`

The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value
adds to the current capacity while a negative number removes from the current capacity.
For exact capacity, you must specify a non-negative value.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
