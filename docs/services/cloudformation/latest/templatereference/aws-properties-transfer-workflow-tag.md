# AWS::Transfer::Workflow Tag
<a name="aws-properties-transfer-workflow-tag"></a>

Creates a key-value pair for a specific resource. Tags are metadata that you can use to search for and group a resource for various purposes. You can apply tags to servers, users, and roles. A tag key can take more than one value. For example, to group servers for accounting purposes, you might create a tag called `Group` and assign the values `Research` and `Accounting` to that group.
