# AWS::CloudTrail::Trail AdvancedEventSelector
<a name="aws-properties-cloudtrail-trail-advancedeventselector"></a>

Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for AWS CloudTrail management, data, and network activity events. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about configuring advanced event selectors, see the [Logging data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html), [Logging network activity events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.html), and [Logging management events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html) topics in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*.

You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.
