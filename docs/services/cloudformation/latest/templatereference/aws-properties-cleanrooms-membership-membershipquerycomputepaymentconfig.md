`IsResponsible`  <a name="cfn-cleanrooms-membership-membershipquerycomputepaymentconfig-isresponsible"></a>
Indicates whether the collaboration member has accepted to pay for query compute costs (`TRUE`) or has not accepted to pay for query compute costs (`FALSE`).
If the collaboration creator has not specified anyone to pay for query compute costs, then the member who can query is the default payer.
An error message is returned for the following reasons:
+ If you set the value to `FALSE` but you are responsible to pay for query compute costs.
+ If you set the value to `TRUE` but you are not responsible to pay for query compute costs.
