# AWS::Kendra::Index CapacityUnitsConfiguration

Specifies additional capacity units configured for your Enterprise Edition index. You can
add and remove capacity units to fit your usage requirements.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "QueryCapacityUnits" : Integer,
  "StorageCapacityUnits" : Integer
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  QueryCapacityUnits: Integer
  StorageCapacityUnits: Integer

```

## Properties

`QueryCapacityUnits`

The amount of extra query capacity for an index and [GetQuerySuggestions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_GetQuerySuggestions.html)
capacity.

A single extra capacity unit for an index provides 0.1 queries per second or approximately
8,000 queries per day. You can add up to 100 extra capacity units.

`GetQuerySuggestions` capacity is five times the provisioned query capacity for
an index, or the base capacity of 2.5 calls per second, whichever is higher. For example, the
base capacity for an index is 0.1 queries per second, and `GetQuerySuggestions`
capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second. If you add another 0.1 queries per second to
total 0.2 queries per second for an index, the `GetQuerySuggestions` capacity is
2.5 calls per second (higher than five times 0.2 queries per second).
