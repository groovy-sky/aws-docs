# AWS::Bedrock::Flow LoopFlowNodeConfiguration
<a name="aws-properties-bedrock-flow-loopflownodeconfiguration"></a>

Contains configurations for the nodes of a DoWhile loop in your flow.

A DoWhile loop is made up of the following nodes:
+ `Loop` - The container node that holds the loop's flow definition. This node encompasses the entire loop structure.
+ `LoopInput` - The entry point node for the loop. This node receives inputs from nodes outside the loop and from previous loop iterations.
+ Body nodes - The processing nodes that execute within each loop iteration. These can be nodes for handling data in your flow, such as a prompt or Lambda function nodes. Some node types aren't supported inside a DoWhile loop body. For more information, see [LoopIncompatibleNodeTypeFlowValidationDetails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_LoopIncompatibleNodeTypeFlowValidationDetails.html).
+ `LoopController` - The node that evaluates whether the loop should continue or exit based on a condition.

These nodes work together to create a loop that runs at least once and continues until a specified condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
