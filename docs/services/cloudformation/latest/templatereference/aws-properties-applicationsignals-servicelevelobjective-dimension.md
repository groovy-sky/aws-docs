# AWS::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjective Dimension
<a name="aws-properties-applicationsignals-servicelevelobjective-dimension"></a>

A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish `InstanceId` as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.
