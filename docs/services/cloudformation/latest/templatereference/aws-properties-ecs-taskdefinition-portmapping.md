# AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition PortMapping

The `PortMapping` property specifies a port mapping. Port mappings allow
containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic. Port
mappings are specified as part of the container definition.

If you are using containers in a task with the `awsvpc` or `host`
network mode, exposed ports should be specified using `containerPort`. The
`hostPort` can be left blank or it must be the same value as the
`containerPort`.

After a task reaches the `RUNNING` status, manual and automatic host and
container port assignments are visible in the `networkBindings` section of
[DescribeTasks](../../../../reference/amazonecs/latest/apireference/api-describetasks.md) API responses.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "AppProtocol" : String,
  "ContainerPort" : Integer,
  "ContainerPortRange" : String,
  "HostPort" : Integer,
  "Name" : String,
  "Protocol" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  AppProtocol: String
  ContainerPort: Integer
  ContainerPortRange: String
  HostPort: Integer
  Name: String
  Protocol: String

```

## Properties

`AppProtocol`

The application protocol that's used for the port mapping. This parameter only applies
to Service Connect. We recommend that you set this parameter to be consistent with the
protocol that your application uses. If you set this parameter, Amazon ECS adds
protocol-specific connection handling to the Service Connect proxy. If you set this
parameter, Amazon ECS adds protocol-specific telemetry in the Amazon ECS console and
CloudWatch.

If you don't set a value for this parameter, then TCP is used. However, Amazon ECS
doesn't add protocol-specific telemetry for TCP.

`appProtocol` is immutable in a Service Connect service. Updating this
field requires a service deletion and redeployment.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the
namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace.
Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for
increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with
Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-connect.md)
in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `http | http2 | grpc`

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`ContainerPort`

The port number on the container that's bound to the user-specified or automatically
assigned host port.

If you use containers in a task with the `awsvpc` or `host`
network mode, specify the exposed ports using `containerPort`.

If you use containers in a task with the `bridge` network mode and you
specify a container port and not a host port, your container automatically receives a
host port in the ephemeral port range. For more information, see `hostPort`.
Port mappings that are automatically assigned in this way do not count toward the 100
reserved ports limit of a container instance.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`ContainerPortRange`

The port number range on the container that's bound to the dynamically mapped host
port range.

The following rules apply when you specify a `containerPortRange`:

- You must use either the `bridge` network mode or the
`awsvpc` network mode.

- This parameter is available for both the EC2 and AWS Fargate launch
types.

- This parameter is available for both the Linux and Windows operating
systems.

- The container instance must have at least version 1.67.0 of the container
agent and at least version 1.67.0-1 of the `ecs-init` package

- You can specify a maximum of 100 port ranges per container.

- You do not specify a `hostPortRange`. The value of the
`hostPortRange` is set as follows:

- For containers in a task with the `awsvpc` network mode,
the `hostPortRange` is set to the same value as the
`containerPortRange`. This is a static mapping
strategy.

- For containers in a task with the `bridge` network mode,
the Amazon ECS agent finds open host ports from the default ephemeral
range and passes it to docker to bind them to the container
ports.

- The `containerPortRange` valid values are between 1 and
65535.

- A port can only be included in one port mapping per container.

- You cannot specify overlapping port ranges.

- The first port in the range must be less than last port in the range.

- Docker recommends that you turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon
config file when you have a large number of ports.

For more information, see [Issue #11185](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/11185) on the
Github website.

For information about how to turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon
config file, see [Docker daemon](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/bootstrap-container-instance.md#bootstrap_docker_daemon) in the _Amazon ECS Developer_
_Guide_.

You can call [`DescribeTasks`](../../../../reference/amazonecs/latest/apireference/api-describetasks.md) to view the `hostPortRange` which
are the host ports that are bound to the container ports.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`HostPort`

The port number on the container instance to reserve for your container.

If you specify a `containerPortRange`, leave this field empty and the value
of the `hostPort` is set as follows:

- For containers in a task with the `awsvpc` network mode, the
`hostPort` is set to the same value as the
`containerPort`. This is a static mapping strategy.

- For containers in a task with the `bridge` network mode, the Amazon
ECS agent finds open ports on the host and automatically binds them to the
container ports. This is a dynamic mapping strategy.

If you use containers in a task with the `awsvpc` or `host`
network mode, the `hostPort` can either be left blank or set to the same
value as the `containerPort`.

If you use containers in a task with the `bridge` network mode, you can
specify a non-reserved host port for your container port mapping, or you can omit the
`hostPort` (or set it to `0`) while specifying a
`containerPort` and your container automatically receives a port in the
ephemeral port range for your container instance operating system and Docker
version.

The default ephemeral port range for Docker version 1.6.0 and later is listed on the
instance under `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range`. If this kernel
parameter is unavailable, the default ephemeral port range from 49153 through 65535
(Linux) or 49152 through 65535 (Windows) is used. Do not attempt to specify a host port
in the ephemeral port range as these are reserved for automatic assignment. In general,
ports below 32768 are outside of the ephemeral port range.

The default reserved ports are 22 for SSH, the Docker ports 2375 and 2376, and the
Amazon ECS container agent ports 51678-51680. Any host port that was previously
specified in a running task is also reserved while the task is running. That is, after a
task stops, the host port is released. The current reserved ports are displayed in the
`remainingResources` of [DescribeContainerInstances](../../../../reference/amazonecs/latest/apireference/api-describecontainerinstances.md) output. A container instance can have up to 100
reserved ports at a time. This number includes the default reserved ports. Automatically
assigned ports aren't included in the 100 reserved ports quota.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`Name`

The name that's used for the port mapping. This parameter is the name that you use in
the `serviceConnectConfiguration` and the
`vpcLatticeConfigurations` of a service. The name can include up to 64
characters. The characters can include lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (\_), and
hyphens (-). The name can't start with a hyphen.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`Protocol`

The protocol used for the port mapping. Valid values are `tcp` and
`udp`. The default is `tcp`. `protocol` is
immutable in a Service Connect service. Updating this field requires a service deletion
and redeployment.

_Required_: No

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `tcp | udp`
