# `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform

This topic describes how to use the `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform to
enable ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy on your stack.

For more information, see [Perform ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy using CloudFormation](../userguide/blue-green.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Usage

To use the `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform, you must declare it at the
top level of your CloudFormation template. You can't use
`AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` as a transform embedded in any other template
section.

The value for the transform declaration must be a literal string. You can't use a
parameter or function to specify a transform value.

### Syntax

To declare this transform in your CloudFormation template, use the following
syntax:

#### JSON

```json

{
  "Transform":[
    "AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen"
  ],
  "Resources":{
    ...
  }
}
```

#### YAML

```yaml

Transform:
  - 'AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen'
Resources:
  ...
```

The `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform is a standalone declaration
with no additional parameters.
