<a name="transform-aws-codedeploybluegreen"></a>

This topic describes how to use the `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform to enable ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy on your stack.

For more information, see [Perform ECS blue/green deployments through CodeDeploy using CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/blue-green.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.

## Usage
<a name="aws-codedeploybluegreen-usage"></a>

To use the `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform, you must declare it at the top level of your CloudFormation template. You can't use `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` as a transform embedded in any other template section.

The value for the transform declaration must be a literal string. You can't use a parameter or function to specify a transform value.

### Syntax
<a name="aws-codedeploybluegreen-syntax"></a>

To declare this transform in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

#### JSON
<a name="aws-codedeploybluegreen-syntax.json"></a>

```
{
  "Transform":[
    "AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen"
  ],
  "Resources":{
    {{...}}
  }
}
```

#### YAML
<a name="aws-codedeploybluegreen-syntax.yaml"></a>

```
Transform:
  - 'AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen'
Resources:
  {{...}}
```

The `AWS::CodeDeployBlueGreen` transform is a standalone declaration with no additional parameters.
