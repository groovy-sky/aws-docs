# AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition HealthCheck

The `HealthCheck` property specifies an object representing a container
health check. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override
any Docker health checks that exist in the container image (such as those specified in a
parent image or from the image's Dockerfile). This configuration maps to the
`HEALTHCHECK` parameter of docker run.

###### Note

The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks
specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health checks that
are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container definition. Health
check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health
checks that exist in the container image.

If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue its
lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a service, if the
task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped and the service scheduler will
replace it.

The following are notes about container health check support:

- Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon ECS
container agent. For more information, see [Updating the Amazon\
ECS Container Agent](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.md).

- Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you are using platform
version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see [AWS Fargate Platform Versions](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/platform-versions.md).

- Container health checks are not supported for tasks that are part of a service
that is configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "Command" : [ String, ... ],
  "Interval" : Integer,
  "Retries" : Integer,
  "StartPeriod" : Integer,
  "Timeout" : Integer
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  Command:
    - String
  Interval: Integer
  Retries: Integer
  StartPeriod: Integer
  Timeout: Integer

```

## Properties

`Command`

A string array representing the command that the container runs to determine if it is
healthy. The string array must start with `CMD` to run the command arguments
directly, or `CMD-SHELL` to run the command with the container's default
shell.

When you use the AWS Management Console JSON panel, the AWS Command Line Interface, or the APIs, enclose the list of commands in double quotes and
brackets.

`[ "CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1" ]`

You don't include the double quotes and brackets when you use the AWS
Management Console.

` CMD-SHELL, curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1`

An exit code of 0 indicates success, and non-zero exit code indicates failure. For
more information, see `HealthCheck` in the docker container create
command.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of String

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`Interval`

The time period in seconds between each health check execution. You may specify
between 5 and 300 seconds. The default value is 30 seconds. This value applies only when
you specify a `command`.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`Retries`

The number of times to retry a failed health check before the container is considered
unhealthy. You may specify between 1 and 10 retries. The default value is 3. This value
applies only when you specify a `command`.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`StartPeriod`

The optional grace period to provide containers time to bootstrap before failed health
checks count towards the maximum number of retries. You can specify between 0 and 300
seconds. By default, the `startPeriod` is off. This value applies only when
you specify a `command`.

###### Note

If a health check succeeds within the `startPeriod`, then the container
is considered healthy and any subsequent failures count toward the maximum number of
retries.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)

`Timeout`

The time period in seconds to wait for a health check to succeed before it is
considered a failure. You may specify between 2 and 60 seconds. The default value is 5.
This value applies only when you specify a `command`.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [Replacement](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-replacement)
