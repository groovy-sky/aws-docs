# AWS::EKS::Cluster UpgradePolicy
<a name="aws-properties-eks-cluster-upgradepolicy"></a>

The support policy to use for the cluster. Extended support allows you to remain on specific Kubernetes versions for longer. Clusters in extended support have higher costs. The default value is `EXTENDED`. Use `STANDARD` to disable extended support.
