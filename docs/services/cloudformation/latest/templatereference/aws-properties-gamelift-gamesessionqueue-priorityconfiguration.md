# AWS::GameLift::GameSessionQueue PriorityConfiguration

Custom prioritization settings for use by a game session queue when placing new game
sessions with available game servers. When defined, this configuration replaces the
default FleetIQ prioritization process, which is as follows:

- If player latency data is included in a game session request, destinations and
locations are prioritized first based on lowest average latency (1), then on
lowest hosting cost (2), then on destination list order (3), and finally on
location (alphabetical) (4). This approach ensures that the queue's top priority
is to place game sessions where average player latency is lowest, and--if
latency is the same--where the hosting cost is less, etc.

- If player latency data is not included, destinations and locations are
prioritized first on destination list order (1), and then on location
(alphabetical) (2). This approach ensures that the queue's top priority is to
place game sessions on the first destination fleet listed. If that fleet has
multiple locations, the game session is placed on the first location (when
listed alphabetically).

Changing the priority order will affect how game sessions are placed.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "LocationOrder" : [ String, ... ],
  "PriorityOrder" : [ String, ... ]
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  LocationOrder:
    - String
  PriorityOrder:
    - String

```

## Properties

`LocationOrder`

The prioritization order to use for fleet locations, when the
`PriorityOrder` property includes `LOCATION`. Locations can
include AWS Region codes (such as `us-west-2`), local zones, and custom
locations (for Anywhere fleets). Each location must be listed only once. For details, see
[Amazon GameLift Servers service locations.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html)

`PriorityOrder`

A custom sequence to use when prioritizing where to place new game sessions. Each
priority type is listed once.

- `LATENCY` \-\- Amazon GameLift Servers prioritizes locations where the average player
latency is lowest. Player latency data is provided in each game session
placement request.

- `COST` \-\- Amazon GameLift Servers prioritizes queue destinations with the lowest
current hosting costs. Cost is evaluated based on the destination's location,
instance type, and fleet type (Spot or On-Demand).

- `DESTINATION` \-\- Amazon GameLift Servers prioritizes based on the list order of
destinations in the queue configuration.

- `LOCATION` \-\- Amazon GameLift Servers prioritizes based on the provided order of
locations, as defined in `LocationOrder`.

_Required_: No

_Type_: Array of String

_Allowed values_: `LATENCY | COST | DESTINATION | LOCATION`

_Minimum_: `1`

_Maximum_: `4`
