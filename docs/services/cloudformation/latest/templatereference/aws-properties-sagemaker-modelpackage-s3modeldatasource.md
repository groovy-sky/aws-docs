# AWS::SageMaker::ModelPackage S3ModelDataSource

Specifies the S3 location of ML model data to deploy.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "CompressionType" : String,
  "ModelAccessConfig" : ModelAccessConfig,
  "S3DataType" : String,
  "S3Uri" : String
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  CompressionType: String
  ModelAccessConfig:
    ModelAccessConfig
  S3DataType: String
  S3Uri: String

```

## Properties

`CompressionType`

Specifies how the ML model data is prepared.

If you choose `Gzip` and choose `S3Object` as the value of
`S3DataType`, `S3Uri` identifies an object that is a
gzip-compressed TAR archive. SageMaker will attempt to decompress and untar the object during
model deployment.

If you choose `None` and chooose `S3Object` as the value of
`S3DataType`, `S3Uri` identifies an object that represents an
uncompressed ML model to deploy.

If you choose None and choose `S3Prefix` as the value of
`S3DataType`, `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix, under
which all objects represents the uncompressed ML model to deploy.

If you choose None, then SageMaker will follow rules below when creating model data files
under /opt/ml/model directory for use by your inference code:

- If you choose `S3Object` as the value of `S3DataType`,
then SageMaker will split the key of the S3 object referenced by `S3Uri`
by slash (/), and use the last part as the filename of the file holding the
content of the S3 object.

- If you choose `S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType`,
then for each S3 object under the key name pefix referenced by
`S3Uri`, SageMaker will trim its key by the prefix, and use the
remainder as the path (relative to `/opt/ml/model`) of the file
holding the content of the S3 object. SageMaker will split the remainder by slash
(/), using intermediate parts as directory names and the last part as filename
of the file holding the content of the S3 object.

- Do not use any of the following as file names or directory names:

- An empty or blank string

- A string which contains null bytes

- A string longer than 255 bytes

- A single dot ( `.`)

- A double dot ( `..`)

- Ambiguous file names will result in model deployment failure. For example, if
your uncompressed ML model consists of two S3 objects
`s3://mybucket/model/weights` and
`s3://mybucket/model/weights/part1` and you specify
`s3://mybucket/model/` as the value of `S3Uri` and
`S3Prefix` as the value of `S3DataType`, then it will
result in name clash between `/opt/ml/model/weights` (a regular file)
and `/opt/ml/model/weights/` (a directory).

- Do not organize the model artifacts in [S3 console using\
folders](../../../s3/latest/userguide/using-folders.md). When you create a folder in S3 console, S3 creates a 0-byte
object with a key set to the folder name you provide. They key of the 0-byte
object ends with a slash (/) which violates SageMaker restrictions on model artifact
file names, leading to model deployment failure.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `None | Gzip`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`ModelAccessConfig`

Specifies the access configuration file for the ML model. You can explicitly accept the
model end-user license agreement (EULA) within the `ModelAccessConfig`. You are
responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making sure
they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using a model.

_Required_: No

_Type_: [ModelAccessConfig](aws-properties-sagemaker-modelpackage-modelaccessconfig.md)

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`S3DataType`

Specifies the type of ML model data to deploy.

If you choose `S3Prefix`, `S3Uri` identifies a key name prefix.
SageMaker uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix as part of the ML model
data to deploy. A valid key name prefix identified by `S3Uri` always ends
with a forward slash (/).

If you choose `S3Object`, `S3Uri` identifies an object that is
the ML model data to deploy.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Allowed values_: `S3Prefix | S3Object`

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`S3Uri`

Specifies the S3 path of ML model data to deploy.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Pattern_: `^(https|s3)://([^/]+)/?(.*)$`

_Maximum_: `1024`
