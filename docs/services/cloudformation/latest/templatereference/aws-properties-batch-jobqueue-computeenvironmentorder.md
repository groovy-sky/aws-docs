# AWS::Batch::JobQueue ComputeEnvironmentOrder

The order that compute environments are tried in for job placement within a queue. Compute
environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are
associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried
for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the `VALID` state before you
can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
( `EC2` or `SPOT`) or Fargate ( `FARGATE` or
`FARGATE_SPOT`); Amazon EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

###### Note

All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same
architecture. AWS Batch doesn't support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single
job queue.

## Syntax

To declare this entity in your CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:

### JSON

```json

{
  "ComputeEnvironment" : String,
  "Order" : Integer
}

```

### YAML

```yaml

  ComputeEnvironment: String
  Order: Integer

```

## Properties

`ComputeEnvironment`

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: String

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)

`Order`

The order of the compute environment. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For
example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment
with a lower `order` integer value is tried for job placement first.

_Required_: Yes

_Type_: Integer

_Update requires_: [No interruption](../userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.md#update-no-interrupt)
