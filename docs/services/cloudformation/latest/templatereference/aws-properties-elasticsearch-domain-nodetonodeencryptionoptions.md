# AWS::Elasticsearch::Domain NodeToNodeEncryptionOptions

Specifies whether node-to-node encryption is enabled.

###### Important

The `AWS::Elasticsearch::Domain` resource is being replaced by the [AWS::OpenSearchService::Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-opensearchservice-domain.html) resource. While the legacy Elasticsearch resource
and options are still supported, we recommend modifying your existing Cloudformation
templates to use the new OpenSearch Service resource, which supports both OpenSearch and
Elasticsearch. For more information about the service rename, see [New resource\
types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/rename.html#rename-resource) in the _Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer_
_Guide_.
