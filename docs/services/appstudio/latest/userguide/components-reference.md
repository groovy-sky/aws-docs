# Components reference

This topic details each of App Studio's components, their properties, and includes configuration examples.

## Common component properties

This section outlines the general properties and features that are shared across multiple
components in the application studio. The specific implementation details and use cases for each
property type may vary depending on the component, but the general concept of these properties
remains consistent across App Studio.

### Name

A default name is generated for each component; however, you can edit to change to a unique
name to each component. You will use this name to reference the component and its data from
other components or expressions within the same page. Limitation: Do not include spaces in the
component name; it can only have have letters, numbers, underscores and dollar signs. Examples:
`userNameInput`, `ordersTable`, `metricCard1`.

### Primary value, Secondary value, and Value

Many components in the application studio provide fields for specifying values or
expressions that determine the content or data displayed within the component. These fields are
often labeled as `Primary value`, `Secondary value`, or simply `Value`, depending on the component
type and purpose.

The `Primary value` field is typically used to define the main value, data point, or content
that should be prominently displayed within the component.

The `Secondary value` field, when available, is used to display an additional or supporting
value or information alongside the primary value.

The `Value` field allows you to specify the value or expression that should be displayed in
the component.

These fields support both static text input and dynamic expressions. By using expressions,
you can reference data from other components, data sources, or variables within your
application, enabling dynamic and data-driven content display.

#### Syntax for expressions

The syntax for entering expressions in these fields follows a consistent pattern:

```nohighlight

{{expression}}
```

Where `expression` is a valid expression that evaluates to the desired value or
data you want to display.

##### Example: Static text

- Primary value: you can enter a static number or value directly, such as
`"123"` or `"$1,999.99"`.

- Secondary value: you can enter a static text label, such as
`"Goal"` or `"Projected Revenue"`.

- Value: you can enter a static string, such as `"since last
            month"` or `"Total Quantity"`.

##### Examples: Expressions

- `Hello, {{currentUser.firstName}}`: Displays a greeting with the first name
of the currently logged-in user.

- `{{currentUser.role === 'Admin' ? 'Admin Dashboard' : 'User Dashboard'}}`:
Conditionally displays a different dashboard title based on the user's role.

- `{{ui.componentName.data?.[0]?.fieldName}}`: Retrieves the value of the
`fieldName` field from the first item in the data of the component with the ID
`componentName`.

- `{{ui.componentName.value * 100}}`: Performs a calculation on the value of
the component with the ID `componentName`.

- `{{ui.componentName.value + ' items'}}`: Concatenates the value of the
component with the ID `componentName` and the string `'
           items'`.

- `{{ui.ordersTable.data?.[0]?.orderNumber}}`: Retrieves the order number
from the first row of data in the `ordersTable` component.

- `{{ui.salesMetrics.data?.[0]?.totalRevenue * 1.15}}`: Calculates the
projected revenue by increasing the total revenue from the first row of data in the
`salesMetrics` component by 15%.

- `{{ui.customerProfile.data?.[0]?.firstName + ' ' +
            ui.customerProfile.data?.lastName}}`: Concatenates the first and last name from the
data in the `customerProfile` component.

- `{{new Date(ui.orderDetails.data?.orderDate).toLocaleDateString()}}`:
Formats the order date from the `orderDetails` component to a more readable date
string.

- `{{ui.productList.data?.length}}`: Displays the total number of products in
the data connected to the `productList` component.

- `{{ui.discountPercentage.value * ui.orderTotal.value}}`: Calculates the
discount amount based on the discount percentage and the order total.

- `{{ui.cartItemCount.value + ' items in cart'}}`: Displays the number of
items in the shopping cart, along with the label `items in cart`.

By using these expression fields, you can create dynamic and data-driven content within
your application, allowing you to display information that is tailored to the user's context
or the state of your application. This enables more personalized and interactive user
experiences.

### Label

The **Label** property allows you to specify a caption or title for the component. This label
is typically displayed alongside or above the component, helping users understand its
purpose.

You can use both static text and expressions to define the label.

#### Example: Static text

If you enter the text "First Name" in the Label field, the component will display "First
Name" as its label.

#### Example: Expressions

##### Example: Retail store

The following example personalizes the label for each user, making the interface feel more tailored to the individual:

```

{{currentUser.firstName}} {{currentUser.lastName}}'s Account
```

##### Example: SaaS project management

The following example pulls data from the selected project to
provide context-specific labels, helping users stay oriented within the application:

```

Project {{ui.projectsTable.selectedRow.id}} - {{ui.projectsTable.selectedRow.name}}
```

##### Example: Healthcare clinic

The following example references the
current user's profile and the doctor's information, providing a more personalized experience for patients.

```

Dr. {{ui.doctorProfileTable.data.firstName}}
       {{ui.doctorProfileTable.data.lastName}}
```

### Placeholder

The Placeholder property allows you to specify hint or guidance text that is displayed
within the component when it is empty. This can help users understand the expected input format
or provide additional context.

You can use both static text and expressions to define the placeholder.

#### Example: Static text

If you enter the text `Enter your name` in the **Placeholder** field, the component will
display `Enter your name` as the placeholder text.

#### Example: Expressions

##### Example: Financial services

`Enter the amount you'd like to deposit into your {{ui.accountsTable.selectedRow.balance}} account` These examples pull data from the selected account to display
relevant prompts, making the interface intuitive for banking customers.

##### Example: E-commerce

`Enter the coupon code for {{ui.cartTable.data.currency}} total`
The placeholder here dynamically updates based on the user's cart contents, providing a
seamless checkout experience.

##### Example: Healthcare clinic

`Enter your {{ui.patientProfile.data.age}}-year-old patient's symptoms` By using an
expression that references the patient's age, the application can create a more personalized
and helpful placeholder.

### Source

The **Source** property allows you to select the data source for a component. Upon selection,
you can choose from the following data source types: `entity`, `expression`, or `automation`.

#### Entity

Selecting **Entity** as the data source allows you to connect the component to an existing
data entity or model in your application. This is useful when you have a well-defined data
structure or schema that you want to leverage throughout your application.

When to use the entity data source:

- When you have a data model or entity that contains the information you want to display
in the component (e.g., a "Products" entity with fields like "Name", "Description",
"Price").

- When you need to dynamically fetch data from a database, API, or other external data
source and present it in the component.

- When you want to take advantage of the relationships and associations defined in your
application's data model.

##### Selecting a query on an entity

Sometimes, you may want to connect a component to a specific query that retrieves data
from an entity, rather than the entire entity. In the Entity data source, you have the option
to choose from existing queries or create a new one.

By selecting a query, you can:

- Filter the data displayed in the component based on specific criteria.

- Pass parameters to the query to dynamically filter or sort the data.

- Leverage complex joins, aggregations, or other data manipulation techniques defined in
the query.

For example, if you have a `Customers` entity in your application with fields like
`Name`, `Email`, and `PhoneNumber`. You can connect a table component to this entity and
choose a pre-defined `ActiveCustomers` data action that filters the customers based on their status.
This allows you to display only the active customers in the table, rather than the entire
customer database.

##### Adding parameters to an entity data source

When using an entity as the data source, you can also add parameters to the component.
These parameters can be used to filter, sort, or transform the data displayed in the
component.

For example, if you have a `Products` entity with fields like `Name`, `Description`, `Price`, and
`Category`. You can add a parameter named `category` to a table component that displays the
product list. When users select a category from a dropdown, the table will automatically
update to show only the products belonging to the selected category, using the
`{{params.category}}` expression in the data action.

#### Expression

Select **Expression** as the data source to enter custom expressions or
calculations to generate the data for the component dynamically. This is useful when you need
to perform transformations, combine data from multiple sources, or generate data based on
specific business logic.

When to use the **Expression** data source:

- When you need to calculate or derive data that is not directly available in your data
model (e.g., calculating the total order value based on quantity and price).

- When you want to combine data from multiple entities or data sources to create a
composite view (e.g., displaying a customer's order history along with their contact
information).

- When you need to generate data based on specific rules or conditions (e.g., displaying a
"Recommended Products" list based on the user's browsing history).

For example, if you have a `Metrics` component that needs to display the total revenue for the
current month, you can use an expression like the following to calculate and display the monthly revenue:

```

{{ui.table1.orders.concat(ui.table1.orderDetails).filter(o => o.orderDate.getMonth() === new Date().getMonth()).reduce((a, b) => a + (b.quantity * b.unitPrice), 0)}}
```

##### Automation

Select **Automation** as the data source to connect the component to an
existing automation or workflow in your application. This is useful when the data or
functionality for the component is generated or updated as part of a specific process or
workflow.

When to use the **Automation** data source:

- When the data displayed in the component is the result of a specific automation or
workflow (e.g., a "Pending Approvals" table that is updated as part of an approval
process).

- When you want to trigger actions or updates to the component based on events or
conditions within an automation (e.g., updating a Metrics with the latest sales figures
for a SKU).

- When you need to integrate the component with other services or systems in your
application through an automation (e.g., fetching data from a third-party API and displaying
it in a table).

For example, if you have a stepflow component that guides users through a job application process. The
stepflow component can be connected to an automation that handles the job application submission,
background checks, and offer generation. As the automation progresses through these steps, the
stepflow component can dynamically update to reflect the current status of the
application.

By carefully selecting the appropriate data source for each component, you can ensure
that your application's user interface is powered by the right data and logic, providing a
seamless and engaging experience for your users.

### Visible if

Use the **Visible if** property to show or hide components or elements based on specific
conditions or data values. This is useful when you want to dynamically control the visibility of
certain parts of your application's user interface.

The **Visible if** property uses the following syntax:

```nohighlight

{{expression ? true : false}}
```

or

```nohighlight

{{expression}}
```

Where `expression` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either
`true` or `false`.

If the expression evaluates to `true`, the component will be visible. If the
expression evaluates to `false`, the component will be hidden. The expression can
reference values from other components, data sources, or variables within your
application.

#### Visible if expression examples

##### Example: Showing or hiding a password input field based on an email input

Imagine you have a login form with an email input field and a password input field. You
want to show the password input field only if the user has entered an email address. You can
use the following Visible if expression:

```

{{ui.emailInput.value !== ""}}
```

This expression checks if the value of the `emailInput` component is not an
empty string. If the user has entered an email address, the expression evaluates to
`true`, and the password input field will be visible. If the email field is empty,
the expression evaluates to `false`, and the password input field will be
hidden.

##### Example: Displaying additional form fields based on a dropdown selection

Let's say you have a form where users can select a category from a dropdown list.
Depending on the category selected, you want to show or hide additional form fields to gather
more specific information.

For example, if the user selects the `Products` category, you can use the following
expression to show an additional `Product Details` field:

```nohighlight

{{ui.categoryDropdown.value === "Products"}}
```

If the user selects the `Services` or `Consulting` categories, you can use this expression
to show a different set of additional fields:

```nohighlight

{{ui.categoryDropdown.value === "Services" || ui.categoryDropdown.value === "Consulting"}}
```

##### Examples: Other

To make the component visible if the `textInput1` component's value is not an
empty string:

```

{{ui.textInput1.value === "" ? false : true}}
```

To make the component always visible:

```

{{true}}
```

To make the component visible if the `emailInput` component's value is not an
empty string:

```

{{ui.emailInput.value !== ""}}
```

### Disabled if

The **Disabled if** feature allows you to conditionally enable or disable a component based on
specific conditions or data values. This is achieved by using the **Disabled if** property, which
accepts a boolean expression that determines whether the component should be enabled or
disabled.

The **Disabled if** property uses the following syntax:

```

{{expression ? true : false}}
```

or

```

{{expression}}
```

#### Disabled if expression examples

##### Example: Disabling a submit button based on form validation

If you have a form with multiple input fields, and you want to disable the submit
button until all required fields are filled out correctly, you can use the following **Disabled**
**If** expression:

```

{{ui.nameInput.value === "" || ui.emailInput.value === "" || ui.passwordInput.value === ""}}
```

This expression checks if any of the required input fields ( `nameInput`, `emailInput`,
`passwordInput`) are empty. If any of the fields are empty, the expression evaluates to `true`, and
the submit button will be disabled. Once all the required fields are filled out, the expression
evaluates to `false`, and the submit button will be enabled.

By using these types of conditional expressions in the **Visible if** and **Disabled ff**
properties, you can create dynamic and responsive user interfaces that adapt to user input,
providing a more streamlined and relevant experience for your application's users.

Where `expression` is a boolean expression that evaluates to
either true or false.

Example:

```

{{ui.textInput1.value === "" ? true : false}}: The component will be Disabled if the textInput1 component's value is an empty string.
{{!ui.nameInput.isValid || !ui.emailInput.isValid || !ui.passwordInput.isValid}}: The component will be Disabled if any of the named input fields are invalid.
```

#### Container layouts

The layout properties determine how the content or elements within a component are
arranged and positioned. Several layout options are available, each represented by an
icon:

- **Column Layout**: This layout arranges the content or elements
vertically, in a single column.

- **Two column layout**: This layout divides the component into two
equal-width columns, allowing you to position content or elements side by side.

- **Row layout**: This layout arranges the content or elements
horizontally, in a single row.

##### Orientation

- **Horizontal**: This layout arranges the content or elements
horizontally, in a single row.

- **Vertical**: This layout arranges the content or elements vertically,
in a single column.

- **Inline wrapped**: This layout arranges the content or elements
horizontally, but wraps to the next line if the elements exceed the available width.

##### Alignment

- **Left**: Aligns the content or elements to the left side of the
component.

- **Center**: Centers the content or elements horizontally within the
component.

- **Right**: Aligns the content or elements to the right side of the
component.

##### Width

The **Width** property specifies the horizontal size of the component. You can
enter a percentage value between 0% and 100%, representing the component's width relative to
its parent container or the available space.

##### Height

The **Height** property specifies the vertical size of the component. The "auto"
value adjusts the component's height automatically based on its content or the available
space.

##### Space between

The **Space between** property determines the spacing or gap between the content or elements
within the component. You can select a value from 0px (no spacing) to 64px, with increments of
4px (e.g., 4px, 8px, 12px, etc.).

##### Padding

The **Padding** property controls the space between the content or elements and the edges of
the component. You can select a value from 0px (no padding) to 64px, with increments of 4px
(e.g., 4px, 8px, 12px, etc.).

##### Background

The **Background** enables or disables a background color or style for the
component.

These layout properties provide flexibility in arranging and positioning the content
within a component, as well as controlling the size, spacing, and visual appearance of the
component itself.

## Data components

This section covers the various data components available in the application studio,
including the **Table**, **Detail**, **Metric**, **Form**, and **Repeater** components.
These components are used to display, gather, and manipulate data within your application.

### Table

The **Table** component displays data in a tabular format, with rows and columns. It is used
to present structured data, such as lists of items or records from a database, in an organized
and easy-to-read manner.

#### Table properties

The **Table** component shares several common properties with other components, such as
`Name`, `Source`, and `Actions`. For more information on these properties, see
[Common component properties](#common-properties).

In addition to the common properties, the **Table** component has specific properties and
configuration options, including `Columns`, `Search and export`, and `Expressions`.

##### Columns

In this section, you can define the columns to be displayed in the table. Each column
can be configured with the following properties:

- **Format**: The data type of the field, for example: text, number, date.

- **Column label**: The header text for the column.

- **Value**: The field from the data source that should be displayed in
this column.

This field allows you to specify the value or expression that should be displayed in
the column cells. You can use expressions to reference data from the connected source or
other components.

Example: `{{currentRow.title}}` \- This expression will display the value of
the `title` field from the current row in the column cells.

- **Enable sorting**: This toggle allows you to enable or disable
sorting functionality for the specific column. When enabled, users can sort the table data
based on the values in this column.

##### Search and export

The **Table** component provides the following toggles to enable or disable search and
export functionality:

- **Show search** When enabled, this toggle adds a search input field
to the table, allowing users to search and filter the displayed data.

- **Show export** When enabled, this toggle adds an export option to
the table, allowing users to download the table data in various formats, for example: CSV.

###### Note

By default, the search functionality is limited to the data that has been loaded into
the table. To use search exhaustively, you will need to load all pages of data.

##### Rows per page

You can specify the number of rows to be displayed per page in the table. Users can
then navigate between pages to view the full dataset.

##### Pre-fetch limit

Specify the maximum number of records to pre-fetch in each query request. The maximum is 3000.

##### Actions

In the **Actions** section, configure the following properties:

- **Action location**: When **Pin to right** is enabled, any added actions will
always show on the right of the table, regardless of user scrolling.

- **Actions**: Add action buttons to the table. You can configure these buttons to do specified
actions when clicked by a user, such as:

- Run a component action

- Navigate to a different page

- Invoke a data action

- Run custom JavaScript

- Invoke an automation

##### Expressions

The **Table** component provides several areas to use expressions and row-level action
capabilities that allow you to customize and enhance the table's functionality and
interactivity. They allow you to dynamically reference and display data within the table. By
leveraging these expression fields, you can create dynamic columns, pass data to row-level
actions, and reference table data from other components or expressions within your
application.

##### Examples: Referencing row values

`{{currentRow.columnName}}` or `{{currentRow["Column Name"]}}`
These expressions allow you to reference the value of a specific column for the current row
being rendered. Replace `columnName` or `Column Name` with the actual name of the column you
want to reference.

Examples:

- `{{currentRow.productName}}` Displays the product name for the current
row.

- `{{currentRow["Supplier Name"]}}` Displays the supplier name for the
current row, where the column header is `Supplier Name`.

- `{{currentRow.orderDate}}` Displays the order date for the current
row.

##### Examples: Referencing selected row

`{{ui.table1.selectedRow["columnName"]}}` This expression allows you to
reference the value of a specific column for the currently selected row in the table with
the ID `table1`. Replace `table1` with the actual ID of your table component, and
`columnName` with the name of the column you want to reference.

Examples:

- `{{ui.ordersTable.selectedRow["totalAmount"]}}` Displays the total amount
for the currently selected row in the table with the ID `ordersTable`.

- `{{ui.customersTable.selectedRow["email"]}}` Displays the email address
for the currently selected row in the table with the ID `customersTable`.

- `{{ui.employeesTable.selectedRow["department"]}}` Displays the department
for the currently selected row in the table with the ID `employeesTable`.

##### Examples: Creating custom columns

You can add custom columns to a table based on data returned from the underlying data action,
automation, or expression. You can use existing column values and JavaScript expressions to
create new columns.

Examples:

- `{{currentRow.quantity * currentRow.unitPrice}}` Creates a new column
displaying the total price by multiplying the quantity and unit price columns.

- `{{new Date(currentRow.orderDate).toLocaleDateString()}}` Creates a new
column displaying the order date in a more readable format.

- `{{currentRow.firstName + ' ' + currentRow.lastName + ' (' + currentRow.email +
             ')' }}` Creates a new column displaying the full name and email address for each
row.

##### Examples: Customizing column display values:

You can customize the display value of a field within a table column by setting the
`Value` field of the column mapping. This allows you to apply custom formatting or
transformations to the displayed data.

Examples:

- `{{ currentRow.rating >= 4 ? '⭐️'.repeat(currentRow.rating) : currentRow.rating
             }}` Displays star emojis based on the rating value for each row.

- `{{ currentRow.category.toLowerCase().replace(/\b\w/g, c => c.toUpperCase())
             }}` Displays the category value with each word capitalized for each row.

- `{{ currentRow.status === 'Active' ? '🟢 Active' : '🔴 Inactive' }}`:
Displays a colored circle emoji and text based on the status value for each row.

##### Row-level button actions

`{{currentRow.columnName}}` or `{{currentRow["Column Name"]}}`
You can use these expressions to pass the referenced row's context within a row-level
action, such as navigating to another page with the selected row's data or triggering an
automation with the row's data.

Examples:

- If you have an edit button in the row action column, you can pass
`{{currentRow.orderId}}` as a parameter to navigate to an order editing page
with the selected order's ID.

- If you have a delete button in the row action column, you can pass
`{{currentRow.customerName}}` to an automation that sends a confirmation email
to the customer before deleting their order.

- If you have a view details button in the row action column, you can pass
`{{currentRow.employeeId}}` to an automation that logs the employee who viewed
the order details.

By leveraging these expression fields and row-level action capabilities, you can create
highly customized and interactive tables that display and manipulate data based on your
specific requirements. Additionally, you can connect row-level actions with other components
or automations within your application, enabling seamless data flow and
functionality.

### Detail

The **Detail** component is designed to display detailed information about a specific record
or item. It provides a dedicated space for presenting comprehensive data related to a single
entity or row, making it ideal for showcasing in-depth details or facilitating data entry and
editing tasks.

#### Detail properties

The **Detail** component shares several common properties with other components, such as
`Name`, `Source`, and `Actions`. For more information on these properties, see
[Common component properties](#common-properties).

The **Detail** component also has specific properties and configuration options, including
`Fields`, `Layout`, and `Expressions`.

#### Layout

The **Layout** section allows you to customize the arrangement and presentation of the fields
within the **Detail** component. You can configure options such as:

- **Number of columns**: Specify the number of columns to display the
fields in.

- **Field ordering**: Drag and drop fields to reorder their
appearance.

- **Spacing and alignment**: Adjust the spacing and alignment of fields
within the component.

#### Expressions and examples

The **Detail** component provides various expression fields that allow you to reference and
display data within the component dynamically. These expressions enable you to create
customized and interactive **Detail** components that seamlessly connect with your application's
data and logic.

##### Example: Referencing data

`{{ui.details.data[0]?.["colName"]}}`: This expression allows you to
reference the value of the column named "colName" for the first item (index 0) in the data
array connected to the **Detail** component with the ID "details". Replace "colName" with the
actual name of the column you want to reference. For example, the following expression will display the value of the "customerName" column for the first item in the data array
connected to the "details" component:

```

{{ui.details.data[0]?.["customerName"]}}
```

###### Note

This expression is useful when the **Detail** component is on the same page as the table
being referenced, and you want to display data from the first row of the table in the **Detail**
component.

##### Example: Conditional rendering

`{{ui.table1.selectedRow["colName"]}}`: This expression returns true if the
selected row in the table with the ID `table1` has data for the column named `colName`. It
can be used to conditionally show or hide the **Detail** component based on whether the table's
selected row is empty or not.

Example:

You can use this expression in the `Visible if` property of the **Detail** component to
conditionally show or hide it based on the selected row in the table.

```

{{ui.table1.selectedRow["customerName"]}}
```

If this expression evaluates to true (the selected row in the `table1` component
has a value for the `customerName` column), the **Detail** component will be visible. If the
expression evaluates to false (i.e., the selected row is empty or does not have a value for
"customerName"), the **Detail** component will be hidden.

##### Example: Conditional display

`{{(ui.Component.value === "green" ? "🟢" : ui.Component.value === "yellow" ? "🟡"
        : ui.detail1.data?.[0]?.CustomerStatus)}}`: This expression conditionally displays an
emoji based on the value of a component or data field.

Breakdown:

- `ui.Component.value`: References the value of a component with the ID
`Component`.

- `=== "green"`: Checks if the component's value is equal to the string
"green".

- `? "🟢"`: If the condition is true, displays the green circle emoji.

- `: ui.Component.value === "yellow" ? "🟡"`: If the first condition is
false, checks if the component's value is equal to the string "yellow".

- `? "🟡"`: If the second condition is true, displays the yellow square
emoji.

- `: ui.detail1.data?.[0]?.CustomerStatus`: If both conditions are false, it
references the "CustomerStatus" value of the first item in the data array connected to the
Detail component with the ID "detail1".

This expression can be used to display an emoji or a specific value based on the value
of a component or data field within the **Detail** component.

### Metrics

The **Metrics** component is a visual element that displays key metrics or data points in
a card-like format. It is designed to provide a concise and visually appealing way to present
important information or performance indicators.

#### Metrics properties

The **Metrics** component shares several common properties with other components, such as
`Name`, `Source`, and `Actions`. For more information on these properties, see
[Common component properties](#common-properties).

#### Trend

The Metrics's trend feature allows you to display a visual indicator of the
performance or change over time for the metric being displayed.

##### Trend value

This field allows you to specify the value or expression that should be used to
determine the trend direction and magnitude. Typically, this would be a value that represents
the change or performance over a specific time period.

Example:

```

{{ui.salesMetrics.data?.[0]?.monthOverMonthRevenue}}
```

This expression retrieves the month-over-month revenue value from the first item in the
data connected to the "salesMetrics" Metrics.

##### Positive trend

This field allows you to enter an expression that defines the condition for a positive
trend. The expression should evaluate to true or false.

Example:

```

{{ui.salesMetrics.data?.[0]?.monthOverMonthRevenue > 0}}
```

This expression checks if the month-over-month revenue value is greater than 0,
indicating a positive trend.

##### Negative trend

This field allows you to enter an expression that defines the condition for a negative
trend. The expression should evaluate to true or false.

Example:

```

{{ui.salesMetrics.data?.[0]?.monthOverMonthRevenue < 0}}
```

This expression checks if the month-over-month revenue value is less than 0, indicating
a negative trend.

##### Color bar

This toggle allows you to enable or disable the display of a colored bar to visually
indicate the trend status.

##### Color Bar examples:

##### Example: Sales metrics trend

- **Trend value**:
`{{ui.salesMetrics.data?.[0]?.monthOverMonthRevenue}}`

- **Positive trend**:
`{{ui.salesMetrics.data?.[0]?.monthOverMonthRevenue > 0}}`

- **Negative trend**:
`{{ui.salesMetrics.data?.[0]?.monthOverMonthRevenue < 0}}`

- **Color bar**: Enabled

##### Example: inventory metrics trend

- **Trend value**:
`{{ui.inventoryMetrics.data?.[0]?.currentInventory -
             ui.inventoryMetrics.data?.[1]?.currentInventory}}`

- **Positive trend**:

secondary value, and value caption to dynamically display a value.

##### Example: Referencing primary value

`{{ui.metric1.primaryValue}}`: This expression allows you to reference the
primary value of the **Metrics** component with the ID `metric1` from other components or
expressions within the same page.

Example: `{{ui.salesMetrics.primaryValue}}` will display the primary value of
the `salesMetrics` **Metrics** component.

##### Example: Referencing secondary value

`{{ui.metric1.secondaryValue}}`: This expression allows you to reference the
secondary value of the **Metrics** component with the ID `metric1` from other components or
expressions within the same page.

Example: `{{ui.revenueMetrics.secondaryValue}}` will display the secondary
value of the `revenueMetrics` **Metrics** component.

##### Example: Referencing data

`{{ui.metric1.data}}`: This expression allows you to reference the data of
the **Metrics** component with the ID `metric1` from other components or expressions within the
same page.

value of the first item in the data connected to the `orderMetrics` **Metrics** component.

##### Example: Displaying data length

`{{ui.metric1.data?.length}}`: This expression demonstrates how to display
the length (number of items) in the data connected to the **Metrics** component with the ID
`metric1`. It is useful when you want to display the number of items in the data.

Breakdown:

- `ui.metric1.data`: References the data set connected to the
component.

- `?.length`: Accesses the total count or number of items or entries in that
data set.

Example: `{{ui.productMetrics.data?.length}}` will display the number of
items in the data connected to the `productMetrics` **Metrics** component.

### Repeater

The **Repeater** component is a dynamic component that allows you to generate and display a
collection of elements based on a provided data source. It is designed to facilitate the
creation of lists, grids, or repeating patterns within your application's user interface. A few
example use cases include:

- Displaying a card for each user in an account

- Showing a list of products that include images and a button to add it to the cart

- Showing a list of files the user can access

The **Repeater** component differentiates itself from the **Table** component with rich content. A
**Table** component has a strict row and column format. The **Repeater** can display your data more flexibly.

#### Repeater properties

The **Repeater** component shares several common properties with other components, such as
`Name`, `Source`, and `Actions`. For more information on these properties, see
[Common component properties](#common-properties).

In addition to the common properties, the **Repeater** component has the following additional properties and
configuration options.

#### Item template

The **Item template** is a container where you can define the structure and components that
will be repeated for each item in the data source. You can drag and drop other components into
this container, such as **Text**, **Image**, **Button**, or any other component you need to represent each
item.

Within the **Item template**, you can reference properties or values from the current item
using expressions in the format `{{currentItem.propertyName}}`.

For example, if your data source contains an `itemName` property, you can use
`{{currentItem.itemName}}` to display the item name(s) of the current item.

#### Layout

The **Layout** section allows you to configure the arrangement of the repeated elements
within the Repeater Component.

##### Orientation

- **List**: Arranges the repeated elements vertically in a single
column.

- **Grid**: Arranges the repeated elements in a grid layout with
multiple columns.

##### Rows per page

Specify the number of rows to display per page in the list layout. Pagination is
provided for items that overflow the specified number of rows.

##### Columns and Rows per Page (Grid)

- **Columns**: Specify the number of columns in the grid layout.

- **Rows per Page**: Specify the number of rows to display per page in
the grid layout. Pagination is provided for items that overflow the specified grid
dimensions.

#### Expressions and examples

The **Repeater** component provides various expression fields that allow you to reference and
display data within the component dynamically. These expressions enable you to create
customized and interactive **Repeater** components that seamlessly connect with your application's
data and logic.

##### Example: Referencing items

- `{{currentItem.propertyName}}`: Reference properties or values from the
current item within the **Item Template**.

- `{{ui.repeaterID[index]}}`: Reference a specific item in the Repeater
Component by its index.

##### Example: Rendering a list of products

- **Source**: Select the `Products` entity as the data source.

- **Item Template**: Add a **Container** component with a **Text** component
inside to display the product name ( `{{currentItem.productName}}`) and an **Image**
component to display the product image
( `{{currentItem.productImageUrl}}`).

- **Layout**: Set the `Orientation` to `List` and adjust the `Rows per Page`
as desired.

##### Example: Generating a grid of user avatars

- **Source**: Use an expression to generate an array of user data
(e.g., `[{name: 'John', avatarUrl: '...'}, {...}, {...}]`).

- **Item Template**: Add an **Image** component and set its `Source` property
to `{{currentItem.avatarUrl}}`.

- **Layout**: Set the `Orientation` to `Grid`, specify the number of
`Columns` and `Rows per Page`, and adjust the `Space Between` and `Padding` as needed.

By using the `Repeater` component, you can create dynamic and data-driven user
interfaces, streamlining the process of rendering collections of elements and reducing the need
for manual repetition or hard-coding.

### Form

The Form component is designed to capture user input and facilitate data entry tasks within
