# Automation actions reference
<a name="automations-actions-reference"></a>

The following is the reference documentation for automation actions used in App Studio.

An automation action, commonly referred to as an **action**, is an individual step of logic that make up an automation. Each action performs a specific task, whether it's sending an email, creating a data record, invoking a Lambda function, or calling APIs. Actions are added to automations from the action library, and can be grouped into conditional statements or loops.

For information about creating and configuring automations and their actions, see the topics in [Automations and actions: Define your app's business logic](automations.md).

## Invoke API
<a name="automations-actions-reference-invoke-API"></a>

Invokes an HTTP REST API request. Builders can use this action to send requests from App Studio to other systems or services with APIs. For example, you could use it to connect to third-party systems or homegrown applications to access business critical data, or invoke API endpoints that cannot be called by dedicated App Studio actions.

For more information about REST APIs, see [What is a RESTful API?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/).

### Properties
<a name="automations-actions-reference-invoke-API-properties"></a>

#### Connector
<a name="automations-actions-reference-invoke-API-properties-connector"></a>

The **Connector** to use for the API requests made by this action. The connector dropdown only contains connectors of the following types: `API Connector` and `OpenAPI Connector`. Depending on how the connector is configured, it can contain important information such as credentials and default headers or query parameters.

For more information about API connectors, including a comparison between using `API Connector` and `OpenAPI Connector`, see [Connect to third-party services](add-connector-third-party.md).

#### API request configuration properties
<a name="automations-actions-reference-invoke-API-properties-request-config"></a>

Choose **Configure API request** from the properties panel to open the request configuration dialog box. If an **API connector** is selected, the dialog box will include connector information.

**Method:** The method for the API call. Possible values are as follows:
+ `DELETE`: Deletes a specified resource.
+ `GET`: Retrieves information or data.
+ `HEAD`: Retrieves only the headers of a response without the body.
+ `POST`: Submits data to be processed.
+ `PUSH`: Submits data to be processed.
+ `PATCH`: Partially updates a specified resource.

**Path:** The relative path to the resource.

**Headers:** Any headers in the form of key-value pairs to be sent with the API request. If a connector is selected, its configured headers will be automatically added and cannot be removed. The configured headers cannot be edited, but you can override them by adding another header with the same name.

**Query parameters:** Any query parameters in the form of key-value pairs to be sent with the API request. If a connector is selected, its configured query parameters will be automatically added and cannot be edited or removed.

**Body:** Information to be sent with the API request in JSON format. There is no body for `GET` requests.

#### Mocked output
<a name="automations-actions-reference-invoke-API-properties-mocked-output"></a>

Actions do not interact with external services or resources in the preview environment. The **Mocked output** field is used to provide a JSON expression that simulates the behavior of a connector in the preview environment for testing purposes. This snippet is stored in the action's `results` map, just like the connector response would be for a published app in the live environment.

With this field, you can test various scenarios and their impact on other actions within the automation such as simulating different result values, error scenarios, edge cases, or unhappy paths without communicating with external services through connectors.

## Invoke AWS
<a name="automations-actions-reference-invoke-aws"></a>

Invokes an operation from an AWS service. This is a general action for calling AWS services or operations, and should be used if there is not a dedicated action for the desired AWS service or operation.

The **Mocked output** field is used to provide a JSON expression that simulates the behavior of a connector in the preview environment for testing purposes. This snippet is stored in the action's `results` map, just like the connector response would be for a published app in the live environment.

With this field, you can test various scenarios and their impact on other actions within the automation such as simulating different result values, error scenarios, edge cases, or unhappy paths without communicating with external services through connectors.

## Loop
<a name="automations-actions-reference-loop"></a>

Runs nested actions repeatedly to iterate through a list of items, one item at a time. For example, add the [Create record](#automations-actions-reference-create-record) action to a loop action to create multiple records.

The loop action can be nested within other loops or condition actions. The loop actions are run sequentially, and not in parallel. The results of each action within the loop can only be accessed to subsequent actions within the same loop iteration. They cannot be accessed outside of the loop or in different iterations of the loop.

### Properties
<a name="automations-actions-reference-loop-properties"></a>

#### Source
<a name="automations-actions-reference-loop-properties-source"></a>

+ A list of strings: `{{["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"]}}`
+ A computed value: `{{params.{{actionName}}.split("\n")}}`

#### Current item name
<a name="automations-actions-reference-loop-properties-function-name"></a>

The name of the variable that can be used to reference the current item being iterated. The current item name is configurable so that you can nest two or more loops and access variables from each loop. For example, if you are looping through countries and cities with two loops, you could configure and reference `currentCountry` and `currentCity`.

## Condition
<a name="automations-actions-reference-condition"></a>

Runs actions based on the result of one or more specified logical conditions that are evaluated when the automation is run. The condition action is made up of the following components:
+ A *condition* field, which is used to provide a JavaScript expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
+ A *true branch*, which contains actions that are run if the condition evalutes to `true`.
+ A *false branch*, which contains actions that are run if the condition evalutes to `false`.

Add actions to the true and false branches by dragging them into the condition action.

<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-prompt-properties-request-settings"></a>

Configure various request settings and model inference parameters. You can configure the following settings:
+ **Temperature**: The temperature to be used by the Amazon Bedrock model when processing the request. The temperature determines the randomness or creativity of the Bedrock model's output. The higher the temperature, the more creative and less analytical the response will be. Possible values are `[0-10]`.
+ **Max Tokens**: Limit the length of the output of the Amazon Bedrock model.
+ **TopP**: In nucleus sampling, the model computes the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cuts it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by the **TopP**. You should alter either **temperature** or **TopP**, but not both
+ **Stop Sequences**: Sequences that cause the model to stop processing the request and generating output.

For more information, see [Inference request parameters and response fields for foundation models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html) in the *Amazon Bedrock User Guide*.

#### Stop Sequences
<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-prompt-properties-guardrail"></a>

Enter an Amazon Bedrock Guardrail **ID** and **Version**. Guardrails are used to implement safeguards based on your use cases and responsible AI policies. For more information, see [Stop harmful content in models using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) in the *Amazon Bedrock User Guide*.

#### Mocked output
<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-prompt-properties-mocked-output"></a>

Actions do not interact with external services or resources in the preview environment. The **Mocked output** field is used to provide a JSON expression that simulates the behavior of a connector in the preview environment for testing purposes. This snippet is stored in the action's `results` map, just like the connector response would be for a published app in the live environment.

With this field, you can test various scenarios and their impact on other actions within the automation such as simulating different result values, error scenarios, edge cases, or unhappy paths without communicating with external services through connectors.

## Amazon Bedrock: Invoke model
<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-invoke-model"></a>

Uses the [Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.html) operation to run inference using the prompt and inference parameters provided in the request body. You use model inference to generate text, images, and embeddings.

### Properties
<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-invoke-model-properties"></a>

#### Connector
<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-invoke-model-properties-connector"></a>

The connector to be used for the operations run by this action. To use this action successfully, the connector must be configured with **Amazon Bedrock Runtime** as the service. The configured connector should be set up with the proper credentials to run the operation, and other configuration information, such as the AWS region that contains any resources referenced in the operation.

#### Configuration
<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-invoke-model-properties-configuration"></a>

The content of the request to be used in the `InvokeModel` command.

**Note**
For more information about the `Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel` operation, including example commands, see [InvokeModel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_DetectDocumentText.html) in the *Amazon Bedrock API Reference*.

#### Mocked output
<a name="automations-actions-reference-bedrock-invoke-model-properties-mocked-output"></a>
