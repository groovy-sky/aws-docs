# Importing applications

You can import a copy of an exported application to your App Studio instance. You can import apps that
have been exported from other App Studio instances, or apps from a catalog provided by App Studio. Importing an app from the App Studio app catalog can help
you get started on an app with similar functionality, or help you learn about app building in App Studio by exploring the imported app.

When you import an app into your instance, a copy of the original app is created in your instance. After the new app is created, you are navigated
to the Development environment of the app, where you can preview it and browse the app's functionality.

###### Warning

When you import an app, you are importing all of the logic from the application, which could result in undesired or unexpected
behavior. For example, there could be destructive queries that delete data from databases you connect to the application. We recommend thoroughly reviewing the application and its
configuration, and testing it on non-production assets before connecting production data to it.

###### To import an application

1. In the navigation pane, choose **My applications** in the **Build** section to navigate
    to a list of your applications.

2. Choose the dropdown arrow next to **\+ Create app**.

3. Choose **Import app**.

4. In the **Import app** dialog box, in **Import code**, enter the import code
    of the application that you want to import.
    For a list of apps provided by App Studio that can be imported, including app descriptions and import codes,
    see [Importable apps provided by App Studio](#app-catalog).

5. Choose **Import** to import the app and go to the Development environment of the imported app to view or edit it.
    For information building apps in App Studio, see [How AWS App Studio works](how-it-works.md)
