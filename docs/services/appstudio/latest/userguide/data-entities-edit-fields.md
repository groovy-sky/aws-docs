<a name="data-entities-edit-fields"></a>

**Tip**
You can press CTRL\+Z to undo the most recent change to your entity.

1. If necessary, navigate to the entity you want to edit.

1. In the **Configuration** tab, in **Fields**, you view a table of your entity's fields. Entity fields have the following columns:
   + **Display name:** The display name is similar to a table header or form field and is viewable by application users. It can contain spaces and special characters but must be unique within an entity.
   + **System name:** The system name is a unique identifier used in code to reference a field. When mapping to a column in an Amazon Redshift table, it must match the Amazon Redshift table column name.
   + **Data type:** The type of data that will be stored within this field, such as `Integer`, `Boolean`, or `String`.
