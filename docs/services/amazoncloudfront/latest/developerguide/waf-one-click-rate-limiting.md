# Set up rate limiting

Rate limiting is one of the recommendations you may receive when configuring security
protections.

CloudFront always enables rate limiting in monitor mode. When monitor mode is enabled, CloudFront
captures metrics that tell you if the rate you configured in the **Rate**
**limiting** field has been exceeded, how often, and by how much.

After you save the distribution, CloudFront starts to collect data based on the number in the
**Rate limiting** field.

You can enable or manage the rate limiting settings in the **Security - Web**
**Application Firewall (WAF)** section on the **Security** tab of any
CloudFront distribution.

###### Note

The **Rate limiting** option only appears in the CloudFront console if you
specified a non-S3 custom origin for your distribution. Otherwise, you will only see the
**Core protections** enabled for the distribution. For more information about
origin types, see [Use various origins with CloudFront distributions](downloaddists3andcustomorigins.md).

###### To set up rate limiting

1. Open the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributions**, and then choose the
    distribution that you want to change.

3. Choose the **Security** tab.

4. In the **Security – Web Application Firewall (WAF)** section,
    choose **Edit**.

5. Under **Additional protections**, select **Rate**
**limiting**. You can optionally change the rate limit. When you have fine-tuned the
    rate, choose **Save changes**.

6. In the **Security – Web Application Firewall (WAF)** section, next
    to **Rate limiting**, you can choose **Monitor mode** and
    then choose **Enable blocking** to deactivate monitor mode. CloudFront will start to
    block requests that exceed the specified rate limit.
