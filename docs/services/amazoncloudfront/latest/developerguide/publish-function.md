# Publish functions

When you publish your function, this copies the function from the `DEVELOPMENT`
stage to the `LIVE` stage.

If cache behaviors aren't associated with the function, publishing it enables you to
associate it with a cache behavior. You can only associate cache behaviors with functions
that are in the `LIVE` stage.

###### Important

- Before you publish, we recommend that you [test\
the function](test-function.md).

- After you publish the function, all cache behaviors that are associated with
that function automatically start using the newly published copy, as soon as the
distributions finish deploying.

You can publish a function in the CloudFront console or with the
AWS CLI.

Console

###### To publish a function

1. Sign in to the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home#/functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home) and choose the
    **Functions** page.

2. Choose the function to update.

3. Choose the **Publish** tab and then choose
    **Publish**. If your function is already attached
    to one or more cache behaviors, choose **Publish and**
**update**.

4. (Optional) To see the distributions that are associated with the
    function, choose **Associated CloudFront distributions** to
    expand that section.

When successful, a banner appears at the top of the page that says
**`Function name` published**
**successfully**. You can also choose the **Build**
tab and then choose **Live** to see the live version of the
function code.

CLI

###### To publish a function

1. Open a command line window.

2. Run the following **aws cloudfront publish-function**
    command. In the example, line breaks are provided to make the example
    more readable.

```bash

aws cloudfront publish-function \
       --name MaxAge \
       --if-match ETVXYZEXAMPLE
```

When the command is successful, you see output like the
    following.

```bash
