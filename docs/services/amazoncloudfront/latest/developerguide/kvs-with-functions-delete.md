# Delete a key value store

You can delete your key value store by using the Amazon CloudFront console or API.

Console

###### To delete a key value store

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the
    **Functions** page in the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home#/functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. Choose the function name.

3. Under the **Associated KeyValueStore**

    choose **Remove association**.

4. In the navigation pane, choose the
    **Functions** page and then choose the
    **KeyValueStores** tab.

    choose **Delete**.
