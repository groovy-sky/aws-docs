## Timing of log file delivery

CloudFront delivers logs for a distribution up to several times an hour. In general, a log
file contains information about the requests that CloudFront received during a given time
period. CloudFront usually delivers the log file for that time period to your destination
within an hour of the events that appear in the log. Note, however, that some or all log
file entries for a time period can sometimes be delayed by up to 24 hours. When log
entries are delayed, CloudFront saves them in a log file for which the file name includes the
date and time of the period in which the requests _occurred_, not the
date and time when the file was delivered.

When creating a log file, CloudFront consolidates information for your distribution from all
of the edge locations that received requests for your objects during the time period
that the log file covers.

CloudFront can save more than one file for a time period depending on how many requests CloudFront
receives for the objects associated with a distribution.

CloudFront begins to reliably deliver access logs about four hours after you enable logging.
You might get a few access logs before that time.

###### Note

If no users request your objects during the time period, you don't receive any log
files for that period.

## How requests are logged when the request URL or headers exceed the maximum size

If the total size of all request headers, including cookies, exceeds 20 KB, or if the
URL exceeds 8192 bytes, CloudFront can't parse the request completely and can't log the
request. Because the request isn't logged, you won't see in the log files the HTTP error
status code returned.

If the request body exceeds the maximum size, the request is logged, including the
HTTP error status code.

## Log file fields

The log file for a distribution contains 33 fields. The following list contains each
field name, in order, along with a description of the information in that field.

01. **`date`**

    The date on which the event occurred in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
     For example, `2019-06-30`. The date and time are in Coordinated
     Universal Time (UTC). For WebSocket connections, this is the date when the
     connection closed.

02. **`time`**

    The time when the CloudFront server finished responding to the request (in UTC), for
     example, `01:42:39`. For WebSocket connections, this is the time when
     the connection is closed.

03. **`x-edge-location`**

    The edge location that served the request. Each edge location is
     identified by a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number (for
     example, DFW3). The three-letter code typically corresponds with the
     International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code for an airport
     near the edge location's geographic location. (These abbreviations might
     change in the future.)

04. **`sc-bytes`**

    The total number of bytes that the server sent to the viewer in
     response to the request, including headers. For WebSocket and gRPC connections, this
     is the total number of bytes sent from the server to the client through the
     connection.

05. **`c-ip`**

    The IP address of the viewer that made the request, for example,
     `192.0.2.183` or `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`. If the
     viewer used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, the value of this
     field is the IP address of the proxy or load balancer. See also the
     `x-forwarded-for` field.

06. **`cs-method`**

    The HTTP request method received from the viewer.

07. **`cs(Host)`**

    The domain name of the CloudFront distribution (for example,
     d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net).

08. **`cs-uri-stem`**

    The portion of the request URL that identifies the path and object
     (for example, `/images/cat.jpg`). Question marks (?) in URLs and query strings are
     not included in the log.

09. **`sc-status`**

    Contains one of the following values:

- The HTTP status code of the server's response (for example,
`200`).

- `000`, which indicates that the viewer closed the
connection before the server could respond to the request. If the viewer
closes the connection after the server starts to send the response, this
field contains the HTTP status code of the response that the server
started to send.

10. **`cs(Referer)`**

    The value of the `Referer` header in the request. This is the
     name of the domain that originated the request. Common referrers include
     search engines, other websites that link directly to your objects, and your
     own website.

11. **`cs(User-Agent)`**

    The value of the `User-Agent` header in the request. The
     `User-Agent` header identifies the source of the request, such as
     the type of device and browser that submitted the request or, if the request
     came from a search engine, which search engine.

12. **`cs-uri-query`**

    The query string portion of the request URL, if any.

    When a URL doesn't contain a query string, this field's value is a hyphen (-).
     For more information, see [Cache content based on query string parameters](querystringparameters.md).

13. **`cs(Cookie)`**

    The `Cookie` header in the request, including name—value
     pairs and the associated attributes.

    If you enable cookie logging, CloudFront logs the cookies in all requests regardless
     of which cookies you choose to forward to the origin. When a request doesn't
     include a cookie header, this field's value is a hyphen (-). For more
     information about cookies, see [Cache content based on cookies](cookies.md).

14. **`x-edge-result-type`**

    How the server classified the response after the last byte left the
     server. In some cases, the result type can change between the time
     that the server is ready to send the response and the time that it
     finishes sending the response. See also the
     `x-edge-response-result-type` field.

    For example, in HTTP streaming, suppose the server finds a segment of
     the stream in the cache. In that scenario, the value of this field
     would ordinarily be `Hit`. However, if the viewer closes the
     connection before the server has delivered the entire segment, the
     final result type (and the value of this field) is
     `Error`.

    WebSocket and gRPC connections will have a value of
     `Miss` for this field because the content is not cacheable
     and is proxied directly to the origin.

    Possible values include:

- `Hit` – The server served the object to the
viewer from the cache.

- `RefreshHit` – The server found the object
in the cache but the object had expired, so the server
contacted the origin to verify that the cache had the latest version
of the object.

- `Miss` – The request could not be satisfied by
an object in the cache, so the server forwarded the
request to the origin and returned the result to the
viewer.

- `LimitExceeded` – The request was denied because
a CloudFront quota (formerly referred to as a limit) was exceeded.

- `CapacityExceeded` – The server returned an HTTP
503 status code because it didn't have enough capacity at the time
of the request to serve the object.

- `Error` – Typically, this means the request
resulted in a client error (the value of the `sc-status`
field is in the `4xx` range) or a server error
(the value of the `sc-status` field is in the
`5xx` range). If the value of the `sc-status`
field is `200`, or if the value of this field is
`Error` and the value of the
`x-edge-response-result-type` field is not
`Error`, it means the HTTP request was successful
but the client disconnected before receiving all of the
bytes.

- `Redirect` – The server redirected the
viewer from HTTP to HTTPS according to the distribution
settings.

- `LambdaExecutionError` – The Lambda@Edge function associated with the distribution didn't complete due to a malformed association, a function timeout, an AWS dependency issue, or another general availability problem.

15. **`x-edge-request-id`**

    An opaque string that uniquely identifies a request. CloudFront also sends
     this string in the `x-amz-cf-id` response header.

16. **`x-host-header`**

    The value that the viewer included in the `Host` header
     of the request. If you're using the CloudFront domain name in your object URLs (such as
     d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net), this field contains that domain name. If you're using
     alternate domain names (CNAMEs) in your object URLs (such as
     www.example.com), this field contains the alternate domain name.

    If you're using alternate domain names, see `cs(Host)` in field 7
     for the domain name that is associated with your distribution.

17. **`cs-protocol`**

    The protocol of the viewer request ( `http`,
     `https`, `grpcs`, `ws`, or `wss`).

18. **`cs-bytes`**

    The total number of bytes of data that the viewer included in the
     request, including headers. For WebSocket and gRPC connections, this is the total number
     of bytes sent from the client to the server on the connection.

19. **`time-taken`**

    The number of seconds (to the thousandth of a second, for example,
     0.082) from when the server receives the viewer's request to when the
     server writes the last byte of the response to the output queue, as measured
     on the server. From the perspective of the viewer, the total time to
     get the full response will be longer than this value because of network
     latency and TCP buffering.

20. **`x-forwarded-for`**

    If the viewer used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request,
     the value of the `c-ip` field is the IP address of the proxy or
     load balancer. In that case, this field is the IP address of the viewer that
     originated the request. This field can contain multiple comma-separated IP addresses. Each IP address can be an IPv4 address (for example,
     `192.0.2.183`) or an IPv6 address (for example,
     `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`).

    If the viewer did not use an HTTP proxy or a load balancer, the value of this
     field is a hyphen (-).

21. **`ssl-protocol`**

    When the request used HTTPS, this field contains the SSL/TLS protocol
     that the viewer and server negotiated for transmitting the request and
     response. For a list of possible values, see the supported SSL/TLS protocols
     in [Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront](secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.md).

    When `cs-protocol` in field 17 is `http`, the value for
     this field is a hyphen (-).

22. **`ssl-cipher`**

    When the request used HTTPS, this field contains the SSL/TLS cipher
     that the viewer and server negotiated for encrypting the request and
     response. For a list of possible values, see the supported SSL/TLS ciphers
     in [Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront](secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.md).

    When `cs-protocol` in field 17 is `http`, the value for
     this field is a hyphen (-).

23. **`x-edge-response-result-type`**

    How the server classified the response just before returning the
     response to the viewer. See also the `x-edge-result-type`
     field. Possible values include:

- `Hit` – The server served the object to the
viewer from the cache.

- `RefreshHit` – The server found the object
in the cache but the object had expired, so the server
contacted the origin to verify that the cache had the latest version
of the object.

- `Miss` – The request could not be satisfied by
an object in the cache, so the server forwarded the
request to the origin server and returned the result to the
viewer.

- `LimitExceeded` – The request was denied because
a CloudFront quota (formerly referred to as a limit) was exceeded.

- `CapacityExceeded` – The server returned a
503 error because it didn't have enough capacity at the time of the
request to serve the object.

- `Error` – Typically, this means the request
resulted in a client error (the value of the `sc-status`
field is in the `4xx` range) or a server error
(the value of the `sc-status` field is in the
`5xx` range).

If the value of the `x-edge-result-type` field is
`Error` and the value of this field is not
`Error`, the client disconnected before finishing the
download.

- `Redirect` – The server redirected the
viewer from HTTP to HTTPS according to the distribution
settings.

- `LambdaExecutionError` – The Lambda@Edge function associated with the distribution didn't complete due to a malformed association, a function timeout, an AWS dependency issue, or another general availability problem.

24. **`cs-protocol-version`**

    The HTTP version that the viewer specified in the request. Possible
     values include `HTTP/0.9`, `HTTP/1.0`,
     `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2.0`, and `HTTP/3.0`.

25. **`fle-status`**

    When [field-level\
     encryption](field-level-encryption.md) is configured for a distribution, this field contains a
     code that indicates whether the request body was successfully processed.
     When the server successfully processes the request body, encrypts
     values in the specified fields, and forwards the request to the origin, the
     value of this field is `Processed`. The value of
     `x-edge-result-type` can still indicate a client-side or
     server-side error in this case.

    Possible values for this field include:

- `ForwardedByContentType` – The server
forwarded the request to the origin without parsing or encryption
because no content type was configured.

- `ForwardedByQueryArgs` – The server
forwarded the request to the origin without parsing or encryption
because the request contains a query argument that wasn't in the
configuration for field-level encryption.

- `ForwardedDueToNoProfile` – The server
forwarded the request to the origin without parsing or encryption
because no profile was specified in the configuration for
field-level encryption.

- `MalformedContentTypeClientError` – The
server rejected the request and returned an HTTP 400 status code to
the viewer because the value of the `Content-Type` header
was in an invalid format.

- `MalformedInputClientError` – The server
rejected the request and returned an HTTP 400 status code to the
viewer because the request body was in an invalid format.

- `MalformedQueryArgsClientError` – The
server rejected the request and returned an HTTP 400 status code to
the viewer because a query argument was empty or in an invalid
format.

- `RejectedByContentType` – The server
rejected the request and returned an HTTP 400 status code to the
viewer because no content type was specified in the configuration
for field-level encryption.

- `RejectedByQueryArgs` – The server rejected
the request and returned an HTTP 400 status code to the viewer
because no query argument was specified in the configuration for
field-level encryption.

- `ServerError` – The origin server returned an
error.

If the request exceeds a field-level encryption quota (formerly referred
to as a limit), this field contains one of the following error codes, and
the server returns HTTP status code 400 to the viewer. For a list
of the current quotas on field-level encryption, see [Quotas on field-level encryption](cloudfront-limits.md#limits-field-level-encryption).

- `FieldLengthLimitClientError` – A field that is
configured to be encrypted exceeded the maximum length
allowed.

- `FieldNumberLimitClientError` – A request that
the distribution is configured to encrypt contains more than the
number of fields allowed.

- `RequestLengthLimitClientError` – The length of
the request body exceeded the maximum length allowed when
field-level encryption is configured.

If field-level encryption is not configured for the distribution, the value of
this field is a hyphen (-).

26. **`fle-encrypted-fields`**

    The number of [field-level\
     encryption](field-level-encryption.md) fields that the server encrypted and forwarded to the
     origin. CloudFront servers stream the processed request to the origin as they
     encrypt data, so this field can have a value even if the value of
     `fle-status` is an error.

    If field-level encryption is not configured for the distribution, the value of
     this field is a hyphen (-).

27. **`c-port`**

    The port number of the request from the viewer.

28. **`time-to-first-byte`**

    The number of seconds between receiving the request and writing the
     first byte of the response, as measured on the server.

29. **`x-edge-detailed-result-type`**

    This field contains the same value as the `x-edge-result-type`
     field, except in the following cases:

- When the object was served to the viewer from the [Origin Shield](origin-shield.md) layer, this field contains
`OriginShieldHit`.

- When the object was not in the CloudFront cache and the response was
generated by an [origin request\
Lambda@Edge function](lambda-at-the-edge.md), this field contains
`MissGeneratedResponse`.

- When the value of the `x-edge-result-type` field is
`Error`, this field contains one of the following values with
more information about the error:

- `AbortedOrigin` – The server encountered an
issue with the origin.

- `ClientCommError` – The response to the
viewer was interrupted due to a communication problem between
the server and the viewer.

- `ClientGeoBlocked` – The distribution is
configured to refuse requests from the viewer's geographic
location.

- `ClientHungUpRequest` – The viewer stopped
prematurely while sending the request.

- `Error` – An error occurred for which the
error type doesn't fit any of the other categories. This
error type can occur when the server serves an error response
from the cache.

- `InvalidRequest` – The server received an
invalid request from the viewer.

- `InvalidRequestBlocked` – Access to the
requested resource is blocked.

- `InvalidRequestCertificate` – The
distribution doesn't match the SSL/TLS certificate for
which the HTTPS connection was established.

- `InvalidRequestHeader` – The request
contained an invalid header.

- `InvalidRequestMethod` – The distribution is
not configured to handle the HTTP request method that was used.
This can happen when the distribution supports only cacheable
requests.

- `OriginCommError` – The request timed out
while connecting to the origin, or reading data from the
origin.

- `OriginConnectError` – The server
couldn't connect to the origin.

- `OriginContentRangeLengthError` – The
`Content-Length` header in the origin's response
doesn't match the length in the `Content-Range`
header.

- `OriginDnsError` – The server couldn't
resolve the origin's domain name.

- `OriginError` – The origin returned an
incorrect response.

- `OriginHeaderTooBigError` – A header
returned by the origin is too big for the edge server to
process.

- `OriginInvalidResponseError` – The origin
returned an invalid response.

- `OriginReadError` – The server couldn't
read from the origin.

- `OriginWriteError` – The server
couldn't write to the origin.

- `OriginZeroSizeObjectError` – A zero size
object sent from the origin resulted in an error.

- `SlowReaderOriginError` – The viewer was
slow to read the message that caused the origin error.

30. **`sc-content-type`**

    The value of the HTTP `Content-Type` header of the
     response.

31. **`sc-content-len`**

    The value of the HTTP `Content-Length` header of the
     response.

32. **`sc-range-start`**

    When the response contains the HTTP `Content-Range` header,
     this field contains the range start value.

33. **`sc-range-end`**

    When the response contains the HTTP `Content-Range` header,
     this field contains the range end value.

34. **`distribution-tenant-id`**

    The ID of the distribution tenant.

35. **`connection-id`**

    A unique identifier for the TLS connection.

    You must enable mTLS for your distributions before you can get information for
     this field. For more information, see [Mutual TLS authentication with CloudFront (Viewer mTLS)](mtls-authentication.md).

## Analyze logs

Because you can receive multiple access logs per hour, we recommend that you combine
all the log files you receive for a given time period into one file. You can then
analyze the data for that period more accurately and completely.

One way to analyze your access logs is to use [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena). Athena is an interactive query service that can help you analyze
data for AWS services, including CloudFront. To learn more, see [Querying Amazon CloudFront Logs](../../../athena/latest/ug/cloudfront-logs.md) in the
_Amazon Athena User Guide_.

In addition, the following AWS blog posts discuss some ways to analyze access
logs.

- [Amazon CloudFront Request Logging](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-cloudfront-request-logging) (for content delivered via HTTP)

- [Enhanced CloudFront Logs, Now With Query Strings](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/enhanced-cloudfront-logs-now-with-query-strings)
