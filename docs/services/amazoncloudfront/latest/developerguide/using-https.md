# Use HTTPS with CloudFront

You can configure CloudFront to require that viewers use HTTPS so that connections are encrypted
when CloudFront communicates with viewers. You also can configure CloudFront to use HTTPS with your
origin so that connections are encrypted when CloudFront communicates with your origin.

If you configure CloudFront to require HTTPS both to communicate with viewers and to communicate
with your origin, here’s what happens when CloudFront receives a request:

1. A viewer submits an HTTPS request to CloudFront. There’s some SSL/TLS negotiation here
    between the viewer and CloudFront. In the end, the viewer submits the request in an
    encrypted format.

2. If the CloudFront edge location contains a cached response, CloudFront encrypts the response
    and returns it to the viewer, and the viewer decrypts it.

3. If the CloudFront edge location doesn’t contain a cached response, CloudFront performs SSL/TLS
    negotiation with your origin and, when the negotiation is complete, forwards the
    request to your origin in an encrypted format.

4. Your origin decrypts the request, processes it (generates a response), encrypts
    the response, and returns the response to CloudFront.

5. CloudFront decrypts the response, re-encrypts it, and forwards it to the viewer. CloudFront
    also caches the response in the edge location so that it’s available the next time
    it’s requested.

6. The viewer decrypts the response.

The process works basically the same way whether your origin is an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaStore, or a custom origin such as an
HTTP/S server.

###### Note

To help thwart SSL renegotiation-type attacks, CloudFront does not support renegotiation for viewer and origin requests.

Alternatively, you can turn on mutual authentication for your CloudFront distribution. For more information, see [Mutual TLS authentication with CloudFront (Viewer mTLS)](mtls-authentication.md).
