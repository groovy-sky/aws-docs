# Data protection in Amazon CloudFront

The AWS [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model)
applies to data protection in Amazon CloudFront. As described in this model, AWS is
responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS Cloud. You are
responsible for maintaining control over your content that is hosted on this infrastructure.
You are also responsible for the security configuration and management tasks for the AWS services
that you use. For more information about data privacy, see the [Data Privacy FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq). For information about data protection in Europe, see the [AWS Shared\
Responsibility Model and GDPR](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/the-aws-shared-responsibility-model-and-gdpr) blog post on the _AWS Security_
_Blog_.

For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect AWS account
credentials and set up individual users with AWS IAM Identity Center or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). That way, each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties. We also recommend that you secure your data in the following ways:

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.

- Use SSL/TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail. For information about using CloudTrail trails to capture AWS activities, see [Working with CloudTrail trails](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-trails.md) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

- Use AWS encryption solutions, along with all default security controls within AWS services.

- Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie, which assists in discovering
and securing sensitive data that is stored in Amazon S3.

- If you require FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through
a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS endpoint. For more information about the
available FIPS endpoints, see [Federal\
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips).

We strongly recommend that you never put confidential or sensitive information, such as your
customers' email addresses, into tags or free-form text fields such as a **Name** field. This includes when you work with CloudFront or other AWS services
using the console, API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Any data that you enter into
tags or free-form text fields used for names may be used for billing or diagnostic logs. If you
provide a URL to an external server, we strongly recommend that you do not include credentials
information in the URL to validate your request to that server.

Amazon CloudFront provides several options that you can use to help secure the content that it
delivers:

- Configure HTTPS connections.

- Configure field-level encryption to provide additional security for specific data during
transit.

- Restrict access to content so that only specific people, or people in a specific
area, can view it.

The following topics explain the options in more detail.

## Encryption in transit

To encrypt your data during transit, you configure Amazon CloudFront to require that viewers
use HTTPS to request your files, so that connections are encrypted when CloudFront
communicates with viewers. You also can configure CloudFront to use HTTPS to get files from
your origin, so that connections are encrypted when CloudFront communicates with your
origin.

For more information, see [Use HTTPS with CloudFront](using-https.md).

Field-level encryption adds an additional layer of security along with HTTPS that lets
you protect specific data throughout system processing so that only certain applications
can see it. By configuring field-level encryption in CloudFront, you can securely upload
user-submitted sensitive information to your web servers. The sensitive information
provided by your clients is encrypted at the edge closer to the user. It remains
encrypted throughout your entire application stack, ensuring that only applications that
need the data—and have the credentials to decrypt it—are able to do
so.

For more information, see [Use field-level encryption to help protect sensitive data](field-level-encryption.md).

The CloudFront API endpoints, `cloudfront.amazonaws.com` and
`cloudfront-fips.amazonaws.com`, only accept HTTPS traffic. This means that
when you send and receive information using the CloudFront API, your data—including
distribution configurations, cache policies and origin request policies, key groups and
public keys, and function code in CloudFront Functions—is always encrypted in transit. In
addition, all requests sent to the CloudFront API endpoints are signed with AWS credentials and logged in AWS CloudTrail.

Function code and configuration in CloudFront Functions is always encrypted in transit when
copied to the edge location points of presence (POPs), and between other storage
locations used by CloudFront.

## Encryption at rest

Function code and configuration in CloudFront Functions is always stored in an encrypted
format on the edge location POPs, and in other storage locations
used by CloudFront.

## Restrict access to content

Many companies that distribute content over the internet want to restrict access to
documents, business data, media streams, or content that is intended for a subset of
users. To securely serve this content by using Amazon CloudFront, you can do one or more of the
following:

**Use signed URLs or cookies**

You can restrict access to content that is intended for selected
users—for example, users who have paid a fee—by serving this
private content through CloudFront using signed URLs or signed cookies. For more
information, see [Serve private content with signed URLs and signed cookies](privatecontent.md).

**Restrict access to content in Amazon S3 buckets**

If you restrict access to your content by using, for example, CloudFront signed URLs or signed
cookies, you also won't want people to view files by using the direct URL
for the file. Instead, you want them to access the files only by using the
CloudFront URL, so that your protections work.

If you use an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin for a CloudFront distribution, you can set up an origin
access control (OAC) which makes it possible to restrict access to the S3
bucket. For more information, see [Restrict access to an Amazon S3 origin](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

**Restrict access to content served by an Application Load Balancer**

When you use CloudFront with an Application Load Balancer in Elastic Load Balancing as the origin, you can configure
CloudFront to prevent users from directly accessing the Application Load Balancer. This allows users
to access the Application Load Balancer only through CloudFront, ensuring that you get the benefits of
using CloudFront. For more information, see [Restrict access to Application Load Balancers](restrict-access-to-load-balancer.md).

**Use AWS WAF web ACLs**

You can use AWS WAF, a web application firewall service, to create a web
access control list (web ACL) to restrict access to your content. Based on
conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests
originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests
either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code
(Forbidden). For more information, see [Use AWS WAF protections](distribution-web-awswaf.md).

**Use geo restriction**

You can use _geo restriction_, also known as
_geoblocking_, to prevent users in specific
geographic locations from accessing content that you serve through a CloudFront
distribution. There are several options to choose from when you configure
geo restrictions. For more information, see [Restrict the geographic distribution of your content](georestrictions.md).
