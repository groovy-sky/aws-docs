# Ways to use Lambda@Edge

There are many uses for Lambda@Edge processing with your Amazon CloudFront distribution, such as
the following examples:

- A Lambda function can inspect cookies and rewrite URLs so that users see
different versions of a site for A/B testing.

- CloudFront can return different objects to viewers based on the device they're using
by checking the `User-Agent` header, which includes information about
the devices. For example, CloudFront can return different images based on the screen
size of their device. Similarly, the function could consider the value of the
`Referer` header and cause CloudFront to return the images to bots that
have the lowest available resolution.

- Or you could check cookies for other criteria. For example, on a retail
website that sells clothing, if you use cookies to indicate which color a user
chose for a jacket, a Lambda function can change the request so that CloudFront returns
the image of a jacket in the selected color.

- A Lambda function can generate HTTP responses when CloudFront viewer request or
origin request events occur.

- A function can inspect headers or authorization tokens, and insert a header to
control access to your content before CloudFront forwards the request to your
origin.

- A Lambda function can also make network calls to external resources to confirm
user credentials, or fetch additional content to customize a response.
