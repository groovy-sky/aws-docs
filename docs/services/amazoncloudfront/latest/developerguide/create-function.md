# Create functions

You create a function in two stages:

1. Create the function code as JavaScript. You can use the default example from the
    CloudFront console or write your own. For more information, see the following
    topics:

- [Write function code](writing-function-code.md)

- [CloudFront Functions event structure](functions-event-structure.md)

- [CloudFront Functions examples for CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/service_code_examples_cloudfront_functions_examples.html)

2. Use CloudFront to create the function and include your code. The code exists inside the
    function (not as a reference).

Console

###### To create a function

1. Sign in to the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home#/functions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home) and choose the
    **Functions** page.

2. Choose **Create function**.

3. Enter a function name that is unique within the AWS account, choose
    the JavaScript version, and then choose **Continue**.
    The details page for the new function appears.

###### Note

To use [key-value pairs](kvs-with-functions.md)
in the function, you must choose JavaScript runtime 2.0.

4. In the **Function code** section, choose the
    **Build** tab and enter your function code. The
    sample code that is included in the **Build** tab
    illustrates the basic syntax for the function code.

5. Choose **Save changes**.

6. If the function code uses key-value pairs, you must associate a key
    value store.

You can associate the key value store when you first create the
    function. Or, you can associate it later, by [updating the function](update-function.md).

To associate a key value store now, follow these steps:

   - Go to the **Associate KeyValueStore** section
      and choose **Associate existing**
     **KeyValueStore**.

   - Select the key value store that contains the key-value pairs
      in the function, and then choose **Associate**
     **KeyValueStore**.

CloudFront immediately associates the store with the function. You don't
need to save the function.

CLI

If you use the CLI, you typically first create the function code in a file,
and then create the function with the AWS CLI.

###### To create a function

1. Create the function code in a file, and store it in a directory that
    your computer can connect to.

2. Run the command as shown in the example. This example uses the
    `fileb://` notation to pass in the file. It also
    includes line breaks to make the command more readable.

```bash

aws cloudfront create-function \
       --name MaxAge \
       --function-config '{"Comment":"Max Age 2 years","Runtime":"cloudfront-js-2.0","KeyValueStoreAssociations":{"Quantity":1,"Items":[{"KeyValueStoreARN":"arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:key-value-store/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"}]}}' \
       --function-code fileb://function-max-age-v1.js

```

###### Notes

- `Runtime` – The version of JavaScript.
To use [key value\
pairs](kvs-with-functions.md) in the function, you must specify version
2.0.

- `KeyValueStoreAssociations` – If your
function uses key-value pairs, you can associate the key
value store when you first create the function. Or, you can
associate it later, by using `update-function`.
The `Quantity` is always `1` because
each function can have only one key value store associated
with it.

When the command is successful, you see output like the
following.

```bash

ETag: ETVABCEXAMPLE
FunctionSummary:
  FunctionConfig:
    Comment: Max Age 2 years
    Runtime: cloudfront-js-2.0
    KeyValueStoreAssociations= \
      {Quantity=1, \
      Items=[{KeyValueStoreARN='arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:key-value-store/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111'}]} \
  FunctionMetadata:
    CreatedTime: '2021-04-18T20:38:56.915000+00:00'
    FunctionARN: arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:function/MaxAge
    LastModifiedTime: '2023-11-19T20:38:56.915000+00:00'
    Stage: DEVELOPMENT
  Name: MaxAge
  Status: UNPUBLISHED
Location: https://cloudfront.amazonaws.com/2020-05-31/function/arn:aws:cloudfront:::function/MaxAge
```

Most of the information is repeated from the request. Other
information is added by CloudFront.

###### Notes

- `ETag` – This value changes each time
you modify the key value store. You use this value and the
function name to reference the function in the future. Make
sure that you always use the current
`ETag`.

- `FunctionARN` – The ARN for your CloudFront
function.

- 111122223333 – The AWS account.

- `Stage` – The stage of the function
( `LIVE` or `DEVELOPMENT`).

- `Status` – The status of the function
( `PUBLISHED` or
`UNPUBLISHED`).

After you create the function, it's added to the `DEVELOPMENT` stage. We
recommend that you [test your function](test-function.md) before you [publish it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/publish-function.html). After you publish your function, the
function changes to the `LIVE` stage.
