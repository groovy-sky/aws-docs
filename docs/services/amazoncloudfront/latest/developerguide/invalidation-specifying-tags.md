# What you need to know when invalidating tags

When you specify a tag to invalidate, refer to the following information:

**Opt-in required**

Tag invalidation only works on distributions that have `CacheTagConfig`
configured. Distributions without this configuration ignore cache tag headers
from the origin. For more information, see [Invalidating content by cache tags](invalidation-by-tags.md).

**Tag invalidation prefix**

Tag invalidation items must begin with the `#` character. For
example, to invalidate all cached objects tagged with `product:electronics`,
specify `
                        #product:electronics` in the `Paths.Items` list.

**Case sensitivity**

Tag values are case-insensitive. For example, `#Product:Electronics`
and `
                        #product:electronics` refer to the same tag.

**Tag format**

Each tag value must contain only ASCII visible characters (33–126),
excluding commas. The maximum length of a tag is 256
characters.

**No wildcard support**

Unlike path invalidations, tag invalidation items do not support the `*`
wildcard. Each `#`-prefixed item matches the exact tag value.

**Maximum tags per cached object**

CloudFront processes up to 50 tags per cached object. If an origin response
contains more than 50 tags in the configured header, the additional tags
beyond the limit are not stored and cannot be used for invalidation.

**Forwarding cookies, headers, and query**
**strings**

When you invalidate by tag, CloudFront invalidates every cached variant of
every object that carries the specified tag, regardless of associated
cookies, headers, or query string parameters. You can't selectively
invalidate some variants and not others.

**Mixed path and tag invalidations**

You can include both path items (for example, `/images/*`) and tag
items (for example, `#brand:acme`) in the same invalidation batch in
a `CreateInvalidation` request. Each item counts as one invalidation
path toward your limits.

**Maximum allowed**

Tag invalidation items count toward the same concurrent invalidation limits as
path items. Each tag item counts as one invalidation path. For more information,
see [Quotas on invalidations](cloudfront-limits.md#limits-invalidations).

**Changing the header name**

If you change the `HeaderName` in `CacheTagConfig`,
invalidations issued against tags extracted under the old header name will no
longer be evaluated. Before changing the header name:

1. Start returning both the old and new cache tag headers from your
    origin.

2. Issue a path invalidation (for example, `/*`) or invalidate
    existing tags.

3. Update `CacheTagConfig` with the new `HeaderName`
    .

4. Stop returning the old header from your origin.

**Distribution tenants**

Tag invalidation is also supported for distribution tenants via the `
                    CreateInvalidationForDistributionTenant` API.
