# HTTP 502 status code (Bad Gateway)

CloudFront returns a HTTP 502 status code (Bad Gateway) when CloudFront wasn't able to serve
the requested object because it couldn't connect to the origin server.

If you're using Lambda@Edge, the issue might be a Lambda validation error. If you
receive an HTTP 502 error with the `NonS3OriginDnsError` error code,
there's likely a DNS configuration problem that's preventing CloudFront from connecting to
the origin.

## SSL/TLS negotiation failure between CloudFront and a custom origin server

If you use a custom origin that requires HTTPS between CloudFront and your origin,
mismatched domain names might cause errors. The SSL/TLS certificate on your
origin _must_ include a domain name that matches either the
**Origin Domain** that you specified for the CloudFront
distribution or the `Host` header of the origin request.

If the domain names don't match, the SSL/TLS handshake fails, and CloudFront returns
an HTTP status code 502 (Bad Gateway) and sets the `X-Cache` header
to `Error from cloudfront`.

To determine whether domain names in the certificate match the
**Origin Domain** in the distribution or the
`Host` header, you can use an online SSL checker or OpenSSL. If
the domain names don't match, you have two options:

- Get a new SSL/TLS certificate that includes the applicable domain
names.

If you use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), see [Requesting a public certificate](../../../acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.md) in the
_AWS Certificate Manager User Guide_ to request a new
certificate.

- Change the distribution configuration so CloudFront no longer tries to use
SSL to connect with your origin.

### Online SSL checker

To find an SSL test tool, search the internet for "online ssl checker."
Typically, you specify the name of your domain, and the tool returns a
variety of information about your SSL/TLS certificate. Confirm that the
certificate contains your domain name in the **Common**
**Name** or **Subject Alternative Names**
fields.

### OpenSSL

To help troubleshoot HTTP 502 errors from CloudFront, you can use OpenSSL to try
to make an SSL/TLS connection to your origin server. If OpenSSL is not able
to make a connection, that can indicate a problem with your origin server's
SSL/TLS configuration. If OpenSSL is able to make a connection, it returns
information about the origin server's certificate, including the
certificate's common name ( `Subject CN` field) and subject
alternative name ( `Subject Alternative Name` field).

Use the following OpenSSL command to test the connection to your origin
server (replace `origin domain` with your origin
server's domain name, such as example.com):

`openssl s_client -connect origin domain
								name:443`

If the following are true:

- Your origin server supports multiple domain names with multiple
SSL/TLS certificates

- Your distribution is configured to forward the `Host`
header to the origin

Then add the `-servername` option to the OpenSSL command, as in
the following example (replace `CNAME` with the
CNAME that's configured in your distribution):

`openssl s_client -connect origin domain
								name:443 -servername
							CNAME`

## Origin is not responding with supported ciphers/protocols

CloudFront connects to origin servers using ciphers and protocols. For a list of the
ciphers and protocols that CloudFront supports, see [Supported protocols and ciphers between CloudFront and the origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-ciphers-cloudfront-to-origin.html). If
your origin does not respond with one of these ciphers or protocols in the
SSL/TLS exchange, CloudFront fails to connect. You can validate that your origin
supports the ciphers and protocols by using an online tool such as [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest). Type the domain name
of your origin in the **Hostname** field, and then choose
**Submit**. Review the **Common**
**names** and **Alternative names**
fields from the test to see if they match your origin's domain name. After the
test is finished, find the **Protocols** and **Cipher**
**Suites** sections in the test results to see which ciphers or
protocols are supported by your origin. Compare them with the list of [Supported protocols and ciphers between CloudFront and the origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-ciphers-cloudfront-to-origin.html).

## SSL/TLS certificate on the origin is expired, invalid, self-signed, or the certificate chain is in the wrong order

If the origin server returns the following, CloudFront drops the TCP connection,
returns HTTP status code 502 (Bad Gateway), and sets the `X-Cache`
header to `Error from cloudfront`:

- An expired certificate

- Invalid certificate

- Self-signed certificate

- Certificate chain in the wrong order

###### Note

If the full chain of certificates, including the intermediate certificate,
is not present, CloudFront drops the TCP connection.

For information about installing an SSL/TLS certificate on your custom origin
server, see [Require HTTPS for communication between CloudFront and your custom origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-cloudfront-to-custom-origin.html).

## Origin is not responding on specified ports in origin settings

When you create an origin on your CloudFront distribution, you can set the ports
that CloudFront connects to the origin with for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. By default,
these are TCP 80/443. You have the option to modify these ports. If your origin
is rejecting traffic on these ports for any reason, or if your backend server
isn't responding on the ports, CloudFront will fail to connect.

To troubleshoot these issues, check any firewalls running in your
infrastructure and validate that they are not blocking the supported IP ranges.
For more information, see [AWS IP address ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_. Additionally, verify whether your web
server is running on the origin.

## Lambda validation error

If you're using Lambda@Edge, an HTTP 502 status code can indicate that your
Lambda function response was incorrectly formed or included invalid content. For
more information about troubleshooting Lambda@Edge errors, see [Test and debug Lambda@Edge functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-testing-debugging.html).

## CloudFront function validation error

If you're using CloudFront functions, an HTTP 502 status code can indicate that the
CloudFront function is trying to add, delete, or change a read-only header. This error
does not show up during testing, but will show up after you deploy the function
and run the request. To resolve this error, check and update your CloudFront function.
For more information, see [Update functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/update-function.html).

## DNS error ( `NonS3OriginDnsError`)

An HTTP 502 error with the `NonS3OriginDnsError` error code
indicates that there's a DNS configuration problem that prevents CloudFront from
connecting to the origin. If you get this error from CloudFront, make sure that the
origin's DNS configuration is correct and working.

When CloudFront receives a request for an object that's expired or is not in its
cache, it makes a request to the origin to get the object. To make a successful
request to the origin, CloudFront performs a DNS resolution on the origin domain. If
the DNS service for your domain is experiencing issues, CloudFront can't resolve the
domain name to get the IP address, which results in an HTTP 502 error
( `NonS3OriginDnsError`). To fix this problem, contact your DNS
provider, or, if you are using Amazon Route 53, see [Why can't I access my website that uses Route 53 DNS services?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route-53-dns-website-unreachable)

To further troubleshoot this issue, ensure that the [authoritative name servers](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/route-53-concepts.md#route-53-concepts-authoritative-name-server) of your origin's
root domain or zone apex (such as `example.com`) are functioning
correctly. You can use the following commands to find the name servers for your
apex origin, with a tool such as [dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)) or [nslookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup):

```nohighlight

dig OriginAPEXDomainName NS +short
```

```nohighlight

nslookup -query=NS OriginAPEXDomainName
```

When you have the names of your name servers, use the following commands to
query the domain name of your origin against them to make sure that each
responds with an answer:

```nohighlight

dig OriginDomainName @NameServer
```

```nohighlight

nslookup OriginDomainName NameServer
```

###### Important

Make sure that you perform this DNS troubleshooting using a computer
that's connected to the public internet. CloudFront resolves the origin domain
using public DNS on the internet, so it's important to troubleshoot in a
similar context.

If your origin is a subdomain whose DNS authority is delegated to a different
name server than the root domain, make sure that the name server
( `NS`) and start of authority ( `SOA`) records are
configured correctly for the subdomain. You can check for these records using
commands similar to the preceding examples.

For more information about DNS, see [Domain Name System (DNS) concepts](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/route-53-concepts.md#route-53-concepts-domain-name-system-dns) in the Amazon Route 53
documentation.
