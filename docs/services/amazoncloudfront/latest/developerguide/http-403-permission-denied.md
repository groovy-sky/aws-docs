# HTTP 403 status code (Permission Denied)

An HTTP 403 error means the client isn't authorized to access the requested
resource. The client understands the request, but can't authorize viewer access. The
following are common causes when CloudFront returns this status code:

## Alternate CNAME is incorrectly configured

Verify that you specified the correct CNAME for our distribution. To use an
alternate CNAME instead of the default CloudFront URL:

1. Create a CNAME record in your DNS to point the CNAME to CloudFront
    distribution URL.

2. Add the CNAME in your CloudFront distribution configuration.

If you create the DNS record but don't add the CNAME in your CloudFront distribution
configuration, then the request returns a 403 error. For more information about
configuring a custom CNAME, see [Use custom URLs by adding alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](cnames.md).

## AWS WAF is configured on CloudFront distribution or at the origin

When AWS WAF sits between the client and CloudFront, CloudFront can't distinguish between a
403 error code that’s returned by your origin and a 403 error code that's
returned by AWS WAF when a request is blocked.

To find the source of the 403 status code, check your AWS WAF web access control
list (ACL) rule for a blocked request. For more information, see the following
topics:

- [AWS WAF web access control lists (web\
ACLs)](../../../waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.md)

- [Testing and tuning your AWS WAF\
protections](../../../waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing.md)

## Custom origin returns a 403 error

If you're using a custom origin, you might see a 403 error if you have a
custom firewall configuration at the origin. To troubleshoot, make the request
directly to the origin. If you can replicate the error without CloudFront, then the
origin is causing the 403 error.

If the custom origin is causing the error, check the origin logs to identify
what might be causing the error. For more information, see the following

- [How do I troubleshoot Application Load Balancer HTTP 403 forbidden\
errors?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/alb-http-403-error)

## Amazon S3 origin returns a 403 error

You might see a 403 error for the following reasons:

- CloudFront doesn't have access to the Amazon S3 bucket. This can happen if origin
access identity (OAI) or origin access control (OAC) isn't enabled for
your distribution and the bucket is private.

- The specified path in the requested URL isn't correct.

- The requested object doesn't exist.

- The host header was forwarded with the REST API endpoint. For more
information, see [HTTP Host header bucket specification](../../../s3/latest/userguide/virtualhosting.md#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

- You configured custom error pages. For more information, see [How CloudFront processes errors when you have configured custom error pages](httpstatuscodes.md#HTTPStatusCodes-custom-error-pages).

## Geographic restrictions return a 403 error

If you enabled geographic restrictions (also known as geoblocking) to prevent
users in specific geographic locations from accessing content that you're
distributing through a CloudFront distribution, blocked users receive a 403
error.

For more information, see [Restrict the geographic distribution of your content](georestrictions.md).

## Signed URL or signed cookie configuration returns a 403 error

If you enabled **Restrict viewer access** for your
distribution's behavior configuration, then requests that don't use signed
cookies or signed URLs result in a 403 error. For more information, see the
following topics:

- [Serve private content with signed URLs and signed cookies](privatecontent.md)

- [How do I troubleshoot issues related to a signed\
URL or signed cookies in CloudFront?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-troubleshoot-signed-url-cookies)

## Stacked distributions cause a 403 error

If you have two or more distributions within a chain of requests to the origin
endpoint, CloudFront returns a 403 error. We don't recommend placing one distribution
in front of another.
