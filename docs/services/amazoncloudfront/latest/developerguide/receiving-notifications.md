# Create alarms for metrics

In the CloudFront console, you can set alarms to notify you by Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) based on
specific CloudFront metrics.

###### To create alarms for metrics

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**.

3. Choose **Create alarm**.

4. For **Details**, specify the following:
1. **Alarm name** – A name for the alarm.

2. **Distribution** – The CloudFront distribution that
       you're creating the alarm for.
5. For **Condition**, specify the following:
1. **Metric** – The metric that you're creating
       the alarm for.

2. **"IF" <condition>** – The threshold when
       CloudWatch should trigger an alarm and send a notification to the Amazon SNS topic.
       For example, to receive a notification when the `5xx` error
       rate exceeds 1%, specify the following:

      **5xx error rate** **\> 1**

3. **"FOR" consecutive periods** – The period of
       time that the condition must be met before triggering an alarm. When you
       choose a value, aim for an appropriate balance between a value that
       doesn't alarm for temporary problems, but will alarm for sustained or
       real problems.

4. (Optional) **Notify** – The Amazon SNS topic to
       send notification to if this metric triggers an alarm.
6. Choose **Create alarm**.

###### Notes

- When you enter the values for the condition, use whole numbers without
punctuation. For example, to specify one thousand, enter
`1000`.

- For `4xx`, `5xx`, and total error rates, the value
that you specify is a percentage.

- For requests, bytes downloaded, and bytes uploaded, the value that you
specify is units. For example, 1073742000 bytes.
