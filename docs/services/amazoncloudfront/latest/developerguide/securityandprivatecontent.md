# Configure secure access and restrict access to content

CloudFront provides several options for securing content that it delivers. The following are some
ways you can use CloudFront to secure and restrict access to content:

- Configure HTTPS connections

- Prevent users in specific geographic locations from accessing content

- Require users to access content using CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies

- Set up field-level encryption for specific content fields

- Use AWS WAF to control access to your content

You should also implement a DDoS-resilient architecture for your infrastructure and applications. For more information, see [AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency.html).
