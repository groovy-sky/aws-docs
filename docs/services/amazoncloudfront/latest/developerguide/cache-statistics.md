# View CloudFront cache statistics reports

The Amazon CloudFront cache statistics report shows the following information:

- **Total requests** – The total number of
requests for all HTTP status codes (for example, 200 or 404) and all methods
(for example, GET, HEAD, or POST)

- **Percentage of viewer requests by result type**
– Hits, misses, and errors as a percentage of total viewer requests for
the selected CloudFront distribution

- **Bytes transferred to viewers** – Total
bytes and bytes from misses

- **HTTP status codes** – Viewer requests by
HTTP status code

- **Percentage of GET requests that didn't finish**
**downloading** – Viewer GET requests that didn't finish
downloading the requested object as a percentage of total requests

Data for these statistics is drawn from the same source as CloudFront access logs. However,
you don't need to enable [access logging](accesslogs.md) to view cache
statistics.

You can display charts for a specified date range in the last 60 days, with data
points every hour or every day. You can usually view data about requests that CloudFront
received as recently as an hour ago, but data can occasionally be delayed by as much as
24 hours.

## View CloudFront cache statistics reports in the console

You can view the CloudFront cache statistics report in the console.

###### To view the CloudFront cache statistics report

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Cache**
**Statistics**.

3. In the **CloudFront Cache Statistics Reports** pane, for
    **Start Date** and **End Date**,
    select the date range for which you want to display cache statistics charts.
    Available ranges depend on the value that you select for
    **Granularity**:

- **Daily** – To display charts
with one data point per day, select any date range in the previous
60 days.

- **Hourly** – To display charts
with one data point every hour, select any date range of up to 14
days within the previous 60 days.

Dates and times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

4. For **Granularity**, specify whether to display one data
    point per day or one data point per hour in the charts. If you specify a
    date range greater than 14 days, the option to specify one data point per
    hour is not available.

5. For **Viewer Location**, choose the continent from which
    viewer requests originated, or choose **All Locations**.
    Cache statistics charts include data for requests that CloudFront received from
    the specified location.

6. In the **Distribution** list, select the distributions
    for which you want to display data in the usage charts:

- **An individual distribution**
– The charts display data for the selected CloudFront distribution.
The **Distribution** list displays the distribution
ID and alternate domain names (CNAMEs) for the distribution, if any.
If a distribution doesn't have alternate domain names, the list
includes origin domain names for the distribution.

- **All distributions** – The
charts display summed data for all distributions that are associated
with the current AWS account, excluding distributions that you
have deleted.

7. Choose **Update**.

###### Tip

- To view data for a daily or hourly data point within a chart, hover
over the data point.

- For charts that show data transferred, you can change the vertical
scale to gigabytes, megabytes, or kilobytes.

## Download data in CSV format

You can download the cache statistics report in CSV format. This section explains
how to download the report and describes the values in the report.

###### To download the cache statistics report in CSV format

1. While viewing the cache statistics report, choose
    **CSV**.

2. In the **Opening _file_**
**_name_** dialog box, choose whether to open or save
    the file.

### Information about the report

The first few rows of the report include the following information:

**Version**

The version of the format for this CSV file.

**Report**

The name of the report.

**DistributionID**

The ID of the distribution that you ran the report for, or
`ALL` if you ran the report for all
distributions.

**StartDateUTC**

The beginning of the date range for which you ran the report, in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

**EndDateUTC**

The end of the date range for which you ran the report, in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

**GeneratedTimeUTC**

The date and time on which you ran the report, in Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC).

**Granularity**

Whether each row in the report represents one hour or one day.

**ViewerLocation**

The continent that viewer requests originated from, or
`ALL`, if you chose to download the report for all
locations.

### Data in the cache statistics report

The report includes the following values:

**DistributionID**

The ID of the distribution that you ran the report for, or
`ALL` if you ran the report for all
distributions.

**FriendlyName**

An alternate domain name (CNAME) for the distribution, if any. If
a distribution has no alternate domain names, the list includes an
origin domain name for the distribution.

**ViewerLocation**

The continent that viewer requests originated from, or
`ALL`, if you chose to download the report for all
locations.

**TimeBucket**

The hour or the day that data applies to, in Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC).

**RequestCount**

The total number of requests for all HTTP status codes (for
example, 200 or 404) and all methods (for example, GET, HEAD, or
POST).

**HitCount**

The number of viewer requests for which the object is served from
a CloudFront edge cache.

**MissCount**

The number of viewer requests for which the object isn't currently
in an edge cache, so CloudFront must get the object from your
origin.

**ErrorCount**

The number of viewer requests that resulted in an error, so CloudFront
didn't serve the object.

**IncompleteDownloadCount**

The number of viewer requests for which the viewer started but
didn't finish downloading the object.

**HTTP2xx**

The number of viewer requests for which the HTTP status code was a
2xx value (succeeded).

**HTTP3xx**

The number of viewer requests for which the HTTP status code was a
3xx value (additional action is required).

**HTTP4xx**

The number of viewer requests for which the HTTP status code was a
4xx value (client error).

**HTTP5xx**

The number of viewer requests for which the HTTP status code was a
5xx value (server error).

**TotalBytes**

The total number of bytes served to viewers by CloudFront in response to
all requests for all HTTP methods.

**BytesFromMisses**

The number of bytes served to viewers for objects that were not in
the edge cache at the time of the request. This value is a good
approximation of bytes transferred from your origin to CloudFront edge
caches. However, it excludes requests for objects that are already
in the edge cache but that have expired.

## How cache statistics charts are related to data in the CloudFront standard logs (access logs)

The following table shows how cache statistics charts in the CloudFront console
correspond with values in CloudFront access logs. For more information about CloudFront access
logs, see [Access logs (standard logs)](accesslogs.md).

**Total requests**

This chart shows the total number of requests for all HTTP status
codes (for example, 200 or 404) and all methods (for example,
`GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`). Total
requests shown in this chart equal the total number of requests in the
access log files for the same time period.

**Percentage of viewer requests by result type**

This chart shows hits, misses, and errors as a percentage of total
viewer requests for the selected CloudFront distribution:

- **Hit** – A viewer request
for which the object is served from a CloudFront edge cache. In access
logs, these are requests for which the value of
`x-edge-response-result-type` is
`Hit`.

- **Miss** – A viewer
request for which the object isn't currently in an edge cache,
so CloudFront must get the object from your origin. In access logs,
these are requests for which the value of
`x-edge-response-result-type` is
`Miss`.

- **Error** – A viewer
request that resulted in an error, so CloudFront didn't serve the
object. In access logs, these are requests for which the value
of `x-edge-response-result-type` is
`Error`, `LimitExceeded`, or
`CapacityExceeded`.

The chart does not include refresh hits—requests for objects
that are in the edge cache but that have expired. In access logs,
refresh hits are requests for which the value of
`x-edge-response-result-type` is
`RefreshHit`.

**Bytes transferred to viewers**

This chart shows two values:

- **Total bytes** – The
total number of bytes served to viewers by CloudFront in response to
all requests for all HTTP methods. In CloudFront access logs,
**Total Bytes** is the sum of the values in
the `sc-bytes` column for all of the requests during
the same time period.

- **Bytes from misses** –
The number of bytes served to viewers for objects that were not
in the edge cache at the time of the request. In CloudFront access
logs, **bytes from misses** is the sum of the
values in the `sc-bytes` column for requests for
which the value of `x-edge-result-type` is
`Miss`. This value is a good approximation of
bytes transferred from your origin to CloudFront edge caches. However,
it excludes requests for objects that are already in the edge
cache but that have expired.

**HTTP status codes**

This chart shows viewer requests by HTTP status code. In CloudFront access
logs, status codes appear in the `sc-status` column:

- **2xx** – The request
succeeded.

- **3xx** – Additional
action is required. For example, 301 (Moved Permanently) means
that the requested object has moved to a different
location.

- **4xx** – The client
apparently made an error. For example, 404 (Not Found) means
that the client requested an object that could not be
found.

- **5xx** – The origin
server didn't fill the request. For example, 503 (Service
Unavailable) means that the origin server is currently
unavailable.

**Percentage of GET requests that didn't finish downloading**

This chart shows viewer `GET` requests that didn't finish
downloading the requested object as a percentage of total requests.
Typically, downloading an object doesn't complete because the viewer
canceled the download, for example, by clicking a different link or by
closing the browser. In CloudFront access logs, these requests have a value of
`200` in the `sc-status` column and a value of
`Error` in the `x-edge-result-type`
column.
