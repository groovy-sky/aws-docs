# Write and create a Lambda@Edge function

To use Lambda@Edge, you _write_ the code for your
AWS Lambda function. To help you write Lambda@Edge functions, see the following
resources:

- [Lambda@Edge event structure](lambda-event-structure.md)
– Understand the event structure to use with Lambda@Edge.

- [Lambda@Edge example functions](lambda-examples.md) –
Example functions, such as A/B testing and generating an HTTP redirect.

The programming model for using Node.js or Python with Lambda@Edge is the same as using
Lambda in an AWS Region. For more information, see [Building Lambda\
functions with Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-nodejs.html) or [Building Lambda functions with Python](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

In your Lambda@Edge function, include the `callback` parameter and return
the applicable object for request or response events:

- **Request events** – Include the
`cf.request` object in the response.

If you're generating a response, include the `cf.response` object
in the response. For more information, see [Generate HTTP responses in request triggers](lambda-generating-http-responses.md#lambda-generating-http-responses-in-requests).

- **Response events** – Include the
`cf.response` object in the response.

After you write your own code or use one of the examples, you then create the function
in Lambda. To create a function or edit an existing one, see the following topics:

###### Topics

- [Edit a Lambda function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-edit-function.html)

After you create the function in Lambda, you set up Lambda to run the function based on
specific CloudFront events, which are called _triggers_. For more
information, see [Add triggers for a Lambda@Edge function](lambda-edge-add-triggers.md).
