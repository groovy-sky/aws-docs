# Use alternate domain names and HTTPS

If you want to use your own domain name in the URLs for your files (for example,
`https://www.example.com/image.jpg`) and you want your viewers to use HTTPS,
you must complete the steps in the following topics. (If you use the default CloudFront distribution
domain name in your URLs, for example,
`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg`, follow the guidance in the
following topic instead: [Require HTTPS for communication between viewers and CloudFront](using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.md).)

###### Important

When you add a certificate to your distribution, CloudFront immediately propagates the
certificate to all of its edge locations. As new edge locations become available,
CloudFront propagates the certificate to those locations, too. You can't restrict the edge
locations that CloudFront propagates the certificates to.
