# Store objects and custom error pages in different locations

If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations,
your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:

- The value of **Path Pattern** matches the path to your custom
error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors
in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named `/4xx-errors`. Your
distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes
requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example,
`/4xx-errors/*`.

- The value of **Origin** specifies the value of
**Origin ID** for the origin that contains your custom
error pages.

For more information, see [Cache behavior settings](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md).
