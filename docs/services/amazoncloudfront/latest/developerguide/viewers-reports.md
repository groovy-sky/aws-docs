## View viewers charts and reports in the console

You can view CloudFront viewers charts and reports in the console.

###### To view CloudFront viewers charts and reports

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Viewers**.

3. In the **CloudFront Viewers** pane, for **Start**
**Date** and **End Date**, select the date range
    for which you want to display viewer charts and reports.

For the Locations chart, available ranges depend on the value that you
    select for **Granularity**:

- **Daily** – To display charts
with one data point per day, select any date range in the previous
60 days.

- **Hourly** – To display charts
with one data point every hour, select any date range of up to 14
days within the previous 60 days.

Dates and times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

4. (Browsers and Operating Systems charts only) For
    **Grouping**, specify whether you want to group
    browsers and operating systems by name (Chrome, Firefox) or by name and
    version (Chrome 40.0, Firefox 35.0).

5. (Locations chart only) For **Granularity**, specify
    whether to display one data point per day or one data point per hour in the
    charts. If you specify a date range greater than 14 days, the option to
    specify one data point per hour is not available.

6. (Locations chart only) For **Details**, specify whether
    to display the top locations by countries or by U.S. states.

7. In the **Distribution** list, select the distribution for
    which you want to display data in the usage charts:

- **An individual distribution**
– The charts display data for the selected CloudFront distribution.
The **Distribution** list displays the distribution
ID and an alternate domain name (CNAME) for the distribution, if
any. If a distribution has no alternate domain names, the list
includes an origin domain name for the distribution.

- **All distributions (excludes**
**deleted)** – The charts display summed data for
all distributions that are associated with the current AWS
account, excluding distributions that you have deleted.

8. Choose **Update**.

To view data for a daily or hourly data point within a chart, hover over the data
point.

The remaining columns in the report list the locations that CloudFront

see the description of Location in [How data in the locations report is related to data in the CloudFront standard logs (access logs)](#viewers-reports-data).

## How data in the locations report is related to data in the CloudFront standard logs (access logs)

The following list shows how data in the Locations report in the CloudFront console
corresponds with values in CloudFront access logs. For more information about CloudFront access
logs, see [Access logs (standard logs)](accesslogs.md).

**Location**

The country or U.S. state that the viewer is in. In access logs, the
`c-ip` column contains the IP address of the device that
the viewer is running on. We use geolocation data to identify the
geographic location of the device based on the IP address.

If you're displaying the **Locations** report by
country, the country list is based on [ISO 3166-2,\
_Codes for the representation of names of countries and_\
_their subdivisions – Part 2: Country subdivision_\
_code_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2). The country list includes the following
additional values:

- **Anonymous Proxy** – The request
originated from an anonymous proxy.

- **Satellite Provider** – The request
originated from a satellite provider that provides internet
service to multiple countries. Viewers might be in countries
with a high risk of fraud.

- **Europe (Unknown)** – The request
originated from an IP in a block that is used by multiple
European countries. The country that the request originated from
can't be determined. CloudFront uses **Europe**
**(Unknown)** as the default.

- **Asia/Pacific (Unknown)** – The
request originated from an IP in a block that is used by
multiple countries in the Asia/Pacific region. The country that
the request originated from can't be determined. CloudFront uses
**Asia/Pacific (Unknown)** as the default.

If you display the **Locations** report by U.S.
state, note that the report can include U.S. territories and U.S. Armed
Forces regions.

###### Note

If CloudFront can't determine a user's location, the location will
appear as Unknown in viewer reports.

**Request Count**

The total number of requests from the country or U.S. state that the
viewer is in, for the specified distribution and period. This value
generally corresponds closely with the number of `GET`
requests from IP addresses in that country or state in CloudFront access logs.

**Request %**

One of the following, depending on the value that you selected for
**Details**:

- **Countries** – The
requests from this country as a percentage of the total number
of requests.

- **U.S. States** – The
requests from this state as a percentage of the total number of
requests from the United States.

If requests came from more than 50 countries, then you can't calculate
**Request %** based on the data in this table
because the **Request Count** column doesn't include
all of the requests during the specified period.

**Bytes**

The number of bytes that CloudFront served to viewers in this country or
state, for the specified distribution and period. To change the display
of data in this column to KB, MB, or GB, choose the link in the column
heading.
