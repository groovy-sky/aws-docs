# Restrict access with VPC origins

You can use CloudFront to deliver content from applications that are hosted in your virtual
private cloud (VPC) private subnets. You can use Application Load Balancers (ALBs), Network Load Balancers (NLBs), and EC2
instances in private subnets as VPC origins.

Here are some reasons why you might want to use VPC origins:

- **Security** – VPC origins is designed to
enhance the security posture of your application by placing your load balancers
and EC2 instances in private subnets, making CloudFront the single point of entry.
User requests go from CloudFront to the VPC origins over a private, secure connection,
providing additional security for your applications.

- **Management** – VPC origins reduces the
operational overhead required for secure connectivity between CloudFront and origins.
You can move your origins to private subnets with no public access, and you
don’t have to implement access control lists (ACLs) or other mechanisms to
restrict access to your origins. This way, you don't have to invest in
undifferentiated development work to secure your web applications with CloudFront.

- **Scalability and performance** – VPC origins
helps you to secure your web applications, freeing up time to focus on growing
your critical business applications while improving security and maintaining
high performance and global scalability with CloudFront. VPC origins streamlines security
management and reduces operational complexity so that you can use CloudFront as the
single point of entry for your applications.

###### Tip

CloudFront supports sharing VPC origins across AWS accounts, whether they're in your
organization or not. You can share VPC origins from the CloudFront console or use
AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). For more information, see [Working with shared resources in CloudFront](sharing-resources.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you create a VPC origin for your CloudFront distribution, you must complete the following:

### VPC Configuration

**Create a virtual private cloud (VPC) on Amazon VPC** in one of the AWS Regions that are supported for VPC origins. For information about creating a VPC, see [Create a VPC plus other VPC resources](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.md#create-vpc-and-other-resources) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_. For a list of supported Regions, see [Supported AWS Regions for VPC origins](#vpc-origins-supported-regions).

Your VPC must include the following:

- **Internet gateway** – You need to add an internet gateway to the VPC that has your VPC origin resources. The internet gateway is required to denote that the VPC can receive traffic from the internet. The internet gateway is not used for routing traffic to origins inside the subnet, and you don't need to update the routing policies.

- **Private subnet with at least one available IPv4 address** – CloudFront routes to your subnet by using a service-managed elastic network interface (ENI) that CloudFront creates after you define your VPC origin resource with CloudFront. You must have at least one available IPv4 address in your private subnet so that the ENI creation process can succeed. The IPv4 address can be private, and there is no additional cost for it. IPv6-only subnets are not supported.

### Origin Resources

In the private subnet, launch an Application Load Balancer, a Network Load Balancer, or an EC2 instance to use as your origin. The resource you launch must be fully deployed and in Active status before you can use it for a VPC origin.

**Origin restrictions:**

- Gateway Load Balancers cannot be added as origins

- Dual-stack Network Load Balancers cannot be added as origins

- Network Load Balancers with TLS listeners cannot be added as origins

- To be used as a VPC origin, a Network Load Balancer must have a security group attached to it

### Security Group Configuration

Your VPC origin resources (Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or EC2 instance) must have a security group attached. When you create a VPC origin, CloudFront automatically creates a service-managed security group with the naming pattern `CloudFront-VPCOrigins-Service-SG`. This security group is fully managed by AWS, and should not be edited.

To allow traffic from CloudFront to reach your VPC origin, update the security group attached to your origin resource (ALB, NLB, or EC2 instance) to allow inbound traffic using one of the following methods:

- **Option 1:** Allow traffic from the CloudFront managed prefix list. For more information, see [Use the CloudFront managed prefix list](locationsofedgeservers.md#managed-prefix-list). This can be done before VPC origin created as well.

- **Option 2:** Allow traffic from the CloudFront service-managed security group ( `CloudFront-VPCOrigins-Service-SG`). This can be done only after the VPC origin is created and the service-managed security group is created. This configuration is further restrictive as it restricts the traffic only to your CloudFront distributions.

###### Important

Do not create your own security group with a name starting with `CloudFront-VPCOrigins-Service-SG`. This is an AWS reserved naming pattern for service-managed security groups. For more information, see [Creating a security group](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/creating-security-groups.md).

### Protocol and Feature Restrictions

VPC origins do not support the following:

- WebSockets

- gRPC traffic

- Origin request and origin response triggers with Lambda@Edge

## Create a VPC origin (new distribution)

The following procedure shows you how to create a VPC origin for your new CloudFront
distribution in the CloudFront console. Alternatively, you can use the [CreateVpcOrigin](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-createvpcorigin.md) and [CreateDistribution](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-createdistribution.md) API operations with the AWS CLI or an AWS
SDK.

###### To create a VPC origin for a new CloudFront distribution

1. Open the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. Choose **VPC origins**, **Create VPC**
**origin**.

3. Fill out the required fields. For **Origin ARN**, select
    the ARN of your Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or EC2 instance. If you don’t see the ARN, you
    can copy your specific resource ARN and paste it here instead.

4. Choose **Create VPC origin**.

5. Wait for your VPC origin status to change to
    **Deployed**. This can take up to 15 minutes.

6. Choose **Distributions**, **Create**
**distribution**.

7. For **Origin domain**, select your VPC origins resource from
    the dropdown list.

If your VPC origin is an EC2 instance, copy and paste the
    **Private IP DNS name** of the instance into the
    **Origin domain** field.

8. Finish creating your distribution. For more information, see [Create a CloudFront distribution in the console](distribution-web-creating-console.md#create-console-distribution).

## Create a VPC origin (existing distribution)

The following procedure shows you how to create a VPC origin for your existing
CloudFront distribution in the CloudFront console, which helps to ensure continuous availability
of your applications. Alternatively, you can use the [CreateVpcOrigin](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-createvpcorigin.md) and [UpdateDistributionWithStagingConfig](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-updatedistributionwithstagingconfig.md) API operations with the AWS CLI or an
AWS SDK.

Optionally, you could choose to add your VPC origin to your existing distribution
without creating a staging distribution.

###### To create a VPC origin for your existing CloudFront distribution

01. Open the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

02. Choose **VPC origins**, **Create VPC**
    **origin**.

03. Fill out the required fields. For **Origin ARN**, select
     the ARN of your Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or EC2 instance. If you don’t see the ARN, you
     can copy your specific resource ARN and paste it here instead.

04. Choose **Create VPC origin**.

05. Wait for your VPC origin status to change to
     **Deployed**. This can take up to 15 minutes.

06. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributions**.

07. Choose the ID of your distribution.

08. On the **General** tab, under **Continuous**
    **deployment**, choose **Create staging**
    **distribution**. For more information, see [Use CloudFront continuous deployment to safely test CDN configuration changes](continuous-deployment.md).

09. Follow the steps in the **Create staging distribution**
     wizard to create a staging distribution. Include the following steps:

- For **Origins**, choose **Create**
**origin**.

- For **Origin domain**, select your VPC origins
resource from the dropdown menu.

If your VPC origin is an EC2 instance, copy and paste the
**Private IP DNS name** of the instance into
the **Origin domain** field.

- Choose **Create origin**.

10. In your staging distribution, test the VPC origin.

11. Promote the staging distribution configuration to your primary
     distribution. For more information, see [Promote a staging distribution configuration](working-with-staging-distribution-continuous-deployment-policy.md#promote-staging-distribution-configuration).

12. Remove public access to your VPC origin by making the subnet private.
     After you do this, the VPC origin won't be discoverable over the internet,
     but CloudFront will still have private access to it. For more information,
     see [Associate or disassociate a subnet with a route table](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/workwithroutetables.md#AssociateSubnet) in the
     _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## Update a VPC origin

The following procedure shows you how to update a VPC origin for your CloudFront
distribution in the CloudFront console. Alternatively, you can use the [UpdateDistribution](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-updatedistribution.md) and [UpdateVpcOrigin](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-updatevpcorigin.md) API operations with the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK.

###### To update an existing VPC origin for your CloudFront distribution

01. Open the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributions**.

03. Choose the ID of your distribution.

04. Choose the **Behaviors** tab.

05. Make sure that the VPC origin is not the default origin for your cache
     behavior.

06. Choose the **Origins** tab.

07. Select the VPC origin that you're going to update and choose
     **Delete**. This disassociates the VPC origin from your
     distribution. Repeat steps 2-7 to disassociate the VPC origin from any other
     distributions.

08. Choose **VPC origins**.

09. Select the VPC origin and choose **Edit**.

10. Make your updates and choose **Update VPC**
    **origin**.

11. Wait for your VPC origin status to change to
     **Deployed**. This can take up to 15 minutes.

12. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributions**.

13. Choose the ID of your distribution.

14. Choose the **Origins** tab.

15. Choose **Create origin**.

16. For **Origin domain**, select your VPC origins resource from
     the dropdown menu.

    If your VPC origin is an EC2 instance, copy and paste the
     **Private IP DNS name** of the instance into the
     **Origin domain** field.

17. Choose **Create origin**. This associates the VPC origin
     with your distribution again. Repeat steps 12-17 to associate the updated
     VPC origin with any other distributions.
