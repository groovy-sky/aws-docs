# Delete a distribution

The following procedure deletes a distribution by using the CloudFront console.
For information about deleting with the CloudFront API, see [DeleteDistribution](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-deletedistribution.md) in the
_Amazon CloudFront API Reference_.

If you need to delete a distribution with an OAC attached to an S3 bucket, see [Delete a distribution with an OAC attached to an S3 bucket](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md#delete-oac-distribution-s3) for important details.

###### Warning

- Before you can delete a distribution, you must disable it, which requires
permission to update the distribution. Once deleted, a distribution cannot
be recovered.

- If you disable a distribution that has an alternate domain name associated
with it, CloudFront stops accepting traffic for that domain name (such as
www.example.com), even if another distribution has an alternate domain name
with a wildcard (\*) that matches the same domain (such as
\*.example.com).

- You can't delete a distribution that is subscribed to a [CloudFront flat-rate pricing plan](flat-rate-pricing-plan.md). You will receive an error that says, "You can't delete this distribution while it's subscribed to a pricing plan." You must first cancel the pricing plan and then after the current billing cycle, delete the distribution.

Multi-tenant

Before you can delete a multi-tenant distribution, you must first delete all associated distribution tenants from it.

###### To delete a multi-tenant distribution

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

    delete.

3. For **Tenants**, select and delete all associated distribution tenants.

4. Choose **Disable** to disable the distribution, and choose
    **Disable distribution** to confirm.

5. Wait until the new timestamp appears
    under the **Last modified** column.

- It might take a few minutes for CloudFront to propagate your change to all edge locations.

6. Choose **Delete**, **Delete distribution**.

2. In the right pane of the CloudFront console, find the distribution that you want to
    delete.

- If the **Status** column shows that the distribution is already
**Disabled**, skip to Step 6.

- If the **Status** shows **Enabled** but the distribution still shows **Deploying** in the **Last modified** column, wait for deployment to finish before continuing to step 3.

3. In the right pane of the CloudFront console, select the check box for the distribution that
    you want to delete.

4. Choose **Disable** to disable the distribution, and choose
    **Yes, Disable** to confirm. Then choose **Close**.

- The value of the **Status** column immediately changes to
**Disabled**.

- If the **Delete** option isn't available, it means that CloudFront is
still propagating your change to the edge locations. Wait until the new timestamp appears
under the **Last modified** column, then repeat steps 6-7.
