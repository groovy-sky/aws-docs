# Revert from a custom SSL/TLS certificate to the default CloudFront certificate

If you configured CloudFront to use HTTPS between viewers and CloudFront, and you configured
CloudFront to use a custom SSL/TLS certificate, you can change your configuration to use
the default CloudFront SSL/TLS certificate. The process depends on whether you've used
your distribution to distribute your content:

- If you have not used your distribution to distribute your content, you can
just change the configuration. For more information, see [Update a distribution](howtoupdatedistribution.md).

- If you have used your distribution to distribute your content, you must create a new CloudFront
distribution and change the URLs for your files to reduce or eliminate the
amount of time that your content is unavailable. To do that, perform the
following procedure.

## Revert to default CloudFront certificate

The following procedure shows you how to revert from a custom SSL/TLS certificate to the default CloudFront certificate.

###### To revert to the default CloudFront certificate

1. Create a new CloudFront distribution with the desired configuration. For
    **SSL Certificate**, choose **Default CloudFront**
**Certificate (\*.cloudfront.net)**.

For more information, see [Create a distribution](distribution-web-creating-console.md).

2. For files that you're distributing using CloudFront, update the URLs in your
    application to use the domain name that CloudFront assigned to the new
    distribution. For example, change
    `https://www.example.com/images/logo.png` to
    `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/logo.png`.

3. Either delete the distribution that is associated with a custom SSL/TLS
    certificate, or update the distribution to change the value of **SSL**
**Certificate** to **Default CloudFront Certificate**
**(\*.cloudfront.net)**. For more information, see [Update a distribution](howtoupdatedistribution.md).

###### Important

Until you complete this step, AWS continues to charge you for using
a custom SSL/TLS certificate.

4. (Optional) Delete your custom SSL/TLS certificate.
1. Run the AWS CLI command `list-server-certificates` to get
       the certificate ID of the certificate that you want to delete. For
       more information, see [list-server-certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/list-server-certificates.html) in the
       _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

2. Run the AWS CLI command `delete-server-certificate` to
       delete the certificate. For more information, see [delete-server-certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/delete-server-certificate.html) in the
       _AWS CLI Command Reference_.
