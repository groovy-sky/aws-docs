# Manage how long content stays in the cache (expiration)

You can control how long your files stay in a CloudFront cache before CloudFront forwards another
request to your origin. Reducing the duration allows you to serve dynamic content.
Increasing the duration means that your users get better performance because your files
are more likely to be served directly from the edge cache. A longer duration also
reduces the load on your origin.

Typically, CloudFront serves a file from an edge location until the cache duration that you
specified passes—that is, until the file expires. After it expires, the next time
the edge location gets a request for the file, CloudFront forwards the request to the origin
to verify that the cache contains the latest version of the file. The response from the
origin depends on whether the file has changed:

- If the CloudFront cache already has the latest version, the origin returns a status
code `304 Not Modified`.

- If the CloudFront cache does not have the latest version, the origin returns a
status code `200 OK` and the latest version of the file.

If a file in an edge location isn't frequently requested, CloudFront might evict the
file—remove the file before its expiration date—to make room for files that
have been requested more recently.

We recommend managing your cache duration by updating your distribution's cache policy. If you opt out of using a cache policy, the default TTL (Time to Live) is 24 hours, but you can update the following settings to override the default:

- To change the cache duration for all files that match the same path pattern,
you can change the CloudFront settings for **Minimum TTL**,
**Maximum TTL**, and **Default TTL** for a
cache behavior. For information about the individual settings, see [Minimum TTL](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesMinTTL), [Maximum TTL](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesMaxTTL), and [Default TTL](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesDefaultTTL).

- To change the cache duration for an individual file, you can configure your
origin to add a `Cache-Control` header with the `max-age`
or `s-maxage` directive, or an `Expires` header to the
file. For more information, see [Use headers to control cache duration for individual objects](#expiration-individual-objects).

For more information about how **Minimum TTL**, **Default**
**TTL**, and **Maximum TTL** interact with the
`max-age` and `s-maxage` directives and the
`Expires` header field, see [Specify the amount of time that CloudFront caches objects](#ExpirationDownloadDist).

You can also control how long errors (for example, `404 Not Found`) stay in
a CloudFront cache before CloudFront tries again to get the requested object by forwarding another
request to your origin. For more information, see [How CloudFront processes HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes from your origin](httpstatuscodes.md).

## Use headers to control cache duration for individual objects

You can use the `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers to
control how long objects stay in the cache. Settings for **Minimum**
**TTL**, **Default TTL**, and **Maximum TTL** also affect cache duration, but here's an overview of how headers can
affect cache duration:

- The `Cache-Control max-age` directive lets you specify how long
(in seconds) that you want an object to remain in the cache before CloudFront gets
the object again from the origin server. The minimum expiration time CloudFront
supports is 0 seconds. The maximum value is 100 years. Specify the value in
the following format:

`Cache-Control:
  						max-age=` `seconds`

For example, the following directive tells CloudFront to keep the associated
object in the cache for 3600 seconds (one hour):

`Cache-Control: max-age=3600`

If you want objects to stay in CloudFront edge caches for a different duration
than they stay in browser caches, you can use the `Cache-Control
  							max-age` and `Cache-Control s-maxage` directives
together. For more information, see [Specify the amount of time that CloudFront caches objects](#ExpirationDownloadDist).

- The `Expires` header field lets you specify an expiration date
and time using the format specified in [RFC 2616, Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 Section 3.3.1, Full\
Date](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html), for example:

`Sat, 27 Jun 2015 23:59:59 GMT`

We recommend that you use the `Cache-Control max-age` directive instead
of the `Expires` header field to control object caching. If you specify
values both for `Cache-Control max-age` and for `Expires`,
CloudFront uses only the value of `Cache-Control max-age`.

For more information, see [Specify the amount of time that CloudFront caches objects](#ExpirationDownloadDist).

You cannot use the HTTP `Cache-Control` or `Pragma` header
fields in a `GET` request from a viewer to force CloudFront to go back to the
origin server for the object. CloudFront ignores those header fields in viewer
requests.

For more information about the `Cache-Control` and `Expires`
header fields, see the following sections in _RFC 2616, Hypertext Transfer_
_Protocol -- HTTP/1.1_:

- [Section 14.9 Cache Control](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)

- [Section 14.21 Expires](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)

## Serve stale (expired) content

CloudFront supports the `Stale-While-Revalidate` and
`Stale-If-Error` cache control directives. You can use these
directives to specify how long stale content is available for viewers.

###### Topics

- [Stale-While-Revalidate](#stale-while-revalidate)

- [Stale-If-Error](#stale-if-error-only)

- [Use both directives](#use-both-stale-directives)

### `Stale-While-Revalidate`

This directive allows CloudFront to serve stale content from the cache while CloudFront
asynchronously fetches a fresh version from the origin. This improves latency as
viewers receive responses immediately from edge locations without having to wait
for the background fetch. Fresh content is loaded in the background for future
requests.

###### Example: Stale-While-Revalidate

CloudFront does the following when you set the `Cache-Control` header
to use these directives.

```nohighlight

Cache-Control: max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=600
```

1. CloudFront will cache a response for one hour
    ( `max-age=3600`).

2. If a request is made after this duration, CloudFront serves the stale
    content, while concurrently sending a request to the origin to
    revalidate and refresh the cached content.

3. While the content is being revalidated, CloudFront serves the stale
    content up to 10 minutes
    ( `stale-while-revalidate=600`).

###### Note

CloudFront will serve the stale content up to the value of the
`stale-while-revalidate` directive or the value of the CloudFront
[maximum TTL](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesMaxTTL), whichever
is less. After the maximum TTL duration, the stale object won't be
available from the edge cache, regardless of the
`stale-while-revalidate` value.

### `Stale-If-Error`

This directive allows CloudFront to serve stale content from the cache if the origin
is unreachable or returns an error code that is between 500 and 600. This
ensures that viewers can access content even during an origin outage.

###### Example: Stale-If-Error

CloudFront does the following when you set the `Cache-Control` header
to use these directives.

```nohighlight

Cache-Control: max-age=3600, stale-if-error=86400
```

1. CloudFront caches the response for one hour
    ( `max-age=3600`).

2. If the origin is down or returns an error after this duration,
    CloudFront continues to serve the stale content for up to 24 hours
    ( `stale-if-error=86400`)

3. If you configured custom error responses, CloudFront will attempt to
    serve the stale content if an error is encountered within the
    specified `stale-if-error` duration. If the stale content
    is unavailable, CloudFront will then serve the custom error responses that
    you configured for the corresponding error status code. For more
    information, see [Generate custom error responses](generatingcustomerrorresponses.md).

###### Notes

- CloudFront will serve the stale content up to the value of the
`stale-if-error` directive or the value of the CloudFront
[maximum TTL](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesMaxTTL),
whichever is less. After the maximum TTL duration, the stale object
won't be available from the edge cache, regardless of the
`stale-if-error` value.

- If you don't configure `stale-if-error` or custom error
responses, CloudFront will return the stale object or forward the error
response back to viewer, depending on whether the requested object
is in the edge cache or not. For more information, see [How CloudFront processes errors if you haven't configured custom error pages](httpstatuscodes.md#HTTPStatusCodes-no-custom-error-pages).

### Use both directives

Both `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` are
independent cache control directives that you can use together to reduce latency
and to add a buffer for your origin to respond or recover.

###### Example: Using both directives

CloudFront does the following when you set the `Cache-Control` header
to use the following directives.

```nohighlight

Cache-Control: max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=600, stale-if-error=86400
```

1. CloudFront caches the response for one hour ( `max-age=3600`).

2. If a request is made after this duration, CloudFront serves the stale
    content for up to 10 minutes
    ( `stale-while-revalidate=600`) while the content is
    being revalidated.

3. If the origin server returns an error while CloudFront attempts to
    revalidate the content, CloudFront will continue to serve the stale
    content for up to 24 hours
    ( `stale-if-error=86400`).

Caching is a balance between performance and freshness. Using directives like
`stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` can
enhance performance and user experience, but make sure the configurations align
with how fresh you want your content to be. Stale content directives are best
suited for use cases where content needs to be refreshed but having the latest
version is non-essential. Additionally, if your content doesn’t change or rarely
changes, `stale-while-revalidate` could add unnecessary network
requests. Instead, consider setting a long cache duration.

## Specify the amount of time that CloudFront caches objects

To control the amount of time that CloudFront keeps an object in the cache before
sending another request to the origin, you can:

- Set the minimum, maximum, and default TTL values in a CloudFront distribution's
cache behavior. You can set these values in a [cache policy](controlling-the-cache-key.md) attached to the
cache behavior (recommended), or in the legacy cache settings.

- Include the `Cache-Control` or `Expires` header in
responses from the origin. These headers also help determine how long a
browser keeps an object in the browser cache before sending another request
to CloudFront.

The following table explains how the `Cache-Control` and
`Expires` headers sent from the origin work together with the TTL
settings in a cache behavior to affect caching.

Origin headersMinimum TTL = 0Minimum TTL > 0

**The origin adds a `Cache-Control:**
**max-age` directive to the object**

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caches the object for the lesser of the value of the
`Cache-Control: max-age` directive or the value
of the CloudFront maximum TTL.

**Browser caching**

Browsers cache the object for the value of the
`Cache-Control: max-age` directive.

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caching depends on the values of the CloudFront minimum TTL and
maximum TTL and the `Cache-Control max-age`
directive:

- If minimum TTL < `max-age` < maximum
TTL, then CloudFront caches the object for the value of the
`Cache-Control: max-age`
directive.

- If `max-age` < minimum TTL, then CloudFront
caches the object for the value of the CloudFront minimum
TTL.

- If `max-age` \> maximum TTL, then CloudFront
caches the object for the value of the CloudFront maximum
TTL.

**Browser caching**

Browsers cache the object for the value of the
`Cache-Control: max-age` directive.

**The origin does not add a**
**`Cache-Control: max-age` directive to the**
**object**

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caches the object for the value of the CloudFront default
TTL.

**Browser caching**

Depends on the browser.

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caches the object for the greater of the value of the
CloudFront minimum TTL or default TTL.

**Browser caching**

Depends on the browser.

**The origin adds `Cache-Control:**
**max-age` and `Cache-Control: s-maxage`**
**directives to the object**

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caches the object for the lesser of the value of the
`Cache-Control: s-maxage` directive or the value
of the CloudFront maximum TTL.

**Browser caching**

Browsers cache the object for the value of the
`Cache-Control max-age` directive.

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caching depends on the values of the CloudFront minimum TTL and
maximum TTL and the `Cache-Control: s-maxage`
directive:

- If minimum TTL < `s-maxage` < maximum
TTL, then CloudFront caches the object for the value of the
`Cache-Control: s-maxage`
directive.

- If `s-maxage` < minimum TTL, then CloudFront
caches the object for the value of the CloudFront minimum
TTL.

- If `s-maxage` \> maximum TTL, then CloudFront
caches the object for the value of the CloudFront maximum
TTL.

**Browser caching**

Browsers cache the object for the value of the
`Cache-Control: max-age` directive.

**The origin adds an `Expires`**
**header to the object**

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caches the object until the date in the
`Expires` header or for the value of the CloudFront
maximum TTL, whichever is sooner.

**Browser caching**

Browsers cache the object until the date in the
`Expires` header.

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caching depends on the values of the CloudFront minimum TTL and
maximum TTL and the `Expires` header:

- If minimum TTL < `Expires` < maximum
TTL, then CloudFront caches the object until the date and time
in the `Expires` header.

- If `Expires` < minimum TTL, then CloudFront
caches the object for the value of the CloudFront minimum
TTL.

- If `Expires` \> maximum TTL, then CloudFront
caches the object for the value of the CloudFront maximum
TTL.

**Browser caching**

Browsers cache the object until the date and time in the
`Expires` header.

**Origin adds `Cache-Control:**
**no-cache`, `no-store`, and/or**
**`private` directives to the**
**object**

CloudFront and browsers respect the headers.

**CloudFront caching**

CloudFront caches the object for the value of the CloudFront minimum TTL.
[See the warning below this\
table](#stale-if-error).

**Browser caching**

Browsers respect the headers.

###### Warning

- If your minimum TTL is greater than 0, CloudFront uses the cache policy’s
minimum TTL, even if the `Cache-Control: no-cache`,
`no-store`, and/or `private` directives are
present in the origin headers.

- If the origin is reachable, CloudFront gets the object from the
origin and returns it to the viewer.

- If the origin is unreachable and the minimum _or_ maximum TTL value is greater
than 0, CloudFront will serve the object that it got from the origin
previously.

To avoid this behavior, include the `Cache-Control:
								stale-if-error=0` directive with the object returned from the
origin. This causes CloudFront to return an error in response to future
requests if the origin is unreachable, rather than returning the object
that it got from the origin previously.

- CloudFront doesn't cache the HTTP 501 status code (Not Implemented) from an
S3 origin when the origin headers include the `Cache-Control:
  								no-cache`, `no-store`, and/or `private`
directives. This is the default behavior for an S3 origin, even if your
[minimum TTL](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesMinTTL) setting
is greater than 0.

For information about how to change settings for distributions using the CloudFront
console, see [Update a distribution](howtoupdatedistribution.md). For information about how to change
settings for distributions using the CloudFront API, see [UpdateDistribution](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-updatedistribution.md).

## Add headers to your objects by using the Amazon S3 console

You can add the `Cache-Control` or `Expires` header field to your
Amazon S3 objects. To do so, you modify the metadata fields for the object.

###### To add a `Cache-Control` or `Expires` header field to Amazon S3 objects

1. Follow the procedure in the **Replacing system-defined metadata**
    section on the [Editing object\
    metadata in the Amazon S3 console](../../../s3/latest/userguide/add-object-metadata.md) topic in the
    _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

2. For **Key**, choose the name of the header that you are
    adding ( **Cache-Control** or
    **Expires**).

3. For **Value**, enter a header value. For example, for a
    `Cache-Control` header, you could enter
    `max-age=86400`. For `Expires`, you could enter an
    expiration date and time such as `Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:28:00
   						GMT`.

4. Follow the rest of the procedure to save your metadata changes.
