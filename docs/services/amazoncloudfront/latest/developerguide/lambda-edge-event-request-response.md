# How Lambda@Edge works with requests and responses

When you associate a CloudFront distribution with a Lambda@Edge function, CloudFront intercepts
requests and responses at CloudFront edge locations. You can execute Lambda functions when the
following CloudFront events occur:

- When CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)

- Before CloudFront forwards a request to the origin (origin request)

- When CloudFront receives a response from the origin (origin response)

- Before CloudFront returns the response to the viewer (viewer response)

If you're using AWS WAF, the Lambda@Edge viewer request is executed after any AWS WAF rules
are applied.

For more information, see [Work with requests and responses](lambda-generating-http-responses.md) and [Lambda@Edge event structure](lambda-event-structure.md).
