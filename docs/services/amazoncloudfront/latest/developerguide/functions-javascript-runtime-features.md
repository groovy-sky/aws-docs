# JavaScript runtime features for CloudFront Functions

The CloudFront Functions JavaScript runtime environment is compliant with [ECMAScript (ES) version\
5.1](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1) and also supports some features of ES versions 6 through 12.

For the most up-to-date features, we recommend that you use JavaScript runtime
2.0.

The JavaScript runtime 2.0 features has the following changes compared to 1.0:

- Buffer module methods are available

- The following non-standard string prototype methods are not available:

- `String.prototype.bytesFrom()`

- `String.prototype.fromBytes()`

- `String.prototype.fromUTF8()`

- `String.prototype.toBytes()`

- `String.prototype.toUTF8()`

- The cryptographic module has the following changes:

- `hash.digest()` – Return type is changed to
`Buffer` if no encoding is provided

- `hmac.digest()` – Return type is changed to
`Buffer` if no encoding is provided
