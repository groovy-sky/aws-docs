# Set signed cookies using a custom policy

To set a signed cookie that uses a custom policy, complete the following
steps.

###### To set a signed cookie using a custom policy

1. If you're using .NET or Java to create signed URLs, and if you haven't
    reformatted the private key for your key pair from the default .pem format
    to a format compatible with .NET or with Java, do so now. For more
    information, see [Reformat the private key (.NET and Java only)](private-content-trusted-signers.md#private-content-reformatting-private-key).

2. Program your application to send three `Set-Cookie` headers to
    approved viewers (or four, if you want to specify a hash algorithm). You need three `Set-Cookie` headers because
    each `Set-Cookie` header can contain only one name-value pair,
    and a CloudFront signed cookie requires three name-value pairs. The name-value
    pairs are: `CloudFront-Policy`,
    `CloudFront-Signature`, and `CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`.
    You can optionally include a fourth name-value pair,
    `CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm`, to specify the hash algorithm used
    for the signature. The values must be present on the viewer before a user makes the first
    request for a file that you want to control access to.

###### Note

In general, we recommend that you exclude `Expires` and
`Max-Age` attributes. This causes the browser to delete
the cookie when the user closes the browser, which reduces the
possibility of someone getting unauthorized access to your content. For
more information, see [Prevent misuse of signed cookies](private-content-signed-cookies.md#private-content-signed-cookie-misuse).

**The names of cookie attributes are**
**case-sensitive**.

Line breaks are included only to make the attributes more readable.

```nohighlight

Set-Cookie:
CloudFront-Policy=base64 encoded version of the policy statement;
Domain=optional domain name;
Path=/optional directory path;
Secure;
HttpOnly

Set-Cookie:
CloudFront-Signature=hashed and signed version of the policy statement;
Domain=optional domain name;
Path=/optional directory path;

Set-Cookie:
CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id=public key ID for the CloudFront public key whose corresponding private key you're using to generate the signature;

Secure;
HttpOnly

Set-Cookie:
CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm=SHA1 or SHA256;
Domain=optional domain name;
Path=/optional directory path;
Secure;
HttpOnly
```

**(Optional) `Domain`**

The domain name for the requested file. If you don't specify a
`Domain` attribute, the default value is the
domain name in the URL, and it applies only to the specified
domain name, not to subdomains. If you specify a
`Domain` attribute, it also applies to
subdomains. A leading dot in the domain name (for example,
`Domain=.example.com`) is optional. In addition,
if you specify a `Domain` attribute, the domain name
in the URL and the value of the `Domain` attribute
must match.

You can specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned to your
distribution, for example, d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net, but
you can't specify \*.cloudfront.net for the domain name.

If you want to use an alternate domain name such as
example.com in URLs, you must add the alternate domain name to
your distribution regardless of whether you specify the
`Domain` attribute. For more information, see
[Alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesCNAME) in the topic [All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

**(Optional) `Path`**

The path for the requested file. If you don't specify a
`Path` attribute, the default value is the path
in the URL.

**`Secure`**

Requires that the viewer encrypt cookies before sending a
request. We recommend that you send the `Set-Cookie`
header over an HTTPS connection to ensure that the cookie
attributes are protected from man-in-the-middle attacks.

**`HttpOnly`**

Requires that the viewer send the cookie only in HTTP or HTTPS
requests.

**`CloudFront-Policy`**

Your policy statement in JSON format, with empty spaces
removed, then base64 encoded. For more information, see [Create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-signature-cookies).

The policy statement controls the access that a signed cookie
grants to a user. It includes the files that the user can
access, an expiration date and time, an optional date and time
that the URL becomes valid, and an optional IP address or range
of IP addresses that are allowed to access the file.

**`CloudFront-Signature`**

A hashed, signed, and base64-encoded version of the JSON
policy statement. For more information, see [Create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-signature-cookies).

**`CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`**

The ID for a CloudFront public key, for example,
`K2JCJMDEHXQW5F`. The public key ID tells CloudFront
which public key to use to validate the signed URL. CloudFront
compares the information in the signature with the information
in the policy statement to verify that the URL has not been
tampered with.

This public key must belong to a key group that is a trusted
signer in the distribution. For more information, see [Specify signers that can create signed URLs and signed cookies](private-content-trusted-signers.md).

**`CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm`**

(Optional) The hash algorithm used to create the signature. Supported values are
`SHA1` and `SHA256`. If you don't include this cookie,
CloudFront defaults to `SHA1`.

## Example `Set-Cookie` headers for custom policies

See the following examples of `Set-Cookie` header pairs.

If you want to use an alternate domain name such as example.org in URLs, you
must add the alternate domain name to your distribution regardless of whether
you specify the `Domain` attribute. For more information, see [Alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesCNAME)
in the topic [All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

###### Example 1

You can use the `Set-Cookie` headers for one signed cookie when
you're using the domain name that is associated with your distribution in
the URLs for your files.

###### Example 2

You can use the `Set-Cookie` headers for one signed cookie when
you're using an alternate domain name (example.org) in the URLs for your
files.

Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm=SHA256; Domain=example.org; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
```

###### Example 3

You can use the `Set-Cookie` header pairs for a signed request
when you're using the domain name that is associated with your distribution
in the URLs for your files.

## Create a policy statement for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy

To create a policy statement for a custom policy, complete the following
steps. For several example policy statements that control access to files in a
variety of ways, see [Example policy statements for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-signed-cookies-examples).

###### To create the policy statement for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy

1. Construct the policy statement using the following JSON format.

```json

{
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Resource": "URL of the file",
               "Condition": {
                   "DateLessThan": {
                       "AWS:EpochTime":required ending date and time in Unix time format and UTC
                   },
                   "DateGreaterThan": {
                       "AWS:EpochTime":optional beginning date and time in Unix time format and UTC
                   },
                   "IpAddress": {
                       "AWS:SourceIp": "optional IP address"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
}
```

Note the following:

- You can include only one statement.

- Use UTF-8 character encoding.

- Include all punctuation and parameter names exactly as
specified. Abbreviations for parameter names are not
accepted.

- The order of the parameters in the `Condition`
section doesn't matter.

- For information about the values for `Resource`,
`DateLessThan`, `DateGreaterThan`, and
`IpAddress`, see [Values that you specify in the policy statement for a custom policy for signed cookies](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-cookies-values).

2. Remove all empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from
    the policy statement. You might have to include escape characters in the
    string in application code.

3. Base64-encode the policy statement using MIME base64 encoding. For
    more information, see [Section 6.8,\
    Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) in _RFC 2045, MIME_
_(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet_
_Message Bodies_.

4. Replace characters that are invalid in a URL query string with
    characters that are valid. The following table lists invalid and valid
    characters.

Replace these invalid charactersWith these valid characters

+

\- (hyphen)

=

\_ (underscore)

/

~ (tilde)

5. Include the resulting value in your `Set-Cookie` header
    after `CloudFront-Policy=`.

6. Create a signature for the `Set-Cookie` header for
    `CloudFront-Signature` by hashing, signing, and
    base64-encoding the policy statement. For more information, see [Create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy](#private-content-custom-policy-signature-cookies).

### Values that you specify in the policy statement for a custom policy for signed cookies

When you create a policy statement for a custom policy, you specify the
following values.

**Resource**

The base URL including your query strings, if any:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/horizon.jpg?size=large&license=yes`

###### Important

If you omit the `Resource` parameter, users can
access all of the files associated with any distribution
that is associated with the key pair that you use to create
the signed URL.

You can specify only one value for
`Resource`.

Note the following:

- **Protocol** – The
value must begin with `http://` or
`https://`.

- **Query string**
**parameters** – If you have no query
string parameters, omit the question mark.

- **Wildcards** –
You can use the wildcard character that matches zero or
more characters (\*) or the wild-card character that
matches exactly one character (?) anywhere in the
string. For example, the value:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/*game_download.zip*`

would include (for example) the following
files:

- `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/game_download.zip`

- `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/example_game_download.zip?license=yes`

- `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/test_game_download.zip?license=temp`

- **Alternate domain**
**names** – If you specify an
alternate domain name (CNAME) in the URL, you must
specify the alternate domain name when referencing the
file in your webpage or application. Do not specify the
Amazon S3 URL for the file.

**DateLessThan**

The expiration date and time for the URL in Unix time format
(in seconds) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Do not
enclose the value in quotation marks.

For example, March 16, 2015 10:00 am UTC converts to
1426500000 in Unix time format.

For more information, see [When CloudFront checks expiration date and time in a signed cookie](private-content-signed-cookies.md#private-content-check-expiration-cookie).

**DateGreaterThan (Optional)**

An optional start date and time for the URL in Unix time
format (in seconds) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Users
are not allowed to access the file on or before the specified
date and time. Do not enclose the value in quotation marks.

**IpAddress (Optional)**

The IP address of the client making the GET request. Note the
following:

- To allow any IP address to access the file, omit the
`IpAddress` parameter.

- You can specify either one IP address or one IP
address range. For example, you can't set the policy to
allow access if the client's IP address is in one of two
separate ranges.

- To allow access from a single IP address, you
specify:

`"` `IPv4 IP
  												address` `/32"`

- You must specify IP address ranges in standard IPv4
CIDR format (for example, `192.0.2.0/24`).
For more information, go to _RFC 4632,_
_Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet_
_Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan_,
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632).

###### Important

IP addresses in IPv6 format, such as
2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334, are not supported.

If you're using a custom policy that includes
`IpAddress`, do not enable IPv6 for the
distribution. If you want to restrict access to some
content by IP address and support IPv6 requests for
other content, you can create two distributions. For
more information, see [Enable IPv6 (viewer requests)](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesEnableIPv6) in
the topic [All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

## Example policy statements for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy

The following example policy statements show how to control access to a
specific file, all of the files in a directory, or all of the files associated
with a key pair ID. The examples also show how to control access from an
individual IP address or a range of IP addresses, and how to prevent users from
using the signed cookie after a specified date and time.

If you copy and paste any of these examples, remove any empty spaces (including
tabs and newline characters), replace the values with your own values, and
include a newline character after the closing brace ( } ).

For more information, see [Values that you specify in the policy statement for a custom policy for signed cookies](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-cookies-values).

- [Example policy statement: Access all files in a directory from a range of IP addresses](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-signed-cookies-example-all-objects)

- [Example policy statement: Access all files associated with a key pair ID from one IP address](#private-content-custom-policy-statement-signed-cookies-example-one-ip)

### Example policy statement: Access one file from a range of IP addresses

The following example custom policy in a signed cookie specifies that a
user can access the file
`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/game_download.zip` from IP
addresses in the range `192.0.2.0/24` until January 1, 2023 10:00
am UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/game_download.zip",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "AWS:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
                },
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1767290400
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example policy statement: Access all files in a directory from a range of IP addresses

The following example custom policy allows you to create signed cookies
for any file in the `training` directory, as indicated by the \*
wildcard character in the `Resource` parameter. Users can access
the file from an IP address in the range `192.0.2.0/24` until
January 1, 2013 10:00 am UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/training/*",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "AWS:SourceIp": "192.0.2.0/24"
                },
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1767290400
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Each signed cookie in which you use this policy includes a base URL that
identifies a specific file, for example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/training/orientation.pdf`

### Example policy statement: Access all files associated with a key pair ID from one IP address

The following sample custom policy allows you to set signed cookies for
any file associated with any distribution, as indicated by the \* wildcard
character in the `Resource` parameter. The user must use the IP
address `192.0.2.10/32`. (The value `192.0.2.10/32` in
CIDR notation refers to a single IP address, `192.0.2.10`.) The
files are available only from January 1, 2013 10:00 am UTC until January 2,
2013 10:00 am UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "https://*",
            "Condition": {
                "IpAddress": {
                    "AWS:SourceIp": "192.0.2.10/32"
                },
                "DateGreaterThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1767290400
                },
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1767376800
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Each signed cookie in which you use this policy includes a base URL that
identifies a specific file in a specific CloudFront distribution, for
example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/training/orientation.pdf`

The signed cookie also includes a key pair ID, which must be associated
with a trusted key group in the distribution (d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net) that you
specify in the base URL.

## Create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy

The signature for a signed cookie that uses a custom policy is a hashed,
signed, and base64-encoded version of the policy statement.

For additional information and examples of how to hash, sign, and encode the
policy statement, see:

- [Linux commands and OpenSSL for base64 encoding and encryption](private-content-linux-openssl.md)

- [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md)

###### Note

The linked examples use SHA-1 by default. To use SHA-256 instead, replace `sha1` with `sha256` in the OpenSSL commands and include the `CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm` cookie with a value of `SHA256`.

###### To create a signature for a signed cookie by using a custom policy

1. Use the SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash function and RSA to hash and sign the JSON policy
    statement that you created in the procedure [To create the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.md#private-content-custom-policy-creating-policy-procedure). Use the version of the policy statement that no longer includes
    empty spaces but that has not yet been base64-encoded.

If you use SHA-256, you must include the `CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm` cookie with a value of `SHA256`.

For the private key that is required by the hash function, use a
    private key whose public key is in an active trusted key group for the
    distribution.

###### Note

The method that you use to hash and sign the policy statement
depends on your programming language and platform. For sample code,
see [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md).

2. Remove empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from the
    hashed and signed string.

3. Base64-encode the string using MIME base64 encoding. For more
    information, see [Section 6.8,\
    Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) in _RFC 2045, MIME_
_(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet_
_Message Bodies_.

4. Replace characters that are invalid in a URL query string with
    characters that are valid. The following table lists invalid and valid
    characters.

Replace these invalid charactersWith these valid characters

+

\- (hyphen)

=

\_ (underscore)

/

~ (tilde)

5. Include the resulting value in the `Set-Cookie` header for
    the `CloudFront-Signature=` name-value pair, and return to
    [To set a signed cookie using a custom policy](#private-content-setting-signed-cookie-custom-policy-procedure) to add the `Set-Cookie` header for
    `CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`.
