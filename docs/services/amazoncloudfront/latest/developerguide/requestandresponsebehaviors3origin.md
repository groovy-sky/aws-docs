### Caching duration and minimum TTL

To control how long your objects stay in a CloudFront cache before CloudFront forwards
another request to your origin, you can:

- Configure your origin to add a `Cache-Control` or an
`Expires` header field to each object.

- Specify a value for Minimum TTL in CloudFront cache behaviors.

- Use the default value of 24 hours.

For more information, see [Manage how long content stays in the cache (expiration)](expiration.md).

### Client IP addresses

If a viewer sends a request to CloudFront and doesn't include an
`X-Forwarded-For` request header, CloudFront gets the IP address of the
viewer from the TCP connection, adds an `X-Forwarded-For` header that
includes the IP address, and forwards the request to the origin. For example, if
CloudFront gets the IP address `192.0.2.2` from the TCP connection, it
forwards the following header to the origin:

`X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.2.2`

If a viewer sends a request to CloudFront and includes an
`X-Forwarded-For` request header, CloudFront gets the IP address of the
viewer from the TCP connection, appends it to the end of the
`X-Forwarded-For` header, and forwards the request to the origin.
For example, if the viewer request includes `X-Forwarded-For:
						192.0.2.4,192.0.2.3` and CloudFront gets the IP address
`192.0.2.2` from the TCP connection, it forwards the following
header to the origin:

`X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.2.4,192.0.2.3,192.0.2.2`

###### Note

The `X-Forwarded-For` header contains IPv4 addresses (such as
192.0.2.44) and IPv6 addresses (such as
2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).

### Conditional GET requests

When CloudFront receives a request for an object that has expired from an edge
cache, it forwards the request to the Amazon S3 origin to get the latest version of
the object or to get confirmation from Amazon S3 that the CloudFront edge cache already has
the latest version. When Amazon S3 originally sent the object to CloudFront, it included an
`ETag` value and a `LastModified` value in the
response. In the new request that CloudFront forwards to Amazon S3, CloudFront adds one or both
of the following headers:

- An `If-Match` or `If-None-Match` header that
contains the `ETag` value for the expired version of the
object.

- An `If-Modified-Since` header that contains the
`LastModified` value for the expired version of the
object.

Amazon S3 uses this information to determine whether the object has been updated
and, therefore, whether to return the entire object to CloudFront or to return only an
HTTP 304 status code (not modified).

### Cookies

Amazon S3 doesn't process cookies. If you configure a cache behavior to forward
cookies to an Amazon S3 origin, CloudFront forwards the cookies, but Amazon S3 ignores them. All
future requests for the same object, regardless if you vary the cookie, are
served from the existing object in the cache.

### Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

If you want CloudFront to respect Amazon S3 cross-origin resource sharing settings,
configure CloudFront to forward selected headers to Amazon S3. For more information, see
[Cache content based on request headers](header-caching.md).

### GET requests that include a body

If a viewer `GET` request includes a body, CloudFront returns an HTTP
status code 403 (Forbidden) to the viewer.

### HTTP methods

If you configure CloudFront to process all of the HTTP methods that it supports,
CloudFront accepts the following requests from viewers and forwards them to your Amazon S3
origin:

- `DELETE`

- `GET`

- `HEAD`

- `OPTIONS`

- `PATCH`

- `POST`

- `PUT`

CloudFront always caches responses to `GET` and `HEAD`
requests. You can also configure CloudFront to cache responses to `OPTIONS`
requests. CloudFront doesn't cache responses to requests that use the other
methods.

If you want to use multi-part uploads to add objects to an Amazon S3 bucket, you
must add a CloudFront origin access control (OAC) to your distribution and give the
OAC the needed permissions. For more information, see [Restrict access to an Amazon S3 origin](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

###### Important

If you configure CloudFront to accept and forward to Amazon S3 all of the HTTP
methods that CloudFront supports, you must create a CloudFront OAC to restrict access to
your Amazon S3 content and give the OAC the required permissions. For example, if
you configure CloudFront to accept and forward these methods because you want to
use the `PUT` method, you must configure Amazon S3 bucket policies to
handle `DELETE` requests appropriately so viewers can't delete
resources that you don't want them to. For more information, see [Restrict access to an Amazon S3 origin](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

For information about the operations supported by Amazon S3, see the [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html).

### HTTP request headers that CloudFront removes or updates

CloudFront removes or updates some headers before forwarding requests to your Amazon S3
origin. For most headers this behavior is the same as for custom origins. For a
full list of HTTP request headers and how CloudFront processes them, see [HTTP request headers and CloudFront behavior (custom and Amazon S3 origins)](requestandresponsebehaviorcustomorigin.md#request-custom-headers-behavior).

### Maximum length of a request and maximum length of a URL

The maximum length of a request, including the path, the query string (if
any), and headers, is 20,480 bytes.

CloudFront constructs a URL from the request. The maximum length of this URL is 8192
bytes.

If a request or a URL exceeds the maximum length, CloudFront returns the HTTP status
code 413 (Request Entity Too Large), to the viewer, and then terminates the TCP
connection to the viewer.

### OCSP stapling

When a viewer submits an HTTPS request for an object, CloudFront or the viewer must
confirm with the certificate authority (CA) that the SSL certificate for the
domain hasn't been revoked. OCSP stapling speeds up certificate validation by
allowing CloudFront to validate the certificate and to cache the response from the CA,
so the client doesn't need to validate the certificate directly with the
CA.

The performance improvement of OCSP stapling is more pronounced when CloudFront
receives many HTTPS requests for objects in the same domain. Each server in a
CloudFront edge location must submit a separate validation request. When CloudFront receives
a lot of HTTPS requests for the same domain, every server in the edge location
soon has a response from the CA that it can staple to a packet in the SSL
handshake. When the viewer is satisfied that the certificate is valid, CloudFront can
serve the requested object. If your distribution doesn't get much traffic in a
CloudFront edge location, new requests are more likely to be directed to a server that
hasn't validated the certificate with the CA yet. In that case, the viewer
separately performs the validation step and the CloudFront server serves the object.
That CloudFront server also submits a validation request to the CA, so the next time
it receives a request that includes the same domain name, it has a validation
response from the CA.

### Protocols

CloudFront forwards HTTP or HTTPS requests to the origin server based on the
protocol of the viewer request, either HTTP or HTTPS.

###### Important

If your Amazon S3 bucket is configured as a website endpoint, you can't
configure CloudFront to use HTTPS to communicate with your origin because Amazon S3
doesn't support HTTPS connections in that configuration.

### Query strings

You can configure whether CloudFront forwards query string parameters to your Amazon S3
origin. For more information, see [Cache content based on query string parameters](querystringparameters.md).

### Origin connection timeout and attempts

_Origin_
_connection timeout_ is the number of seconds that CloudFront waits when
trying to establish a connection to the origin.

_Origin connection attempts_ is the number of
times that CloudFront attempts to connect to the origin.

Together, these settings determine how long CloudFront tries to connect to the
origin before failing over to the secondary origin (in the case of an origin
group) or returning an error response to the viewer. By default, CloudFront waits as
long as 30 seconds (3 attempts of 10 seconds each) before attempting to connect
to the secondary origin or returning an error response. You can reduce this time
by specifying a shorter connection timeout, fewer attempts, or both.

For more information, see [Control origin timeouts and attempts](high-availability-origin-failover.md#controlling-attempts-and-timeouts).

### Origin response timeout

The _origin response timeout_, also known as
the _origin read timeout_ or _origin request timeout_, applies to both of the
following:

- The amount of time, in seconds, that CloudFront waits for a response after
forwarding a request to the origin.

- The amount of time, in seconds, that CloudFront waits after receiving a
packet of a response from the origin and before receiving the next
packet.

CloudFront behavior depends on the HTTP method of the viewer request:

- `GET` and `HEAD` requests – If the origin
doesn’t respond within 30 seconds or stops responding for 30 seconds,
CloudFront drops the connection. If the specified number of [origin connection\
attempts](downloaddistvaluesorigin.md#origin-connection-attempts) is more than 1, CloudFront tries again to get a complete
response. CloudFront tries up to 3 times, as determined by the value of the
_origin connection attempts_
setting. If the origin doesn’t respond during the final attempt, CloudFront
doesn’t try again until it receives another request for content on the
same origin.

- `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`,
`PUT`, and `POST` requests – If the
origin doesn’t respond within 30 seconds, CloudFront drops the connection and
doesn’t try again to contact the origin. The client can resubmit the
request if necessary.

You can’t change the response timeout for an Amazon S3 origin (an S3 bucket that is
_not_ configured with static website
hosting).

### Simultaneous requests for the same object (request collapsing)

When a CloudFront edge location receives a request for
an object and the object isn't in the cache or the cached object is
expired, CloudFront immediately sends the request to the origin. However, if there are
simultaneous requests for the same object—that is, if additional requests for
the same object (with the same cache key) arrive at the edge location before
CloudFront receives the response to the first request—CloudFront pauses before forwarding
the additional requests to the origin. This brief pause helps to reduce the load
on the origin. CloudFront sends the response from the original request to all the
requests that it received while it was paused. This is called
_request collapsing_. In CloudFront logs, the first
request is identified as a `Miss` in the
`x-edge-result-type` field, and the collapsed requests are identified
as a `Hit`. For more information about CloudFront logs, see
[CloudFront and edge function logging](logging.md).

CloudFront only collapses requests that share a [cache\
key](understanding-the-cache-key.md). If the additional requests do not share the same cache
key because, for example, you configured CloudFront to cache based on request headers
or cookies or query strings, CloudFront forwards all the requests with a unique cache
key to your origin.

If you want to prevent all request collapsing, you can use the managed cache policy `CachingDisabled`, which also prevents caching.
For more information, see [Use managed cache policies](using-managed-cache-policies.md).

If you want to prevent request collapsing for specific objects, you can
set the minimum TTL for the cache behavior to 0 _and_ configure the origin to send `Cache-Control:
						private`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Cache-Control:
						no-cache`, `Cache-Control: max-age=0`, or
`Cache-Control: s-maxage=0`. These configurations will increase
the load on your origin and introduce additional latency for the simultaneous
requests that are paused while CloudFront waits for the response to the first
request.

###### Important

Currently, CloudFront doesn't support request collapsing if you enable cookie forwarding in the [cache policy](controlling-the-cache-key.md), the [origin request\
policy](controlling-origin-requests.md), or the legacy cache settings.

### Canceled requests

If an object is not in the edge cache, and if a viewer terminates a session
(for example, closes a browser) after CloudFront gets the object from your origin but
before it can deliver the requested object, CloudFront does not cache the object in
the edge location.

### HTTP response headers that CloudFront removes or updates

CloudFront removes or updates the following header fields before forwarding the
response from your Amazon S3 origin to the viewer:

- `X-Amz-Id-2`

- `X-Amz-Request-Id`

- `Set-Cookie` – If you configure CloudFront to forward
cookies, it will forward the `Set-Cookie` header field to
clients. For more information, see [Cache content based on cookies](cookies.md).

- `Trailer`

- `Transfer-Encoding` – If your Amazon S3 origin returns
this header field, CloudFront sets the value to `chunked` before
returning the response to the viewer.

- `Upgrade`

- `Via` – CloudFront sets the value to the following in the
response to the viewer:

`Via: ` `http-version` `alphanumeric-string` `.cloudfront.net
  								(CloudFront)`

For example, the value is something like the following:

`Via: 1.1 1026589cc7887e7a0dc7827b4example.cloudfront.net
  								(CloudFront)`

### Maximum cacheable file size

The maximum size of a response body that CloudFront saves in its cache is
50 GB. This includes
chunked transfer responses that don't specify the `Content-Length`
header value.

You can use CloudFront to cache an object that is larger than this size by using range
requests to request the objects in parts that are each 50 GB or smaller. CloudFront
caches these parts because each of them is 50 GB or smaller. After the viewer
retrieves all the parts of the object, it can reconstruct the original, larger
object. For more information, see [Use range requests to cache large objects](rangegets.md#cache-large-objects-with-range-requests).

### Redirects

You can configure an Amazon S3 bucket to redirect all requests to another host
name; this can be another Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server. If you configure a
bucket to redirect all requests and if the bucket is the origin for a CloudFront
distribution, we recommend that you configure the bucket to redirect all
requests to a CloudFront distribution using either the domain name for the
distribution (for example, d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net) or an alternate domain
name (a CNAME) that is associated with a distribution (for example,
example.com). Otherwise, viewer requests bypass CloudFront, and the objects are served
directly from the new origin.

###### Note

If you redirect requests to an alternate domain name, you must also update
the DNS service for your domain by adding a CNAME record. For more
information, see [Use custom URLs by adding alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](cnames.md).

Here's what happens when you configure a bucket to redirect all
requests:

1. A viewer (for example, a browser) requests an object from CloudFront.

2. CloudFront forwards the request to the Amazon S3 bucket that is the origin for
    your distribution.

3. Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently) as well as
    the new location.

4. CloudFront caches the redirect status code and the new location, and returns
    the values to the viewer. CloudFront does not follow the redirect to get the
    object from the new location.

5. The viewer sends another request for the object, but this time the
    viewer specifies the new location that it got from CloudFront:

- If the Amazon S3 bucket is redirecting all requests to a CloudFront
distribution, using either the domain name for the distribution
or an alternate domain name, CloudFront requests the object from the
Amazon S3 bucket or the HTTP server in the new location. When the new
location returns the object, CloudFront returns it to the viewer and
caches it in an edge location.

- If the Amazon S3 bucket is redirecting requests to another
location, the second request bypasses CloudFront. The Amazon S3 bucket or
the HTTP server in the new location returns the object directly
to the viewer, so the object is never cached in a CloudFront edge
cache.
