# Use managed cache policies

CloudFront provides a set of managed cache policies that you can attach to any of your
distribution's cache behaviors. With a managed cache policy, you don't need to write or
maintain your own cache policy. The managed policies use settings that are optimized for
specific use cases.

To use a managed cache policy, you attach it to a cache behavior in your distribution.
The process is the same as when you create a cache policy, but instead of creating a new
one, you just attach one of the managed cache policies. You attach the policy either by
name (with the console) or by ID (with the AWS CLI or SDKs). The names and IDs are listed
in the following section.

For more information, see [Create cache policies](cache-key-create-cache-policy.md).

The following topics describe the managed cache policies that you can use.

## Amplify

[View\
this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

This policy is designed for use with an origin that is an [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify) web app.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`2e54312d-136d-493c-8eb9-b001f22f67d2`

This policy has the following settings:

- **Minimum TTL:** 2 seconds

- **Maximum TTL:** 600 seconds (10
minutes)

- **Default TTL:** 2 seconds

- **Headers included in cache key:**

- `Authorization`

- `CloudFront-Viewer-Country`

- `Host`

The normalized `Accept-Encoding` header is also included
because the cache compressed objects setting is enabled. For more
information, see [Compression\
support](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md#cache-policy-compressed-objects).

- **Cookies included in cache key:** All
cookies are included.

- **Query strings included in cache key:** All
query strings are included.

- **Cache compressed objects setting:**
Enabled. For more information, see [Compression support](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md#cache-policy-compressed-objects).

###### Warning

Because this policy has a minimum TTL greater than 0, CloudFront will cache content for at least the duration specified in the cache policy's minimum TTL, even if the `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `no-store`, or `private` directives are present in the origin headers.

### AWS Amplify Hosting cache policies

Amplify uses the following managed cache policies to optimize the default cache
configuration for customers' applications:

- [Amplify-Default](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

- [Amplify-DefaultNoCookies](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

- [Amplify-ImageOptimization](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

- [Amplify-StaticContent](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

###### Note

These policies are only used by Amplify. We don't recommend that you use
these policies for your distributions.

For more information about managing cache configuration for your Amplify hosted
application, see [Managing cache configuration](../../../amplify/latest/userguide/caching.md)
in the _Amplify Hosting User Guide_.

## CachingDisabled

[View\
this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

This policy disables caching. This policy is useful for dynamic content and for
requests that are not cacheable.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`4135ea2d-6df8-44a3-9df3-4b5a84be39ad`

This policy has the following settings:

- **Minimum TTL:** 0 seconds

- **Maximum TTL:** 0 seconds

- **Default TTL:** 0 seconds

- **Headers included in the cache key:**
None

- **Cookies included in the cache key:**
None

- **Query strings included in the cache key:**
None

- **Cache compressed objects setting:**
Disabled

## CachingOptimized

[View\
this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

This policy is designed to optimize cache efficiency by minimizing the values that
CloudFront includes in the cache key. CloudFront doesn't include any query strings or cookies in
the cache key, and only includes the normalized `Accept-Encoding` header.
This enables CloudFront to separately cache objects in the Gzip and Brotli compressions
formats when the origin returns them or when [CloudFront edge compression](servingcompressedfiles.md) is enabled.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`658327ea-f89d-4fab-a63d-7e88639e58f6`

This policy has the following settings:

- **Minimum TTL:** 1 second.

- **Maximum TTL:** 31,536,000 seconds (365
days).

- **Default TTL:** 86,400 seconds (24
hours).

- **Headers included in the cache key:** None
are explicitly included. The normalized `Accept-Encoding` header
is included because the cache compressed objects setting is enabled. For
more information, see [Compression support](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md#cache-policy-compressed-objects).

- **Cookies included in the cache key:**
None.

- **Query strings included in the cache key:**
None.

- **Cache compressed objects setting:**
Enabled. For more information, see [Compression support](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md#cache-policy-compressed-objects).

###### Warning

Because this policy has a minimum TTL greater than 0, CloudFront will cache content for at least the duration specified in the cache policy's minimum TTL, even if the `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `no-store`, or `private` directives are present in the origin headers.

## CachingOptimizedForUncompressedObjects

[View\
this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

This policy is designed to optimize cache efficiency by minimizing the values
included in the cache key. No query strings, headers, or cookies are included. This
policy is identical to the previous one, but it disables the cache compressed
objects setting.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`b2884449-e4de-46a7-ac36-70bc7f1ddd6d`

This policy has the following settings:

- **Minimum TTL:** 1 second

- **Maximum TTL:** 31,536,000 seconds (365
days)

- **Default TTL:** 86,400 seconds (24
hours)

- **Headers included in the cache key:**
None

- **Cookies included in the cache key:**
None

- **Query strings included in the cache key:**
None

- **Cache compressed objects setting:**
Disabled

###### Warning

Because this policy has a minimum TTL greater than 0, CloudFront will cache content for at least the duration specified in the cache policy's minimum TTL, even if the `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `no-store`, or `private` directives are present in the origin headers.

days)

- **Default TTL:** 86,400 seconds (24
hours)

- **Headers included in the cache key:**

- `Origin`

The normalized `Accept-Encoding` header is also included
because the cache compressed objects setting is enabled for Gzip. For more
information, see [Compression\
support](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md#cache-policy-compressed-objects).
