# Create a custom error page for specific HTTP status codes

If you’d rather display a custom error message instead of the default
message—for example, a page that uses the same formatting as the rest of your
website—you can have CloudFront return to the viewer an object (such as an HTML file)
that contains your custom error message.

To specify the file that you want to return and the errors for which the file should
be returned, you update your CloudFront distribution to specify those values. For more
information, see [Configure error response behavior](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages-procedure.html).

For example, the following is a custom error page:

You can specify a different object for each supported HTTP status code, or you can use
the same object for all of the supported status codes. You can choose to specify custom
error pages for some status codes and not for others.

The objects that you’re serving through CloudFront can be unavailable for a variety of
reasons. These fall into two broad categories:

- _Client errors_ indicate a problem with the
request. For example, an object with the specified name isn’t available, or the
user doesn’t have the permissions required to get an object in your Amazon S3 bucket.
When a client error occurs, the origin returns an HTTP status code in the 4xx
range to CloudFront.

- _Server errors_ indicate a problem with the
origin server. For example, the HTTP server is busy or unavailable. When a
server error occurs, either your origin server returns an HTTP status code in
the 5xx range to CloudFront, or CloudFront doesn’t get a response from your origin server
for a certain period of time and assumes a 504 status code (Gateway
Timeout).

The HTTP status codes for which CloudFront can return a custom error page include the
following:

- 400, 403, 404, 405, 414, 416

- 500, 501, 502, 503, 504

###### Notes

- If CloudFront detects that the request might be unsafe, CloudFront returns a
400 (Bad Request) error instead of a custom error page.

- You can create a custom error page for HTTP status code 416
(Requested Range Not Satisfiable), and you can change the HTTP
status code that CloudFront returns to viewers when your origin returns a
status code 416 to CloudFront. For more information, see [Change response codes returned by CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages-response-code.html). However,
CloudFront doesn't cache status code 416 responses, so even if you
specify a value for **Error Caching Minimum TTL**
for status code 416, CloudFront doesn't use it.

- In some cases, CloudFront doesn’t return a custom error page for the
HTTP 503 status code even if you configure CloudFront to do so. If the
CloudFront error code is `Capacity Exceeded` or `Limit
  									Exceeded`, CloudFront returns a 503 status code to the viewer
without using your custom error page.

- If you created a custom error page, CloudFront will return
`Connection: close` or `Connection:
  									keep-alive` for the following response codes:

- CloudFront returns `Connection: close` for status
codes: 400, 405, 414, 416, 500, 501

- CloudFront returns `Connection: keep-alive` for
status codes: 403, 404, 502, 503, 504
