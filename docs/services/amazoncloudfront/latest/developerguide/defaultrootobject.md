# Specify a default root object

You can configure CloudFront to return a specific object (the default root object) when a
user (viewer) requests the root URL for your distribution instead of requesting an
object in your distribution. You can use a default root object to avoid exposing the
contents of your distribution.

## How to specify a default root object

To avoid exposing the contents of your distribution or returning an error, specify
a default root object for your distribution. You can specify the exact file name or
the path to the file. For example, if your root object is an
`index.html` file, you can specify that file name. If your
`index.html` file is in another folder, specify the path
instead such as
`exampleFolderName/index.html`. If
you set a path to the default root object, viewer requests to the root URL of the
distribution will return the specified file from that path. You can use a file path
to have more flexibility to organize your content at the origin, as your default
root object can be in a folder instead of at the root level.

###### To specify a default root object for your distribution

1. Upload the default root object to the origin that your distribution points
    to.

The file can be any type supported by CloudFront. For a list of constraints on
    the file name, see the `DefaultRootObject` element in [DistributionConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_DistributionConfig.html) of the
    _Amazon CloudFront API Reference_.

###### Note

If the file name of the default root object is too long or contains an
invalid character, CloudFront returns the error `HTTP 400 Bad Request -
   								InvalidDefaultRootObject`. In addition, CloudFront caches the code
for 10 seconds (by default) and writes the results to the access
logs.

2. Confirm that the permissions for the object grant CloudFront at least read
    access.

For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see [Identity and\
    access management in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the
    _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

3. Update your distribution to refer to the default root object by using the
    CloudFront console or the CloudFront API.

To specify a default root object by using the CloudFront console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the list of distributions in the top pane, select the
       distribution to update.

3. In the **Settings** pane, on the
       **General** tab, choose
       **Edit**.

4. In the **Edit settings** dialog box, in the
       **Default root object** field, enter the file
       name or path to the default root object.

      ###### Tip

      Your string can't begin with a forward slash ( `/`).
      Only specify the object name or the path to the object. For
      example, use `index.html` or
      `exampleFolderName/index.html`.
      Specifying a
      `/exampleFolderName/index.html`
      or `/index.html` can
      lead to a [403 Access\
      Denied error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/http-403-permission-denied.html).

5. Choose **Save changes**.

To update your configuration using the CloudFront API, specify a value for the
`DefaultRootObject` element in your distribution. For
information about using the CloudFront API to specify a default root object, see
[UpdateDistribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html) in the
_Amazon CloudFront API Reference_.

4. Confirm that you have enabled the default root object by requesting your
    root URL. If your browser doesn't display the default root object, perform
    the following steps:
1. Confirm that your distribution is fully deployed by viewing the
       status of your distribution in the CloudFront console.

2. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to verify that you granted the correct
       permissions and that you correctly updated the configuration of your
       distribution to specify the default root object.

## How default root object works

Suppose the following request points to the object `image.jpg`:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg`

In contrast, the following request points to the root URL of the same distribution
instead of to a specific object, as in the first example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/`

When you define a default root object, an end-user request that calls the root of
your distribution returns the default root object. For example, if you designate the
file `index.html` as your default root object, a request for:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/`

Returns:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/index.html`

###### Note

CloudFront does not determine whether a URL with multiple trailing slashes
( `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net///`) is equivalent to
`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/`. Your origin server makes that
comparison.

If you define a default root object, an end-user request for a subdirectory of
your distribution does not return the default root object. For example, suppose
`index.html` is your default root object and that CloudFront receives an
end-user request for the `install` directory under your CloudFront
distribution:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/install/`

CloudFront does not return the default root object even if a copy of
`index.html` appears in the `install` directory. However,
if you specified a _path_ to your default root object,
( `install/index.html`)CloudFront will return the default root
object for end-user requests for the `install` directory

If you configure your distribution to allow all of the HTTP methods that CloudFront
supports, the default root object applies to all methods. For example, if your
default root object is index.php and you write your application to submit a
`POST` request to the root of your domain (https://example.com), CloudFront
sends the request to https://example.com/index.php.

The behavior of CloudFront default root objects is different from the behavior of Amazon S3
index documents. When you configure an Amazon S3 bucket as a website and specify the
index document, Amazon S3 returns the index document even if a user requests a
subdirectory in the bucket. (A copy of the index document must appear in every
subdirectory.) For more information about configuring Amazon S3 buckets as websites and
about index documents, see the [Hosting\
Websites on Amazon S3](../../../s3/latest/userguide/websitehosting.md) chapter in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### Important

Remember that a default root object applies only to your CloudFront distribution.
You still need to manage security for your origin. For example, if you are using
an Amazon S3 origin, you still need to set your Amazon S3 bucket ACLs appropriately to
ensure the level of access you want on your bucket.

## How CloudFront works if you don’t define a root object

If you don't define a default root object, requests for the root of your
distribution pass to your origin server. If you are using an Amazon S3 origin, any of the
following might be returned:

- A list of the contents of your Amazon S3 bucket
– Under any of the following conditions, the contents of your origin are
visible to anyone who uses CloudFront to access your distribution:

- Your bucket is not properly configured.

- The Amazon S3 permissions on the bucket associated with your
distribution and on the objects in the bucket grant access to
_everyone_.

- An end user accesses your origin using your origin root URL.

- A list of the private contents of your
origin – If you configure your origin as a private distribution
(only you and CloudFront have access), the contents of the Amazon S3 bucket associated
with your distribution are visible to anyone who has the credentials to
access your distribution through CloudFront. In this case, users are not able to
access your content through your origin root URL. For more information about
distributing private content, see [Serve private content with signed URLs and signed cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html).

- `Error 403 Forbidden`—CloudFront returns this error if the
permissions on the Amazon S3 bucket associated with your distribution or the
permissions on the objects in that bucket deny access to CloudFront and to
everyone.
