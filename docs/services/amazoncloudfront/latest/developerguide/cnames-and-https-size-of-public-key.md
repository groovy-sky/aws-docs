# Determine the size of the public key in an SSL/TLS RSA certificate

When you’re using CloudFront alternate domain names and HTTPS, the maximum size of the public key
in an SSL/TLS RSA certificate is 4096 bits. (This is the key size, not the number of
characters in the public key.) If you use AWS Certificate Manager for your certificates, although
ACM supports larger RSA keys, you cannot use the larger keys with CloudFront.

You can determine the size of the RSA public key by running the following OpenSSL
command:

```nohighlight

openssl x509 -in path and filename of SSL/TLS certificate -text -noout
```

Where:

- `-in` specifies the path and file name of your SSL/TLS RSA certificate.

- `-text` causes OpenSSL to display the length of the RSA public key in
bits.

- `-noout` prevents OpenSSL from displaying the public
key.

Example output:

```nohighlight

Public-Key: (2048 bit)
```
