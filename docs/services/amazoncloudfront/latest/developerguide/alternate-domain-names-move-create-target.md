# Set up the target standard distribution or distribution tenant

Before you can move an alternate domain name, you must set up the target resource.
This is the target standard distribution or distribution tenant that you're moving the alternate domain name
to.

Standard distribution

###### To set up a target standard distribution

1. Request a TLS certificate. This certificate includes the alternate
    domain name as the Subject or Subject Alternative Domain (SAN), or a
    wildcard (\*) that covers the alternate domain name that you’re
    moving. If you don’t have one, you can request one from AWS Certificate Manager
    (ACM) or from another certificate authority (CA) and import it
    into ACM.

###### Note

You must request or import the certificate in the
US East (N. Virginia) ( `us-east-1`) Region.

For more information, see [Request a public certificate using the\
    console](../../../acm/latest/userguide/acm-public-certificates.md#request-public-console) and [Import a certificate](../../../acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate-api-cli.md) in the
    AWS Certificate Manager in the _AWS Certificate Manager User Guide_.

2. If you haven’t created the target standard distribution, create one now. As
    part of creating the standard distribution, associate the certificate with this
    standard distribution. For more information, see [Create a distribution](distribution-web-creating-console.md).

If you already have a target standard distribution, associate the certificate
    with the standard distribution. For more information, see [Update a distribution](howtoupdatedistribution.md).

3. **If you’re moving alternate domain names**
**within the same AWS account, skip this step.**

To move an alternate domain name from one AWS account to
    another, you must create a TXT record in your DNS configuration.
    This verification step helps prevent unauthorized domain transfers.
    CloudFront uses this TXT record to validate your ownership of the
    alternate domain name.

In your DNS configuration, create a DNS TXT record that associates
    the alternate domain name with the target standard distribution. The TXT record
    format can vary, depending on the domain type.

- For subdomains, specify an underscore ( `_`) in
front of the alternate domain name. The following shows an
example TXT record.

`_www.example.com TXT
                                          d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`

- For an apex (or root domain), specify an underscore and
period ( `_.`) in front of the domain name. The
following shows an example TXT record.

`_.example.com TXT d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`

Distribution tenant

###### To set up the target distribution tenant

1. Request a TLS certificate. This certificate includes the alternate
    domain name as the Subject or Subject Alternative Domain (SAN), or a
    wildcard (\*) that covers the alternate domain name that you’re
    moving. If you don’t have one, you can request one from AWS Certificate Manager
    (ACM) or from another certificate authority (CA) and import it
    into ACM.

###### Note

You must request or import the certificate in the
US East (N. Virginia) ( `us-east-1`) Region.

For more information, see [Request a public certificate using the\
    console](../../../acm/latest/userguide/acm-public-certificates.md#request-public-console) and [Import a certificate](../../../acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate-api-cli.md) in the
    AWS Certificate Manager in the _AWS Certificate Manager User Guide_.

2. If you haven’t created the target distribution tenant, create one now. As
    part of creating the distribution tenant, associate the certificate with the
    distribution tenant. For more information, see [Create a distribution](distribution-web-creating-console.md).

If you already have a target distribution tenant, associate the certificate
    with the distribution tenant. For more information, see [Add a domain and certificate (distribution tenant)](managed-cloudfront-certificates.md#vanity-domain-tls-tenant).

To move an alternate domain name from one AWS account to

- For an apex (or root domain), specify an underscore and
period ( `_.`) in front of the domain name. The
following shows an example TXT record.

`_.example.com TXT d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`

associated with the alternate domain name.
