## DNS resolution

CloudFront performs a DNS resolution on the origin domain name
_before_ it executes your origin request Lambda@Edge function.
If the DNS service for your domain is experiencing issues and CloudFront can't resolve the
domain name to get the IP address, your Lambda@Edge function will not invoke. CloudFront
will return an [HTTP 502 status code (Bad\
Gateway)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/http-502-bad-gateway.html) to the client. For more information, see [DNS error (NonS3OriginDnsError)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/http-502-bad-gateway.html#http-502-dns-error).

If your function logic modifies the origin domain name, CloudFront will perform another
DNS resolution on the updated domain name after the function has finished
executing.

For more information about managing DNS failover, see [Configuring\
DNS failover](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/dns-failover-configuring.md) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer_
_Guide_.

## HTTP status codes

Lambda@Edge functions for viewer response events cannot modify the HTTP status code
of the response, regardless of whether the response came from the origin or the CloudFront
cache.

## Lambda function version

You must use a numbered version of the Lambda function, not `$LATEST` or
aliases.

## Lambda Region

The Lambda function must be in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

## Lambda role permissions

The IAM execution role associated with the Lambda function must allow the service
principals `lambda.amazonaws.com` and
`edgelambda.amazonaws.com` to assume the role. For more information,
see [Set up IAM permissions and roles for Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-permissions.html).

## Lambda features

The following Lambda features are not supported by Lambda@Edge:

- [Lambda runtime management configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html#runtime-management-controls) other than
**Auto** (default)

- Configuration of your Lambda function to access resources inside your
VPC

- [Lambda function dead\
letter queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#dlq)

- [Lambda environment\
variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html) (except for reserved environment variables, which are
automatically supported)

- Lambda functions with [Managing AWS Lambda\
dependencies with layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/chapter-layers.html)

- [Using\
AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html)

- Lambda provisioned concurrency

###### Note

Lambda@Edge functions share the same [Regional\
concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html) capabilities as all Lambda functions. For more
information, see [Quotas on Lambda@Edge](cloudfront-limits.md#limits-lambda-at-edge).

- [Create a Lambda function using a container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html)

- [Lambda functions that use the arm64 architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-arch.html)

- Lambda functions with more than 512 MB of ephemeral storage

- Using a [customer managed key to encrypt\
your .zip deployment packages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/encrypt-zip-package.html)

## Supported runtimes

Lambda@Edge supports the latest versions of Node.js and Python runtimes. For a list
of supported versions and their future deprecation dates, see [Supported\
runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtimes-supported) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

###### Tip

- As a best practice, use the latest versions of the provided runtimes
for performance improvements and new features.

- You can’t create or update functions with deprecated versions of
Node.js. You can only associate existing functions with these versions
with CloudFront distributions. Functions with these versions that are
associated with distributions will continue to run. However, we
recommend that you move your function to newer versions of Node.js. For
more information, see [Runtime deprecation policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtime-support-policy.html) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_ and the [Node.js\
release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) on GitHub.

## CloudFront headers

Lambda@Edge functions can read, edit, remove, or add any of the CloudFront headers listed
in [Add CloudFront request headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/adding-cloudfront-headers.html).

###### Notes

- If you want CloudFront to add these headers, you must configure CloudFront to add
them by using a [cache\
policy](controlling-the-cache-key.md) or [origin\
request policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html).

- CloudFront adds the headers _after_ the viewer request
event, which means the headers aren't available to Lambda@Edge functions
in a viewer request. The headers are only available to Lambda@Edge
functions in an origin request and origin response.

- If the viewer request includes headers that have these names, and you
configured CloudFront to add these headers using a [cache policy](controlling-the-cache-key.md) or [origin request policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html),
then CloudFront overwrites the header values that were in the viewer request.
Viewer-facing functions see the header value from the viewer request,
while origin-facing functions see the header value that CloudFront
added.

- If a viewer request function adds the
`CloudFront-Viewer-Country` header, it fails validation
and CloudFront returns HTTP status code 502 (Bad Gateway) to the
viewer.

## Restrictions on the request body with the include body option

When you choose the **Include Body** option to expose the request
body to your Lambda@Edge function, the following information and size limits apply to
the portions of the body that are exposed or replaced.

- CloudFront always base64 encodes the request body before exposing it to
Lambda@Edge.

- If the request body is large, CloudFront truncates it before exposing it to
Lambda@Edge, as follows:

- For viewer request events, the body is truncated at 40 KB.

- For origin request events, the body is truncated at 1 MB.

- If you access the request body as read-only, CloudFront sends the full original
request body to the origin.

- If your Lambda@Edge function replaces the request body, the following size
limits apply to the body that the function returns:

- If the Lambda@Edge function returns the body as plain text:

- For viewer request events, the body limit is 40 KB.

- For origin request events, the body limit is 1 MB.

- If the Lambda@Edge function returns the body as base64 encoded
text:

- For viewer request events, the body limit is 53.2
KB.

- For origin request events, the body limit is 1.33
MB.

###### Note

If your Lambda@Edge function returns a body that exceeds these limits, your
request will fail with an HTTP 502 status code ( [Lambda validation error](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/http-502-bad-gateway.html#http-502-lambda-validation-error)). We recommend that you
update your Lambda@Edge function so that the body doesn't exceed these
limits.

## Response timeout and keep-alive timeout (custom origins only)

If you're using Lambda@Edge functions to set the response timeout or keep-alive
timeout for your distribution origins, verify that you're specifying a value that
your origin can support. For more information, see [Response and keep-alive timeout quotas](downloaddistvaluesorigin.md#response-keep-alive-timeout-quota).
