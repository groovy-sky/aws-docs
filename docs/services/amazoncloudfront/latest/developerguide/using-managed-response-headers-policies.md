# Use managed response headers policies

With a CloudFront response headers policy, you can specify the HTTP headers that Amazon CloudFront
removes or adds in responses that it sends to viewers. For more information about response
headers policies and reasons to use them, see [Add or remove HTTP headers in CloudFront responses with a policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/modifying-response-headers.html).

CloudFront provides managed response headers policies that you can attach to cache behaviors in
your CloudFront distributions. With a managed response headers policy, you don't need to write or
maintain your own policy. The managed policies contain sets of HTTP response headers for
common use cases.

To use a managed response headers policy, you attach it to a cache behavior in your
distribution. The process is the same as when you create a custom response headers
policy. However, instead of creating a new policy, you attach one of the managed
policies. You attach the policy either by name (with the console) or by ID (with CloudFormation,
the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs). The names and IDs are listed in the following
section.

For more information, see [Create response headers policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/creating-response-headers-policies.html).

The following topics describe the managed response headers policies that you can
use.

## CORS-and-SecurityHeadersPolicy

[View this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

Use this managed policy to allow simple CORS requests from any origin. This policy
also adds a set of security headers to all responses that CloudFront sends to viewers.
This policy combines the [SimpleCORS](#managed-response-headers-policies-cors)
and [SecurityHeadersPolicy](#managed-response-headers-policies-security) policies into
one.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`e61eb60c-9c35-4d20-a928-2b84e02af89c`

Policy settingsHeader nameHeader valueOverride origin?**CORS headers:**`Access-Control-Allow-Origin``*`No**Security**
**headers:**`Referrer-Policy``strict-origin-when-cross-origin`No`Strict-Transport-Security``max-age=31536000`No`X-Content-Type-Options``nosniff`Yes`X-Frame-Options``SAMEORIGIN`No`X-XSS-Protection``1; mode=block`No

## CORS-With-Preflight

[View this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

Use this managed policy to allow CORS requests from any origin, including
preflight requests. For preflight requests (using the HTTP `OPTIONS`
method), CloudFront adds all three of the following headers to the response. For simple
CORS requests, CloudFront adds only the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
header.

If the response that CloudFront receives from the origin includes any of these headers,
CloudFront uses the received header (and its value) in its response to the viewer. CloudFront
doesn't use the header in this policy.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`5cc3b908-e619-4b99-88e5-2cf7f45965bd`

Policy settingsHeader nameHeader valueOverride origin?**CORS**
**headers:**`Access-Control-Allow-Methods``DELETE`, `GET`, `HEAD`,
`OPTIONS`, `PATCH`, `POST`,
`PUT`No`Access-Control-Allow-Origin``*``Access-Control-Expose-Headers``*`

## CORS-with-preflight-and-SecurityHeadersPolicy

[View this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

Use this managed policy to allow CORS requests from any origin. This includes
preflight requests. This policy also adds a set of security headers to all responses
that CloudFront sends to viewers. This policy combines the [CORS-With-Preflight](#managed-response-headers-policies-cors-preflight) and [SecurityHeadersPolicy](#managed-response-headers-policies-security) policies into one.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`eaab4381-ed33-4a86-88ca-d9558dc6cd63`

Policy settingsHeader nameHeader valueOverride origin?**CORS**
**headers:**`Access-Control-Allow-Methods``DELETE`, `GET`, `HEAD`,

**headers:**`Referrer-Policy``strict-origin-when-cross-origin`No`Strict-Transport-Security``max-age=31536000`No`X-Content-Type-Options``nosniff`Yes`X-Frame-Options``SAMEORIGIN`No`X-XSS-Protection``1; mode=block`No

## SecurityHeadersPolicy

[View this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

Use this managed policy to add a set of security headers to all responses that
CloudFront sends to viewers. For more information about these security headers, see [Mozilla's web security\
guidelines](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security).

With this response headers policy, CloudFront adds `X-Content-Type-Options:
                nosniff` to all responses. This is the case when the response that CloudFront
received from the origin included this header and when it didn't. For all other
headers in this policy, if the response that CloudFront receives from the origin includes
the header, CloudFront uses the received header (and its value) in its response to the
viewer. It doesn't use the header in this policy.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`67f7725c-6f97-4210-82d7-5512b31e9d03`

Policy settingsHeader nameHeader valueOverride origin?**Security**
**headers:**`Referrer-Policy``strict-origin-when-cross-origin`No`Strict-Transport-Security``max-age=31536000`No`X-Content-Type-Options``nosniff`Yes`X-Frame-Options``SAMEORIGIN`No`X-XSS-Protection``1; mode=block`No

## SimpleCORS

[View this policy in the CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home)

Use this managed policy to allow [simple\
CORS requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) from any origin. With this policy, CloudFront adds the header
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to all responses for simple CORS
requests.

If the response that CloudFront receives from the origin includes the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, CloudFront uses that header (and its
value) in its response to the viewer. CloudFront doesn't use the header in this
policy.

When using CloudFormation, the AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API, the ID for this policy is:

`60669652-455b-4ae9-85a4-c4c02393f86c`

Policy settingsHeader nameHeader valueOverride origin?**CORS headers:**`Access-Control-Allow-Origin``*`No
