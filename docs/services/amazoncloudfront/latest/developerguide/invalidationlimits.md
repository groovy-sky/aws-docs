# Concurrent invalidation request maximum

If you’re invalidating files individually, you can have invalidation requests for
up to 3,000 files per distribution in progress at one time. This can be one
invalidation request for up to 3,000 files, up to 3,000 requests for one file each,
or any other combination that doesn’t exceed 3,000 files. For example, you can
submit 30 invalidation requests that invalidate 100 files each. As long as all 30
invalidation requests are still in progress, you can’t submit any more invalidation
requests. If you exceed the maximum, CloudFront returns an error message.

If you’re using the \* wildcard, you can have requests for up to 15 invalidation
paths in progress at one time. You can also have invalidation requests for up to
3,000 individual files per distribution in progress at the same time; the maximum on
wildcard invalidation requests allowed is independent of the maximum on invalidating
files individually.
