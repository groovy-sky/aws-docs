# Get started with Lambda@Edge functions (console)

With Lambda@Edge, you can use CloudFront triggers to invoke a Lambda function. When you
associate a CloudFront distribution with a Lambda function, CloudFront [intercepts requests and responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html) at
CloudFront edge locations and runs the function. Lambda functions can improve security or
customize information close to your viewers to improve performance.

The following list provides a basic overview of how to create and use Lambda functions
with CloudFront.

###### Overview: Creating and using Lambda functions with CloudFront

1. Create a Lambda function in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

2. Save and publish a numbered version of the function.

If you want to change the function, you must edit the $LATEST version of the
    function in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. Then, before you set it up to work with CloudFront,
    you publish a new numbered version.

3. Associate the function with a CloudFront distribution and cache behavior. Then
    specify one or more CloudFront events ( _triggers_) that cause the
    function to execute. For example, you can create a trigger for the function to
    execute when CloudFront receives a request from a viewer.

4. When you create a trigger, Lambda creates replicas of the function at AWS
    locations around the world.

For more information, see [creating and\
updating functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-create-function.html), [the event\
structure](lambda-event-structure.md), and [adding CloudFront\
triggers](lambda-edge-add-triggers.md). You can also find more ideas and get code samples in [Lambda@Edge example functions](lambda-examples.md).
