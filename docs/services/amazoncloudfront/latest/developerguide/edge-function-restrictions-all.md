## AWS account ownership

To associate an edge function with a CloudFront distribution, the function and
distribution must be owned by the same AWS account.

## Combining CloudFront Functions with Lambda@Edge

For a given cache behavior, the following restrictions apply:

- Each event type (viewer request, origin request, origin response, and
viewer response) can have only one edge function association.

- You can’t combine CloudFront Functions and Lambda@Edge in viewer events (viewer
request and viewer response).

All other combinations of edge functions are allowed. The following table explains
the allowed combinations.

**CloudFront Functions**

**Viewer request**

**Viewer response**

**Lambda@Edge**

**Viewer request**

Not allowed

**Origin request**

**Origin response**

**Viewer response**

## HTTP status codes

CloudFront doesn't invoke edge functions for viewer response events when the origin
returns HTTP status code 400 or higher.

Lambda@Edge functions for origin response events are invoked for _all_ origin responses, including when the origin returns
HTTP status code 400 or higher. For more information, see [Update HTTP responses in origin response triggers](lambda-generating-http-responses.md#lambda-updating-http-responses).

## HTTP headers

Certain HTTP headers are disallowed, which means they're not exposed to edge
functions and functions can't add them. Other headers are read-only, which means
functions can read them but can't add, modify, or delete them.

- [Read-only headers](#function-restrictions-read-only-headers)

### Disallowed headers

The following HTTP headers are not exposed to edge functions, and functions
can't add them. If your function adds one of these headers, it fails CloudFront
validation and CloudFront returns HTTP status code 502 (Bad Gateway) to the
viewer.

- `Connection`

- `Expect`

- `Keep-Alive`

- `Proxy-Authenticate`

- `Proxy-Authorization`

- `Proxy-Connection`

- `Trailer`

- `Upgrade`

- `X-Accel-Buffering`

- `X-Accel-Charset`

- `X-Accel-Limit-Rate`

- `X-Accel-Redirect`

- `X-Amz-Cf-*`

- `X-Amzn-Auth`

- `X-Amzn-Cf-Billing`

- `X-Amzn-Cf-Id`

- `X-Amzn-Cf-Xff`

- `X-Amzn-Errortype`

- `X-Amzn-Fle-Profile`

- `X-Amzn-Header-Count`

- `X-Amzn-Header-Order`

- `X-Amzn-Lambda-Integration-Tag`

- `X-Amzn-RequestId`

- `X-Cache`

- `X-Edge-*`

- `X-Forwarded-Proto`

- `X-Real-IP`

### Read-only headers

The following headers are read-only. Your function can read them and use them
as input to the function logic, but it can't change the values. If your function
adds or edits a read-only header, the request fails CloudFront validation and CloudFront
returns HTTP status code 502 (Bad Gateway) to the viewer.

#### Read-only headers in viewer request events

The following headers are read-only in viewer request events.

- `CDN-Loop`

- `Content-Length`

- `Host`

- `Transfer-Encoding`

- `Via`

#### Read-only headers in origin request events (Lambda@Edge only)

The following headers are read-only in origin request events, which exist
only in Lambda@Edge.

- `Accept-Encoding`

- `CDN-Loop`

- `Content-Length`

- `If-Modified-Since`

- `If-None-Match`

- `If-Range`

- `If-Unmodified-Since`

- `Transfer-Encoding`

- `Via`

#### Read-only headers in origin response events (Lambda@Edge only)

The following headers are read-only in origin response events, which exist
only in Lambda@Edge.

- `Transfer-Encoding`

- `Via`

#### Read-only headers in viewer response events

The following headers are read-only in viewer response events for both
CloudFront Functions and Lambda@Edge.

- `Warning`

- `Via`

The following headers are read-only in viewer response events for
Lambda@Edge.

- `Content-Length`

- `Content-Encoding`

- `Transfer-Encoding`

## Query strings

The following restrictions apply to functions that read, update, or create a query
string in a request URI.

- (Lambda@Edge only) To access the query string in an origin request or
origin response function, your cache policy or origin request policy must be
set to **All** for **Query**
**strings**.

- A function can create or update a query string for viewer request and
origin request events (origin request events exist only in
Lambda@Edge).

- A function can read a query string, but cannot create or update one, for
origin response and viewer response events (origin response events exist
only in Lambda@Edge).

- If a function creates or updates a query string, the following
restrictions apply:

- The query string can't include spaces, control characters, or the
fragment identifier ( `#`).

- The total size of the URI, including the query string, must be
less than 8,192 characters.

- We recommend that you use percent encoding for the URI and query
string. For more information, see [URI, query string, and headers encoding](#function-restrictions-encoding).

## URI

If a function changes the URI for a request, that doesn't change the cache
behavior for the request or the origin that the request is forwarded to.

The total size of the URI, including the query string, must be less than 8,192
characters.

## URI, query string, and headers encoding

The values for the URI, query string, and headers that are passed to edge
functions are UTF-8 encoded. Your function should use UTF-8 encoding for the URI,
query string, and header values that it returns. Percent encoding is compatible with
UTF-8 encoding.

The following list explains how CloudFront handles encoding for the URI, query string,
and headers:

- When values in the request are UTF-8 encoded, CloudFront forwards the values to
your function without changing them.

- When values in the request are [ISO-8859-1\
encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1), CloudFront converts the values to UTF-8 encoding before
forwarding them to your function.

- When values in the request are encoded using some other character
encoding, CloudFront assumes that they're ISO-8859-1 encoded and tries to convert
from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.

###### Important

The converted characters might be an inaccurate interpretation of the
values in the original request. This might cause your function or your
origin to produce an unintended result.

The values for the URI, query string, and headers that CloudFront forwards to your
origin depend on whether a function changes the values:

- If a function doesn't change the URI, query string, or header, CloudFront
forwards the values that it received in the request to your origin.

- If a function changes the URI, query string, or header, CloudFront forwards the
UTF-8 encoded values.

## Microsoft Smooth Streaming

You can't use edge functions with a CloudFront distribution that you're using for
streaming media files that you've transcoded into the Microsoft Smooth Streaming
format.

## Tagging

You can't add tags to edge functions. For more information about tagging in CloudFront,
see [Tag a distribution](tagging.md).
