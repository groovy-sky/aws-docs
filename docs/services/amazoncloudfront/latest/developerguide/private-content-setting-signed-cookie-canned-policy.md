# Set signed cookies using a canned policy

To set a signed cookie by using a canned policy, complete the following steps. To create
the signature, see [Create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-signature-cookies).

###### To set a signed cookie using a canned policy

1. If you're using .NET or Java to create signed cookies, and if you haven't reformatted the private key
    for your key pair from the default .pem format to a format compatible with .NET or with Java, do so now.
    For more information, see [Reformat the private key (.NET and Java only)](private-content-trusted-signers.md#private-content-reformatting-private-key).

2. Program your application to send three `Set-Cookie` headers to approved
    viewers (or four, if you want to specify a hash algorithm). You need three `Set-Cookie` headers because each
    `Set-Cookie` header can contain only one name-value pair, and a
    CloudFront signed cookie requires three name-value pairs. The name-value pairs
    are: `CloudFront-Expires`, `CloudFront-Signature`, and
    `CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`. You can optionally include a fourth
    name-value pair, `CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm`, to specify the hash
    algorithm used for the signature. The values must be present on the
    viewer before a user makes the first request for a file that you want to
    control access to.

###### Note

In general, we recommend that you exclude `Expires` and `Max-Age` attributes.
Excluding the attributes causes the browser to delete the cookie when the user closes the browser,
which reduces the possibility of someone getting unauthorized access to your content. For more
information, see [Prevent misuse of signed cookies](private-content-signed-cookies.md#private-content-signed-cookie-misuse).

**The names of cookie attributes are case-sensitive**.

Line breaks are included only to make the attributes more readable.

```nohighlight

Set-Cookie:
CloudFront-Expires=date and time in Unix time format (in seconds) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);
Domain=optional domain name;

Set-Cookie:
CloudFront-Signature=hashed and signed version of the policy statement;
Domain=optional domain name;

Secure;
HttpOnly

Set-Cookie:
CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm=SHA1 or SHA256;
Domain=optional domain name;
Path=/optional directory path;
Secure;
HttpOnly
```

**(Optional) `Domain`**

The domain name for the requested file. If you don't specify a `Domain`
attribute, the default value is the domain name in the URL, and it applies only to the
specified domain name, not to subdomains. If you specify a `Domain` attribute, it
also applies to subdomains. A leading dot in the domain name (for example,
`Domain=.example.com`) is optional. In addition, if you specify a
`Domain` attribute, the domain name in the URL and the value of the
`Domain` attribute must match.

You can specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned to your distribution, for example,
d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net, but you can't specify \*.cloudfront.net for the domain
name.

If you want to use an alternate domain name such as example.com in URLs, you must add the
alternate domain name to your distribution regardless of whether you specify the
`Domain` attribute. For more information, see [Alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesCNAME) in the topic
[All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

**(Optional) `Path`**

The path for the requested file. If you don't specify a `Path` attribute, the
default value is the path in the URL.

**`Secure`**

Requires that the viewer encrypt cookies before sending a request. We recommend that you
send the `Set-Cookie` header over an HTTPS connection to ensure that the cookie
attributes are protected from man-in-the-middle attacks.

**`HttpOnly`**

Defines how the browser (where supported) interacts with the cookie value. With
`HttpOnly`, the cookie values are inaccessible to JavaScript. This
precaution can help mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
For more information, see [Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).

**`CloudFront-Expires`**

Specify the expiration date and time in Unix time format (in
seconds) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example,
January 1, 2026 10:00 am UTC converts to 1767290400 in Unix time
format.

To use epoch time, specify a 64-bit integer for a date that's
no later than `9223372036854775807` (Friday, April
11, 2262 at 23:47:16.854 UTC).

For information about UTC, see _RFC 3339, Date and_
_Time on the Internet: Timestamps_, [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).

**`CloudFront-Signature`**

A hashed, signed, and base64-encoded version of a JSON policy statement. For more
information, see [Create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-signature-cookies).

**`CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`**

The ID for a CloudFront public key, for example,
`K2JCJMDEHXQW5F`. The public key ID tells CloudFront which
public key to use to validate the signed URL. CloudFront compares the
information in the signature with the information in the policy
statement to verify that the URL has not been tampered
with.

This public key must belong to a key group that is a trusted
signer in the distribution. For more information, see [Specify signers that can create signed URLs and signed cookies](private-content-trusted-signers.md).

**`CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm`**

(Optional) The hash algorithm used to create the signature. Supported values are
`SHA1` and `SHA256`. If you don't include this cookie,
CloudFront defaults to `SHA1`.

The following example shows `Set-Cookie` headers for one signed cookie when you're using the domain
name that is associated with your distribution in the URLs for your files:

```nohighlight

Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Expires=1426500000; Domain=d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Signature=yXrSIgyQoeE4FBI4eMKF6ho~CA8_; Domain=d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id=K2JCJMDEHXQW5F; Domain=d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm=SHA256; Domain=d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The following example shows `Set-Cookie` headers for one signed cookie when you're using the
alternate domain name example.org in the URLs for your files:

```nohighlight

Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Expires=1426500000; Domain=example.org; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Signature=yXrSIgyQoeE4FBI4eMKF6ho~CA8_; Domain=example.org; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id=K2JCJMDEHXQW5F; Domain=example.org; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm=SHA256; Domain=example.org; Path=/images/*; Secure; HttpOnly
```

If you want to use an alternate domain name such as example.com in URLs, you must add the alternate domain name
to your distribution regardless of whether you specify the `Domain` attribute. For more information,
see [Alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesCNAME) in the topic [All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

## Create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy

To create the signature for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy, complete the following procedures.

###### Topics

- [Create a policy statement for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-statement-cookies)

- [Sign the policy statement to create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-cookies-signing-policy-statement)

### Create a policy statement for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy

When you set a signed cookie that uses a canned policy, the
`CloudFront-Signature` attribute is a hashed and signed version
of a policy statement. For signed cookies that use a canned policy, you
don't include the policy statement in the `Set-Cookie` header, as
you do for signed cookies that use a custom policy. To create the policy
statement, complete the following steps.

###### To create a policy statement for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy

1. Construct the policy statement using the following JSON format and using UTF-8 character
    encoding. Include all punctuation and other literal values exactly as specified. For information
    about the `Resource` and `DateLessThan` parameters, see [Values that you specify in the policy statement for a canned policy for signed cookies](#private-content-canned-policy-statement-cookies-values).

```json

{
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Resource": "base URL or stream name",
               "Condition": {
                   "DateLessThan": {
                       "AWS:EpochTime": ending date and time in Unix time format and UTC
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
}
```

2. Remove all empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from the policy
    statement. You might have to include escape characters in the string
    in application code.

#### Values that you specify in the policy statement for a canned policy for signed cookies

When you create a policy statement for a canned policy, you specify the following values:

**Resource**

The base URL including your query strings, if any, for example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/horizon.jpg?size=large&license=yes`

You can specify only one value for `Resource`.

Note the following:

- **Protocol** – The value must begin with
`http://` or `https://`.

- **Query string parameters** – If you have no
query string parameters, omit the question mark.

- **Alternate domain names** – If you specify an
alternate domain name (CNAME) in the URL, you must
specify the alternate domain name when referencing
the file in your webpage or application. Do not
specify the Amazon S3 URL for the file.

**DateLessThan**

The expiration date and time for the URL in Unix time format (in seconds) and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Do not enclose the value in quotation marks.

For example, March 16, 2015 10:00 am UTC converts to 1426500000 in Unix time
format.

This value must match the value of the `CloudFront-Expires` attribute in the
`Set-Cookie` header. Do not enclose the value in quotation marks.

For more information, see [When CloudFront checks expiration date and time in a signed cookie](private-content-signed-cookies.md#private-content-check-expiration-cookie).

#### Example policy statement for a canned policy

When you use the following example policy statement in a signed cookie, a user can access the file
`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/horizon.jpg` until March 16, 2015 10:00 am
UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/horizon.jpg?size=large&license=yes",
            "Condition": {
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1426500000
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Sign the policy statement to create a signature for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy

To create the value for the `CloudFront-Signature` attribute in a `Set-Cookie`
header, you hash and sign the policy statement that you created in [To create a policy statement for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-statement-cookies-procedure).

For additional information and examples of how to hash, sign, and encode the policy statement, see the
following topics:

- [Linux commands and OpenSSL for base64 encoding and encryption](private-content-linux-openssl.md)

- [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md)

###### Note

The linked examples use SHA-1 by default. To use SHA-256 instead, replace `sha1` with `sha256` in the OpenSSL commands and include the `CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm` cookie with a value of `SHA256`.

###### To create a signature for a signed cookie using a canned policy

1. Use the SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash function and RSA to hash and sign the policy statement that you
    created in the procedure [To create a policy statement for a signed cookie that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-statement-cookies-procedure). Use the version of the policy statement that no longer includes
    empty spaces.

If you use SHA-256, you must include the `CloudFront-Hash-Algorithm` cookie with a value of `SHA256`.

For the private key that is required by the hash function, use a
    private key whose public key is in an active trusted key group for
    the distribution.

###### Note

The method that you use to hash and sign the policy statement depends on your programming
language and platform. For sample code, see [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md).

2. Remove empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from the hashed and signed
    string.

3. Base64-encode the string using MIME base64 encoding. For more information, see [Section 6.8,\
    Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) in _RFC 2045, MIME_
_(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet_
_Message Bodies_.

4. Replace characters that are invalid in a URL query string with characters that are valid. The
    following table lists invalid and valid characters.

Replace these invalid charactersWith these valid characters

+

\- (hyphen)

=

\_ (underscore)

/

~ (tilde)

5. Include the resulting value in the `Set-Cookie` header for the
    `CloudFront-Signature` name-value pair. Then return to [To set a signed cookie using a canned policy](#private-content-setting-signed-cookie-canned-policy-procedure) add the
    `Set-Cookie` header for `CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`.
