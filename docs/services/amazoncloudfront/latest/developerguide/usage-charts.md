# View CloudFront usage reports

The CloudFront usage reports include the following information:

- **Number of requests** – Shows the total
number of requests that CloudFront responds to from edge locations in the selected
region during each time interval for the specified CloudFront distribution.

- **Data transferred by protocol** and **data transferred by destination** – Both show
the total amount of data transferred from CloudFront edge locations in the selected
region during each time interval for the specified CloudFront distribution. They
separate the data differently, as follows:

- **By protocol** – Separates the data by
protocol: HTTP or HTTPS.

- **By destination** – Separates the data
by destination: to your viewers or to your origin.

The CloudFront usage report is based on the AWS usage report for CloudFront. This report doesn't
require any additional configuration. For more information, see [View the AWS usage report for CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/reports-billing.html#usage-report).

You can view reports for a specified date range in the last 60 days, with data points
every hour or every day. You can usually view data about requests that CloudFront received as
recently as four hours ago, but data can occasionally be delayed by as much as 24
hours.

For more information, see [How the usage charts are related to data in the CloudFront usage report](#usage-charts-table).

## View CloudFront usage reports in the console

You can view the CloudFront usage report in the console.

###### To view CloudFront usage reports

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Usage Reports**.

3. In the **CloudFront Usage Reports** pane, for **Start**
**Date** and **End Date**, select the date range
    for which you want to display usage charts. Available ranges depend on the
    value that you select for **Granularity**:

- **Daily** — To display charts with one
data point per day, select any date range in the previous 60 days.

- **Hourly** — To display charts with one
data point every hour, select any date range of up to 14 days within
the previous 60 days.

Dates and times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

4. For **Granularity**, specify whether to display one data
    point per day or one data point per hour in the charts. If you specify a
    date range greater than 14 days, the option to specify one data point per
    hour is not available.

5. For **Billing Region**, choose the CloudFront billing region
    that has the data you want to view, or choose **All**
**Regions**. Usage charts include data for requests that CloudFront
    processes in edge locations in the specified region. The region where CloudFront
    processes requests might or might not correspond with the location of your
    viewers.

Select only Regions that are included in the price class for your
    distribution. Otherwise, the usage charts probably won't contain any data.
    For example, if you chose Price Class 200 for your distribution, the South
    America and Australia billing regions are not included, so CloudFront generally
    won't process your requests from those regions. For more information about
    price classes, see [CloudFront\
    pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing).

6. In the **Distribution** list, select the distributions
    for which you want to display data in the usage charts:

- **An individual distribution**
— The charts display data for the selected CloudFront distribution.
The **Distribution** list displays the distribution
ID and alternate domain names (CNAMEs) for the distribution, if any.
If a distribution has no alternate domain names, the list includes
origin domain names for the distribution.

- **All distributions (excludes deleted)** —
The charts display summed data for all distributions that are
associated with the current AWS account, excluding distributions
that you have deleted.

- **All Deleted Distributions** — The charts
display summed data for all distributions that are associated with
the current AWS account and that were deleted in the last 60
days.

7. Choose **Update Graphs**.

###### Tip

- To view data for a daily or hourly data point within a chart, hover
over the data point.

- For charts that show data transferred, note that you can change the
vertical scale to gigabytes, megabytes, or kilobytes.
