# Monitor a staging distribution

To monitor the performance of a staging distribution, you can use the same [metrics, logs, and reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/reports-and-monitoring.html) that CloudFront provides
for all distributions. For example:

- You can view the [default CloudFront\
distribution metrics](viewing-cloudfront-metrics.md#monitoring-console.distributions) (such as total requests and error rate) in the CloudFront
console, and you can [turn on additional metrics](viewing-cloudfront-metrics.md#monitoring-console.distributions-additional) (such as cache hit rate and error rate by
status code) for an additional cost. You can also create alarms based on these
metrics.

- You can view [standard logs](accesslogs.md) and [real-time access logs](real-time-logs.md) to get detailed information about
the requests that are received by the staging distribution. Standard logs
contain the following two fields that help you identify the primary distribution
that the request was originally sent to before CloudFront routed it to the staging
distribution: `primary-distribution-id` and
`primary-distribution-dns-name`.

- You can view and download [reports](reports.md) in the CloudFront
console, for example the cache statistics report.
