# Use signed URLs

A signed URL includes additional information, for example, an expiration date and time, that gives you more control
over access to your content. This additional information appears in a policy statement, which is based on either a
canned policy or a custom policy. The differences between canned and custom policies are explained in the next two
sections.

###### Note

You can create some signed URLs using canned policies and create some signed URLs using custom policies for the
same distribution.

## Decide to use canned or custom policies for signed URLs

When you create a signed URL, you write a policy statement in JSON format that specifies the restrictions on the
signed URL, for example, how long the URL is valid. You can use either a canned policy or a custom policy. Here's
how canned and custom policies compare:

You can reuse the policy statement for multiple files. To reuse the policy statement, you
must use wildcard characters in the `Resource` object. For more information, see
[Values that you specify in the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a custom policy](private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.md#private-content-custom-policy-statement-values).)

## How signed URLs work

Here's an overview of how you configure CloudFront and Amazon S3 for signed URLs and how CloudFront responds when a user uses a
signed URL to request a file.

1. In your CloudFront distribution, specify one or more trusted key
    groups, which
    contain the public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the URL signature. You
    use the corresponding private keys to sign the URLs.

CloudFront supports signed URLs with RSA 2048 and ECDSA 256 key signatures.

For more information, see [Specify signers that can create signed URLs and signed cookies](private-content-trusted-signers.md).

2. Develop your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content
    and to create signed URLs for the files or parts of your application that
    you want to restrict access to. For more information, see the following
    topics:

- [Create a signed URL using a canned policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-canned-policy.html)

- [Create a signed URL using a custom policy](private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.md)

3. A user requests a file for which you want to require signed URLs.

4. Your application verifies that the user is entitled to access the file:
    they've signed in, they've paid for access to the content, or they've met
    some other requirement for access.

5. Your application creates and returns a signed URL to the user.

6. The signed URL allows the user to download or stream the content.

This step is automatic; the user usually doesn't have to do anything
    additional to access the content. For example, if a user is accessing your
    content in a web browser, your application returns the signed URL to the
    browser. The browser immediately uses the signed URL to access the file in
    the CloudFront edge cache without any intervention from the user.

7. CloudFront uses the public key to validate the signature and confirm that the
    URL hasn't been tampered with. If the signature is invalid, the request is
    rejected.

If the signature is valid, CloudFront looks at the policy statement in the URL
    (or constructs one if you're using a canned policy) to confirm that the
    request is still valid. For example, if you specified a beginning and ending
    date and time for the URL, CloudFront confirms that the user is trying to access
    your content during the time period that you want to allow access.

If the request meets the requirements in the policy statement, CloudFront does
    the standard operations: determines whether the file is already in the edge
    cache, forwards the request to the origin if necessary, and returns the file
    to the user.

###### Note

If an unsigned URL contains query string parameters, make sure you include them in the
portion of the URL that you sign. If you add a query string to a signed URL
after signing it, the URL returns an HTTP 403 status.

## Decide how long signed URLs are valid

You can distribute private content using a signed URL that is valid for only a short time—possibly for as
little as a few minutes. Signed URLs that are valid for such a short period are good for distributing content
on-the-fly to a user for a specific purpose, such as distributing movie rentals or music downloads to customers on
demand. If your signed URLs will be valid for just a short period, you'll probably want to generate them
automatically using an application that you develop. When the user starts to download a file or starts to play a
media file, CloudFront compares the expiration time in the URL with the current time to determine whether the URL is
still valid.

You can also distribute private content using a signed URL that is valid for a longer time, possibly for years.
Signed URLs that are valid for a longer period are useful for distributing private content to known users, such as
distributing a business plan to investors or distributing training materials to employees. You can develop an
application to generate these longer-term signed URLs for you.

## When CloudFront checks expiration date and time in a signed URL

CloudFront checks the expiration date and time in a signed URL at the time of the HTTP
request. If a client begins to download a large file immediately before the
expiration time, the download should complete even if the expiration time passes
during the download. If the TCP connection drops and the client tries to restart the
download after the expiration time passes, the download will fail.

If a client uses Range GETs to get a file in smaller pieces, any GET request that
occurs after the expiration time passes will fail. For more information about Range
GETs, see [How CloudFront processes partial requests for an object (range GETs)](rangegets.md).
