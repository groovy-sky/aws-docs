# AWS billing and usage reports for CloudFront

AWS provides two usage reports for CloudFront:

- The AWS billing report is a high-level view of all activity for AWS services
that you're using, including CloudFront.

- The AWS usage report is a summary of activity for a specific service, aggregated
by hour, day, or month. It also includes usage charts that provide a graphical
representation of your CloudFront usage.

###### Note

Like other AWS services, CloudFront charges you for only what you use. For more
information, see [CloudFront\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing).

## View the AWS usage report for CloudFront

AWS provides a CloudFront usage report that is more detailed than the billing report but
less detailed than CloudFront access logs. The usage report provides aggregate usage data by
hour, day, or month, and it lists operations by region and usage type, such as data
transferred out of the Australia region.

3. On the **New cost and usage report** page, in the **Report parameters** pane, choose a date range and granularity for the report.

4. Under **Filters**, **Service**, select **CloudFront**.

5. Select the **Usage type**.

6. Under **Cost and usage breakdown**, choose **Download as CSV**.

Report](../../../cur/latest/userguide/usage-report.md) in the _AWS Data Exports User Guide_.

The CloudFront usage report includes the following values:

- **Service** –

- `KeyValueStore-EdgeReads`

- `RealTimeLog-KinesisDataStream`

- `SSL-Cert-Custom`

- **Resource** – Either the ID of the CloudFront
distribution associated with the usage or the certificate ID of an SSL
certificate that you have associated with a CloudFront distribution.

- **StartTime/EndTime** – The day that the
usage applies to, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

- **UsageValue** – 1) The number of requests
during the specified time period or 2)the amount of data transferred in
bytes.

If you’re using Amazon S3 as the origin for CloudFront, consider running the usage report for
Amazon S3, too. However, if you use Amazon S3 for purposes other than as an origin for your CloudFront
distributions, it might not be clear what portion applies to your CloudFront usage.

###### Tip

For detailed information about every request that CloudFront receives for your objects,
turn on CloudFront access logs for your distribution. For more information, see [Access logs (standard logs)](accesslogs.md).

For more information about understanding the CloudFront charges and usage types on your
reports, see [Interpret your AWS bill and usage reports for CloudFront](billing-and-usage-interpreting.md).
