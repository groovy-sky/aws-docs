# Create cache policies

You can use a cache policy to improve your cache hit ratio by controlling the values
(URL query strings, HTTP headers, and cookies) that are included in the cache key. You
can create a cache policy in the CloudFront console, with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or with the
CloudFront API.

After you create a cache policy, you attach it to one or more cache behaviors in a
CloudFront distribution.

Console

###### To create a cache policy (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the
    **Policies** page in the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home?#/policies](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home?).

2. Choose **Create cache policy**.

3. Choose the desired setting for this cache policy. For more
    information, see [Understand cache policies](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md).

4. When finished, choose **Create**.

After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to a cache
behavior.

###### To attach a cache policy to an existing distribution (console)

1. Open the **Distributions** page in the CloudFront
    console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home#/distributions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. Choose the distribution to update, then choose the
    **Behaviors** tab.

3. Choose the cache behavior to update, then choose
    **Edit**.

Or, to create a new cache behavior, choose **Create**
**behavior**.

4. In the **Cache key and origin requests** section,
    make sure that **Cache policy and origin request**
**policy** is chosen.

5. For **Cache policy**, choose the cache policy to
    attach to this cache behavior.

6. At the bottom of the page, choose **Save**
**changes**.

###### To attach a cache policy to a new distribution (console)

1. Open the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. Choose **Create distribution**.

3. In the **Cache key and origin requests** section,
    make sure that **Cache policy and origin request**
**policy** is chosen.

4. For **Cache policy**, choose the cache policy to
    attach to this distribution's default cache behavior.

5. Choose the desired settings for the origin, default cache
    behavior, and other distribution settings. For more information, see
    [All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

6. When finished, choose **Create**
**distribution**.

CLI

To create a cache policy with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), use the **aws**
**cloudfront create-cache-policy** command. You can use an input
file to provide the command's input parameters, rather than specifying each
individual parameter as command line input.

###### To create a cache policy (CLI with input file)

1. Use the following command to create a file named
    `cache-policy.yaml` that contains all of the
    input parameters for the **create-cache-policy**
    command.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront create-cache-policy --generate-cli-skeleton yaml-input > cache-policy.yaml
```

2. Open the file named `cache-policy.yaml` that
    you just created. Edit the file to specify the cache policy settings
    that you want, then save the file. You can remove optional fields
    from the file, but don't remove the required fields.

For more information about the cache policy settings, see [Understand cache policies](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md).

3. Use the following command to create the cache policy using input
    parameters from the `cache-policy.yaml`
    file.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront create-cache-policy --cli-input-yaml file://cache-policy.yaml
```

Make note of the `Id` value in the command's output.
    This is the cache policy ID, and you need it to attach the cache
    policy to a CloudFront distribution's cache behavior.

###### To attach a cache policy to an existing distribution (CLI with input file)

1. Use the following command to save the distribution configuration
    for the CloudFront distribution that you want to update. Replace
    `distribution_ID` with the
    distribution's ID.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id distribution_ID --output yaml > dist-config.yaml
```

2. Open the file named `dist-config.yaml` that you
    just created. Edit the file, making the following changes to each
    cache behavior that you are updating to use a cache policy.

- In the cache behavior, add a field named
`CachePolicyId`. For the field's value, use
the cache policy ID that you noted after creating the
policy.

- Remove the `MinTTL`, `MaxTTL`,
`DefaultTTL`, and
`ForwardedValues` fields from the cache
behavior. These settings are specified in the cache policy,
so you can't include these fields and a cache policy in the
same cache behavior.

- Rename the `ETag` field to
`IfMatch`, but don't change the field's
value.

Save the file when finished.

3. Use the following command to update the distribution to use the
    cache policy. Replace `distribution_ID`
    with the distribution's ID.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront update-distribution --id distribution_ID --cli-input-yaml file://dist-config.yaml
```

###### To attach a cache policy to a new distribution (CLI with input file)

1. Use the following command to create a file named
    `distribution.yaml` that contains all of the
    input parameters for the **create-distribution**
    command.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront create-distribution --generate-cli-skeleton yaml-input > distribution.yaml
```

2. Open the file named `distribution.yaml` that
    you just created. In the default cache behavior, in the
    `CachePolicyId` field, enter the cache policy ID that
    you noted after creating the policy. Continue editing the file to
    specify the distribution settings that you want, then save the file
    when finished.

For more information about the distribution settings, see [All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md).

3. Use the following command to create the distribution using input
    parameters from the `distribution.yaml`
    file.

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront create-distribution --cli-input-yaml file://distribution.yaml
```

API

To create a cache policy with the CloudFront API, use [CreateCachePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCachePolicy.html). For more information about the fields that
you specify in this API call, see [Understand cache policies](cache-key-understand-cache-policy.md) and the API
reference documentation for your AWS SDK or other API client.

After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to a cache behavior,
using one of the following API calls:

- To attach it to a cache behavior in an existing distribution, use
[UpdateDistribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html).

- To attach it to a cache behavior in a new distribution, use [CreateDistribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDistribution.html).

For both of these API calls, provide the cache policy's ID in the
`CachePolicyId` field, inside a cache behavior. For more
information about the other fields that you specify in these API calls, see
[All distribution settings reference](distribution-web-values-specify.md) and the API reference
documentation for your AWS SDK or other API client.
