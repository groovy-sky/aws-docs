# Helper methods for key value stores

###### Note

Key value store helper method calls from CloudFront Functions don't trigger an AWS CloudTrail
data event. These events aren't logged in the CloudTrail event history. For more
information, see [Logging Amazon CloudFront API calls using AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md).

This section applies if you use the [CloudFront Key Value\
Store](kvs-with-functions.md) to include key values in the function that you create. CloudFront Functions
has a module that provides three helper methods to read values from the
key value store.

To use this module in the function code, make sure that you have [associated a key value store](kvs-with-functions-associate.md) with the
function.

Next, include the following statements in the first lines of the function code:

```javascript

import cf from 'cloudfront';
const kvsHandle = cf.kvs();
```

## `get()` method

Use this method to return the key value for the key name that you specify.

**Request**

```nohighlight

get("key", options);
```

- `key`: The name of the key whose value needs to be
fetched

- `options`: There is one option, `format`. It ensures
that the function parses the data correctly. Possible values:

- `string`: (Default) UTF8 encoded

- `json`

- `bytes`: Raw binary data buffer

**Request example**

```nohighlight

const value = await kvsHandle.get("myFunctionKey", { format: "string"});
```

**Response**

The response is a `promise` that resolves to a value in the format
requested by using `options`. By default, the value is returned as a
string.

### Error handling

The `get()` method will return an error when the key that you
requested doesn't exist in the associated key value store. To manage this use
case, you can add a `try` and `catch` block to your
code.

###### Warning

Using promise combinators (for example, `Promise.all`,
`Promise.any`, and promise chain methods (for example,
`then` and `catch`) can require high function memory
usage. If your function exceeds the [maximum\
function memory](cloudfront-limits.md#limits-functions) quota, it will fail to execute. To avoid this error,
we recommend that you use the `await` syntax sequentially or in loops
to request multiple values.

**Example**

```nohighlight

var value1 = await kvs.get('key1');
var value2 = await kvs.get('key2');
```

Currently, using promise combinators to get multiple values won't improve
performance, such as the following example.

```nohighlight

var values = await Promise.all([kvs.get('key1'), kvs.get('key2'),]);
```

## `exists()` method

Use this method to identify whether or not the key exists in the
key value store.

**Request**

```nohighlight

exists("key");
```

**Request example**

```nohighlight

const exist = await kvsHandle.exists("myFunctionkey");
```

**Response**

The response is a `promise` that returns a Boolean ( `true`
or `false`). This value specifies whether or not the key exists in the
key value store.

## `meta()` method

Use this method to return metadata about the key value store.

**Request**

```nohighlight

meta();
```

**Request example**

```nohighlight

const meta = await kvsHandle.meta();
```

**Response**

The response is a `promise` that resolves to an object with the
following properties:

- `creationDateTime`: The date and time that the key value store
was created, in ISO 8601 format.

- `lastUpdatedDateTime`: The date and time that the key value
store was last synced from the source, in ISO 8601 format. The value doesn't
include the propagation time to the edge.

- `keyCount`: The total number of keys in the KVS after the last
sync from the source.

**Response example**

```nohighlight

{keyCount:3,creationDateTime:2023-11-30T23:07:55.765Z,lastUpdatedDateTime:2023-12-15T03:57:52.411Z}
```
