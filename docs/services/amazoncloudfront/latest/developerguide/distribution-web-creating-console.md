# Create a distribution

This topic explains how to use the CloudFront console to create a distribution.

###### Overview

1. Create one or more Amazon S3 buckets, or configure HTTP servers as your origin servers. An
    _origin_ is the location where you
    store the original version of your content. When CloudFront gets a request for
    your files, it goes to the origin to get the files that it distributes at
    edge locations. You can use any combination of Amazon S3 buckets and HTTP servers
    as your origin servers.

- If you use Amazon S3, the name of your bucket must be all lowercase and cannot contain
spaces.

- If you use an Amazon EC2 server or another custom origin, review [Use Amazon EC2 (or another custom origin)](downloaddists3andcustomorigins.md#concept_CustomOrigin).

- For the current maximum number of origins that you can create for a distribution, or to
request a higher quota, see [General quotas on distributions](cloudfront-limits.md#limits-web-distributions).

2. Upload your content to your origin servers. You make your objects publicly readable, or you can use CloudFront signed URLs to restrict access to
    your content.

###### Important

You are responsible for ensuring the security of your origin server. You must ensure
that CloudFront has permission to access the server and that the security settings safeguard your content.

3. Create your CloudFront distribution:

- For a detailed procedure that creates a distribution in the CloudFront console,
see [Create a CloudFront distribution in the console](#create-console-distribution).

- For information about creating a distribution using the CloudFront API, see
[CreateDistribution](../../../../reference/cloudfront/latest/apireference/api-createdistribution.md) in the
_Amazon CloudFront API Reference_.

4. (Optional) If you use the CloudFront console to create your distribution, create more cache
    behaviors or origins for the distribution. For more information about behaviors and origins, see [To update a multi-tenant distribution](howtoupdatedistribution.md#HowToUpdateDistributionProcedure).

5. Test your distribution. For more information about testing, see [Test a distribution](distribution-web-testing.md).

6. Develop your website or application to access your content using the domain name that
    CloudFront returned after you created your distribution in Step 3. For example, if
    CloudFront returns d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net as the domain name for your distribution,
    the URL for the file `image.jpg` in an Amazon S3 bucket or in the root
    directory on an HTTP server is
    `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg`.

If you specified one or more alternate domain names (CNAMEs) when you created your
    distribution, you can use your own domain name. In that case, the URL for
    `image.jpg` might be
    `https://www.example.com/image.jpg`.

Note the following:

- If you want to use signed URLs to restrict access to your content, see [Serve private content with signed URLs and signed cookies](privatecontent.md).

- If you want to serve compressed content, see [Serve compressed files](servingcompressedfiles.md).

- For information about CloudFront request and response behavior for Amazon S3 and custom
origins, see [Request and response behavior](requestandresponsebehavior.md).

## Create a CloudFront distribution in the console

When you create a distribution, CloudFront configures your distribution settings for you, based on your content origin type. For more details about the preconfigured settings, see [Preconfigured distribution settings reference](template-preconfigured-origin-settings.md). You can also create multi-tenant distributions with settings that can be reused across multiple distribution tenants. For more information, see [Understand how multi-tenant distributions work](distribution-config-options.md). Alternatively, you can manually configure your own distribution settings.

Multi-tenant

###### To create a multi-tenant distribution

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributions**, then choose
     **Create distribution**.

03. Choose **Multi-tenant architecture**, **Next**.

04. Enter a **Distribution name** for the
     multi-tenant distribution. The name will appear as the value for the
     `Name` key. You can change this value later.
     You can add up to 50 tags for your multi-tenant distribution. For more
     information, see [Tag a distribution](tagging.md) .

05. (Optional) For **Wildcard certificate**, choose the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
     certificate that will cover all subdomains under the root
     domain, such as `*.example.com`. The
     certificate must be in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

06. Choose **Next**.

07. On the **Specify origin** page, select the
     origin type that CloudFront will get your content from. CloudFront will
     use the recommended settings for that origin type for your
     multi-tenant distribution. For more information about the recommended settings,
     see [Preconfigured distribution settings reference](template-preconfigured-origin-settings.md).

08. For **Origin**, under the origin type that you selected, choose or enter the
     origin to use.

09. For **Origin path**, enter the forward slash
     ( `/`) character, followed by the origin path.

10. (Optional) To add a parameter, choose **Insert parameter** for
     either the origin domain name or origin path. You can enter up
     to two parameters for each field.
    1. Choose **Create new**
       **parameter**.

    2. On the **Create new parameter**
        dialog box, for **Parameter name**,
        enter a unique name for the parameter and, optionally, a
        description.

    3. For **Required parameter**, select the checkbox to make this
        parameter value required at the distribution tenant level. If it's not required, enter a
        **Default value** that the distribution tenant
        will inherit.

    4. Choose **Create parameter**. This
        parameter appears in the corresponding field.
11. For **Options**, choose one of the following
     options:

- **Use recommended origin settings** – Use the default
recommended cache and origin settings for the origin
type that you selected.

- **Customize origin settings** – Customize the cache and
origin settings. If you choose this option, specify your
own values that appear.

12. Choose **Next**.

13. On the **Enable security protections** page, choose whether to
     enable AWS WAF security protections. You can customize the web
     ACL for specific distribution tenants later. For more information, see [Enable AWS WAF for a new distribution](waf-one-click.md#enable-waf-new-distribution).

14. Choose **Next**, **Create distribution**.

15. On the **Distributions** page, your multi-tenant distribution appears in the list of
     resources. You can choose the **All**
    **distributions** dropdown to filter by standard distribution or
     multi-tenant distribution. You can also choose the **Type**
     column to filter by standard or multi-tenant distribution.

By default, CloudFront creates a connection group for you. The connection group controls how viewer
requests for content connect to CloudFront. You can customize some routing settings in
the connection group. For more information, see [Understand how multi-tenant distributions work](distribution-config-options.md).

You can create additional distribution tenants using the multi-tenant distribution as a
template.

###### To create a distribution tenant

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

02. In the navigation pane, do one of the following:
    - Choose **Distributions**, choose a
       multi-tenant distribution, and then choose **Create**
      **tenant**.

    - Choose **Distribution tenants** and then
       choose **Create tenant**.
03. For **Distribution tenant name**, enter the name. The
     name must be unique in your AWS account and can't be changed
     after you create it.

04. For **Template distribution**, choose a
     multi-tenant distribution ID from the list.

05. For **Manage tags**, add up to 50 key-value
     pairs for the distribution tenant. For more information, see [Tag a distribution](tagging.md).

06. Choose **Next**.

07. On the **Add domains** page, for
     **Certificate**, choose if you want a
     **Custom TLS certificate** for your
     distribution tenant. The certificate verifies whether you're authorized to
     use the domain name. The certificate must exist in the
     US East (N. Virginia) Region.

08. For **Domains**, enter your domain name.

    ###### Note

    If you entered a domain name that isn't covered by a
    certificate, you will need to verify that you own the
    domain. You can still create the distribution tenant for now and verify
    domain ownership later. For more information, see [Request certificates for your CloudFront distribution tenant](managed-cloudfront-certificates.md).

09. Choose **Next**.

10. On the **Define parameters** page, the
     parameters that you specified in the multi-tenant distribution appear.
     For required parameters, enter a value next to the parameter
     name and save your changes.

11. To add another parameter, choose **Add**
    **parameter** and enter a name and value.

12. Choose **Next**.

13. (Optional) For **Security customization**, if you choose to **Override distribution settings**, select the option for your use case.

14. (Optional) For **Geographic restrictions**
    **customization**, if you choose to **Override distribution settings**, select the appropriate **Restriction type** and **Countries** for the distribution tenant. For more information, see [Restrict the geographic distribution of your content](georestrictions.md).

15. Choose **Next**.

16. Choose **Create**
    **distribution tenant**.

You can find all your distribution tenants on the
**Distribution tenants** page. You can filter by
the following:

###### Association

- Distribution ID

- Certificate ID

- Connection group ID

- Web ACL ID

###### Properties

- Name

- Domain

You can edit your distribution tenants to customize specific settings.
For more information, see [Distribution tenant customizations](tenant-customization.md).

Standard

###### To create a standard distribution

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributions**, then choose
     **Create distribution**.

03. Enter a **Distribution name** for the
     standard distribution. The name will appear as the value for the
     `Name` key as a tag. You can change this value later.
     You can add up to 50 tags for your standard distribution. For more
     information, see [Tag a distribution](tagging.md).

04. Choose **Single website or app**, **Next**.

05. (Optional) For **Domain setup**, enter a domain that's already registered with Route 53 in your AWS account, or register a new domain. Complete the setup steps.

- If your domain uses a DNS provider other than Route 53, you can still add the domain, but you'll need to do so after creating the distribution. Skip the domain setup for now to proceed with distribution creation. You must manually configure the domain and TLS certificate later. For more information, see [Add a domain to your CloudFront standard distribution](add-domain-existing-distribution.md).

06. Choose **Next**.

07. On the **Specify origin** page, select the
     origin type that CloudFront will get your content from. CloudFront will
     use the recommended settings for that origin type for your
     distribution. For more information about the recommended settings,
     see [Preconfigured distribution settings reference](template-preconfigured-origin-settings.md).

08. For **Origin**, choose or enter your
     origin.

09. For **Settings**, choose one of the following
     options:

- **Use recommended origin settings** – Use the default
recommended cache and origin settings for the origin
type that you selected.

- **Customize origin settings** – Customize the cache and
origin settings. If you choose this option, specify your
own values.

10. Choose **Next**.

11. On the **Enable security protections** page, choose whether to
     enable AWS WAF security protections.

12. Choose **Next**.

13. (Optional) If you are using Route 53 for your domain, you will see the **TLS certificate** page. If CloudFront can't find an existing AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for your domain in your AWS account in the `us-east-1` AWS Region, you can choose to automatically create a certificate or manually create it. After the certificate is created, choose **Next**.

14. Review your distribution details and choose **Create distribution**.

15. After CloudFront creates your distribution, the value of the **Status**
     column for your distribution will change from **Deploying** to
     the date and time that the distribution is deployed.

    The domain name that CloudFront assigns to your distribution appears in the list of
     distributions. (It also appears on the **General** tab for a selected
     distribution.)

    ###### Tip

    You can use an alternate domain name, instead of the name assigned to you by CloudFront,
    by following the steps in [Use custom URLs by adding alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](cnames.md).

16. When your distribution is deployed, confirm that you can access your content by using
     your new CloudFront URL (d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net) or the CNAME. For more information,
     see [Test a distribution](distribution-web-testing.md).

17. Make sure to update your DNS records to point to CloudFront when you're ready to send traffic to your distribution. For more information, see [Point domains to CloudFront (standard distribution)](add-domain-existing-distribution.md#point-domains-standard).

## Values that CloudFront displays in the console

When you create a new distribution or update an existing distribution, CloudFront displays
the following information in the CloudFront console.

###### Note

Active trusted signers, the AWS accounts that have an active CloudFront key pair and can
be used to create valid signed URLs, are currently not visible in the CloudFront console.

### Distribution ID

When you perform an action on a distribution using the CloudFront API, you use the
distribution ID to specify which distribution to use, for
example, `EDFDVBD6EXAMPLE`. You can't change a distribution's distribution ID.

### Deploying and status

When you deploy a distribution, you see the **Deploying** status under
the **Last modified** column. Wait for the distribution to
finish deploying and make sure the **Status** column shows
**Enabled**. For more information, see [Distribution state](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesEnabled).

### Last modified

The date and time that the distribution was last modified, using ISO 8601
format, for example, 2012-05-19T19:37:58Z. For more information, see [https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).

### Domain name

You use the distribution's domain name in the links to your objects. For example, if
your distribution's domain name is `d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net`, the link to
`/images/image.jpg` would be
`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg`. You can't change the CloudFront
domain name for your distribution. For more information about CloudFront URLs for links to your
objects, see [Customize the URL format for files in CloudFront](linkformat.md).

If you specified one or more alternate domain names (CNAMEs), you can use your own
domain names for links to your objects instead of using the CloudFront domain name. For more
information about CNAMEs, see [Alternate domain names (CNAMEs)](downloaddistvaluesgeneral.md#DownloadDistValuesCNAME).

###### Note

CloudFront domain names are unique. Your distribution's domain name was never used for a
previous distribution and will never be reused for another distribution in the
future.
