# How CloudFront processes HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes from your origin

When CloudFront requests an object from your Amazon S3 bucket or custom origin server, your
origin sometimes returns an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code, which indicates that an error
has occurred. CloudFront behavior depends on:

- Whether you have configured custom error pages

- Whether you have configured how long you want CloudFront to cache error responses
from your origin (error caching minimum TTL)

- The status code

- For 5xx status codes, whether the requested object is currently in the CloudFront
edge cache

- For some 4xx status codes, whether the origin returns a `Cache-Control
  						max-age` or `Cache-Control s-maxage` header

CloudFront always caches responses to `GET` and `HEAD` requests. You
can also configure CloudFront to cache responses to `OPTIONS` requests. CloudFront does
not cache responses to requests that use the other methods.

If the origin doesn't respond, the CloudFront request to the origin times out which is
considered an HTTP 5xx error from the origin, even though the origin didn't respond with
that error. In that scenario, CloudFront continues to serve cached content. For more
information, see [Origin unavailable](requestandresponsebehaviorcustomorigin.md#ResponseCustomOriginUnavailable).

If you have enabled logging, CloudFront writes the results to the logs regardless of the
HTTP status code.

returned from CloudFront, see the following:

## How CloudFront processes errors when you have configured custom error pages

If you have configured custom error pages, CloudFront behavior depends on whether the
requested object is in the edge cache.

### The requested object is not in the edge cache

CloudFront continues to try to get the requested object from your origin when all of
the following are true:

- A viewer requests an object.

- The object isn't in the edge cache.

- Your origin returns an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code and one of the
following is true:

- Your origin returns an HTTP 5xx status code instead of
returning a 304 status code (Not Modified) or an updated version
of the object.

- Your origin returns an HTTP 4xx status code that is not
restricted by a cache control header and is included in the
following list of status codes: [HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes that CloudFront caches](#HTTPStatusCodes-cached-errors).

- Your origin returns an HTTP 4xx status code with a
`Cache-Control max-age` header or a
`Cache-Control s-maxage` header, and the status
code is included in the following list of status codes: Control
[HTTP 4xx status codes that CloudFront caches based on Cache-Control headers](#HTTPStatusCodes-cached-errors-with-cache-control).

###### CloudFront does the following:

1. In the CloudFront edge cache that received the viewer request, CloudFront checks
    your distribution configuration and gets the path of the custom error
    page that corresponds with the status code that your origin returned.

2. CloudFront finds the first cache behavior in your distribution that has a
    path pattern that matches the path of the custom error page.

3. The CloudFront edge location sends a request for the custom error page to
    the origin that is specified in the cache behavior.

4. The origin returns the custom error page to the edge location.

5. CloudFront returns the custom error page to the viewer that made the
    request, and also caches the custom error page for the maximum of the
    following:

- The amount of time specified by the error caching minimum TTL
(10 seconds by default)

- The amount of time specified by a `Cache-Control
  										max-age` header or a `Cache-Control
  										s-maxage` header that is returned by the origin when
the first request generated the error

6. After the caching time (determined in Step 5) has elapsed, CloudFront tries
    again to get the requested object by forwarding another request to your
    origin. CloudFront continues to retry at intervals specified by the error
    caching minimum TTL.

###### Note

If you also configured a cache behavior for the same custom error page, CloudFront uses the
cache behavior TTL instead. In this case, CloudFront will do the following for
steps 5 and 6:

- After CloudFront returns the custom error page to the viewer that made
the request, CloudFront checks the cache behavior TTL (for example, you
set the default TTL to 5 seconds). CloudFront then caches the custom error
page up to that maximum.

- After 5 seconds elapse, CloudFront fetches the custom error page from
the origin again. CloudFront will continue to retry at intervals specified
by the cache behavior TTL.

For more information, see the cache behavior [TTL settings](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesMinTTL).

### The requested object is in the edge cache

CloudFront continues to serve the object that is currently in the edge cache when
all of the following are true:

- A viewer requests an object.

- The object is in the edge cache but it has expired.

- Your origin returns an HTTP 5xx status code instead of returning a 304
status code (Not Modified) or an updated version of the object.

###### CloudFront does the following:

1. If your origin returns a 5xx status code, CloudFront serves the object even
    though it has expired. For the duration of the error caching minimum
    TTL, CloudFront continues to respond to viewer requests by serving the object
    from the edge cache.

If your origin returns a 4xx status code, CloudFront returns the status
    code, not the requested object, to the viewer.

2. After the error caching minimum TTL has elapsed, CloudFront tries again to
    get the requested object by forwarding another request to your origin.
    Note that if the object is not requested frequently, CloudFront might evict it
    from the edge cache while your origin server is still returning 5xx
    responses. For information about how long objects stay in CloudFront edge
    caches, see [Manage how long content stays in the cache (expiration)](expiration.md).

## How CloudFront processes errors if you haven't configured custom error pages

If you haven't configured custom error pages, CloudFront behavior depends on whether the
requested object is in the edge cache.

### The requested object is not in the edge cache

CloudFront continues to try to get the requested object from your origin when all of
the following are true:

- A viewer requests an object.

- The object isn't in the edge cache.

- Your origin returns an HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code and one of the
following is true:

- Your origin returns an HTTP 5xx status code instead of
returning a 304 status code (Not Modified) or an updated version
of the object.

- Your origin returns an HTTP 4xx status code that is not
restricted by a cache control header and is included in the
following list of status codes: [HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes that CloudFront caches](#HTTPStatusCodes-cached-errors)

- Your origin returns an HTTP 4xx status code with a
`Cache-Control max-age` header or a
`Cache-Control s-maxage` header and the status
code is included in the following list of status codes: Control
[HTTP 4xx status codes that CloudFront caches based on Cache-Control headers](#HTTPStatusCodes-cached-errors-with-cache-control).

CloudFront does the following:

1. CloudFront returns the 4xx or 5xx status code to the viewer, and also caches
    status code in the edge cache that received the request for the maximum
    of the following:

- The amount of time specified by the error caching minimum TTL
(10 seconds by default)

- The amount of time specified by a `Cache-Control
  										max-age` header or a `Cache-Control
  										s-maxage` header that is returned by the origin when
the first request generated the error

2. For the duration of the caching time (determined in Step 1), CloudFront
    responds to subsequent viewer requests for the same object with the
    cached 4xx or 5xx status code.

3. After the caching time (determined in Step 1) has elapsed, CloudFront tries
    again to get the requested object by forwarding another request to your
    origin. CloudFront continues to retry at intervals specified by the error
    caching minimum TTL.

### The requested object is in the edge cache

CloudFront continues to serve the object that is currently in the edge cache when
all of the following are true:

- A viewer requests an object.

- The object is in the edge cache but it has expired. This means the
object is _stale_.

- Your origin returns an HTTP 5xx status code instead of returning a 304
status code (Not Modified) or an updated version of the object.

CloudFront does the following:

1. If your origin returns a 5xx error code, CloudFront serves the object even
    though it has expired. For the duration of the error caching minimum TTL
    (10 seconds by default), CloudFront continues to respond to viewer requests by
    serving the object from the edge cache.

If your origin returns a 4xx status code, CloudFront returns the status
    code, not the requested object, to the viewer.

2. After the error caching minimum TTL has elapsed, CloudFront tries again to
    get the requested object by forwarding another request to your origin.
    If the object isn't requested frequently, CloudFront might evict it from the
    edge cache while your origin server is still returning 5xx responses.
    For more information, see [Manage how long content stays in the cache (expiration)](expiration.md).

###### Tip

- If you configure the `stale-if-error` or
`Stale-While-Revalidate` directive, you can specify how
long the stale objects are available in the edge cache. This allows you
to continue serving content for your viewers even when your origin is
unavailable. For information, see [Serve stale (expired) content](expiration.md#stale-content).

- CloudFront will only serve an object that is stale up to the specified [maximum TTL](downloaddistvaluescachebehavior.md#DownloadDistValuesMaxTTL) value. After this duration, the object won't be available from the edge cache.

## HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes that CloudFront caches

CloudFront caches HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes returned by your origin, depending on
the specific status code that is returned and whether your origin returns specific
headers in the response.

CloudFront caches the following HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes returned by your origin.
If you configured a custom error page for an HTTP status code, CloudFront caches the
custom error page.

###### Note

If you're using the [CachingDisabled](using-managed-cache-policies.md#managed-cache-policy-caching-disabled) managed cache policy, CloudFront
won't cache these status codes or custom error pages.

### HTTP 4xx status codes that CloudFront caches based on `Cache-Control` headers

CloudFront only caches the following HTTP 4xx status codes returned by your origin
if your origin returns a `Cache-Control max-age` or
`Cache-Control s-maxage` header. If you have configured a custom
error page for one of these HTTP status codes – and your origin returns
one of the cache control headers – CloudFront caches the custom error page.
