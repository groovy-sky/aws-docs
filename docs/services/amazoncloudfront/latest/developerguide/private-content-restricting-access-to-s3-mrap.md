# Restrict access to an Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Point origin

You can use origin access control (OAC) to restrict access to an Amazon S3 Multi-Region
Access Point origin. S3 Multi-Region Access Points provide a global endpoint that routes
requests to the closest S3 bucket based on network latency.

For information about using OAC with a standard Amazon S3 bucket origin, see [Restrict access to an Amazon S3 origin](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you create and set up OAC, you must have a CloudFront distribution with an Amazon S3
Multi-Region Access Point origin. The origin domain name must use the S3 Multi-Region
Access Point hostname format:

`multi-region-access-point-alias.accesspoint.s3-global.amazonaws.com`

For more information about creating an S3 Multi-Region Access Point, see [Creating\
Multi-Region Access Points](../../../s3/latest/userguide/creatingmultiregionaccesspoints.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

## Grant CloudFront permission to access the S3 Multi-Region Access Point

Update the Multi-Region Access Point policy to allow the CloudFront service principal
( `cloudfront.amazonaws.com`) to access the Multi-Region Access Point.
Use a `Condition` element in the policy to allow CloudFront to access the
Multi-Region Access Point only when the request is on behalf of the CloudFront distribution
that contains the origin.

For information about adding or modifying a Multi-Region Access Point policy, see
[Multi-Region\
Access Point policy examples](../../../s3/latest/userguide/multiregionaccesspointpermissions.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### Example Multi-Region Access Point policy for CloudFront OAC

```JSON

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontOACAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3::111122223333:accesspoint/Multi-Region-Access-Point-Alias.mrap/object/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:distribution/CloudFront distribution ID"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Grant CloudFront permission to access the underlying S3 buckets

In addition to the Multi-Region Access Point policy, you must also grant CloudFront
permission to access each of the underlying S3 buckets that are associated with the
Multi-Region Access Point. You can do this in one of two ways:

### Option 1: Grant access only to CloudFront

Add a bucket policy to each S3 bucket that allows the CloudFront service principal to
access the bucket. Use this option when you also need to allow direct access to the
bucket from other sources.

###### Example S3 bucket policy for an underlying bucket

```JSON

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontOACAccessViaMRAP",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket-us-east-1/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:distribution/CloudFront distribution ID"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Option 2: Delegate full bucket access to the Multi-Region Access Point

Grant the Multi-Region Access Point full access to each underlying bucket. With
this approach, all access to the bucket is controlled by the Multi-Region Access
Point policy, which simplifies access management. We recommend this option for use
cases that don't require direct access to the bucket.

###### Example S3 bucket policy that delegates access to the Multi-Region Access Point

```JSON

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DelegateAccessToMRAP",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket-us-east-1",
                "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket-us-east-1/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:DataAccessPointArn": "arn:aws:s3::111122223333:accesspoint/Multi-Region-Access-Point-Alias.mrap"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

For more information, see [Multi-Region Access Point policy example](../../../s3/latest/userguide/multiregionaccesspointpermissions.md#MultiRegionAccessPointPolicyExamples) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### Important

You must add this bucket policy to every S3 bucket that is associated with the
Multi-Region Access Point. If any bucket is missing the policy, CloudFront requests
routed to that bucket will be denied.

### SSE-KMS

If the objects in the underlying S3 buckets are encrypted using server-side
encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), you must make sure that the CloudFront distribution has
permission to use the AWS KMS key. Because S3 Multi-Region Access Points can route
requests to buckets in multiple Regions, you must add a statement to the KMS key
policy in each Region where an underlying bucket uses SSE-KMS. For information
about how to modify a key policy, see [Changing a key\
policy](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Example KMS key policy statement

The following example shows a KMS key policy statement that allows the CloudFront
distribution with OAC to access a KMS key for SSE-KMS.

```JSON

{
    "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipalSSE-KMS",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": [
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:distribution/CloudFront distribution ID"
        }
    }
}
```

###### Important

You must add this key policy statement to the KMS key in every Region where
an underlying S3 bucket uses SSE-KMS encryption.

## Create the origin access control

To create an origin access control (OAC), you can use the AWS Management Console, CloudFormation, the
AWS CLI, or the CloudFront API.

Console

###### To create an origin access control

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFront console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Origin**
**access**.

3. Choose **Create control setting**.

4. On the **Create control setting** form, do the
    following:
1. In the **Details** pane, enter a
       **Name** and (optionally) a
       **Description** for the origin access
       control.

2. In the **Settings** pane, we recommend
       that you leave the default setting ( **Sign requests**
      **(recommended)**). For more information, see
       [Advanced settings for origin access control](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md#oac-advanced-settings-s3).
5. Choose **S3 Multi-Region Access Point** from the
    **Origin type** dropdown.

6. Choose **Create**.

After the OAC is created, make note of the
    **Name**. You need this in the following
    procedure.

###### To add an origin access control to an S3 Multi-Region Access Point origin in a distribution

1. Open the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v4/home).

2. Choose a distribution with an S3 Multi-Region Access Point origin
    that you want to add the OAC to, then choose the
    **Origins** tab.

3. Select the S3 Multi-Region Access Point origin that you want to
    add the OAC to, then choose **Edit**.

4. For **Origin access**, choose **Origin**
**access control settings (recommended)**.

5. From the **Origin access control** dropdown menu,
    choose the OAC that you want to use.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

The distribution starts deploying to all of the CloudFront edge locations. When
an edge location receives the new configuration, it signs all requests that
it sends to the S3 Multi-Region Access Point origin.

CLI

Use the **create-origin-access-control** command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudfront create-origin-access-control \
    --origin-access-control-config '{
        "Name": "my-s3-mrap-oac",
        "Description": "OAC for S3 Multi-Region Access Point",
        "SigningProtocol": "sigv4a",
        "SigningBehavior": "always",
        "OriginAccessControlOriginType": "s3mrap"
    }'
```

CloudFormation

Specify the following values in the
`OriginAccessControlConfig`:

- `SigningProtocol`: `sigv4a`

- `SigningBehavior`: `always`,
`never`, or `no-override`

- `OriginAccessControlOriginType`:
`s3mrap`

###### Example CloudFormation template

```yaml

Type: AWS::CloudFront::OriginAccessControl
Properties:
  OriginAccessControlConfig:
    Description: An optional description for the origin access control
    Name: my-s3-mrap-oac
    OriginAccessControlOriginType: s3mrap
    SigningBehavior: always
    SigningProtocol: sigv4a
```

## Signing behavior

The signing behavior options for S3 Multi-Region Access Point origins are the same as
those for regular Amazon S3 bucket origins. For more information, see [Advanced settings for origin access control](private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md#oac-advanced-settings-s3) in _Restrict access to an Amazon S3_
_origin_.
