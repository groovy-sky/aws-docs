# Create a Lambda@Edge function

To set up AWS Lambda to run Lambda functions that are based on CloudFront events, follow
this procedure.

###### To create a Lambda@Edge function

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda).

02. If you already have one or more Lambda functions, choose **Create**
    **function**.

    If you've don't have any functions, choose **Get Started**
    **Now**.

03. In the Region list at the top of the page, choose
     **US East (N. Virginia)**.

04. Create a function using your own code or create a function starting with a
     CloudFront blueprint.

- To create a function using your own code, choose **Author**
**from scratch**.

- To display a list of blueprints for CloudFront, enter
**cloudfront** in the filter field, and then
choose **Enter**.

If you find a blueprint that you want to use, choose the name of
the blueprint.

05. In the **Basic information** section, specify the
     following values:
    1. **Name** – Enter a name for your
        function.

    2. **Role** – To get started quickly, choose
        **Create new role from template(s)**. You can
        also choose **Choose an existing role** or
        **Create a custom role**, and then follow the
        prompts to complete the information for this section.

    3. **Role name** – Enter a name for the
        role.

    4. **Policy templates** – Choose
        **Basic Edge Lambda permissions**.
06. If you chose **Author from scratch** in step 4, skip to
     step 7.

    If you chose a blueprint in step 4, the **cloudfront**
     section lets you create one trigger, which associates this function with a
     cache in a CloudFront distribution and a CloudFront event. We recommend that you choose
     **Remove** at this point, so there isn't a trigger for
     the function when it's created. Then you can add triggers later.

    ###### Tip

    We recommend that you test and debug the function before adding
    triggers. If you add a trigger now, the function will run as soon as you
    create the function and it finishes replicating to AWS locations
    around the world, and the corresponding distribution is deployed.

07. Choose **Create function**.

    Lambda creates two versions of your function: $LATEST and Version 1. You
     can edit only the $LATEST version, but the console initially displays
     Version 1.

08. To edit the function, choose **Version 1** near the top
     of the page, under the ARN for the function. Then, on the
     **Versions** tab, choose **$LATEST**.
     (If you left the function and then returned to it, the button label is
     **Qualifiers**.)

09. On the **Configuration** tab, choose the applicable
     **Code entry type**. Then follow the prompts to edit or
     upload your code.

10. For **Runtime**, choose the value based on your
     function's code.

11. In the **Tags** section, add any applicable tags.

12. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Publish new**
    **version**.

13. Enter a description for the new version of the function.

14. Choose **Publish**.

15. Test and debug the function. For more information about testing in the
     Lambda console, see [Invoke a Lambda function using the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html#get-started-invoke-manually) in the
     _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

16. When you're ready to have the function execute for CloudFront events, publish
     another version and edit the function to add triggers. For more information,
     see [Add triggers for a Lambda@Edge function](lambda-edge-add-triggers.md).
