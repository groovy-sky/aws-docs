# Create a signed URL using a canned policy

To create a signed URL using a canned policy, complete the following steps.

###### To create a signed URL using a canned policy

1. If you're using .NET or Java to create signed URLs, and if you haven't reformatted the private key for
    your key pair from the default .pem format to a format compatible with .NET or with Java, do so now. For
    more information, see [Reformat the private key (.NET and Java only)](private-content-trusted-signers.md#private-content-reformatting-private-key).

2. Concatenate the following values. You can use the format in this example signed URL.

```nohighlight

https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg?color=red&size=medium&Expires=1767290400&Signature=nitfHRCrtziwO2HwPfWw~yYDhUF5EwRunQA-j19DzZrvDh6hQ73lDx~-ar3UocvvRQVw6EkC~GdpGQyyOSKQim-TxAnW7d8F5Kkai9HVx0FIu-5jcQb0UEmatEXAMPLE3ReXySpLSMj0yCd3ZAB4UcBCAqEijkytL6f3fVYNGQI6&Key-Pair-Id=K2JCJMDEHXQW5F&Hash-Algorithm=SHA256
```

Remove all empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters). You might have to
    include escape characters in the string in application code. All values have
    a type of `String`.

**1\. `Base URL for the file`**

The base URL is the CloudFront URL that you would use to access the file if you were not
using signed URLs, including your own query string parameters,
if any. In the preceding example, the base URL is `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg`. For more information about the format of URLs for
distributions, see [Customize the URL format for files in CloudFront](linkformat.md).

- The following CloudFront URL is for an image file in a distribution (using the CloudFront domain
name). Note that `image.jpg` is in an
`images` directory. The path to the file in
the URL must match the path to the file on your HTTP
server or in your Amazon S3 bucket.

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg`

- The following CloudFront URL includes a query string:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg?size=large`

- The following CloudFront URLs are for image files in a distribution. Both use an alternate
domain name. The second one includes a query
string:

`https://www.example.com/images/image.jpg`

`https://www.example.com/images/image.jpg?color=red`

- The following CloudFront URL is for an image file in a distribution that uses an alternate
domain name and the HTTPS protocol:

`https://www.example.com/images/image.jpg`

**2\. `?`**

The `?` indicates that query parameters follow the
base URL. Include the `?` even if you don't specify
any query parameters.

###### Note

You can specify the following query parameters in any
order.

**3\. `Your query string parameters, if**
**any` `&`**

(Optional) You can enter your own query string parameters. To do so, add an ampersand
( `&`) between each one, such as
`color=red&size=medium`. You can specify
query string parameters in any order within the URL.

###### Important

Your query string parameters can't be named `Expires`,
`Signature`,
`Key-Pair-Id`, or
`Hash-Algorithm`.

**4\. `Expires=` `date and time in Unix time format (in seconds) and Coordinated**
**Universal Time (UTC)`**

The date and time that you want the URL to stop allowing
access to the file.

Specify the expiration date and time in Unix time format (in
seconds) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example,
January 1, 2026 10:00 am UTC converts to `1767290400`
in Unix time format, as shown in the example at the start of
this topic.

To use epoch time, specify a 64-bit integer for a date that's
no later than `9223372036854775807` (Friday, April
11, 2262 at 23:47:16.854 UTC).

For information about UTC, see [RFC 3339, Date and\
Time on the Internet: Timestamps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).

**5\. `&Signature=` `hashed and signed version of the policy**
**statement`**

A hashed, signed, and base64-encoded version of the JSON policy statement. For more
information, see [Create a signature for a signed URL that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-creating-signature).

**6\. `&Key-Pair-Id=` `public key ID for the**
**CloudFront public key whose corresponding private key you're using to**
**generate the signature`**

The ID for a CloudFront public key, for example, `K2JCJMDEHXQW5F`. The public key
ID tells CloudFront which public key to use to validate the signed
URL. CloudFront compares the information in the signature with the
information in the policy statement to verify that the URL has
not been tampered with.

This public key must belong to a key group that is a trusted signer in the
distribution. For more information, see [Specify signers that can create signed URLs and signed cookies](private-content-trusted-signers.md).

**7\. `&Hash-Algorithm=` `SHA1 or SHA256`**

(Optional) The hash algorithm used to create the signature. Supported values are
`SHA1` and `SHA256`. If you don't specify this parameter,
CloudFront defaults to `SHA1`.

## Create a signature for a signed URL that uses a canned policy

To create the signature for a signed URL that uses a canned policy, complete the following procedures.

### Create a policy statement for a signed URL that uses a canned policy

When you create a signed URL using a canned policy, the `Signature` parameter is a hashed and
signed version of a policy statement. For signed URLs that use a canned policy, you don't include the
policy statement in the URL, as you do for signed URLs that use a custom policy. To create the policy
statement, do the following procedure.

###### To create the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a canned policy

1. Construct the policy statement using the following JSON format and using UTF-8 character
    encoding. Include all punctuation and other literal values exactly as specified. For information
    about the `Resource` and `DateLessThan` parameters, see [Values that you specify in the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-statement-values).

```json

{
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Resource": "base URL or stream name",
               "Condition": {
                   "DateLessThan": {
                       "AWS:EpochTime": ending date and time in Unix time format and UTC
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
}
```

2. Remove all empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from the policy
    statement. You might have to include escape characters in the string
    in application code.

#### Values that you specify in the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a canned policy

When you create a policy statement for a canned policy, you specify the following values.

**Resource**

###### Note

You can specify only one value for `Resource`.

The base URL including your query strings, if any, but
excluding the CloudFront `Expires`,
`Signature`, `Key-Pair-Id`,
and `Hash-Algorithm`
parameters, for example:

`https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/horizon.jpg?size=large&license=yes`

Note the following:

- **Protocol** –
The value must begin with `http://` or
`https://`.

- **Query string**
**parameters** – If you have no query
string parameters, omit the question mark.

- **Alternate domain names** – If you specify an
alternate domain name (CNAME) in the URL, you must
specify the alternate domain name when referencing
the file in your webpage or application. Do not
specify the Amazon S3 URL for the object.

**DateLessThan**

The expiration date and time for the URL in Unix time format (in seconds) and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, January 1,
2026 10:00 am UTC converts to 1767290400 in Unix time
format.

This value must match the value of the `Expires` query string parameter in
the signed URL. Do not enclose the value in quotation marks.

For more information, see [When CloudFront checks expiration date and time in a signed URL](private-content-signed-urls.md#private-content-check-expiration).

#### Example policy statement for a signed URL that uses a canned policy

When you use the following example policy statement in a signed URL, a user can access
the file `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/horizon.jpg` until
January 1, 2026 10:00 am UTC:

```json

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Resource": "https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/horizon.jpg?size=large&license=yes",
            "Condition": {
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "AWS:EpochTime": 1767290400
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Create a signature for a signed URL that uses a canned policy

To create the value for the `Signature` parameter in a signed URL, you hash
and sign the policy statement that you created in [Create a policy statement for a signed URL that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-creating-policy-statement).

For additional information and examples of how to hash, sign, and encode the policy statement,
see:

- [Linux commands and OpenSSL for base64 encoding and encryption](private-content-linux-openssl.md)

- [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md)

###### Note

The linked examples use SHA-1 by default. To use SHA-256 instead, replace `sha1` with `sha256` in the OpenSSL commands and include the `Hash-Algorithm=SHA256` query parameter in the signed URL.

###### Option 1: To create a signature by using a canned policy

1. Use the SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash function and the generated RSA or ECDSA private key to hash and sign the policy statement that you
    created in the procedure [To create the policy statement for a signed URL that uses a canned policy](#private-content-canned-policy-creating-policy-statement-procedure). Use the version of the policy statement that no longer includes
    empty spaces.

If you use SHA-256, you must include `&Hash-Algorithm=SHA256` in the signed URL.

For the private key that is required by the hash function, use a private key whose
    public key is in an active trusted key group for the
    distribution.

###### Note

The method that you use to hash and sign the policy statement depends on your programming
language and platform. For sample code, see [Code examples for creating a signature for a signed URL](privatecfsignaturecodeandexamples.md).

2. Remove empty spaces (including tabs and newline characters) from the hashed and signed
    string.

3. Base64-encode the string using MIME base64 encoding. For more information, see [Section 6.8,\
    Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) in _RFC 2045, MIME_
_(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet_
_Message Bodies_.

4. Replace characters that are invalid in a URL query string with characters that are valid. The
    following table lists invalid and valid characters.

Replace these invalid charactersWith these valid characters

+

\- (hyphen)

=

\_ (underscore)

/

~ (tilde)

5. Append the resulting value to your signed URL after `&Signature=`, and return to
    [To create a signed URL using a canned policy](#private-content-creating-signed-url-canned-policy-procedure) to finish
    concatenating the parts of your signed URL.
