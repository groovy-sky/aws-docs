# Signing in to multiple accounts

You can sign in to up to five different identities simultaneously in a single web browser in the AWS Management Console. These can be any combination of root, IAM, or federated roles in different accounts or in the same account.
Each identity you sign in to opens its own instance of the AWS Management Console in a new tab.

When you enable multi-session support, the console URL contains a subdomain (for example, `https://000000000000-aaaaaaaa.us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1`).
Be sure to update your bookmarks and console links.

###### Note

You must opt-in to multi-session support by choosing **Turn on multi-session** in the account menu in the AWS Management Console, or by choosing **Enable multi-session**
on [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). You can opt-out of multi-sessions at any time by choosing **Disable multi-session** on [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) or by clearing your browser cookies. Opt-in is browser specific.
