# How AWS User Experience Customization works with IAM
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam"></a>

AWS User Experience Customization (UXC) works with IAM policies to manage access to UXC API Operations.

Before you use IAM to manage access to AWS User Experience Customization (User Experience Customization), learn what IAM features are available to use with User Experience Customization. We recommend you integrate with User Experience Customization through an AWS managed policy, for more information, see [AWS managed policies for the AWS Management Console](security-iam-awsmanpol.md).

Before you use IAM to manage access to User Experience Customization, learn what IAM features are available to use with User Experience Customization.

| IAM feature | User Experience Customization support |
| --- | --- |
| [Identity-based policies](#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies) |  Yes |
| Resource-based policies |  No  |
| [Policy actions](#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions) |  Yes |
| Policy resources |  No  |
| Policy condition keys |  No  |
| [Temporary credentials](#security_iam_service-with-iam-roles-tempcreds) |  Yes |
| Cross-service principal permissions |  No  |
| Service-linked roles |  No  |
| Service roles |  No  |

To get a high-level view of how User Experience Customization and other AWS services work with most IAM features, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Identity-based policies for User Experience Customization
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies"></a>

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based policy, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. To learn about all of the elements that you can use in a JSON policy, see [IAM JSON policy elements reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

To view examples of User Experience Customization identity-based policies, see [Identity-based policy examples for AWS User Experience Customization](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md).

## Policy actions for User Experience Customization
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions"></a>

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Action` element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.

To see all User Experience Customization actions, refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

Policy actions in User Experience Customization use the `uxc:` prefix before the action (for example `uxc:GetAccountCustomizations`).

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas:

```
"Action": [
      "uxc:GetAccountCustomizations",
      "uxc:ListServices"
         ]
```

To view examples of User Experience Customization identity-based policies, see [Identity-based policy examples for AWS User Experience Customization](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md).

## Policy resources for User Experience Customization
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources"></a>

User Experience Customization does not support policy resources.

## Using temporary credentials with User Experience Customization
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-roles-tempcreds"></a>

Temporary credentials provide short-term access to AWS resources and are automatically created when you use federation or switch roles. AWS recommends that you dynamically generate temporary credentials instead of using long-term access keys. For more information, see [Temporary security credentials in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) and [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Troubleshooting AWS User Experience Customization identity and access
<a name="security_iam_troubleshoot"></a>

Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might encounter when working with User Experience Customization and IAM.

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user tries to use the console to view details about a fictional `{{my-example-widget}}` resource but doesn't have the fictional `uxc:{{GetWidget}}` permissions.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: uxc:{{GetWidget}} on resource: {{my-example-widget}} because no identity-based policy allows the {{GetWidget}} action
```

In this case, the policy for the `mateojackson` user must be updated to allow access to the `{{my-example-widget}}` resource by using the `uxc:{{GetWidget}}` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

After you create your IAM user access keys, you can view your access key ID at any time. However, you can't view your secret access key again. If you lose your secret key, you must create a new access key pair.

Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED`) and a secret access key (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`). Like a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests. Manage your access keys as securely as you do your user name and password.

**Important**
Do not provide your access keys to a third party, even to help [find your canonical user ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.html#FindCanonicalId). By doing this, you might give someone permanent access to your AWS account.

When you create an access key pair, you are prompted to save the access key ID and secret access key in a secure location. The secret access key is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your secret access key, you must add new access keys to your IAM user. You can have a maximum of two access keys. If you already have two, you must delete one key pair before creating a new one. To view instructions, see [Managing access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) in the *IAM User Guide*.

To allow others to access User Experience Customization, you must grant permission to the people or applications that need access. If you are using AWS IAM Identity Center to manage people and applications, you assign permission sets to users or groups to define their level of access. Permission sets automatically create and assign IAM policies to IAM roles that are associated with the person or application. For more information, see [Permission sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/permissionsetsconcept.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide*.

If you are not using IAM Identity Center, you must create IAM entities (users or roles) for the people or applications that need access. You must then attach a policy to the entity that grants them the correct permissions in User Experience Customization. After the permissions are granted, provide the credentials to the user or application developer. They will use those credentials to access AWS. To learn more about creating IAM users, groups, policies, and permissions, see [IAM Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) and [Policies and permissions in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
