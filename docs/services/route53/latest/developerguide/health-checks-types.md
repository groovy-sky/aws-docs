# Types of Amazon Route 53 health checks

You can create the following types of Amazon Route 53 health checks:

**Health checks that monitor an endpoint**

You can configure a health check that monitors an endpoint that you
specify either by IP address or by domain name. At regular intervals that
you specify, Route 53 submits automated requests over the internet to your
application, server, or other resource to verify that it's reachable,
available, and functional. Optionally, you can configure the health check to
make requests similar to those that your users make, such as requesting a
web page from a specific URL.

**Health checks that monitor other health checks (calculated health**
**checks)**

You can create a health check that monitors whether Route 53 considers other
health checks healthy or unhealthy. One situation where this might be useful
is when you have multiple resources that perform the same function, such as
multiple web servers, and your chief concern is whether some minimum number
of your resources are healthy. You can create a health check for each
resource without configuring notification for those health checks. Then you
can create a health check that monitors the status of the other health
checks and that notifies you only when the number of available web resources
drops below a specified threshold.

**Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms**

You can create CloudWatch alarms that monitor the status of CloudWatch metrics, such
as the number of throttled read events for an Amazon DynamoDB database or the
number of Elastic Load Balancing hosts that are considered healthy. After
you create an alarm, you can create a health check that monitors the same
data stream that CloudWatch monitors for the alarm.

To improve resiliency and availability, Route 53 doesn't wait for the CloudWatch
alarm to go into the `ALARM` state. The status of a health check
changes from healthy to unhealthy based on the data stream and on the
criteria in the CloudWatch alarm.

Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following features:

- Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't supported. For more information, see
[High-resolution metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

- Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and SampleCount. Extended statistics aren't supported.

- Route 53 does not support "M out of N" alarms. For more information, see
[Evaluating an alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html#alarm-evaluation) in the _Amazon CloudWatch guide_.

- A health check can only monitor a CloudWatch alarm that exists in the same AWS account as the health check.

- Route 53 does not support alarms that use [metric math](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md) to query multiple CloudWatch metrics.

**Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) routing controller**

Health checks in
ARC are associated with routing controls, which are simple on/off
switches. You configure each routing control health check with a failover
DNS record. Then you can simply update your routing controls in ARC to
reroute traffic and fail over your applications, for example, across
Availability Zones or AWS-Regions. For more information, see [Routing control in\
ARC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.html) in the ARC developer guide.
