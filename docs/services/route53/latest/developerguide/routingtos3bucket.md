# Routing traffic to a website that is hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket

This topic provides comprehensive procedures for routing DNS traffic to any Amazon Simple Storage Service
bucket configured for static website hosting. If you're setting up a static website with
Amazon Simple Storage Service, see [Use your domain for a static website in an Amazon S3 bucket](getting-started-s3.md)
for a complete tutorial.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides secure, durable, highly scalable [cloud storage](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-storage). You can
configure an S3 bucket to host a static website that can include webpages and
client-side scripts. (S3 doesn't support server-side scripting.)

To route domain traffic to an S3 bucket, use Amazon Route 53 to create an [alias\
record](resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.md) that points to your bucket. An alias record is a Route 53 extension to
DNS. It's similar to a CNAME record, except you can create an alias record both for the
root domain, such as example.com, and for subdomains, such as www.example.com. You can
create CNAME records only for subdomains.

###### Note

Route 53 doesn't charge for alias queries to S3 buckets or other AWS
resources.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following:

- An S3 bucket that's configured to host a static website.

For more information, see [Tutorial: Configuring a static website using a custom domain registered\
with Route 53](../../../s3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### Important

The bucket must have the same name as your domain or subdomain. For
example, if you want to use the subdomain acme.example.com, the name of
the bucket must be acme.example.com.

You can route traffic for a domain and its subdomains, such as example.com
and www.example.com, to a single bucket. Create a bucket for the domain and
each subdomain, and configure all but one of the buckets to redirect traffic
to the remaining bucket.

###### Note

An S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint doesn't support
SSL/TLS, so you need to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution and use
the S3 bucket as the origin for the distribution.

For instructions on how to create a CloudFront distribution, see [Routing traffic to an Amazon CloudFront distribution by using your domain name](routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.md).

- A registered domain name. You can use Route 53 as your domain registrar, or
you can use a different registrar.

- Route 53 as the DNS service for the domain. If you register your domain name
by using Route 53, we automatically configure Route 53 as the DNS service for the
domain.

For information about using Route 53 as the DNS service provider for your
domain, see [Making Amazon Route 53 the DNS service for an existing domain](migratingdns.md).

## Configuring Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to an S3 Bucket

To configure Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to an S3 bucket that is configured to host
a static website, perform the following procedure.

###### To route traffic to an S3 bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosted zones**.

3. Choose the name of the hosted zone that has the domain name that you want
    to use to route traffic to your S3 bucket.

4. Choose **Create record**.

5. Specify the following values:

**Record name**

Enter the domain name that you want to use to route traffic to
your S3 bucket. The default value is the name of the hosted
zone.

For example, if the name of the hosted zone is example.com and
you want to use acme.example.com to route traffic to your
bucket, enter **acme**.

**Record type**

Choose **A – IPv4 address**.

**Alias**

Turn on **Alias**.

**Route traffic to**

Choose **Alias to S3 website endpoint**, then
choose the Region that the endpoint is from.

Choose the bucket that has the same name that you specified
for **Record name**.

The list includes a bucket only if the bucket meets the
following requirements:

- The name of the bucket is the same as the name of the
record that you're creating.

- The bucket is configured as a website endpoint.

- The bucket was created by the current AWS
account.

If you created the bucket using a different AWS
account, enter the name of the Region that you created
your S3 bucket in. For the correct format for the Region
name, see the **Website**
**endpoint** column in the table [Amazon S3 website endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

**Evaluate target health**

Choose **No**. For information about
evaluating target health, see [Evaluate target health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-alias.html#rrsets-values-alias-evaluate-target-health).

**Routing policy**

Choose the applicable routing policy. For more information,
see [Choosing a routing policy](routing-policy.md).

6. Choose **Create records**.

Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 servers within 60 seconds. When
    propagation is done, you'll be able to route traffic to your S3 bucket by
    using the name of the alias record that you created in this procedure.
