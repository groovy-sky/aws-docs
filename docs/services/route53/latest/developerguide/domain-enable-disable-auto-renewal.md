# Enabling or disabling automatic renewal for a domain

When you want to change whether Amazon Route 53 automatically renews registration for a
domain shortly before the expiration date, or you want to see the current setting for
automatic renewal, perform the following procedure.

Note that you can't use AWS credits to pay the fee for renewing registration for a
domain.

###### Note

Make sure you turn off automatic renewal if you intend to cancel your AWS
account. Otherwise, you will continue to receive renewal notices from AWS. Your
domain will not, however, be renewed, unless you re-activate your account.

###### To enable or disable automatic renewal for a domain

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Registered domains**.

3. Choose the name of the domain that you want to update.

4. On the **Details** section, in the
    **Actions** dropdown, choose **Turn on**
**auto-renew**

In the **Turn on auto-renew for <domain name>?** agree to
    pay the yearly rate, and choose **Turn on**.

###### Note

The price listed is for the current registration period, and can change.
For more information, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing for Domain Registration](https://d32ze2gidvkk54.cloudfront.net/Amazon_Route_53_Domain_Registration_Pricing_20140731.pdf).

5. To turn off auto-renew, select **Turn off auto-renew** in the
    **Actions** dropdown.

6. If you encounter issues while enabling or disabling automatic renewal, you can
    contact AWS Support for free. For more information, see [Contacting AWS Support about domain registration issues](domain-contact-support.md).
