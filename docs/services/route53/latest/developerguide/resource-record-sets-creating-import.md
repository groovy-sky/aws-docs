# Creating records by importing a zone file

If you're migrating from another DNS service provider, and if your current DNS service provider lets you export your current DNS settings to a zone
file, you can quickly create all of the records for an Amazon Route 53 hosted zone by importing a zone file.

###### Note

A zone file uses a standard format known as BIND to represent records in a text format. For information about the
format of a zone file, see the Wikipedia entry [Zone file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file). Additional
information is available in
[RFC 1034, Domain Names—Concepts and Facilities](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) section 3.6.1, and
[RFC 1035, Domain Names—Implementation and Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035) section 5.

If you want to create records by importing a zone file, note the following:

- The zone file must be in RFC-compliant format.

- The domain name of the records in the zone file must match the name of the
hosted zone.

- Route 53 supports the `$ORIGIN` and `$TTL` keywords. If the
zone file includes `$GENERATE` or `$INCLUDE` keywords, the
import fails and Route 53 returns an error.

- When you import the zone file, Route 53 ignores the SOA record in the zone file.
Route 53 also ignores any NS records that have the same name as the hosted
zone.

- You can import a maximum of 1000 records.

- If the hosted zone already contains records that appear in the zone file, the
import process fails, and no records are created.

- For TXT records that contain backslash characters, the zone file import
process interprets certain backslash sequences as control characters. To include
literal backslash characters in TXT record values:

- Use double backslashes ( `\\\\`) in the zone file to
represent a single literal backslash in the final TXT record.

- For example, if your TXT record should contain
`\\jYTDWqH...` (with a literal backslash and j), specify
`\\\\jYTDWqH...` in the zone file.

This is particularly important for ACME challenge records and other TXT
records that contain literal backslash characters.

- For long TXT records (such as DKIM records), the zone file import process
supports splitting the content into multiple strings. To create TXT records with
multiple strings:

- Use separate lines in your zone file with the same record name and
type.

###### Example

```

example.com. 300 IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC"
example.com. 300 IN TXT "7fCC6C13dM9tXuJmUBH7D4Vw8y1ByJ8z9QX2fvLm3pN4sR5tU6vW7xY8zA9bC0dE1f"
example.com. 300 IN TXT "G2hI3jK4lM5nO6pQ7rS8tU9vW0xY1zA2bC3dE4fG5hI6jK7lM8nO9pQ0rS1tU2vW3x"
```

The import process automatically combines these into a single TXT record with
multiple strings. Each individual string can contain up to 65,535 characters. Do
not concatenate long strings into a single quoted value.

- We recommend that you review the contents of the zone file to confirm that
record names include or exclude a trailing dot as appropriate:

- When the name of a record in the zone file includes a trailing dot
( `example.com.`), the import process interprets the name
as a fully qualified domain name and creates a Route 53 record with that
name.

- When the name of a record in the zone file does not include a trailing
dot ( `www`), the import process concatenates that name with
the domain name in the zone file ( `example.com`) and creates
a Route 53 record with the concatenated name
( `www.example.com`).

If the export process doesn't add a trailing dot to the fully qualified domain
names of a record, the Route 53 import process adds the domain name to the name of
the record. For example, suppose you're importing records into the hosted zone
`example.com` and the name of an MX record in the zone file is
`mail.example.com`, with no trailing dot. The Route 53 import
process creates an MX record named
`mail.example.com.example.com`.

###### Important

For CNAME, MX, PTR, and SRV records, this behavior also applies to the
domain name that is included in the RDATA value. For example, suppose you
have a zone file for `example.com`. If a CNAME record in the zone
file ( `support`, without a trailing dot) has an RDATA value of
`www.example.com` (also without a trailing dot), the import
process creates a Route 53 record with the name
`support.example.com` that routes traffic to
`www.example.com.example.com`. Before you import your zone
file, review RDATA values and update as applicable. For TXT records
containing backslash characters, use double backslashes ( `\\\\`)
in the zone file to represent literal backslashes.

Route 53 doesn't support exporting records to a zone file.

###### Note

If you're creating a record that has the same name as the hosted zone, don't enter a value (for example, an @ symbol) in the Name field.

###### To create records by importing a zone file

1. Get a zone file from the DNS service provider that is currently servicing the domain. The process and terminology
    vary from one service provider to another. Refer to your provider's interface and documentation for information about
    exporting or saving your records in a zone file or a BIND file.

If the process isn't obvious, try asking your current DNS provider's customer support for your
    _records list_ or _zone file_ information.

2. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosted zones**.

4. On the **Hosted zones** page, create a new hosted zone:

1. Choose **Create hosted zone**.

2. Enter the name of your domain and, optionally, a comment.

3. Choose **Create**.
5. Choose **Import zone file**.

6. In the **Import zone file** pane, paste the contents of your zone file into
    the **Zone file** text box.

7. Choose **Import**.

###### Note

Depending on the number of records in your zone file, you might have to wait a few minutes for
the records to be created.

8. If you're using another DNS service for the domain (which is common if you registered the domain with another registrar),
    migrate DNS service to Route 53. When that step is complete, your registrar will start to identify Route 53 as your DNS service in response to
    DNS queries for your domain, and the queries will start being sent to Route 53 DNS servers. (Typically, there's a day or two of delay
    before DNS queries start being routed to Route 53 because information about your previous DNS service is cached on DNS resolvers
    for that long.) For more information, see [Making Amazon Route 53 the DNS service for an existing domain](migratingdns.md).
