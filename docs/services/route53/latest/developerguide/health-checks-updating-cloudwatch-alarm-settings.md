# Updating health checks when you change CloudWatch alarm settings (health checks that monitor a CloudWatch alarm only)

If you create a Route 53 health check that monitors the data stream for a CloudWatch alarm
and then you update the settings in the CloudWatch alarm, Route 53 doesn't automatically
update the alarm settings in the health check. If you want the health check to start
using the new alarm settings, you need to update the health check.

###### Note

To update a health check programmatically, you can use the
`UpdateHealthCheck` API. Just specify the current values for
`AlarmIdentifier` and `Region`, and Route 53 will get the
latest settings from CloudWatch. For more information, see [UpdateHealthCheck](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html) in
the _Amazon Route 53 API Reference_.

###### Note

We're updating the health checks console for Route 53. During the transition period, you can continue
to use the old console.

Choose the tab for the console you are using.
