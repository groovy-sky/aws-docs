# How Resolver endpoints forward DNS queries from your VPCs to your network

When you want to forward DNS queries from the EC2 instances in one or more VPCs in an AWS Region to your network, you perform
the following steps.

1. You create a Resolver outbound endpoint in a VPC, and you specify several values:

- The VPC that you want DNS queries to pass through on the way to the resolvers on your network.

- A [VPC security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) that includes
outbound rules allowing TCP and UDP access on port 53 (or the port
you're using for DNS queries on your network)

For each IP address that you specify for the outbound endpoint, VPC Resolver creates an Amazon VPC elastic network interface
in the VPC that you specify. For more information, see
[Considerations when creating inbound and outbound endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-choose-vpc.html).

2. You create one or more rules, which specify the domain names of the DNS queries that you want
    to delegate to VPC Resolver to forward, or want VPC Resolver to forward to resolvers on
    your network. For forwarding rules, you also specify the IP addresses of the
    resolvers. For more information, see [Using rules to control which queries are forwarded to your network](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network-using-rules.html).

3. You associate each rule with the VPCs for which you want to forward DNS queries to your network.
