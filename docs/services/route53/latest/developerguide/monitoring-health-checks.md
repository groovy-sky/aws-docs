# Monitoring health checks using CloudWatch

Route 53 health checks integrate with CloudWatch metrics so that you can do the following:

- Verify that a health check is properly configured.

- Review the status of a health check over a specified period of time.

- Configure CloudWatch to send an Amazon SNS alert when the status of a health check is unhealthy. Note that several
minutes might elapse between the time that a health check fails and the time that you receive the associated SNS notification.

For more information, see
[How Amazon Route 53 determines whether a health check is healthy](dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.md).

###### To view the status of a health check

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Health checks**.

3. Choose the linked ID of the health check for which you want to view metrics.

4. In the bottom pane, choose the **Metrics** tab.

The two graphs display the status for the last hour in one-minute intervals:

**Health check status**

The graph shows the Route 53 assessment of endpoint health. **1** indicates healthy and
**0** indicates unhealthy.

**Health checkers that report the endpoint healthy (%)**

For health checks that monitor an endpoint only, the graph shows the percentage of
Route 53 health checkers that consider the selected endpoint to be healthy.

When a health check is disabled, this metric isn't available.

**Number of healthy child health checks**

For calculated health checks only, the graph shows the number of child health checks that are healthy.

5. To view a larger graph and specify different settings, choose the three dots on the upper right, and then **Enlarge**. You can change the following settings:

**Statistic**

Changes the calculation that CloudWatch performs on the data.

**Time range**

Displays the status of a health check over a different period, for example, overnight or last week.

**Period**

Changes the interval between data points in the graph.

Note the following:

- If you just created a health check, you might need to wait for a few minutes for data to appear in the graph and for the health check
metric to appear in the list of available metrics.

- The graph doesn't refresh itself automatically. To update the display, choose the refresh (![Icon to refresh the CloudWatch graph](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/cloudwatch-refresh-icon.png)) icon.

5. Choose **Health Check Metrics**.

6. You can also set up SNS notification on the CloudWatch console. For more information, see [Create recommended alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Best-Practice-Alarms.html#Best-Practice-Alarms-create) in the _CloudWatch User_
_Guide_.

## Create an alarm with an SNS notification

###### Note

The following procedure applies to the old console only. The new console directs you to the CloudWatch console to create alarms. For more
information, see [Find and create recommended alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Best-Practice-Alarms.html#Best-Practice-Alarms-create)
in the _CloudWatch User guide_.

###### To receive an Amazon SNS notification when a health check status is unhealthy (old console)

1. In the navigation pane of the Route 53 console, choose **Health Checks**.

2. Choose the row for the applicable health check.

3. In the bottom pane, choose the **Alarms** tab.

The table lists the alarms that you've already created for this health check.

4. Choose **Create Alarm**.

5. Specify the following values:

**Alarm name**

Enter the name that you want Route 53 to display in the **Name** column on the
**Alarms** tab.

**Alarm description**

(Optional) Enter a description for the alarm. This value appears in the CloudWatch console.

**Send notification**

Choose whether you want Route 53 to send you notification if the status of this health check
triggers an alarm.

**Notification target (Only when "Send notification" is "Yes")**

If you want CloudWatch to send notification to an existing SNS topic, choose the topic from the list.

If you want CloudWatch to send notification but not to an existing SNS topic, do one of the following:

- **If you want CloudWatch to send email notification** –
Choose **New SNS topic** and continue with this procedure.

- **If you want CloudWatch to send notification by another method** –
Open a new browser tab, go to the Amazon SNS console, and create the new topic. Then return to the Route 53 console,
choose the name of the new topic from the **Notification target** list, and
continue with this procedure.

**Topic name (Only when you choose to create a new Amazon SNS topic)**

Enter a name for the new Amazon SNS topic.

**Recipient email addresses (Only when you choose to create a new Amazon SNS topic)**

Enter the email address that you want Route 53 to send an SNS notification to when a health check triggers
an alarm.

**Alarm target**

Choose the value that you want Route 53 to evaluate for this health check:

- **Health check status** – Route 53 health checkers report that the
health check is healthy or unhealthy

- **Health checkers that report the endpoint healthy (%)**
(health checks that monitor an endpoint only) –
The percentage of Route 53 health checkers that report that the status of the health check is healthy

- **Number of healthy child health checks** (calculated health checks only) –
The number of child health checks in a calculated health check that report that the status of the
health check is healthy

- **TCP connection time** (HTTP and TCP health checks only) –
The time in milliseconds that it took Route 53 health checkers to establish a TCP connection with the endpoint

- **Time to complete SSL handshake** (HTTPS health checks only) –
The time in milliseconds that it took Route 53 health checkers to complete the SSL/TLS handshake

- **Time to first byte** (HTTP and HTTPS health checks only) –
The time in milliseconds that it took Route 53 health checkers to receive the first byte of the response
to an HTTP or HTTPS request

**Alarm target**

For the alarm targets that are based on latency ( **TCP connection time**,
**Time to complete SSL handshake**, **Time to first byte**), choose whether you want
CloudWatch to calculate latency for Route 53 health checkers in a specific region or for all regions ( **Global**).

Note that if you choose a region, Route 53 measures latency only twice per minute, and the number of samples will be smaller
than if you choose all regions. As a result, outlying values are more likely. To prevent spurious alarm notifications,
we recommend that you specify a larger number of consecutive periods that the health check must fail before CloudWatch
sends you a notification.

**Fulfill condition**

Use the following settings to determine when CloudWatch should trigger an alarm.

Alarm targetRecommended conditionDescription

**Health check status**

**Minimum** < 1

Route 53 health checkers report when the endpoint is unhealthy.

**Health checkers that report the endpoint healthy (%)**

**Average** < _desired percentage_

_Health checks that monitor an endpoint only_ – Route 53 considers the status of a
health check to be unhealthy when less than 18% of health checkers report that the status is healthy.
Don't choose **Sample Count** for this metric because the range of sample counts can change as
Route 53 adds more health checking regions. **Average** will always accurately represent
the percentage of checkers that are reporting the status of a health check.

**Number of healthy child health checks**

**Minimum** < _desired number of healthy child health checks_

The **Minimum** statistic returns the most conservative value and
represents the worst-case scenario.

**TCP connection time**

**Average** \> _desired time in milliseconds_

**Average** is a more consistent value than other statistics.

**Time to complete SSL handshake**

**Average** \> _desired time in milliseconds_

**Average** is a more consistent value than other statistics.

**Time to first byte**

**Average** \> _desired time in milliseconds_

**Average** is a more consistent value than other statistics.

**For at least `x` consecutive periods of `y` minutes/hours/day**

Specify how many consecutive time periods that the specified value must meet the criteria before Route 53 sends notification.
Then specify the length of the time period.

6. When you choose **Create**, Amazon SNS sends you an email with information about the new SNS topic.

7. In the email, choose **Confirm subscription**. You must confirm your subscription to begin receiving CloudWatch notifications.
