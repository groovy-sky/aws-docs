# Managing Resolver query logging configurations

## Configuring (VPC Resolver query logging)

You can configure VPC Resolver query logging in two ways:

- **Direct VPC association** \- Associate VPCs
directly to a query logging configuration.

- **Profile association** \- Associate a query
logging configuration to a Route 53 Profile, which applies the logging to all VPCs
associated with that Profile. For more information, see [Associate VPC Resolver query logging configurations to a Route 53 Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/profile-associate-query-logging.html).

To start logging DNS queries that originate in your VPCs, you perform the
following tasks in the Amazon Route 53 console:

###### To configure Resolver query logging

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. Expand the Route 53 console menu. In the upper left corner of the console,
    choose the three horizontal bars (![Menu icon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/menu-icon.png)) icon.

3. Within the Resolver menu, choose **Query**
**logging**.

4. In the Region selector, choose the AWS Region where you want to create
    the query logging configuration. This must be the same Region where you
    created the VPCs that you want to log DNS queries for. If you have VPCs in
    multiple Regions, you must create at least one query logging configuration
    for each Region.

5. Choose **Configure query logging**.

6. Specify the following values:

**Query logging configuration name**

Enter a name for your query logging configuration. The name
appears in the console in the list of query logging
configurations. Enter a name that will help you find this
configuration later.

**Query logs destination**

Choose the type of AWS resource that you want VPC Resolver to send
query logs to. For information about how to choose among the
options (CloudWatch Logs log group, S3 bucket, and Firehose delivery stream),
see [AWS resources that you can send VPC Resolver query logs to](resolver-query-logs-choosing-target-resource.md).

After you choose the type of resource, you can either create
another resource of that type or choose an existing resource
that was created by the current AWS account.

###### Note

You can choose only resources that were created in the
AWS Region that you chose in step 4, the Region where
you're creating the query logging configuration. If you
choose to create a new resource, that resource will be
created in the same Region.

**VPCs to log queries for**

This query logging configuration will log DNS queries that
originate in the VPCs that you choose. Check the check box for
each VPC in the current Region that you want VPC Resolver to log
queries for, then choose **Choose**.

**Alternative**: Instead of
associating VPCs directly, you can associate this query logging
configuration to a Route 53 Profile, which will apply logging to all VPCs
associated with that Profile. For more information, see [Associate VPC Resolver query logging configurations to a Route 53 Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/profile-associate-query-logging.html).

###### Note

VPC log delivery can be enabled only once for a specific
destination type. The logs can't be delivered to multiple
destinations of the same type, for example, VPC logs can't
be delivered to 2 Amazon S3 destinations.

7. Choose **Configure query logging**.

###### Note

You should start to see DNS queries made by resources in your VPC in the logs
within a few minutes of successfully creating the query logging
configuration.
