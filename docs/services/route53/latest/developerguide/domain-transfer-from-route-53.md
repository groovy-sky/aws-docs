# Transferring a domain from Amazon Route 53 to another registrar

When you transfer a domain from Amazon Route 53 to another registrar, you get some
information from Route 53 and provide it to the new registrar. The new registrar will do
the rest.

###### Important

If you're currently using Route 53 as your DNS service provider and you also want to
transfer DNS service to another provider, be aware that the following Route 53 features
don't have direct parallels with features provided by other DNS service providers.
You'll need to work with the new DNS service provider to determine how to achieve
comparable functionality:

- Alias records. For more information, see [Choosing between alias and non-alias records](resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.md).

- Routing policies other than the simple routing policy. For more
information, see [Choosing a routing policy](routing-policy.md).

- Health checks that are associated with records. For more information, see
[Configuring DNS failover](dns-failover-configuring.md).

Most domain registrars enforce requirements on transferring a domain to another
registrar. The primary purpose of these requirements is to prevent the owners of
fraudulent domains from repeatedly transferring the domains to different registrars.
Requirements vary, but the following requirements are typical:

- You must have registered the domain with the current registrar or transferred
registration for the domain to the current registrar at least 14 days
ago.

- The domain cannot have any of the following domain name status codes:

- pendingDelete

- pendingTransfer

- redemptionPeriod

- clientTransferProhibited

- serverTransferProhibited

For a current list of domain name status codes and an explanation of what each code
means, go to the [ICANN website](https://www.icann.org/) and search
for **epp status codes**. (Search on the ICANN website; web searches
sometimes return an old version of the document.)

###### Note

If you want to transfer your domain to another domain registrar but the AWS
account that the domain is registered with is closed, suspended, or terminated, you
can contact AWS Support for help. Domains cannot be transferred within the first
14 days of registration. For more information, see [Contacting AWS Support about domain registration issues](domain-contact-support.md).

###### Note

If the new registrar requires a REG-ID code, you can contact AWS Support for
help. For more information, see [Contacting AWS Support about domain registration issues](domain-contact-support.md).

###### To transfer a domain from Route 53 to another registrar

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Registered domains**.

03. Choose the name of the domain that you want to transfer to another
     registrar.

04. On the _domain name_ page, check the value of
     **Domain name status code**. If it is one of the following
     values, you can't currently transfer the domain:

- pendingDelete

- pendingTransfer

- redemptionPeriod

- clientTransferProhibited

- serverTransferProhibited

For a current list of domain name status codes and an explanation of what each
code means, go to the [ICANN website](https://www.icann.org/)
and search for **epp status codes**. (Search on the ICANN
website; web searches sometimes return an old version of the document.)

If the value of **Domain name status code** is
**serverTransferProhibited**, you can contact AWS Support
for free to learn what you must do so you can transfer the domain. For more
information, see [Contacting AWS Support about domain registration issues](domain-contact-support.md).

05. If the value of **Transfer lock** is **On**,
     choose **Turn off transfer lock** from the
     **Actions** dropdown.

06. _All domains except .be, .co.za, .ru, .uk, .co.uk, .me.uk, and_
    _.org.uk domains_ – On the _domain name_
     page, choose **Transfer to another registrar** from the
     **Transfer out** dropdown.

     In the **Transfer to another registrar** dialog box, choose
     **Copy** to copy the authorization code for the domain
     transfer. You'll provide this value to your registrar later in this
     procedure.

    ###### Note

    For .eu domains, you can also generate the auth code by using the "My.eu"
    panel at the registry: [https://my.eurid.eu/](https://my.eurid.eu/).

    _.be, .co.za, .es, .ru, .uk, .co.uk, .me.uk, and .org.uk_
    _domains_ – Do the following:

    **.be domains**

    Get the authorization code from the registry for .be domains at
    [DNS\
    Belgium website](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/transfer-code).

    **.co.za domains**

    You don't need to get an authorization code to transfer a .co.za
    domain to another registrar.

    **.ru domains**

    Get the authorization code from the registry for .ru domains at
    [https://www.nic.ru/en/auth/recovery/](https://www.nic.ru/en/auth/recovery):

1. Choose the option to recover credentials by domain
    name.

2. Enter your domain name, and choose
    **Continue**.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to get access to the
    RU-CENTER admin page.

4. In the **Manage your account** section,
    choose **Domain transfer**.

5. Confirm the transfer with REGRU-RU.

**.uk, .co.uk, .me.uk, and .org.uk domains**

Change the IPS tag to the value for the new registrar:

1. Go to the [Find a\
    Registrar](http://www.nominet.uk/registrar-list) page on the Nominet website, and find
    the IPS tag for the new registrar. (Nominet is the registry
    for .uk, .co.uk, .me.uk, and .org.uk domains.)

2. On the **Registered Domains >** _domain name_ page, select the
    **Transfer out**, drop-down, then
    **Update IPS Tag**, and specify the
    value that you got in step 6a.

3. Choose **Update**.

###### Note

You can also update the IPS tag on the Nominet
console. For instructions, see [Switch the registrar](https://theukdomain.uk/help-centre/can-i-switch-the-registrar-i-have-my-domain-registered-with).

07. If you're not currently using Route 53 as the DNS service provider for your
     domain, skip to step 10.

    If you are currently using Route 53 as the DNS service provider for the domain,
     perform the following steps:
    1. Choose **Hosted Zones.**

    2. Choose the name of the hosted zone for your domain. The domain and the
        hosted zone have the same name.

    3. _If you want to continue using Route 53 as the DNS service_
       _provider for the domain:_ Get the names of the four name
        servers that Route 53 assigned to your hosted zone. For more information,
        see [Getting the name servers for a public hosted zone](getinfoabouthostedzone.md).

       _If you do not want to continue using Route 53 as the DNS_
       _service provider for the domain:_ Make note of the
        settings for all of your records except the NS and SOA records. For
        Route 53–specific features such as alias records, you'll need to
        work with your new DNS service provider to determine how to achieve
        comparable functionality.
08. If you're transferring DNS service to another provider, use the methods that
     are provided by the new DNS service to perform the following tasks:

- Create a hosted zone

- Create records that reproduce the functionality of your Route 53
records

- Get the name servers that the new DNS service assigned to your hosted
zone

09. Use the process that is provided by the new registrar to request a transfer of
     the domain.

    _All domains except .co.za, .uk, .co.uk, .me.uk, and .org.uk_
    _domains_ – You'll be prompted to enter the authorization
     code that you got from the Route 53 console in step 6 of this procedure.

10. If you still want to use Route 53 as your DNS service provider, use the process
     that is provided by the new registrar to specify the names of the Route 53 name
     servers that you got in step 7. If you want to use another DNS service provider,
     specify the names of the name servers that the new provider gave you when you
     created a new hosted zone in step 8.

11. Act on the confirmation email:

    **All domains except .jp domains**

    Route 53 sends a confirmation email to the registrant contact for
    the domain:

- Depending on the TLD, the confirmation email includes
a link from one of the following domains. Use this link
to approve or reject the transfer.

- registrar.amazon

- approvemove.com

- domainnameverification.net

- emailverification.info

- key-systems.net

- If you don't take action, the transfer will proceed
automatically on the specified date.

**.jp domains**

Route 53 sends a confirmation email to the registrant contact for
the domain from address
_noreply@domainnameverification.net_ or
_noreply@emailverification.info_ with a
link to confirm the transfer:

- Use this link to approve or reject the transfer. You
will need to provide the domain authorization code
that you obtained in step 7.

- If you don't take action, the transfer will be canceled
on the specified date.

In addition you might receive an email from WIXI.jp. You can
ignore this email.

12. If the registrar that you're transferring the domain to reports that the
     transfer failed, contact that registrar for more information. When you transfer
     a domain to another registrar, all status updates go to the new registrar, so
     Route 53 has no information about why a transfer failed.

    If the new registrar reports that the transfer failed because the
     authorization code that you got from Route 53 isn't valid, open a case with AWS
     Support. (You don't need a support contract, and there's no fee.) For more
     information, see [Contacting AWS Support about domain registration issues](domain-contact-support.md).

    ###### Note

    Authorization codes generated by Gandi are valid for about 5 days. If your
    transfer attempt occurs after this period, it might fail due to an expired
    code.

13. If you transferred DNS service to another DNS service provider, you can delete
     the records in the hosted zone and delete the hosted zone after DNS resolvers
     stop responding to DNS queries with the names of Route 53 name servers. This
     typically takes two days, the amount of time that DNS resolvers commonly cache
     the names of name servers for a domain.

    ###### Important

    If you delete the hosted zone while DNS resolvers are still responding to
    DNS queries with the names of Route 53 name servers, your domain will become
    unavailable on the internet.

    After you delete the hosted zone, Route 53 will stop billing you the monthly
     charge for a hosted zone. For more information, see the following
     documentation:

- [Deleting records](resource-record-sets-deleting.md)

- [Deleting a public hosted zone](deletehostedzone.md)
