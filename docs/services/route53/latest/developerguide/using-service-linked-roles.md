# Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Route 53 Resolver

Route 53 VPC Resolver uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role). A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is
linked directly to VPC Resolver. Service-linked roles are predefined by VPC Resolver and
include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your
behalf.

A service-linked role makes setting up VPC Resolver easier because you don’t have to
manually add the necessary permissions. VPC Resolver defines the permissions of its
service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only VPC Resolver can assume its roles. The
defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions
policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.

You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting the related resources. This
protects your VPC Resolver resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the
resources.

For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see [AWS Services that Work with\
IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) and look for the services that have **Yes** in the
**Service-Linked Role** column. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that
service.

## Service-Linked Role Permissions for VPC Resolver

VPC Resolver uses the **`AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver`** service-linked role to
deliver query logs on your behalf.

The role permissions policy allows VPC Resolver to complete the following actions on your
resources:

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogDelivery",
        "logs:GetLogDelivery",
        "logs:UpdateLogDelivery",
        "logs:DeleteLogDelivery",
        "logs:ListLogDeliveries",
        "logs:DescribeResourcePolicies",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "s3:GetBucketPolicy"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (such as a user, group, or role)
to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see [Service-Linked Role Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Creating a Service-Linked Role for VPC Resolver

You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you create a resolver query
log configuration association in the Amazon Route 53 console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API, VPC Resolver
creates the service-linked role for you.

###### Important

This service-linked role can appear in your account if you completed an action in
another service that uses the features supported by this role. Also, if you were using the
VPC Resolver service before August 12, 2020, when it began supporting service-linked roles,
then VPC Resolver created the `AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver` role in your account. To learn more, see [A New\
Role Appeared in My IAM Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_roles.html#troubleshoot_roles_new-role-appeared).

If you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the
same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create a new Resolver query log
configuration association, the `AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver` service-linked role is created for you again.

## Editing a Service-Linked Role for VPC Resolver

VPC Resolver does not allow you to edit the `AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver` service-linked role. After you
create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities
might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For
more information, see [Editing a\
Service-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Deleting a Service-Linked Role for VPC Resolver

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we
recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not
actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up the resources for your
service-linked role before you can manually delete it.

###### Note

If the VPC Resolver service is using the role when you try to delete the resources,
then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the
operation again.

###### To delete VPC Resolver resources used by the `AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver`

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. Expand the Route 53 console menu. In the upper left corner of the console, choose the three horizontal bars (![Menu icon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/menu-icon.png)) icon.

3. Within the **Resolver** menu, choose **Query logging**.

4. Select the check box next to the name of your query logging configuration, and then choose **Delete**.

5. In the **Delete query logging configuration** text box, select **Stop logging queries**.

This will disassociate the configuration from the VPC. You can also disassociate the
    query logging configuration programmatically. For more information, see [disassociate-resolver-query-log-config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/route53resolver/disassociate-resolver-query-log-config.html).

6. After logging queries has stopped, you can optionally type `delete` in
    the field and choose **Delete** to delete the query logging
    configuration. However, this is not necessary for deleting the resources used by
    `AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver`.

**To manually delete the service-linked role using**
**IAM**

Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the `AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver`
service-linked role. For more information, see [Deleting a\
Service-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Supported Regions for VPC Resolver Service-Linked Roles

VPC Resolver does not support using service-linked roles in every Region where the service is
available. You can use the `AWSServiceRoleForRoute53Resolver` role in the following Regions.
