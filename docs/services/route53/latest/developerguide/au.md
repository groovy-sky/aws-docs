# .au (Australia)

[Return to index](registrar-tld-list.md#index)

**Confirmation email from the TLD registry**

Our registrar associate, Gandi, resells .au domains through
DomainDirectors. When you transfer a domain name to Route 53,
DomainDirectors sends an email to the registrant contact for the
domain to verify contact information or to authorize transfer
requests.

**Lease period for registration and renewal**

One to five years.

**Restrictions**

Open to the public, with some restrictions:

- The .au domains are open to legal persons, trading,
partnerships, or sole traders registered in Australia; to
foreign companies licensed to trade in Australia; and to
owners or applicants of an Australian-registered trademark.
Individuals cannot register .au domains. The registrant
contact must be a company.

- During the registration process, you must indicate the
following:

- Your registration type: ABN (Australian Business
Number), ACN (Australian Company Number), or TM
(Trademark) if the domain name corresponds to your
trademark.

- Your ID number, which can be an Australian Business Name (ABN), Australian Company Number (ACN),
or TM (trademark).

- Your registrant name, which is the name of the legal entity registering the domains.
This value must exactly match the name on the provided ABN (Australian Business
Number), ACN (Australian Company Number), or TM
(Trademark).

- Your eligibility type, which refers to the type of legal entity registering the domain name.

- The reason why you are allowed to register this domain name (Policy reason):

- The domain name matches the acronym or abbreviation of the registrant's company or
trading name, organization or association name, or trademark. (Policy reason 1)

- The domain name meets the allocation rules but is not an acronym or abbreviation of the r
egistrant's company or trading name, organization or association name, or trademark. (Policy reason 2).
To view the allocation rules for .au, see SCHEDULE A from the [.au registry](https://www.auda.org.au/au-domain-names/au-rules-and-policies/domain-name-eligibility-and-allocation-policy-rules-open-2lds-2012-04).

- Incorrect or mismatched contact information, including
name, ABN, or Trademark (TM) number will result in
registration, trade, and renewals failures. An ownership
change might be required to correct information for existing
domains.

**Privacy protection**

Not supported.

**Domain locking to prevent unauthorized transfers**

Not supported. We recommend that you prevent unauthorized
transfers by restricting access to the [RetrieveDomainAuthCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_RetrieveDomainAuthCode.html) API action. (When you restrict
access to this Route 53 API, you also restrict who can generate an
authorization code using the Route 53 console, AWS SDKs, and other
programmatic methods.) For more information, see [Identity and access management in Amazon Route 53](security-iam.md).

**Internationalized domain names**

Not supported.

**Authorization code required for transfers**

Yes. In addition to the Route 53 console, you can also obtain the transfer code from the
[.au registry](https://pw.auda.org.au/).

**DNSSEC**

Supported for domain registration. When you set the key, you must
choose DNS security algorithm 2 (DH). For more information, see
[Configuring DNSSEC for a domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-configure-dnssec.html).

**Deadlines for renewing and restoring domains**

- Renewal is possible: Between 60 days before expiration and
the expiration date

- Late renewal with Route 53 is possible: Until 29 days after
expiration

- Domain is deleted from Route 53: 29 days after
expiration

- Restoration with the registry is possible: No

- Domain is deleted from the registry: 30 days after
expiration

**Deletion of domain registration**

The registry for .au domains doesn't allow you to delete domain
registrations. Instead, you must disable automatic renewal and wait
for the domain to expire. For more information, see [Deleting a domain name registration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-delete.html).

**Changing ownership**

Change the owner by using the Route 53 console. See [Updating contact information for a domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-update-contacts.html#domain-update-contacts-basic). Then complete
the following process to complete the ownership change:

1. Both the old and new registrants must click the link they receive in an email from
    _transfers@1api.net_ to their listed
    email addresses. If this isn't completed within 14 days, you
    have to start the process again.

2. After the responses are confirmed, the owner change in the
    registry will be processed in a short time without any
    further confirmation.
