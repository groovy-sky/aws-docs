# Monitoring the latency between health checkers and your endpoint

When you create a health check, if you choose to monitor the status of an endpoint (not the status of other health checks)
and you choose the **Latency graphs** option, you can view the following values on CloudWatch graphs on the Route 53 console:

- The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to establish a TCP connection
with the endpoint

- The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to receive the first byte of the
response to an HTTP or HTTPS request

- The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers to complete the SSL/TLS handshake

###### Note

You can't enable latency monitoring for existing health checks.

###### Important

The health checkers are run on 16 redundant availability zones. Occasionally an availability
zone can be unavailable because of deployments, updates, maintenance, and so on. The
health check system is designed to account for this without any customer
impact.

###### Note

We're updating the health checks console for Route 53. During the transition period, you can continue
to use the old console.

Choose the tab for the console you are using.

- [New console](#health-checks-latency-new)

- [Old console](#health-checks-latency-old)

###### To view the latency between Route 53 health checkers and your endpoint

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Health checks**.

3. Select the linked ID for the health check for which you want to view metrics. You can view
    latency data only for health checks that monitor the status of an
    endpoint and for which the **Latency graphs**
    option is enabled.

4. In the bottom pane, choose the **Metrics** tab.

5. Choose the time range and the geographic region that you want to display latency graphs for.

The graphs display the status for the specified time range:

**TCP connection time (HTTP and TCP only)**

The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers in the selected geographic region
to establish a TCP connection with the endpoint.

**Time to first byte (HTTP and HTTPS only)**

The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers in the selected geographic region
to receive the first byte of the response to an HTTP or HTTPS request.

**Time to complete SSL handshake (HTTPS only)**

The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers in the selected geographic region
to complete the SSL/TLS handshake.

6. To view a larger graph and specify different settings, choose the three dots on the upper right of the graph. You can change the following settings:

**Statistic**

Changes the calculation that CloudWatch performs on the data.

**Time range**

Displays the status of a health check over a different period, for example, overnight or last week.

**Period**

Changes the interval between data points in the graph.

Note the following:

- If you just created a health check, you might need to wait for a few minutes for data to appear in the graph and for the health check
metric to appear in the list of available metrics.

- The graph doesn't refresh itself automatically. To update the display, choose the refresh (![Icon to refresh the CloudWatch graph](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/images/cloudwatch-refresh-icon.png)) icon.

- If health checks are failing for some reason, such as a connection timeout, Route 53 can't measure latency,
and latency data will be missing from the graph for the affected period.

###### To view the latency between Route 53 health checkers and your endpoint

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Health Checks**.

3. Select the rows for the applicable health checks. You can view latency data only for health checks that monitor
    the status of an endpoint and for which the **Latency graphs** option is enabled.

4. In the bottom pane, choose the **Latency** tab.

5. Choose the time range and the geographic region that you want to display latency graphs for.

The graphs display the status for the specified time range:

**TCP connection time (HTTP and TCP only)**

The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers in the selected geographic region
to establish a TCP connection with the endpoint.

**Time to first byte (HTTP and HTTPS only)**

The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers in the selected geographic region

**Time to complete SSL handshake (HTTPS only)**

The average time, in milliseconds, that it took Route 53 health checkers in the selected geographic region
to complete the SSL/TLS handshake.

###### Note

If you select more than one health check, the graph displays a separate color-coded line for each health check.
