# Enabling DNSSEC validation in Amazon Route 53

When you enable DNSSEC validation for a virtual private cloud (VPC) in Amazon Route 53,
DNSSEC signatures are cryptographically checked to ensure that the response was not
tampered with. You enable DNSSEC validation on your VPC detail page.

DNSSEC validation is applied by VPC Resolver to public signed names when it is performing
recursive DNS resolution.

However, if the VPC Resolver is forwarding to another DNS resolver, that resolver is performing
recursive DNS resolution and, therefore, must also apply the DNSSEC validation.

###### Important

Enabling DNSSEC validation can impact DNS resolution for public DNS records from
AWS resources in a VPC, which could result in an outage. Be aware that enabling or
disabling DNSSEC validation can take several minutes.

###### Note

At this time, the Route 53 VPC Resolver in your VPC (aka AmazonProvidedDNS) ignores the DO
(DNSSEC OK) EDNS header bit and the CD (Checking Disabled) bit in the DNS query. If
you have configured DNSSEC, this means that while the VPC Resolver does perform DNSSEC
validation, it doesn't return DNSSEC records nor set the AD bit in the response.
Therefore, performing your own DNSSEC validation is not currently supported by the
VPC Resolver. If you need to do this you will have to perform your own recursive DNS
resolution.

###### To enable DNSSEC validation for a VPC

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, under **VPC Resolver**, choose
    **VPCs**.

3. Under **DNSSEC validation**, select the check box. If the
    check box is already selected, you can clear it to disable DNSSEC
    validation.

Be aware that enabling or disabling DNSSEC validation can take several
    minutes.
