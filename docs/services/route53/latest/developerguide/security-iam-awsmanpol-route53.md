# AWS managed policies for Amazon Route 53

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed
to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because
they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining
[customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS
managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is
most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for
existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonRoute53FullAccess

You can attach the `AmazonRoute53FullAccess` policy to your IAM
identities.

This policy grants full access to Route 53 resources, including domain
registration and health checking, but excluding VPC Resolver.

**Permissions details**

This policy includes the following permissions.

- `route53:*` – Lets you perform all Route 53 actions
_except_ the following:

- Create and update alias records for which the value of **Alias**
**Target** is a CloudFront distribution, an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, an
Elastic Beanstalk environment, or an Amazon S3 bucket. (With these permissions, you can
create alias records for which the value of **Alias**
**Target** is another record in the same hosted zone.)

- Work with private hosted zones.

- Work with domains.

- Create, delete, and view CloudWatch alarms.

- Render CloudWatch metrics in the Route 53 console.

- `route53domains:*`– Lets you work with domains.

- `cloudfront:ListDistributions` – Lets you create and update
alias records for which the value of **Alias Target** is a CloudFront
distribution.

This permission isn't required if you aren't using the Route 53 console. Route 53
uses it only to get a list of distributions to display in the console.

- `cloudfront:GetDistributionTenantByDomain` – Used to fetch the CloudFront multi-tenant distributions
to let you create and update alias records for which the value of **Alias Target** is a CloudFront distribution tenant.

- `cloudfront:GetConnectionGroup` – Used to fetch the CloudFront multi-tenant distributions
to let you create and update alias records for which the value of **Alias Target** is a CloudFront distribution tenant.

- `cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` – Together with `sns:ListTopics` and
`sns:ListSubscriptionsByTopic`, lets you create, delete, and
view CloudWatch alarms.

- `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics` – Lets you create CloudWatch
metric health checks.

These permissions aren't required if you aren't using the Route 53 console. Route 53
uses it only to get statistics to display in the console.

- `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` – Lets you display the status of your CloudWatch health check metrics.

- `ec2:DescribeVpcs` – Lets you display a list of VPCs.

- `ec2:DescribeVpcEndpoints` – Lets you display a list of VPC
endpoints.

- `ec2:DescribeRegions` – Lets you display a list of
Availability Zones.

- `elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers` – Lets you
create and update alias records for which the value of **Alias**
**Target** is an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

These permissions aren't required if you aren't using the Route 53 console. Route 53
uses it only to get a list of load balancers to display in the console.

- `elasticbeanstalk:DescribeEnvironments` – Lets you create
and update alias records for which the value of **Alias**
**Target** is an Elastic Beanstalk environment.

These permissions aren't required if you aren't using the Route 53 console. Route 53
uses it only to get a list of environments to display in the console.

- `es:ListDomainNames` – Lets you display the names of all Amazon OpenSearch Service domains owned by the current user in the active Region.

- `es:DescribeDomains` – Lets you get the domain configuration for the specified Amazon OpenSearch Service domains.

- `lightsail:GetContainerServices` – Lets you the Lightsail container services to let
you create and update alias records for which the value of **Alias Target** is a Lightsail domain.

- `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetBucketLocation`, and
`s3:GetBucketWebsite` – Let you create and update alias
records for which the value of **Alias Target** is an Amazon S3
bucket. (You can create an alias to an Amazon S3 bucket only if the bucket is
configured as a website endpoint; `s3:GetBucketWebsite` gets the
required configuration information.)

These permissions aren't required if you aren't using the Route 53 console. Route 53
uses these only to get a list of buckets to display in the console.

- `sns:ListTopics`, `sns:ListSubscriptionsByTopic`,
`cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms` – Let you create, delete, and
view CloudWatch alarms.

- `tag:GetResources` – Lets you display the tags in your resources. For example, names of your health checks.

- `apigateway:GET` – Lets you create and update alias records
for which the value of **Alias Target** is an Amazon API Gateway
API.
