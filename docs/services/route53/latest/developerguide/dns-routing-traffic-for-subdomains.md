# Routing traffic for subdomains

When you want to route traffic to your resources for a subdomain, such as
acme.example.com or zenith.example.com, you have two options:

**Create records in the hosted zone for the domain**

Typically, to route traffic for a subdomain, you create a record in the
hosted zone that has the same name as the domain. For example, to route
internet traffic for acme.example.com to a web server in your data center,
you create a record named acme.example.com in the example.com hosted zone.
For more information, see the topic [Working with records](rrsets-working-with.md) and its subtopics.

**Create a hosted zone for the subdomain, and create records in the new hosted**
**zone**

You can also create a hosted zone for the subdomain. Using a separate
hosted zone to route internet traffic for a subdomain is sometimes known as
"delegating responsibility for a subdomain to a hosted zone" or "delegating
a subdomain to other name servers" or some similar combination of terms.
Here's an overview of how it works:

1. You create a hosted zone that has the same name as the subdomain
    that you want to route traffic for, such as acme.example.com.

2. You create records in the new hosted zone that define how you want
    to route traffic for the subdomain (acme.example.com) and its
    subdomains, such as backend.acme.example.com.

3. You get the name servers that Route 53 assigned to the new hosted
    zone when you created it.

4. You create a new NS record in the hosted zone for the domain
    (example.com). The NS record name must be the subdomain name
    (acme.example.com), and you specify the four name servers that you
    got in step 3 as the record values.

When you use a separate hosted zone to route traffic for a subdomain, you
can use IAM permissions to restrict access to the hosted zone for the
subdomain. If you have multiple subdomains that are managed by different
groups, creating a hosted zone for each subdomain can significantly reduce
the number of people who must have access to records in the hosted zone for
the domain.

To implement this delegation process, you need the following IAM
permissions. For more information about Route 53 IAM policies, see [Identity and access management in Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/security-iam.html):

**Parent account (owns example.com)**

The user or role needs permissions to modify records in the
parent domain's hosted zone:

**Child account (creates acme.example.com)**

The user or role needs permissions to create and manage the
subdomain hosted zone:

Using a separate hosted zone for a subdomain also allows you to use
different DNS services for the domain and the subdomain. For more
information, see [Using Amazon Route 53 as the DNS service for subdomains without migrating the parent domain](creating-migrating.md).

There's a small performance impact to this configuration for the first DNS
query from each DNS resolver. The resolver must get information from the
hosted zone for the root domain and then get information from the hosted
zone for the subdomain. After the first DNS query for a subdomain, the
resolver caches the information and doesn't need to get it again until the
TTL expires and another client requests the subdomain from that resolver.
For more information, see [TTL (seconds)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-basic.html#rrsets-values-basic-ttl) in the section [Values that you specify when you create or edit Amazon Route 53 records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values.html).

## Creating another hosted zone to route traffic for a subdomain

One way to route traffic for a subdomain is to create a hosted zone for the
subdomain, and then create records for the subdomain in the new hosted zone. (The
more common option is to create records for the subdomain in the hosted zone for the
domain.)

###### Note

This procedure shows how to delegate a subdomain to Route 53. You can also
delegate a subdomain to other DNS services by creating NS records that point to
those services' name servers instead.

Here's an overview of the process:

1. Create a hosted zone for the subdomain. For more information, see [Creating a new hosted zone for a subdomain](#dns-routing-traffic-for-subdomains-creating-hosted-zone).

2. Add records to the hosted zone for the subdomain. If the hosted zone for
    the domain contains any records that belong in the hosted zone for the
    subdomain, duplicate those records in the hosted zone for the subdomain. For
    more information, see [Creating records in the hosted zone for the subdomain](#dns-routing-traffic-for-subdomains-creating-records)

3. Create an NS record for the subdomain in the hosted zone for the domain,
    which delegates responsibility for the subdomain to the name servers in the
    new hosted zone. If the hosted zone for the domain contains any records that
    belong in the hosted zone for the subdomain, delete the records from the
    hosted zone for the domain. (You created copies in the hosted zone for the
    subdomain in step 2.) For more information, see [Updating the hosted zone for the domain](#dns-routing-traffic-for-subdomains-delegating-responsibility).

### Creating a new hosted zone for a subdomain

To create a hosted zone for a subdomain using the Route 53 console, perform the
following procedure.

###### To create a hosted zone for a subdomain (console)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. If you're new to Route 53, choose **Get started**.

If you're already using Route 53, choose **Hosted**
**zones** in the navigation pane.

3. Choose **Create hosted zone**.

4. In the right pane, enter the name of the subdomain, such as
    acme.example.com. You can also optionally enter a comment.

For information about how to specify characters other than a-z, 0-9,
    and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see
    [DNS domain name format](domainnameformat.md).

5. For **Type**, accept the default value of
    **Public hosted zone**.

6. At the bottom of the right pane, choose **Create hosted**
**zone**.

### Creating records in the hosted zone for the subdomain

To define how you want Route 53 to route traffic for the subdomain
(acme.example.com) and its subdomains (backend.acme.example.com), you create
records in the hosted zone for the subdomain.

Note the following about creating records in the hosted zone for the
subdomain:

- Don't create additional name server (NS) or start of authority (SOA)
records in the hosted zone for the subdomain, and don't delete the
existing NS and SOA records.

- Create all records for the subdomain in the hosted zone for the
subdomain. For example, if you have hosted zones for example.com and for
acme.example.com domain, create all records for the acme.example.com
subdomain in the acme.example.com hosted zone. This includes records
such as backend.acme.example.com and
beta.backend.acme.example.com.

- If the hosted zone for the domain (example.com) already contains
records that belong in the hosted zone for the subdomain
(acme.example.com), duplicate those records in the hosted zone for the
subdomain. In the last step of the process, you delete the duplicate
records from the hosted zone for the domain later.

###### Important

If you have some records for the subdomain in both the hosted zone
for the domain and the hosted zone for the subdomain, DNS behavior
will be inconsistent. Behavior will depend on which name servers a
DNS resolver has cached, the name servers for the domain hosted zone
(example.com) or the name servers for the subdomain hosted zone
(acme.example.com). In some cases, Route 53 will return NXDOMAIN
(non-existent domain) when the record exists, but not in the hosted
zone that DNS resolvers are submitting the query to.

For more information, see [Working with records](rrsets-working-with.md).

### Updating the hosted zone for the domain

When you create a hosted zone, Route 53 automatically assigns four name servers
to the zone. The NS record for a hosted zone identifies the name servers that
respond to DNS queries for the domain or subdomain. To start using the records
in the hosted zone for the subdomain to route internet traffic, you create a new
NS record in the hosted zone for the domain (example.com), and give it the name
of the subdomain (acme.example.com). For the value of the NS record, you specify
the names of the name servers from the hosted zone for the subdomain.

Here's what happens when Route 53 receives a DNS query from a DNS resolver for
the subdomain acme.example.com or one of its subdomains:

1. Route 53 looks in the hosted zone for the domain (example.com) and finds
    the NS record for the subdomain (acme.example.com).

2. Route 53 gets the name servers from the acme.example.com NS record in the
    hosted zone for the domain, example.com, and returns those name servers
    to the DNS resolver.

3. The resolver resubmits the query for acme.example.com to the name
    servers for the acme.example.com hosted zone.

4. Route 53 responds to the query using a record in the acme.example.com
    hosted zone.

To configure Route 53 to route traffic for the subdomain using the hosted zone
for the subdomain and to delete any duplicate records from the hosted zone for
the domain, perform the following procedure:

###### To configure Route 53 to use the hosted zone for the subdomain (console)

1. In the Route 53 console, get the name servers for the hosted zone for the
    subdomain:
1. In the navigation pane, choose **Hosted**
      **zones**.

2. On the **Hosted zones** page, choose the name
       for the hosted zone for the subdomain.

3. In the right pane, copy the names of the four servers listed
       for **Name servers** in the **Hosted**
      **zones details** section.
2. Choose the name of the hosted zone for the domain (example.com), not
    for the subdomain.

3. Choose **Create record**.

4. Choose **Simple routing** and choose
    **Next**.

5. Choose **Define simple record**.

6. Specify the following values:

**Name**

Enter the name of the subdomain (for example,
`acme.example.com`). This must match exactly
the name of the subdomain hosted zone you created.

**Value/Route traffic to**

Choose **IP address or another value depending on**
**the record type**, and paste the names of the
name servers that you copied in step 1.

**Record type**

Choose **NS – Name servers for a hosted**
**zone**.

**TTL (Seconds)**

Change to a more common value for an NS record, such as
172800 seconds.

7. Choose **Define simple record**, and choose
    **Create records**.

8. If the hosted zone for the domain contains any records that you
    recreated in the hosted zone for the subdomain, delete those records
    from the hosted zone for the domain. For more information, see [Deleting records](resource-record-sets-deleting.md).

When you're finished, all records for the subdomain should be in the
    hosted zone for the subdomain.

## Routing traffic for additional levels of subdomains

You route traffic to a subdomain of a subdomain, such as backend.acme.example.com,
the same way that you route traffic to a subdomain, such as acme.example.com. Either
you create records in the hosted zone for the domain, or you create a hosted zone
for the lower-level subdomain, and then you create records in that new hosted
zone.

If you choose to create a separate hosted zone for the lower-level subdomain,
create the NS record for the lower-level subdomain in the hosted zone for the
subdomain that is one level closer to the domain name. This helps to ensure that
traffic is correctly routed to your resources. For example, suppose you want to
route traffic for the following subdomains:

- subdomain1.example.com

- subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com

To use another hosted zone to route traffic for subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com,
you do the following:

1. Create a hosted zone named subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com.

2. Create records in the subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com hosted zone. For
    more information, see [Creating records in the hosted zone for the subdomain](#dns-routing-traffic-for-subdomains-creating-records).

3. Copy the names of the name servers for the
    subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com hosted zone.

4. In the subdomain1.example.com hosted zone, create an NS record named
    subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com, and paste in the names of the name
    servers for the subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com hosted zone.

In addition, delete any duplicate records from the subdomain1.example.com.
    For more information, see [Updating the hosted zone for the domain](#dns-routing-traffic-for-subdomains-delegating-responsibility).

After you create this NS record, Route 53 starts to use the
    subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com hosted zone to route traffic for the
    subdomain2.subdomain1.example.com subdomain.
