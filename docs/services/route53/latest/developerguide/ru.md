# .ru (Russian Federation)

###### Important

You can no longer use Route 53 to register new .ru domains, transfer .ru
domains to Route 53, or renew existing .ru domains with Route 53. If you have existing .ru domains
with Route 53, transfer them to a registrar that supports .ru immediately to avoid
any service disruption.

**Lease period for registration and renewal**

One year.

###### Note

The registry for .ru domains updates the expiration date for a
domain on the day that the domain expires. WHOIS queries will
show the old expiration date for the domain until that date
regardless of when you renew the domain with Route 53.

**Restrictions**

Open to the public, with some restrictions:

- Individuals might need to provide a passport number or
government-issued ID number.

- Foreign companies might need to provide a company ID or
company registration.

**Privacy protection**

Determined by the registry.

**Domain locking to prevent unauthorized transfers**

Not supported. We recommend that you prevent unauthorized
transfers by restricting access to the [RetrieveDomainAuthCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_RetrieveDomainAuthCode.html) API action. (When you restrict
access to this Route 53 API, you also restrict who can generate an
authorization code using the Route 53 console, AWS SDKs, and other
programmatic methods.) For more information, see [Identity and access management in Amazon Route 53](security-iam.md).

**Internationalized domain names**

Not supported.

**Authorization code required for transfers**

Not supported. You can no longer transfer .ru domains to
Route 53.

**DNSSEC**

Not supported.

**Deadlines for renewing and restoring domains**

Not supported. You can no longer renew or restore .ru domains with Route 53.

**Deletion of domain registration**

The registry for .ru domains doesn't allow you to delete domain
registrations. Instead, you must disable automatic renewal and wait
for the domain to expire. For more information, see [Deleting a domain name registration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-delete.html).
