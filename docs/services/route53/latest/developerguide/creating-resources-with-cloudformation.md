# Creating Amazon Route 53 and Route 53 VPC Resolver resources with AWS CloudFormation

Amazon Route 53 and Route 53 VPC Resolver are integrated with AWS CloudFormation, a service that helps you to model
and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time creating and managing your
resources and infrastructure. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources
that you want, and CloudFormation provisions and configures those resources for you.

When you use CloudFormation, you can reuse your template to set up your Route 53 and VPC Resolver resources
consistently and repeatedly. Describe your resources once, and then provision the same
resources over and over in multiple AWS accounts and Regions.

## Route 53, VPC Resolver, and CloudFormation templates

To provision and configure resources for Route 53, VPC Resolver, and related services, you must
understand [CloudFormation\
templates](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/template-guide.md). Templates are formatted text files in JSON or YAML. These templates
describe the resources that you want to provision in your CloudFormation stacks. If you're
unfamiliar with JSON or YAML, you can use CloudFormation Designer to help you get started with
CloudFormation templates. For more information, see [What is CloudFormation Designer?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer.html) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

Route 53 supports creating the following resource types in CloudFormation:

- `AWS::Route53::DNSSEC`

- `AWS::Route53::HealthCheck`

- `AWS::Route53::HostedZone`

- `AWS::Route53::KeySigningKey`

- `AWS::Route53::RecordSet`

- `AWS::Route53::RecordSetGroup`

For more information, including examples of JSON and YAML templates
for Route 53 resources, see the [Amazon Route 53 resource type\
reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_Route53.html) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

VPC Resolver supports creating the following resource types in CloudFormation:

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::FirewallDomainList`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::FirewallDomainList`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::FirewallRuleGroupAssociation`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverDNSSECConfig`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverEndpoint`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverQueryLoggingConfig`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverQueryLoggingConfigAssociation`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverRule`

- `AWS::Route53Resolver::ResolverRuleAssociation`

For more information, including examples of JSON and YAML templates for VPC Resolver
resources, see the [Route 53 VPC Resolver\
resource type reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_Route53Resolver.html) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

## Best practices for Route 53 and CloudFormation

When using CloudFormation to manage Route 53 resources, follow these best practices to avoid
common issues and ensure reliable deployments.

### Understanding eventual consistency

Route 53 uses an eventually consistent model for DNS changes. This can affect CloudFormation
operations, particularly during rollbacks and rapid successive changes.

###### Important

When CloudFormation attempts to roll back DNS record changes, the rollback might fail
due to the Route 53 eventual consistency model. If CloudFormation tries to recreate a record
that was recently deleted but still appears to exist due to eventual
consistency, you might encounter `InvalidChangeBatch` errors that
leave your DNS in a broken state.

To minimize issues related to eventual consistency:

- **Plan changes carefully** \- Avoid making
rapid successive changes to the same DNS records

- **Test in non-production first** \- Always
test DNS changes in development environments before applying to
production

- **Monitor deployments** \- Watch CloudFormation stack
events closely during DNS-related deployments. For monitoring guidance, see
[Monitoring Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-overview.html).

- **Have rollback procedures ready** \- Prepare
manual recovery procedures in case automatic rollbacks fail

### DNS record ordering and logical IDs

When creating multiple DNS records in CloudFormation, be careful about record ordering and
logical ID assignment.

###### Warning

If you define DNS records in arrays or lists within your CloudFormation template,
inserting new records in the middle of the list can cause CloudFormation to reassign
logical IDs to existing records. This triggers record replacements that can lead
to service disruptions and rollback failures.

Best practices for DNS record management:

- **Use explicit logical IDs** \- Always assign
explicit, meaningful logical IDs to DNS records rather than relying on array
indices. For more information about CloudFormation logical IDs, see [Resources section structure](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/resources-section-structure.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_

- **Append new records** \- When adding new DNS
records to existing lists, append them to the end rather than inserting them
in the middle

- **Group related records** \- Consider using
`AWS::Route53::RecordSetGroup` for managing related records
together. For more information, see [AWS::Route53::RecordSetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-route53-recordsetgroup.html) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

- **Review change sets** \- Always review CloudFormation
change sets before deployment to identify unexpected record replacements.
For more information, see [Updating stacks using change sets](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.md) in the
_AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

### Handling rollback failures

If a CloudFormation rollback fails due to DNS-related issues, you might need to perform
manual recovery.

###### To perform manual recovery from failed DNS rollbacks

1. Identify the failed DNS records by reviewing CloudFormation stack events and Route 53
    hosted zone records

2. Manually create or update the missing DNS records through the Route 53
    console or API. For information about creating records, see [Working with records](rrsets-working-with.md).

3. Once DNS is restored, update your CloudFormation template to match the current
    state

4. Deploy the corrected template to bring CloudFormation back in sync with the actual
    resources

To prevent rollback failures:

- Avoid making changes that could trigger DNS record replacements during
high-traffic periods

- Implement health checks and monitoring to detect DNS issues quickly. For
information about health checks, see [Creating and updating health checks](health-checks-creating.md).

- Consider using blue-green deployment strategies for critical DNS changes.
For more information about deployment best practices, see [Best practices for Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/best-practices.html).

- Document emergency procedures for manual DNS recovery
