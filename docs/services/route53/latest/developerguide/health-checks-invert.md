# Inverting health checks

If you invert a health check, Route 53 considers the health
check to be unhealthy when the status is healthy and vice versa.

###### Note

We're updating the health checks console for Route 53. During the transition period, you can continue
to use the old console.

You can invert a health check on the old console when you create or edit the health check. For more information, see
[Values that you specify when you create or update health checks](health-checks-creating-values.md).

To invert health checks on the new console, perform the following procedure.

###### To invert a health check (new console only)

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Health checks**.

3. In the **Actions** column select the three dots and then **Invert**.

Or- select the linked ID of the health check that you want to invert.

4. On the **Configuration** table, the **Inverted** filed specifies whether the health check
    is inverted ( **Yes**) or not ( **No**).

5. Choose **Invert** to invert the health check.

If you want to undo the inverted status, and the **Inverted** field is **Yes**, choose **Invert** again.
