# Monitoring Resolver DNS Firewall rule groups with Amazon CloudWatch

You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the number of DNS queries that are filtered by Resolver DNS Firewall rule groups. Amazon CloudWatch collects and
processes raw data into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are recorded for a period of two weeks, so that
you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your resources are performing. By default, metric data for
DNS Firewall rule groups is automatically sent to CloudWatch at five-minute intervals.

For more information about DNS Firewall, see [Using DNS Firewall to filter outbound DNS traffic](resolver-dns-firewall.md). For more information about CloudWatch, see
[What is Amazon CloudWatch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

## Metrics and dimensions for Resolver DNS Firewall

When you associate a Resolver DNS Firewall rule group with a VPC to filter DNS queries, DNS Firewall
starts to send metrics and dimensions once every 5 minutes to CloudWatch about the queries
that it filters. For information about the metrics and dimensions for DNS Firewall, see
[CloudWatch metrics for Resolver DNS Firewall](#cloudwatch-metrics-resolver-dns-firewall).

You can use the following procedures
to view the metrics in the CloudWatch console or view them by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

###### To view DNS Firewall metrics using the CloudWatch console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. On the navigation bar, choose the Region that you want to view.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**.

4. On the **All metrics** tab, choose **Route 53 VPC Resolver**.

5. Choose a metric that you're interested in.

###### To view metrics using the AWS CLI

- At a command prompt, use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/Route53Resolver"
```
