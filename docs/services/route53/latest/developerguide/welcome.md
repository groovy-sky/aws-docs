# What is Amazon Route 53?

Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions
in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.

If you choose to use Route 53 for all three functions, be sure to follow the order below:

**1\. Register domain names**

Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Route 53 lets you register a name for your website or web application,
known as a _domain name_.

- For an overview, see [How domain registration works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-domain-registration.html).

- For a procedure, see [Registering a new domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html).

- For a tutorial that takes you through registering a domain and creating a simple website in an Amazon S3 bucket, see
[Getting started with Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html).

**2\. Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain**

When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) in the address bar,
Route 53 helps connect the browser with your website or web application.

- For an overview, see [How internet traffic is routed to your website or web application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-dns-service.html).

- For procedures, see [Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring.html).

- For a procedure on how to route email to Amazon WorkMail, see [Routing traffic to Amazon WorkMail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-workmail.html).

**3\. Check the health of your resources**

Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to verify that it's reachable, available,
and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic
away from unhealthy resources.

- For an overview, see [How Amazon Route 53 checks the health of your resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-health-checks.html).

- For procedures, see [Creating Amazon Route 53 health checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html).

###### Other Route 53 features

In addition to being a Domain Name System (DNS) web service, Route 53 offers the following
features:

**VPC Resolver**

Get recursive DNS for your Amazon VPCs in AWS Regions, VPCs in AWS Outposts racks, or any other on-premises networks.
Create conditional forwarding rules and
Route 53 endpoints to resolve custom names mastered in Route 53 private hosted zones or in your on-premises DNS servers.

For more information , see [What is Route 53 VPC Resolver?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html).

**Amazon Route 53 Resolver on Outposts**

Connect VPC Resolver on Outpost racks with DNS servers in your on-premises data
centers through Resolver endpoints. This enables resolution of DNS queries between
the Outposts racks and your other on-premises resources.

For more information , see [What is Amazon Route 53 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/outpost-resolver.html).

**Resolver DNS Firewall**

Protect your recursive DNS queries within the VPC Resolver. Create domain lists and build firewall rules that filter outbound DNS traffic against these rules.

For more information , see [Using DNS Firewall to filter outbound DNS traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-dns-firewall.html).

**Traffic Flow**

Easy-to-use and cost-effective global traffic management: route end users to the best endpoint for your application based on geoproximity, latency, health, and other considerations.

For more information , see [Using Traffic Flow to route DNS traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html).

**Amazon Route 53 Profiles**

With Route 53 Profiles, you can apply and manage DNS-related Route 53 configurations across many VPCs and in different AWS account.

For more information , see [What are Amazon Route 53 Profiles?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/profiles.html).
