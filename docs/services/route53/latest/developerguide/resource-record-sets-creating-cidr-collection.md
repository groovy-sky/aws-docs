# Creating a CIDR collection with CIDR locations and blocks

To get started, create a CIDR collection and add CIDR blocks and locations to it.

###### To create a CIDR collection using the Route 53 console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **IP-based routing**, and then
    **CIDR collections**.

3. Select **Create CIDR collection**.

4. In the **Create CIDR collection** pane, under
    **Details**, enter a name for the
    collection.

5. Choose **Create collection** to create an empty
    collection.

\- or -

In the **Create CIDR locations** section, enter a name for the CIDR
    location in the **CIDR location** box. The location name can be any identifying string, for example
    `company 1`, or
    `Seattle`. It doesn't have to be an actual
    geographic location.

###### Important

The CIDR location name has a maximum length of 16 characters.

Enter the
    CIDR blocks in the **CIDR blocks** box one per line.
    These can be IPv4 or IPv6 addresses ranging from /0 to /24 for IPv4 and
    /0 to /48 for IPv6.

6. After you have entered the CIDR blocks, choose **Create CIDR**
**collection**, or **Add another location**
    to keep entering locations and CIDR block. You can enter multiple CIDR
    locations per collection.

7. After you have entered CIDR locations, choose **Create CIDR**
**collection**.
