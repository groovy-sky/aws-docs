# Naming and tagging health checks

You can add tags to Amazon Route 53 health checks, which lets you give each health check a
name that is more comprehensible than the health check ID. These are the same tags that
AWS Billing and Cost Management provides for organizing your AWS bill. For more information about using tags
for cost allocation, see [Use cost allocation\
tags for custom billing reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation.html) in the
_AWS Billing User Guide_.

Each tag consists of a key (the name of the tag) and a value, both of which you
define. When you add tags to a health check, we recommend that you add one tag that has
the following values for the key and value:

- **key** – **Name**

- **value** – The name that you want to give
to the health check

The value of the **Name** tag appears in the list of health checks on
the Route 53 console, which lets you readily distinguish health checks from one another. To
see other tags for a health check, you choose the health check and then choose the
**Tags** tab.

For more information about tags, see the following topics:

- To add, edit, or delete the **Name** tag when you add or edit
health checks in the Route 53 console, see [Creating and updating health checks](health-checks-creating.md).

- For an overview of tagging Route 53 resources, see [Tagging Amazon Route 53 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/tagging-resources.html).

## Tag restrictions

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource – 50 on the new console and 10 on the old console.

- Maximum **Key** length – 128 Unicode
characters

- Maximum **Value** length – 256 Unicode
characters

- Valid values for **Key** and **Value**
– uppercase and lowercase letters in the UTF-8 character set,
numbers, space, and the following characters: \_ . : / = + - and @

- Tag keys and values are case sensitive

- Don't use the `aws:` prefix for either keys or values; it's
reserved for AWS use

## Adding, editing, and deleting tags for health checks

The following procedures show you how to use tags for your health checks on the
Route 53 console.

###### Note

We're updating the health checks console for Route 53. During the transition period, you can continue
to use the old console.

Choose the tab for the console you are using.

- [New console](#health-checks-tagging-new)

- [Old console](#health-checks-tagging-old)

###### To add tags to health checks

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Health Checks**.

3. Select a health check, or select multiple health checks if you want to add
    the same tag to more than one health check.

4. In the bottom pane, choose the **Tags** tab, and then
    choose **Add/Edit Tags**.

    tag in the **Key** field, and enter a value in the

###### To edit tags for health checks

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Health Checks**.

3. Select a health check.

If you select multiple health checks that share the same tag, you cannot
    edit the value for all the tags simultaneously. Note, however, that you can
    edit the value of a tag that appears in multiple health checks if you select
    health checks that have the tag and at least one than doesn't.

For example, suppose you select multiple health checks that have a
    **Cost Center** tag and one that doesn't. You choose
    the option to add a tag, and you specify **Cost Center**
    for the key and **777** for the value. For the selected
    health checks that already have a **Cost Center** tag,
    Route 53 changes the value to **777**. For the one health
    check that doesn't have a **Cost Center** tag, Route 53 adds
    one and sets the value to **777**.

4. In the bottom pane, choose the **Tags** tab, and then
    choose **Add/Edit Tags**.

5. In the **Add/Edit Tags** dialog box, edit the
    value.

6. Choose **Save**.

3. Select a health check, or select multiple health checks if you want to
    delete the same tag from more than one health check.

4. In the bottom pane, choose the **Tags** tab, and then
    choose **Add/Edit Tags**.

5. In the **Add/Edit Tags** dialog box, choose the
    `X` next to the tag that you want to
    delete.

6. Choose **Save**.
