**Lease period for registration and renewal**

One year.

**Restrictions**

Open to the public, with some restrictions:

- You must reside in Germany or have an administrative
contact (physical person) who resides in Germany and has an
address other than a P.O. box.

- During registration, the DNS (A, MX, and CNAME) of the
domain name must be correctly configured so that it can pass
the registry's zone check. Three servers of two different C
classes are required.

- If you're using a DNS service other than Route 53, the name
servers for the domain must pass a check to ensure that
they're correctly configured. To determine whether the name
servers for your domain will pass the check, see [https://www.denic.de/en/service/tools/nast/](https://www.denic.de/en/service/tools/nast).

- You must provide contact information that meets registry validation requirements. Invalid or incorrectly formatted contact details can cause domain renewals to fail.

**Privacy protection**

Not supported.

**Domain locking to prevent unauthorized transfers**

Not supported. We recommend that you prevent unauthorized
transfers by restricting access to the [RetrieveDomainAuthCode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_RetrieveDomainAuthCode.html) API action. (When you restrict
access to this Route 53 API, you also restrict who can generate an
authorization code using the Route 53 console, AWS SDKs, and other
programmatic methods.) For more information, see [Identity and access management in Amazon Route 53](security-iam.md).

**Internationalized domain names**

Supported.

**Authorization code required for transfers**

Yes

**DNSSEC**

Supported for domain registration. For more information, see [Configuring DNSSEC for a domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-configure-dnssec.html).

**Deadlines for renewing and restoring domains**

- Renewal is possible: Until the expiration date

- Late renewal with Route 53 is possible: No

- Domain is deleted from Route 53: On the expiration
date

- Restoration with the registry is possible: Contact [AWS Support](domain-contact-support.md).

- Domain is deleted from the registry: Contact [AWS Support](domain-contact-support.md).
