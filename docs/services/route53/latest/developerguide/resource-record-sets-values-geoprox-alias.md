## Routing policy

Choose **Geoproximity**.

## Record name

Enter the name of the domain or subdomain that you want to route traffic for. The default value is the name of the hosted zone.

###### Note

If you're creating a record that has the same name as the hosted zone, don't enter a value (for example, an @ symbol) in the **Record**
**name** field.

Enter the same name for all of the records in the group of geoproximity records.

For more information about record names, see [Record name](resource-record-sets-values-alias-common.md#rrsets-values-common-alias-name).

## Record type

The DNS record type. For more information, see [Supported DNS record types](resourcerecordtypes.md).

Select the applicable value based on the AWS resource that you're routing traffic to. Select the same value for all of the records in the group
of geoproximity records:

**API Gateway custom regional API or edge-optimized API**

Select **A — IPv4 address**.

**Amazon VPC interface endpoints**

Select **A — IPv4 address**.

**CloudFront distribution**

Select **A — IPv4 address**.

If IPv6 is enabled for the distribution, create two records, one with a value of **A — IPv4 address** for
**Type**, and one with a value of **AAAA — IPv6 address**.

**App Runner service**

Select **A — IPv4 address**

**Elastic Beanstalk environment that has regionalized subdomains**

Select **A — IPv4 address**

**ELB load balancer**

Select **A — IPv4 address** or **AAAA — IPv6 address**

**Amazon S3 bucket**

Select **A — IPv4 address**

**OpenSearch Service**

Select **A — IPv4 address** or **AAAA — IPv6 address**

**Another record in this hosted zone**

Select the type of the record that you're creating the alias for. All types are supported except **NS** and
**SOA**.

###### Note

If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the _zone apex_), you
can't route traffic to a record for which the value of **Type** is **CNAME**. This is because the
alias record must have the same type as the record you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't
supported even for an alias record.

## Value/Route traffic to

The value that you choose from the list or that you type in the field depends on the AWS resource that you're routing traffic to.

For information about what AWS resources you can target, see [Value/route traffic to](resource-record-sets-values-alias-common.md#rrsets-values-alias-common-target).

For more information about how to configure Route 53 to route traffic to specific AWS resources, see
[Routing internet traffic to your AWS resources](routing-to-aws-resources.md).

## Endpoint location

You can specify the resource endpoint location by using one of the following:

**Custom coordinates**

Specify the longitude and lattitude for a geopgraphic area.

**AWS Region**

Choose an available Region from the **Location** list.

For more information about the Regions, see
[AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure).

**AWS Local Zone Group**

Choose an available Local Zone Region from the **Location** list.

For more information about Local Zones, see
[Available Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/local-zones/latest/ug/available-local-zones.html) in the
_AWS Local Zones User Guide_. A local Zone Group is usually the Local Zone without the ending character. For example,
if the Local Zone is `us-east-1-bue-1a` the Local Zone Group is `us-east-1-bue-1`.

You can also identify the Local Zones Group for a specific Local Zone by using the [describe-availability-zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.html) CLI command:

```

aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-west-2 --all-availability-zones --query "AvailabilityZones[?ZoneName=='us-west-2-den-1a']" | grep "GroupName"
```

This command returns: `"GroupName": "us-west-2-den-1"`, specifying that the Local Zone `us-west-2-den-1a`
belongs to the Local Zone Group `us-west-2-den-1`.

You can't create non-geoproximity records that have the same values for
**Record name** and **Record type** as geoproximity
records.

You also can't create two geoproximity resource record sets that specify the same location for the same record name and record type.

For more information, see available-local-zones.html

## Bias

A bias either expands or shrinks a geographic area from which Route 53 routes traffic to a resource.
A positive bias expands the area, and a negative bias shrinks it. For more information, see
[How Amazon Route 53 uses bias to route traffic](routing-policy-geoproximity.md#routing-policy-geoproximity-bias).

## Health check

Select a health check if you want Route 53 to check the health of a specified endpoint and to respond to DNS queries using this record only when the
endpoint is healthy.

Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified in the record, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the
**Value** field. When you select a health check for a record, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the
health check. For information about how Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy, see [How Amazon Route 53 determines whether a health check is healthy](dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.md).

Associating a health check with a record is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more records to respond to a DNS query, and you want
Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Use health checks only in the following configurations:

- You're checking the health of all of the records in a group of records that have the same name, type, and routing policy (such as failover
or weighted records), and you specify health check IDs for all the records. If the health check for a record specifies an endpoint that is
not healthy, Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that record.

- You select **Yes** for **Evaluate target**
**health** for an alias record or the records in a group of failover
alias, geolocation alias, geoproximity alias, latency alias,
IP-based
alias, or weighted alias record. If the alias records
reference non-alias records in the same hosted zone, you must also specify
health checks for the referenced records. If you associate a health check with
an alias record and also select **Yes** for **Evaluate**
**Target Health**, both must evaluate to true. For more information,
see [What happens when you associate a health check with an alias record?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-alias).

If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For
example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of **Domain name**,
specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the records (example.com).

###### Important

In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of **Domain name** matches the name of the records
and then associate the health check with those records, health check results will be unpredictable.

For geoproximity records, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a closest endpoint that is still healthy.

## Evaluate target health

Select **Yes** if you want Route 53 to determine whether to respond to DNS queries using this record by checking the health of the
resource specified by **Endpoint**.

Note the following:

**API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs**

There are no special requirements for setting **Evaluate target**
**health** to **Yes** when the endpoint is an
API Gateway custom Regional API or an edge-optimized API.

**CloudFront distributions**

You can't set **Evaluate target health** to **Yes** when the endpoint is a CloudFront distribution.

**Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains**

If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in **Endpoint** and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes
queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB
load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set **Evaluate target health** to
**Yes** and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to
other available resources that are healthy, if any.

If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.

**ELB load balancers**

Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:

- **Classic Load Balancers** – If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in
**Endpoint**, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load
balancer. If you set **Evaluate target health** to **Yes** and either no EC2 instances are
healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

- **Application and Network Load Balancers** – If you specify an ELB Application or Network
Load Balancer and you set **Evaluate target health** to **Yes**, Route 53 routes queries to the
load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:

- For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must
contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is
considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

- A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.

###### Note

When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform
a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.

**S3 buckets**

There are no special requirements for setting **Evaluate target health** to **Yes** when the
endpoint is an S3 bucket.

**Amazon VPC interface endpoints**

There are no special requirements for setting **Evaluate target health** to **Yes** when the
endpoint is an Amazon VPC interface endpoint.

**Other records in the same hosted zone**

If the AWS resource that you specify in **Endpoint** is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of
weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the
endpoint. For more information, see [What happens when you omit health checks?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting).
