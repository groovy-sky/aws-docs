# Content Domain 4: Monitoring and Logging

## Task Statement 4.1: Configure the collection, aggregation, and storage of logs and metrics.

### Knowledge of:

- How to monitor applications and infrastructure

- Amazon CloudWatch metrics (for example, namespaces, metrics, dimensions, and resolution)

- Real-time log ingestion

- Encryption options for at-rest and in-transit logs and metrics (for example, client-side and server-side, AWS Key Management Service \[AWS KMS\])

- Security configurations (for example, IAM roles and permissions to allow for log collection)

### Skills in:

- Securely storing and managing logs

- Creating CloudWatch metrics from log events by using metric filters

- Creating CloudWatch metric streams (for example, Amazon S3 or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose options)

- Collecting custom metrics (for example, using the CloudWatch agent)

- Managing log storage lifecycles (for example, Amazon S3 lifecycles, CloudWatch log group retention)

- Processing log data by using CloudWatch log subscriptions (for example, Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, Amazon OpenSearch Service)

- Searching log data by using filter and pattern syntax or Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights

- Configuring encryption of log data (for example, AWS KMS)

## Task Statement 4.2: Audit, monitor, and analyze logs and metrics to detect issues.

### Knowledge of:

- Anomaly detection alarms (for example, CloudWatch anomaly detection)

- Common CloudWatch metrics and logs (for example, CPU utilization with Amazon EC2, queue length with Amazon RDS, 5xx errors with an Application Load Balancer \[ALB\])

- Amazon Inspector and common assessment templates

- AWS Config rules

- AWS CloudTrail log events

### Skills in:

- Building CloudWatch dashboards and Amazon QuickSight visualizations

- Associating CloudWatch alarms with CloudWatch metrics (standard and custom)

- Configuring AWS X-Ray for different services (for example, containers, Amazon API Gateway, Lambda)

- Analyzing real-time log streams (for example, using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams)

- Analyzing logs with AWS services (for example, Amazon Athena, CloudWatch Logs Insights)

## Task Statement 4.3: Automate monitoring and event management of complex environments.

### Knowledge of:

- Event-driven, asynchronous design patterns (for example, S3 Event Notifications or Amazon EventBridge events to Amazon Simple Notification Service \[Amazon SNS\] or Lambda)

- Capabilities of auto scaling for a variety of AWS services (for example, EC2 Auto Scaling groups, RDS storage auto scaling, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Container Service \[Amazon ECS\] capacity provider, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \[Amazon EKS\] autoscalers)

- Alert notification and action capabilities (for example, CloudWatch alarms to Amazon SNS, Lambda, EC2 automatic recovery)

- Health check capabilities in AWS services (for example, ALB target groups, Amazon Route 53)

### Skills in:

- Configuring solutions for auto scaling (for example, DynamoDB, EC2 Auto Scaling groups, RDS storage auto scaling, ECS capacity provider)

- Creating CloudWatch custom metrics and metric filters, alarms, and notifications (for example, Amazon SNS, Lambda)

- Configuring S3 events to process log files (for example, by using Lambda) and deliver log files to another destination (for example, OpenSearch Service, CloudWatch Logs)

- Configuring EventBridge to send notifications based on a particular event pattern

- Installing and configuring agents on EC2 instances (for example, AWS Systems Manager Agent \[SSM Agent\], CloudWatch agent)

- Configuring AWS Config rules to remediate issues

- Configuring health checks (for example, Route 53, ALB)
