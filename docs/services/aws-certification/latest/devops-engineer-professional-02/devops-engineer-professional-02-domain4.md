<a name="devops-engineer-professional-02-domain4"></a>

## Task Statement 4.1: Configure the collection, aggregation, and storage of logs and metrics.
<a name="dop-02-task-4-1"></a>

### Knowledge of:
<a name="dop-02-task-4-1-knowledge"></a>
+ How to monitor applications and infrastructure
+ Amazon CloudWatch metrics (for example, namespaces, metrics, dimensions, and resolution)
+ Real-time log ingestion
+ Encryption options for at-rest and in-transit logs and metrics (for example, client-side and server-side, AWS KMS)
+ Security configurations (for example, IAM roles and permissions to allow for log collection)

### Skills in:
<a name="dop-02-task-4-1-skills"></a>
+ Securely storing and managing logs
+ Creating CloudWatch metrics from log events by using metric filters
+ Creating CloudWatch metric streams (for example, Amazon S3 or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose options)
+ Collecting custom metrics (for example, using the CloudWatch agent)
+ Managing log storage lifecycles (for example, Amazon S3 lifecycles, CloudWatch log group retention)
+ Processing log data by using CloudWatch log subscriptions (for example, Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, Amazon OpenSearch Service)
+ Searching log data by using filter and pattern syntax or Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights
+ Configuring encryption of log data (for example, AWS KMS)

## Task Statement 4.2: Audit, monitor, and analyze logs and metrics to detect issues.
<a name="dop-02-task-4-2"></a>

### Knowledge of:
<a name="dop-02-task-4-2-knowledge"></a>
+ Anomaly detection alarms (for example, CloudWatch anomaly detection)
+ Common CloudWatch metrics and logs (for example, CPU utilization with Amazon EC2, queue length with Amazon RDS, 5xx errors with an Application Load Balancer [ALB])
+ Amazon Inspector and common assessment templates
+ AWS Config rules
+ AWS CloudTrail log events

### Skills in:
<a name="dop-02-task-4-2-skills"></a>
+ Building CloudWatch dashboards and Amazon Quick Sight visualizations
+ Associating CloudWatch alarms with CloudWatch metrics (standard and custom)
+ Configuring AWS X-Ray for different services (for example, containers, Amazon API Gateway, Lambda)
+ Analyzing real-time log streams (for example, using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams)
+ Analyzing logs with AWS services (for example, Amazon Athena, CloudWatch Logs Insights)

## Task Statement 4.3: Automate monitoring and event management of complex environments.
<a name="dop-02-task-4-3"></a>

### Knowledge of:
<a name="dop-02-task-4-3-knowledge"></a>
+ Event-driven, asynchronous design patterns (for example, S3 Event Notifications or Amazon EventBridge events to Amazon SNS or Lambda)
+ Capabilities of auto scaling for a variety of AWS services (for example, EC2 Auto Scaling groups, RDS storage auto scaling, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon ECS capacity provider, Amazon EKS autoscalers)
+ Alert notification and action capabilities (for example, CloudWatch alarms to Amazon SNS, Lambda, EC2 automatic recovery)
+ Health check capabilities in AWS services (for example, ALB target groups, Amazon Route 53)

### Skills in:
<a name="dop-02-task-4-3-skills"></a>
+ Configuring solutions for auto scaling (for example, DynamoDB, EC2 Auto Scaling groups, RDS storage auto scaling, ECS capacity provider)
+ Creating CloudWatch custom metrics and metric filters, alarms, and notifications (for example, Amazon SNS, Lambda)
+ Configuring S3 events to process log files (for example, by using Lambda) and deliver log files to another destination (for example, OpenSearch Service, CloudWatch Logs)
+ Configuring EventBridge to send notifications based on a particular event pattern
+ Installing and configuring agents on EC2 instances (for example, AWS Systems Manager Agent [SSM Agent], CloudWatch agent)
+ Configuring AWS Config rules to remediate issues
+ Configuring health checks (for example, Route 53, ALB)
