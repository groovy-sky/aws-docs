# Multicast in AWS Transit Gateway

Multicast is a communication protocol used for delivering a single stream of data to
multiple receiving computers simultaneously. Transit Gateway supports routing multicast traffic
between subnets of attached VPCs, and it serves as a multicast router for instances sending
traffic destined for multiple receiving instances.

## Multicast concepts

The following are the key concepts for multicast:

- Multicast domain — Allows segmentation of a
multicast network into different domains, and makes the transit gateway act as multiple multicast
routers. You define multicast domain membership at the subnet level.

- Multicast group — Identifies a set of hosts that
will send and receive the same multicast traffic. A multicast group is identified by a
group IP address. Multicast group membership is defined by individual elastic network
interfaces attached to EC2 instances.

- Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) — An
internet protocol that allows hosts and routers to dynamically manage multicast group
membership. An IGMP multicast domain contains hosts that use the IGMP protocol to join,
leave, and send messages. AWS supports the IGMPv2 protocol and both IGMP and static
(API-based) group membership multicast domains.

- Multicast source — An elastic network interface
associated with a supported EC2 instance that is statically configured to send multicast
traffic. A multicast source only applies to static source configurations.

A static source multicast domain contains hosts that do not use the IGMP protocol to
join, leave, and send messages. You use the AWS CLI to add a source and group members. The
statically-added source sends multicast traffic and the members receive multicast
traffic.

- Multicast group member — An elastic network
interface associated with a supported EC2 instance that receives multicast traffic. A
multicast group has multiple group members. In a static source group membership
configuration, multicast group members can only receive traffic. In an IGMP group
configuration, members can both send and receive traffic.

## Considerations

- Transit gateway multicast may not be suitable for high-frequency trading or
performance-sensitive applications. We strongly recommend that you review the [Multicast quotas](transit-gateway-quotas.md#multicast-quotas) for the limits. Contact your account or Solution Architect team for a
detailed review of your performance requirements.

- For information about supported Regions, see [AWS Transit Gateway FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/faqs).

- You must create a new transit gateway to support multicast.

- Multicast group membership is managed using the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Console or the
AWS CLI, or IGMP.

- A subnet can only be in one multicast domain.

- If you use a non-Nitro instance, you must disable the **Source/Dest**
checkbox. For information about disabling the check, see [Changing the source or\
destination checking](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-eni.md#change_source_dest_check) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- A non-Nitro instance cannot be a multicast sender.

- Multicast routing is not supported over Direct Connect, Site-to-Site VPN, peering attachments, or
transit gateway Connect attachments.

- A transit gateway does not support fragmentation of multicast packets. Fragmented multicast
packets are dropped. For more information, see [Maximum transmission unit (MTU)](transit-gateway-quotas.md#mtu-quotas).

- At startup, an IGMP host sends multiple IGMP JOIN messages to join a
multicast group (typically 2 to 3 retries). In the unlikely event that all the IGMP
JOIN messages get lost, the host will not become part of transit gateway multicast
group. In such a scenario you will need to re-trigger the IGMP JOIN message
from the host using application specific methods.

- A group membership starts with the receipt of IGMPv2 JOIN message by the
transit gateway and ends with the receipt of the IGMPv2 LEAVE message. The transit gateway keeps
track of hosts that successfully joined the group. As a cloud multicast router, transit gateway issues
an IGMPv2 QUERY message to all members every two minutes. Each member sends
an IGMPv2 JOIN message in response, which is how the members renew their
membership. If a member fails to reply to three consecutive queries, the transit gateway removes this
membership from all joined groups. However, it continues sending queries to this member for
12 hours before permanently removing the member from its to-be-queried list. An explicit
IGMPv2 LEAVE message immediately and permanently removes the host from any
further multicast processing.

- The transit gateway keeps track of hosts that successfully joined the group. In the event of a
transit gateway outage, the transit gateway continues to send multicast data to the host for seven minutes (420
seconds) after the last successful IGMP JOIN message. The transit gateway continues to
send membership queries to the host for up to 12 hours or until it receives a IGMP
LEAVE message from the host.

- The transit gateway sends membership query packets to all the IGMP members so that it can track
multicast group membership. The source IP of these IGMP query packets is 0.0.0.0/32, and
the destination IP is 224.0.0.1/32 and the protocol is 2. Your security group
configuration on the IGMP hosts (instances), and any ACLs configuration on the host
subnets must allow these IGMP protocol messages.

- When the multicast source and destination are in the same VPC, you cannot use
security group referencing to set the destination security group to accept traffic from
the source's security group.

- For static multicast groups and sources, AWS Transit Gateway automatically remove static
groups and sources for ENIs that no longer exist. This is performed by periodically
assuming the [Transit Gateway service-linked\
role](service-linked-roles.md#tgw-service-linked-roles) to describe ENIs in the account.

- Only static multicast supports IPv6. Dynamic multicast does not.

## Multicast routing

When you enable multicast on a transit gateway, it acts as a multicast router. When you add a subnet
to a multicast domain, we send all multicast traffic to the transit gateway that is associated with
that multicast domain.

### Network ACLs

Network ACL rules operate at the subnet level. They apply to multicast traffic,
because transit gateways reside outside of the subnet. For more information, see [Network ACLs](../userguide/vpc-network-acls.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

For Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) multicast traffic, the following are the
minimum inbound rules. The remote host is the host sending the multicast traffic.

The following are the minimum outbound rules for IGMP.

### Security groups

Security group rules operate at the instance level. They can be applied to both
inbound and outbound multicast traffic. The behavior is the same as with unicast
traffic. For all group member instances, you must allow inbound traffic from the group
source. For more information, see [Security groups](../userguide/vpc-security-groups.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

For IGMP multicast traffic, you must have the following inbound rules at a minimum.
The remote host is the host sending the multicast traffic. You can't specify a security
group as the source of the UDP inbound rule.
