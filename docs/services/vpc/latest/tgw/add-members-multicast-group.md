    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Transit Gateway Multicast**.

3. Select the multicast domain, and then choose **Actions**,
    **Add group members**.

4. For **Group IP address**, enter either the IPv4 CIDR block or IPv6
    CIDR block to assign to the multicast domain.

5. Under **Choose network interfaces**, select the multicast receivers'
    network interfaces.

6. Choose **Add members**.

###### To register members using the AWS CLI
