# Modify a transit gateway in AWS Transit Gateway

You can modify the configuration options for a transit gateway. When you modify a transit
gateway, any existing transit gateway attachments don't experience any service
interruptions.

You cannot modify a transit gateway that has been shared with you.

You cannot remove a CIDR block for the transit gateway if any of the IP addresses
are currently used for a [Connect peer](tgw-connect.md).

###### Note

Transit gateways that have Encryption Support enabled can be attached to VPCs with Encryption Controls
in monitor or Enforce mode, or to VPCs that don’t have Encryption Controls enabled. VPCs that have Encryption
Controls in Enforce mode can ONLY be attached to Transit Gateways that have Encryption Support enabled.

For more detailed information, see [Encryption Support for AWS Transit Gateway](tgw-encryption-support.md).
