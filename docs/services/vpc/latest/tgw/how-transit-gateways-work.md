# How AWS Transit Gateway works

In AWS Transit Gateway, a transit gateway acts as a Regional virtual router for traffic flowing between your
virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. A transit gateway scales elastically based on
the volume of network traffic. Routing through a transit gateway operates at layer 3, where the
packets are sent to a specific next-hop attachment, based on the destination IP
addresses.

## Example architecture diagram

The following diagram shows a transit gateway with three VPC attachments. The route table for each
of these VPCs includes the local route and routes that send traffic destined for the other
two VPCs to the transit gateway.

![VPC connectivity options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/tgw/images/transit-gateway-overview.png)

The following is an example of a default transit gateway route table for the attachments
shown in the previous diagram. The CIDR blocks for each VPC propagate to the route table.
Therefore, each attachment can route packets to the other two attachments.

## Resource attachments

A transit gateway attachment is both a source and a destination of packets. You can attach the
following resources to your transit gateway:

- One or more VPCs. AWS Transit Gateway deploys an elastic network interface within VPC
subnets, which is then used by the transit gateway to route traffic to and from the chosen
subnets. You must have at least one subnet for each Availability Zone, which
then enables traffic to reach resources in every subnet of that zone. During
attachment creation, resources within a particular Availability Zone can reach a
transit gateway only if a subnet is enabled within the same zone. If a subnet route table
includes a route to the transit gateway, traffic is only forwarded to the transit gateway if the
transit gateway has an attachment in the subnet of the same Availability Zone.

- One or more VPN connections

- One or more VPN Concentrators

- One or more AWS Direct Connect gateways

- One or more Transit Gateway Connect attachments

- One or more transit gateway peering connections

## Equal Cost Multipath routing

AWS Transit Gateway supports Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) routing for most attachments. For a
VPN attachment, you can enable or disable ECMP support using the console when
creating or modifying a transit gateway. For all other attachment types, the following ECMP
restrictions apply:

- VPC - VPC does not support ECMP since CIDR blocks cannot overlap. For example,
you can't attach a VPC with a CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 with a second VPC using the same
CIDR to a transit gateway, and then set up routing to load balance the traffic between
them.

- VPN - When the **VPN ECMP support** option is disabled, a
transit gateway uses internal metrics to determine the preferred path in the event of
equal prefixes across multiple paths. For more information on enabling or
disabling ECMP for a VPN attachment, see [Transit gateways in AWS Transit Gateway](tgw-transit-gateways.md).

- AWS Transit Gateway Connect - AWS Transit Gateway Connect attachments automatically support
ECMP.

- AWS Direct Connect Gateway - AWS Direct Connect Gateway attachments automatically
support ECMP across multiple Direct Connect Gateway attachments when the network
prefix, prefix length, and AS\_PATH are exactly the same.

- Transit gateway peering - Transit gateway peering does not support ECMP since
it neither supports dynamic routing nor can you configure the same static route
against two different targets.

- VPN Concentrator - VPN Concentrator does not support ECMP.

###### Note

- BGP Multipath AS-Path Relax is not supported, so you can't use ECMP over
different Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs).

- ECMP is not supported between different attachment types. For example, you
can't enable ECMP between a VPN and a VPC attachment. Instead, transit gateway routes
are evaluated and traffic routed accordingly to the evaluated route. For
more information, see [Route evaluation order](#tgw-route-evaluation-overview).

- A single Direct Connect gateway supports ECMP across multiple transit
virtual interfaces. Therefore, we recommended that you set up and use only a
single Direct Connect gateway and to not set up and use multiple gateways to
take advantage of ECMP. For more information about Direct Connect gateways
and public virtual interfaces, see [How do I set up an Active/Active or Active/Passive Direct Connect\
connection to AWS from a public virtual interface?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/dx-create-dx-connection-from-public-vif).

## Availability Zones

When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, you must enable one or more Availability Zones to be
used by the transit gateway to route traffic to resources in the VPC subnets. To enable each
Availability Zone, you specify exactly one subnet. The transit gateway places a network interface
in that subnet using one IP address from the subnet. After you enable an Availability
Zone by specifying a subnet, traffic can be routed to all subnets in that Availability
Zone, not just the one you specified. However, only resources that reside in
Availability Zones where there is a transit gateway attachment can reach the transit gateway.

If traffic is sourced from an Availability Zone that the destination attachment is not
present in, AWS Transit Gateway will internally route that traffic to a random Availability Zone
where the attachment is present. There is no additional transit gateway charge for this
type of cross-Availability Zone traffic.

We recommend that you enable multiple Availability Zones to ensure
availability.

###### Using appliance mode support

If you plan to configure a stateful network appliance in your VPC, you can enable
appliance mode support for the VPC attachment in which the appliance is located.
This ensures that the transit gateway uses the same Availability Zone for that VPC attachment
for the lifetime of a flow of traffic between source and destination. It also allows
the transit gateway to send traffic to any Availability Zone in the VPC, as long as there is a
subnet association in that zone. For more information, see [Example: Appliance in a shared services VPC](#transit-gateway-appliance-scenario).

## Routing

Your transit gateway routes IPv4 and IPv6 packets between attachments using transit gateway route tables.
You can configure these route tables to propagate routes from the route tables for the
attached VPCs, VPN connections, and Direct Connect gateways. You can also add static
routes to the transit gateway route tables. When a packet comes from one attachment, it is routed
to another attachment using the route that matches the destination IP address.

For transit gateway peering attachments, only static routes are supported.

###### Routing topics

- [Route tables](#tgw-route-tables-overview)

- [Route table association](#tgw-route-table-association-overview)

- [Route propagation](#tgw-route-propagation-overview)

- [Routes for peering attachments](#tgw-route-table-peering)

- [Route evaluation order](#tgw-route-evaluation-overview)

### Route tables

Your transit gateway automatically comes with a default route table. By default, this route
table is the default association route table and the default propagation route
table. If you disable both route propagation and route table association, AWS does
not create a default route table for the transit gateway. However, if either route propagation
or route table association is enabled, AWS then creates a default route
table.

You can create additional route tables for your transit gateway. This enables you to isolate
subsets of attachments. Each attachment can be associated with one route table. An
attachment can propagate its routes to one or more route tables.

You can create a blackhole route in your transit gateway route table that drops traffic that
matches the route.

When you attach a VPC to a transit gateway, you must add a route to your subnet
route table in order for traffic to route through the transit gateway. For more
information, see [Routing for a\
Transit Gateway](../userguide/route-table-options.md#route-tables-tgw) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

### Route table association

You can associate a transit gateway attachment with a single route table. Each route table
can be associated with zero to many attachments and can forward packets to other
attachments.

### Route propagation

Each attachment comes with routes that can be installed in one or more transit gateway route
tables. When an attachment is propagated to a transit gateway route table, these routes are
installed in the route table. You can't filter on advertised routes.

For a VPC attachment, the CIDR blocks of the VPC are propagated to the transit
gateway route table.

When dynamic routing is used with a VPN attachment, VPN Concentrator attachment or a Direct Connect gateway
attachment, you can propagate the routes learned from the on-premises router through
BGP to any of the transit gateway route tables.

When dynamic routing is used with a VPN attachment or a VPN Concentrator attachment, the routes in the route table
associated with the VPN attachment or VPN Concentrator attachment are advertised to the customer gateway through
BGP.

For a Connect attachment, routes in the route table associated with the Connect
attachment are advertised to the third-party virtual appliances, such as SD-WAN
appliances, running in a VPC through BGP.

For a Direct Connect gateway attachment, [allowed prefixes interactions](../../../directconnect/latest/userguide/allowed-to-prefixes.md)
control which routes are advertised to the customer network from AWS.

When a static route and a propagated route have the same destination, the static
route has the higher priority, so the propagated route is not included in the route
table. If you remove the static route, the overlapping propagated route is included
in the route table.

### Routes for peering attachments

You can peer two transit gateways, and route traffic between them. To do this, you create a
peering attachment on your transit gateway, and specify the peer transit gateway with which to create
the peering connection. You then create a static route in your transit gateway route table to
route traffic to the transit gateway peering attachment. Traffic that's routed to the peer
transit gateway can then be routed to the VPC and VPN attachments for the peer transit gateway.

For more information, see [Example: Peered transit gateways](#transit-gateway-peering-scenario).

### Route evaluation order

Transit gateway routes are evaluated in the following order:

- The most specific route for the destination address.

- For routes with the same CIDR, but from different attachment types, the
route priority is as follows:

- Static routes (for example, Site-to-Site VPN static routes)

- Prefix list referenced routes

- VPC-propagated routes

- Direct Connect gateway-propagated routes

- Transit Gateway Connect-propagated routes

- Site-to-Site VPN over private Direct Connect-propagated
routes

- Site-to-Site VPN-propagated routes

- Site-to-Site VPN-Concentrator propagated routes

- Transit Gateway peering-propagated routes (Cloud WAN)

Some attachments support route advertisement over BGP. For routes with the same
CIDR, and from the same attachment type, the route priority is controlled by BGP
attributes:

- Shorter AS Path length

- Lower MED value

- eBGP over iBGP routes are preferred, if the attachment supports it

###### Important

- AWS can't guarantee a consistent route prioritization order
for BGP routes with the same CIDR, attachment type, and BGP
attributes as listed above.

- For routes advertised to a transit gateway without MED,
AWS Transit Gateway will assign the following default values:

- 0 for inbound routes advertised on Direct Connect
attachments.

- 100 for inbound routes advertised on VPN and Connect
attachments.

AWS Transit Gateway only shows a preferred route. A backup route will only appear in the
transit gateway route table if the previously active route is no longer advertised —
for example, if you are advertising the same routes over the Direct Connect gateway
and over Site-to-Site VPN. AWS Transit Gateway will only show the routes received from the
Direct Connect gateway route, which is the preferred route. The Site-to-Site VPN,
which is the backup route, will only display when the Direct Connect gateway is no
longer advertised.

#### VPC and transit gateway route table differences

Route table evaluation differs between whether you're using a VPC route table
or a transit gateway route table.

The following example shows a VPC route table. The VPC local route has the highest
priority, followed by the routes that are the most specific. When a static route
and a propagated route have the same destination, the static route has a higher
priority.

DestinationTargetPriority10.0.0.0/16

2172.31.0.0/16vgw-12345 (propagated)30.0.0.0/0igw-123454

The following example shows a transit gateway route table. If you prefer the Direct Connect
gateway attachment to the VPN attachment, use a BGP VPN connection and propagate
the routes in the transit gateway route table.

## Network function attachments

A network function attachment is a resource that connects a network security function
— for example, an AWS Network Firewall attachment — directly to your transit gateway. It
eliminates the need to manually create and manage inspection VPCs.

With a network function attachment:

- AWS automatically creates and manages the underlying infrastructure

- Traffic can be inspected as it flows through your transit gateway

- Security policies are applied consistently across your network

- You can direct traffic through the firewall using simple routing rules

- The attachment works across multiple Availability Zones for high availability

This integration simplifies network security by allowing you to attach
firewalls directly to your transit gateway rather than creating complex routing
configurations and managing separate endpoints through separate VPCs.

### AWS Network Firewall integration

AWS Network Firewall integration allows you to connect a firewall in the form of a group of
Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints, one per Availability Zone, in a service-managed
buffer VPC. A Network Firewall attachment is created with appliance mode automatically
enabled. This eliminates the need to explicitly manage inspection VPCs.

With Network Firewall integration, you no longer need to create and manage inspection
VPCs for your Network Firewall deployments. Instead of selecting a VPC and subnets
when creating your firewall, you directly select the Transit Gateway, and AWS
automatically provisions and manages all the necessary resources behind the scenes.
You'll see a new transit gateway network function attachment rather than an
individual firewall endpoint.

For cross-account scenarios, the Transit Gateway can be RAM-shared from the Transit Gateway owner to the Network Firewall owner account, allowing either account to manage the firewall attachment. Once your firewall and attachment are ready, you can simply modify your Transit Gateway route tables to send traffic to the attachment for inspection.

###### Note

- Transit Gateway supports only static routing on Network Firewall
attachments.

- Third-party firewalls are not supported.

For more information about firewalls and attachments see [Transit gateway network function attachments](tgw-nf-fw.md).

## Example transit gateway scenarios

The following are common use cases for transit gateways. Your transit gateways are not
limited to these use cases.

###### Examples

You can configure your transit gateway as a centralized router that connects all of your VPCs,
AWS Direct Connect, and Site-to-Site VPN connections. In this scenario, all attachments are associated
with the transit gateway default route table and propagate to the transit gateway default
route table. Therefore, all attachments can route packets to each other, with the transit gateway
serving as a simple layer 3 IP router.

#### Overview

The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario. In
this scenario, there are three VPC attachments and one Site-to-Site VPN attachment to the transit gateway.
Packets from the subnets in VPC A, VPC B, and VPC C that are destined for a subnet in
another VPC or for the VPN connection first route through the transit gateway.

![A transit gateway with three VPC attachments and one VPN attachment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/tgw/images/transit-gateway-three-vpcs.png)

#### Resources

Create the following resources for this scenario:

- Three VPCs. For more information, see [Create a VPC](../userguide/create-vpc.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- A transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway in AWS Transit Gateway](create-tgw.md).

- Three VPC attachments on the transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpc-attachment.md).

- A Site-to-Site VPN attachment on the transit gateway. The CIDR blocks for each VPC propagate to
the transit gateway route table. When the VPN connection is up, the BGP session is established and
the Site-to-Site VPN CIDR propagates to the transit gateway route table and the VPC CIDRs are added to the
customer gateway BGP table. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway attachment to a VPN in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpn-attachment.md).

Ensure that you review the [requirements for your customer gateway device](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.md#CGRequirements) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN_
_User Guide_.

#### Routing

Each VPC has a route table and there is a route table for the transit gateway.

##### VPC route tables

Each VPC has a route table with 2 entries. The first entry is the default entry for local
IPv4 routing in the VPC; this entry enables the instances in this VPC to communicate
with each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet traffic to the transit gateway.
The following table shows the VPC A routes.

The customer gateway BGP table contains the following VPC CIDRs.

- 10.1.0.0/16

- 10.2.0.0/16

- 10.3.0.0/16

You can configure your transit gateway as multiple isolated routers. This is similar to using multiple
transit gateways, but provides more flexibility in cases where the routes and attachments might
change. In this scenario, each isolated router has a single route table. All attachments
associated with an isolated router propagate and associate with its route table. Attachments
associated with one isolated router can route packets to each other, but cannot route
packets to or receive packets from the attachments for another isolated router.

#### Overview

The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario.
Packets from VPC A, VPC B, and VPC C route to the transit gateway. Packets from the subnets in
VPC A, VPC B, and VPC C that have the internet as a destination first route through the
transit gateway and then route to the Site-to-Site VPN connection (if the destination is within that
network). Packets from one VPC that have a destination of a subnet in another VPC, for
example from 10.1.0.0 to 10.2.0.0, route through the transit gateway, where they are blocked
because there is no route for them in the transit gateway route table.

![A transit gateway with three VPC attachments and one VPN attachment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/tgw/images/transit-gateway-isolated.png)

#### Resources

Create the following resources for this scenario:

- Three VPCs. For more information, see [Create a VPC](../userguide/create-vpc.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- A transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway in AWS Transit Gateway](create-tgw.md).

- Three attachments on the transit gateway for the three VPCs. For more information, see [Create a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpc-attachment.md).

- A Site-to-Site VPN attachment on the transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway attachment to a VPN in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpn-attachment.md). Ensure that you review the [requirements for your\
customer gateway device](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.md#CGRequirements) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN_
_User Guide_.

When the VPN connection is up, the BGP session is established and the VPN CIDR propagates to
the transit gateway route table and the VPC CIDRs are added to the customer gateway BGP
table.

#### Routing

Each VPC has a route table, and the transit gateway has two route tables—one for the VPCs and one for
the VPN connection.

##### VPC A, VPC B, and VPC C route tables

Each VPC has a route table with 2 entries. The first entry is the default entry for local
IPv4 routing in the VPC. This entry enables the instances in this VPC to communicate
with each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet traffic to the transit gateway.
The following table shows the VPC A routes.

##### Customer gateway BGP table

The customer gateway BGP table contains the following VPC CIDRs.

- 10.1.0.0/16

- 10.2.0.0/16

- 10.3.0.0/16

You can configure your transit gateway as multiple isolated routers that use a shared service. This is
similar to using multiple transit gateways, but provides more flexibility in cases where the routes
and attachments might change. In this scenario, each isolated router has a single route
table. All attachments associated with an isolated router propagate and associate with its
route table. Attachments associated with one isolated router can route packets to each
other, but cannot route packets to or receive packets from the attachments for another
isolated router. Attachments can route packets to or receive packets from the shared
services. You can use this scenario when you have groups that need to be isolated, but use a
shared service, for example a production system.

Site-to-Site VPN. Packets from subnets in VPC A, VPC B, or VPC C that have a destination of a
subnet in VPC A, VPC B, or VPC C route through the transit gateway, where they are blocked because
there is no route for them in the transit gateway route table. Packets from VPC A, VPC B, and VPC
C that have VPC D as the destination route through the transit gateway and then to VPC D.

![A transit gateway with four VPC attachments and one VPN attachment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/tgw/images/transit-gateway-isolated_shared.png)

#### Resources

Create the following resources for this scenario:

- Four VPCs. For more information, see [Create a VPC](../userguide/create-vpc.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- A transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway](tgw-transit-gateways.md).

- Four attachments on the transit gateway, one per VPC. For more information, see [Create a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpc-attachment.md).

- A Site-to-Site VPN attachment on the transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway attachment to a VPN in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpn-attachment.md).

Ensure that you review the [requirements \
for your customer gateway device](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.md#CGRequirements) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.

When the VPN connection is up, the BGP session is established and the VPN CIDR propagates to
the transit gateway route table and the VPC CIDRs are added to the customer gateway BGP
table.

- Each isolated VPC is associated with the isolated route table and propagated
to the shared route table.

- Each shared services VPC is associated with the shared route table and
propagated to both route tables.

#### Routing

Each VPC has a route table, and the transit gateway has two route tables—one for the VPCs and
one for the VPN connection and shared services VPC.

##### VPC A, VPC B, VPC C, and VPC D route tables

Each VPC has a route table with two entries. The first entry is the default entry for local
routing in the VPC; this entry enables the instances in this VPC to communicate with
each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet traffic to the
transit gateway.

DestinationTarget10.1.0.0/16local0.0.0.0/0`transit gateway ID`

##### Transit gateway route tables

This scenario uses one route table for the VPCs and one route table for the VPN
connection.

The VPC A, B, and C attachments are associated with the following route table,
which has a propagated route for the VPN attachment and a propagated route for the
attachment for VPC D.

DestinationTargetRoute type10.99.99.0/24`Attachment for VPN connection`propagated10.4.0.0/16`Attachment for VPC D`propagated

The VPN attachment and shared services VPC (VPC D) attachments are associated with the
following route table, which has entries that point to each of the VPC attachments.
This enables communication to the VPCs from the VPN connection and the shared
services VPC.

For more information, see [Enable route propagation to a transit gateway route table in AWS Transit Gateway](enable-tgw-route-propagation.md).

##### Customer gateway BGP table

The customer gateway BGP table contains the CIDRs for all four VPCs.

You can create a transit gateway peering connection between transit gateways. You can then
route traffic between the attachments for each of the transit gateways. In this scenario,
VPC and VPN attachments are associated with the transit gateway default route tables, and
they propagate to the transit gateway default route tables. Each transit gateway route table
has a static route that points to the transit gateway peering attachment.

#### Overview

The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario.
Transit gateway 1 has two VPC attachments, and transit gateway 2 has one Site-to-Site VPN
attachment. Packets from the subnets in VPC A and VPC B that have the internet as a
destination first route through transit gateway 1, then transit gateway 2, and then route to the VPN
connection.

![Two peered transit gateways, one with two VPC attachments and the other with a VPN attachment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/tgw/images/transit-gateway-peering.png)

#### Resources

Create the following resources for this scenario:

- Two VPCs. For more information, see [Create a VPC](../userguide/create-vpc.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- Two transit gateways. They can be in the same Region or in different Regions. For more information,
see [Create a transit gateway in AWS Transit Gateway](create-tgw.md).

- Two VPC attachments on the first transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpc-attachment.md).

- A Site-to-Site VPN attachment on the second transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway attachment to a VPN in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpn-attachment.md). Ensure that you review the [requirements for your\
customer gateway device](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.md#CGRequirements) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User_
_Guide_.

- A transit gateway peering attachment between the two transit gateways. For more
information, see [Transit gateway peering attachments in AWS Transit Gateway](tgw-peering.md).

When you create the VPC attachments, the CIDRs for each VPC propagate to the route
table for transit gateway 1. When the VPN connection is up, the following actions occur:

- The BGP session is established

- The Site-to-Site VPN CIDR propagates to the route table for transit gateway 2

- The VPC CIDRs are added to the customer gateway BGP table

#### Routing

Each VPC has a route table and each transit gateway has a route table.

##### VPC A and VPC B route tables

Each VPC has a route table with 2 entries. The first entry is the default entry for local
IPv4 routing in the VPC. This default entry enables the resources in this VPC to
communicate with each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet traffic
to the transit gateway. The following table shows the VPC A routes.

- 10.2.0.0/16

You can configure a transit gateway to route outbound internet traffic from a VPC without an internet
gateway to a VPC that contains a NAT gateway and an internet gateway.

#### Overview

The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario. You
have applications in VPC A and VPC B that need outbound only internet access. You
configure VPC C with a public NAT gateway and an internet gateway, and a private subnet
for the VPC attachment. Connect all VPCs to a transit gateway. Configure routing so that outbound
internet traffic from VPC A and VPC B traverses the transit gateway to VPC C. The NAT gateway in
VPC C routes the traffic to the internet gateway.

#### Resources

Create the following resources for this scenario:

- Three VPCs with IP address ranges that are neither identical nor overlap. For more information,
see [Create a VPC](../userguide/create-vpc.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- VPC A and VPC B each have private subnets with EC2 instances.

- VPC C has the following:

- An internet gateway attached to the VPC. For more information, see [Create and attach an internet gateway](../userguide/vpc-internet-gateway.md#Add_IGW_Attach_Gateway) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- A public subnet with a NAT gateway. For more information, see [Create\
a NAT gateway](../userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.md#nat-gateway-creating) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- A private subnet for the transit gateway attachment. The private subnet should be in the same
Availability Zone as the public subnet.

- One transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway in AWS Transit Gateway](create-tgw.md).

- Three VPC attachments on the transit gateway. The CIDR blocks for each VPC propagate to the transit gateway
route table. For more information, see [Create a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpc-attachment.md).
For VPC C, you must create the attachment using the private subnet. If you
create the attachment using the public subnet, the instance traffic is routed to
the internet gateway, but the internet gateway drops the traffic because the
instances don't have public IP addresses. By placing the attachment in the
private subnet, the traffic is routed to the NAT gateway, and the NAT gateway
sends the traffic to the internet gateway using its Elastic IP address as the
source IP address.

#### Routing

There are route tables for each VPC and a route table for the transit gateway.

###### Route tables

- [VPC A](#transit-gateway-nat-igw-vpc-a-route-table)

- [VPC B](#transit-gateway-nat-igw-vpc-b-route-table)

- [VPC C](#transit-gateway-nat-igw-nat-vpc-c-route-tables)

- [Transit gateway](#transit-gateway-nat-igw-tgw-route-table)

##### Route table for VPC A

The following is an example route table. The first entry enables instances in the VPC to
communicate with each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet traffic
to the transit gateway.

DestinationTarget

`VPC A CIDR`

local

0.0.0.0/0

`transit-gateway-id`

##### Route table for VPC B

The following is an example route table. The first entry enables the instances in the VPC
to communicate with each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet
traffic to the transit gateway.

DestinationTarget

`VPC B CIDR`

local

0.0.0.0/0

`transit-gateway-id`

##### Route tables for VPC C

Configure the subnet with the NAT gateway as a public subnet by adding a route to the
internet gateway. Leave the other subnet as a private subnet.

The following is an example route table for the public subnet. The first entry enables
instances in the VPC to communicate with each other. The second and third entries route
traffic for VPC A and VPC B to the transit gateway. The remaining entry routes all other IPv4 subnet
traffic to the internet gateway.

DestinationTarget`VPC C CIDR`local`VPC A CIDR``transit-gateway-id``VPC B CIDR``transit-gateway-id`0.0.0.0/0`internet-gateway-id`

The following is an example route table for the private subnet.
The first entry enables instances in the VPC to communicate with each other.
The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet traffic to the NAT gateway.

##### Transit gateway route table

The following is an example of the transit gateway route table.
The CIDR blocks for each VPC propagate to the transit gateway route table.
The static route sends outbound internet traffic to VPC C.
You can optionally prevent inter-VPC communication by adding a blackhole route for each VPC CIDR.

You can configure an appliance (such as a security appliance) in a shared services VPC. All
traffic that's routed between transit gateway attachments is first inspected by the
appliance in the shared services VPC. When appliance mode is enabled, a transit gateway selects a
single network interface in the appliance VPC, using a flow hash algorithm, to send traffic
to for the life of the flow. The transit gateway uses the same network interface for the return
traffic. This ensures that bidirectional traffic is routed symmetrically—it's routed
through the same Availability Zone in the VPC attachment for the life of the flow. If you
have multiple transit gateways in your architecture, each transit gateway maintains its own session affinity,
and each transit gateway can select a different network interface.

You must connect exactly one transit gateway to the appliance VPC to guarantee flow stickiness.
Connecting multiple transit gateways to a single appliance VPC does not guarantee flow stickiness
because the transit gateways do not share flow state information with each other.

###### Important

- Traffic in appliance mode is routed correctly as long as the source and
destination traffic are coming to a centralized VPC (Inspection VPC) from the
same transit gateway attachment. Traffic can drop if the source and destination
are on two different transit gateway attachments. Traffic can drop if the
centralized VPC receives the traffic from a different gateway — for example, an
Internet gateway — and then sends that traffic to the transit gateway attachment
after inspection.

- Enabling appliance mode on an existing attachment might affect that
attachment's current route as the attachment can flow through any Availability
Zone. When appliance mode is not enabled, traffic is kept to the originating
Availability Zone.

#### Overview

The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario.
The transit gateway has three VPC attachments. VPC C is a shared services VPC. Traffic
between VPC A and VPC B is routed to the transit gateway, then routed to a security
appliance in VPC C for inspection before it's routed to the final destination. The
appliance is a stateful appliance, therefore both the request and response traffic is
inspected. For high availability, there is an appliance in each Availability Zone in VPC
C.

![An appliance in a shared services VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/tgw/images/transit-gateway-appliance.png)

You create the following resources for this scenario:

- Three VPCs. For more information, see [Create a VPC](../userguide/create-vpc.md)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- A transit gateway. For more information, see [Create a transit gateway in AWS Transit Gateway](create-tgw.md).

- Three VPC attachments - one for each of the VPCs. For more information, see
[Create a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpc-attachment.md).

For each VPC attachment, specify a subnet in each Availability Zone. For the
shared services VPC, these are the subnets where traffic is routed to the VPC
from the transit gateway. In the preceding example, these are subnets A and
C.

For the VPC attachment for VPC C, enable appliance mode support so that
response traffic is routed to the same Availability Zone in VPC C as the source
traffic.

The Amazon VPC console supports appliance mode. You can also use the Amazon VPC API, an
AWS SDK, the AWS CLI to enable appliance mode, or CloudFormation. For example, add
`--options ApplianceModeSupport=enable` to the [create-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment.md) or [modify-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment.md) command.

###### Note

Flow stickiness in appliance mode is guaranteed only for source and destination
traffic that originate towards the Inspection VPC.

#### Stateful appliances and appliance mode

If your VPC attachments span multiple Availability Zones and you require traffic
between source and destination hosts to be routed through the same appliance for stateful
inspection, enable appliance mode support for the VPC attachment in which the appliance
is located.

For more information, see [Centralized inspection architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/centralized-inspection-architecture-with-aws-gateway-load-balancer-and-aws-transit-gateway) in the AWS blog.

###### Behavior when appliance mode is not enabled

When appliance mode is not enabled, a transit gateway attempts to keep traffic routed between VPC
attachments in the originating Availability Zone until it reaches its destination.
Traffic crosses Availability Zones between attachments only if there is an Availability
Zone failure or if there are no subnets associated with a VPC attachment in that
Availability Zone.

The following diagram shows a traffic flow when appliance mode support is not
enabled. The response traffic that originates from Availability Zone 2 in VPC B is
routed by the transit gateway to the same Availability Zone in VPC C. The traffic is
therefore dropped, because the appliance in Availability Zone 2 is not aware of the
original request from the source in VPC A.

![Dropped response traffic to an appliance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/tgw/images/transit-gateway-appliance-dropped-traffic.png)

#### Routing

Each VPC has one or more route tables and the transit gateway has two route tables.

##### VPC route tables

**VPC A and VPC B**

VPCs A and B have route tables with 2 entries. The first entry is the default entry for
local IPv4 routing in the VPC. This default entry enables the resources in this VPC
to communicate with each other. The second entry routes all other IPv4 subnet
traffic to the transit gateway. The following is the route table for VPC A.

DestinationTarget

10.0.0.0/16

local

0.0.0.0/0

_tgw-id_

**VPC C**

The shared services VPC (VPC C) has different route tables for each subnet. Subnet
A is used by the transit gateway (you specify this subnet when you create the VPC
attachment). The route table for subnet A routes all traffic to the appliance in
subnet B.

DestinationTarget

192.168.0.0/16

local

0.0.0.0/0

_appliance-eni-id_

The route table for subnet B (which contains the appliance) routes the traffic
back to the transit gateway.

DestinationTarget

192.168.0.0/16

local

0.0.0.0/0

##### Transit gateway route tables

This transit gateway uses one route table for VPC A and VPC B, and one route table for the
shared services VPC (VPC C).

The VPC A and VPC B attachments are associated with the following route table. The
route table routes all traffic to VPC C.
