# Register sources with a multicast group in AWS Transit Gateway

###### Note

This procedure is only required when you have set the **Static sources**
**support** attribute to **enable**.

Use the following procedure to register sources with a multicast group. The source is the
network interface that sends multicast traffic.

You need the following information before you add a source:

- The ID of the multicast domain

- The IDs of the sources' network interfaces

- The multicast group IP address

###### To register sources using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Transit Gateway Multicast**.

3. Select the multicast domain, and then choose **Actions**,
    **Add group sources**.

4. For **Group IP address**, enter either the IPv4 CIDR block or IPv6
    CIDR block to assign to the multicast domain.

5. Under **Choose network interfaces**, select the multicast senders'
    network interfaces.

6. Choose **Add sources**.

###### To register sources using the AWS CLI

Use the [register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources.md) command.
