# Transit gateway attachments to a Direct Connect gateway in AWS Transit Gateway

Attach a transit gateway to a Direct Connect gateway using a transit virtual interface. This
configuration offers the following benefits. You can:

- Manage a single connection for multiple VPCs or VPNs that are in the same Region.

- Advertise prefixes from on-premises to AWS and from AWS to on-premises.

The following diagram illustrates how the Direct Connect gateway enables you to create a
single connection to your Direct Connect connection that all of your VPCs can use.

The solution involves the following components:

- A transit gateway.

- A Direct Connect gateway.

- An association between the Direct Connect gateway and the transit gateway.

- A transit virtual interface that is attached to the Direct Connect gateway.
