# Create a transit gateway in AWS Transit Gateway

When you create a transit gateway, we create a default transit gateway route table and use it as the
default association route table and the default propagation route table. If you
choose not to create the default transit gateway route table, you can create one later on. For
more information about routes and route tables, see [Routing](how-transit-gateways-work.md#tgw-routing-overview).

###### Note

If you want to enable Encryption support on a transit gateway, you can’t enable it
while creating the gateway. After you create the transit gateway, and it’s in the
available state, you can then modify it to enable Encryption support. For more
information, see [Encryption Support for AWS Transit Gateway](tgw-encryption-support.md).

###### To create a transit gateway using the console

01. Open the Amazon VPC console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

02. On the navigation pane, choose **Transit**
    **Gateways**.

03. Choose **Create transit gateway**.

04. For **Name tag**, optionally enter a name for the transit gateway.
     A name tag can make it easier to identify a specific gateway from the list
     of gateways. When you add a **Name tag**, a tag is created
     with a key of **Name** and with a value equal
     to the value you enter.

05. For **Description**, optionally enter a description for
     the transit gateway.

06. For **Amazon side Autonomous System Number (ASN)**, either leave the default value
     to use the default ASN or enter the private ASN
     for your transit gateway. This should be the ASN for the AWS side of a Border Gateway
     Protocol (BGP) session.

    The range is 64512 to 65534 for 16-bit ASNs.

    The range is 4200000000 to 4294967294 for 32-bit ASNs.

    If you have a multi-Region deployment, we recommend that you use a unique
     ASN for each of your transit gateways.

07. For **DNS support**, select this option if you need the VPC to
     resolve public IPv4 DNS host names to private IPv4 addresses when queried from
     instances in another VPC attached to the transit gateway.

08. For **Security Group Referencing support**, enable this feature
     to reference a security group across VPCs attached to a transit gateway. For more
     information about security group referencing see [Security group referencing](tgw-vpc-attachments.md#vpc-attachment-security).

09. For **VPN ECMP support**, select this option if you need Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP)
     routing support between VPN tunnels. If connections advertise the same
     CIDRs, the traffic is distributed equally between them.

    When you select this option, the advertised BGP ASN, then the BGP
     attributes such as the AS-path, must be the same.

    ###### Note

    To use ECMP, you must create a VPN connection that uses dynamic routing.
    VPN connections that use static routing do not support ECMP.

10. For **Default route table association**, select this option to automatically associate transit gateway attachments
     with the default route table for the transit gateway.

11. For **Default route table propagation**, select this option to automatically propagate transit gateway attachments
     to the default route table for the transit gateway.

12. (Optional) To use the transit gateway as a router for multicast traffic, select
     **Multicast support**.

13. (Optional) In the **Configure-cross-account sharing**
    **options** section, choose whether to **Auto accept**
    **shared attachments**. If enabled, attachments are automatically
     accepted. Otherwise, you must accept or reject attachment requests.

    For **Auto accept shared attachments**, select this option to automatically accept cross-account
     attachments.

14. (Optional) For **Transit gateway CIDR blocks**, specify
     one or more IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks for your transit gateway.

    You can specify a size /24 CIDR block or larger (for example, /23 or /22)
     for IPv4, or a size /64 CIDR block or larger (for example, /63 or /62) for
     IPv6. You can associate any public or private IP address range, except for
     addresses in the 169.254.0.0/16 range, and ranges that overlap with the
     addresses for your VPC attachments and on-premises networks.

    ###### Note

    Transit gateway CIDR blocks are used if you are configuring Connect
    (GRE) attachments or PrivateIP VPNs. Transit Gateway assigns IPs for the
    Tunnel endpoints (GRE/PrivateIP VPN) from this range.

15. Choose **Create transit gateway**.

###### To create a transit gateway using the AWS CLI

Use the [create-transit-gateway](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-transit-gateway.md) command.
