# Multicast domains in AWS Transit Gateway

A multicast domain allows segmentation of a multicast network into different domains. To
begin using multicast with a transit gateway, create a multicast domain, and then associate
subnets with the domain.

## Multicast domain attributes

The following table details the multicast domain attributes. You cannot enable both attributes
at the same time.

AttributeDescription`Igmpv2Support` (AWS CLI)

**IGMPv2 support** (console)

This attribute determines how group members join or leave a multicast group.

When this attribute is disabled, you must add the group members to the domain
manually.

Enable this attribute if at least one member uses the IGMP protocol. Members join
the multicast group in one of the following ways:

- Members that support IGMP use the `JOIN` and `LEAVE`
messages.

- Members that do not support IGMP must be added or removed from the group using
the Amazon VPC console or the AWS CLI.

If you register multicast group members, you must deregister them, too. The
transit gateway ignores an IGMP `LEAVE` message sent by a manually added group
member.

`StaticSourcesSupport` (AWS CLI)

**Static sources support** (console)

This attribute determines whether there are static multicast sources for the
group.

When this attribute is enabled, you must add sources for a multicast domain using
[register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-transit-gateway-multicast-group-sources.md). Only multicast sources
can send multicast traffic.

When this attribute is disabled, there are no designated multicast sources. Any
instances that are in subnets associated with the multicast domain can send multicast
traffic, and the group members receive the multicast traffic.
