# View AWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs records in Amazon CloudWatch

You can view your flow log records using the CloudWatch Logs console or Amazon S3 console,
depending on the chosen destination type. It might take a few minutes after you've
created your flow log for it to be visible in the console.

###### To view flow log records published to CloudWatch Logs

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, and select the
    log group that contains your flow log. A list of log streams for each transit gateway
    is displayed.

3. Select the log stream that contains the ID of the transit gateway that you want to
    view the flow log records for. For more information, see [Transit Gateway Flow Log records](tgw-flow-logs.md#flow-log-records).
