# Create a VPN Concentrator attachment in AWS Transit Gateway

**Prerequisites**

- You must have an existing transit gateway in your account.

###### To create a VPN Concentrator attachment using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Site-to-Site VPN Concentrators**.

3. Choose **Create Site-to-Site VPN Concentrator**.

4. (Optional) For **Name tag**, enter a name for your Site-to-Site VPN Concentrator.

5. For **Transit gateway**, select an existing transit gateway.

6. (Optional) To add additional tags, choose **Add new tag** and specify the key and value for each tag.

7. Choose **Create Site-to-Site VPN Concentrator**.

After you create the VPN Concentrator attachment, it appears in the list of attachments with a resource type of **VPN Concentrator** and an initial state of **Pending**. When the attachment is ready, the state changes to **Available**. You can then create Site-to-Site VPN connections on this Concentrator.

###### To create a VPN Concentrator attachment using the AWS CLI

Use the [create-vpn-concentrator](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpn-concentrator.md) command.

###### To create a VPN connection on a VPN Concentrator using the console

01. Open the Amazon VPC console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

02. On the navigation pane, choose **Site-to-Site VPN Connections**.

03. Choose **Create VPN connection**.

04. For **Target Gateway Type**, choose **Site-to-Site VPN Concentrator**.

05. For **Site-to-Site VPN Concentrator**, choose the VPN Concentrator where you want to create the VPN connection.

06. For **Customer Gateway**, do one of the following:
    - To use an existing customer gateway, choose **Existing**, and then select the gateway to use. Ensure that the customer gateway supports BGP routing.

    - To create a customer gateway, choose **New**. For **IP Address**, enter the static public IP address for your customer gateway device. For **BGP ASN**, enter the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) for your customer gateway.

      If your customer gateway is behind a network address translation (NAT) device that's enabled for NAT traversal (NAT-T), use the public IP address of your NAT device, and adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
07. For **Routing options**, **Dynamic (requires BGP)** is automatically selected. VPN Concentrator only supports dynamic routing with BGP.

08. For **Pre-shared key storage**, select either **Standard** or **Secrets Manager**.

09. For **Tunnel bandwidth**, **Standard** is automatically selected. VPN Concentrator only supports standard tunnel bandwidth.

10. For **Tunnel inside IP version**, select either **IPv4** or **IPv6**.

11. (Optional) Select **Enable acceleration** to improve performance of VPN tunnels.

12. (Optional) For **Local IPv4 network CIDR**, provide an IPv4 CIDR range.

13. (Optional) For **Remote IPv4 network CIDR**, provide an IPv4 CIDR range.

14. For **Outside IP Address Type**, you can select either **Public IPv4** or **IPv6** address.

15. (Optional) For **Tunnel Options**, you can configure tunnel settings such as inside tunnel IP addresses and pre-shared keys. For more information, see [Site-to-Site VPN architectures](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/site-site-architectures.md) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.

16. (Optional) To add additional tags, choose **Add new tag** and specify the key and value for each tag.

17. Choose **Create VPN connection**.

The VPN connection appears in the list of VPN connections with the VPN Concentrator ID in the **Transit Gateway ID** column and an initial state of **Pending**. When the VPN connection is ready, the state changes to **Available**.

###### To create a VPN connection on a VPN Concentrator using the AWS CLI

Use the [create-vpn-connection](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpn-connection.md) command and specify the VPN Concentrator ID using the `--vpn-concentrator-id` parameter.
