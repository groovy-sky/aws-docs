1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Transit Gateway Route**
**Tables**.

3. Select the transit gateway route table.

4. Choose the prefix list reference, and choose **Delete**
**references**.

5. Choose **Delete references**.

###### To modify a prefix list reference using the AWS CLI

Use the [delete-transit-gateway-prefix-list-reference](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/delete-transit-gateway-prefix-list-reference.md) command.
