# Modify a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway

###### To modify your VPC attachments using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Transit Gateway**
**Attachments**.

3. Select the VPC attachment, and then choose **Actions**,
    **Modify transit gateway attachment**.

4. Enable or disable any of the following:

- **DNS support**

- **IPv6 support**

- **Appliance mode support**

5. To add or remove a subnet from the attachment, choose or clear the checkbox by the
    **Subnet ID** you want to add or remove.

###### Note

Adding or modifying a VPC attachment subnet might impact data traffic while
the attachment is in a modifying state.

6. To be able to reference a security group across VPCs attached to a transit
    gateway, select **Security Group Referencing support**. For more
    information about security group referencing, see [Security group referencing](tgw-vpc-attachments.md#vpc-attachment-security).

###### Note

If you disable security group referencing for an existing transit gateway, it
will be disabled on all VPC attachments.

7. Choose **Modify transit gateway attachment**.

###### To modify your VPC attachments using the AWS CLI

Use the [modify-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-transit-gateway-vpc-attachment.md) command.
