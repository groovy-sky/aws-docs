# Troubleshoot AWS Transit Gateway VPC attachment creation

The following topic can help you troubleshoot problems that you might have when you create
a VPC attachment.

###### Problem

The VPC attachment failed.

###### Cause

The cause might be one of the following:

1. The user that is creating the VPC attachment does not have correct permissions to
    create service-linked role.

2. There is a throttling issue because of too many IAM requests, for example you are using
    CloudFormation to create permissions and roles.

3. The account has the service-linked role, and the service-linked role has been
    modified.

4. The transit gateway is not in the `available` state.

###### Solution

Depending on the cause, try the following:

1. Verify that the user has the correct permissions to create service-linked roles.
    For more information, see [Service-linked role permissions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-service-linked-role.md#service-linked-role-permissions) in the _IAM User Guide_.
    After the user has the permissions, create the VPC attachment.

2. Create the VPC attachment manually. For more information, see
    [Create a VPC attachment in AWS Transit Gateway](create-vpc-attachment.md).

3. Verify that the service-linked role has the correct permissions. For more information, see
    [Transit gateway service-linked role](service-linked-roles.md#tgw-service-linked-roles).

4. Verify that the transit gateway is in the `available` state. For more
    information, see [View transit gateway information in AWS Transit Gateway](view-tgws.md).
