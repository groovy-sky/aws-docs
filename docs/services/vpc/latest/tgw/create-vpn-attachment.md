# Create a transit gateway attachment to a VPN in AWS Transit Gateway

###### To create a VPN attachment using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Transit Gateway**
**Attachments**.

3. Choose **Create transit gateway attachment**.

4. For **Transit gateway ID**, choose the transit gateway for the attachment. You
    can choose a transit gateway that you own.

5. For **Attachment type**, choose **VPN**.

6. For **Customer Gateway**, do one of the following:
   - To use an existing customer gateway, choose **Existing**, and
      then select the gateway to use.

     If your customer gateway is behind a network address translation (NAT) device
      that's enabled for NAT traversal (NAT-T), use the public IP address of your NAT
      device, and adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.

   - To create a customer gateway, choose **New**, then for
      **IP Address**, type a static public IP address and
      **BGP ASN**.

     For **Routing options**, choose whether to use
      **Dynamic** or **Static**. For
      more information, see [Site-to-Site VPN Routing Options](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpnroutingtypes.md) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.
7. For **Tunnel Options**, enter the CIDR ranges and pre-shared keys
    for your tunnel. For more information, see [Site-to-Site VPN architectures](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/site-site-architectures.md).

8. Choose **Create transit gateway attachment**.

###### To create a VPN attachment using the AWS CLI

Use the [create-vpn-connection](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpn-connection.md) command.
