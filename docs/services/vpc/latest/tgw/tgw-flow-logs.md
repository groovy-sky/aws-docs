# AWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs

Transit Gateway Flow Logs is a feature of AWS Transit Gateway that enables you to capture
information about the IP traffic going to and from your transit gateways. Flow log data can be
published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Firehose. After you create a flow log, you can retrieve and
view its data in the chosen destination. Flow log data is collected outside of the path of
your network traffic, and therefore does not affect network throughput or latency. You can
create or delete flow logs without any risk of impact to network performance. Transit
Gateway Flow Logs capture information related only to transit gateways, described in [Transit Gateway Flow Log records](#flow-log-records). If you want to capture information about IP traffic going
to and from network interfaces in your VPCs, use VPC Flow Logs. See [Logging IP traffic using\
VPC Flow Logs](../userguide/flow-logs.md) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_ for more
information.

###### Note

To create a transit gateway flow log, you must be the owner of the transit gateway. If you are not the
owner, the transit gateway owner must give you permission.

Flow log data for a monitored transit gateway is recorded as _flow log records_,
which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more
information, see [Transit Gateway Flow Log records](#flow-log-records).

To create a flow log, you specify:

- The resource for which to create the flow log

- The destinations to which you want to publish the flow log data

After you create a flow log, it can take several minutes to begin collecting and
publishing data to the chosen destinations. Flow logs do not capture real-time log streams
for your transit gateways.

You can apply tags to your flow logs. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value,
both of which you define. Tags can help you organize your flow logs, for example by purpose
or owner.

If you no longer require a flow log, you can delete it. Deleting a flow log disables the
flow log service for the resource, and no new flow log records are created or published to
CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. Deleting the flow log does not delete any existing flow log records or log
streams (for CloudWatch Logs) or log file objects (for Amazon S3) for a transit gateway. To delete an existing log
stream, use the CloudWatch Logs console. To delete existing log file objects, use the Amazon S3 console.
After you've deleted a flow log, it can take several minutes to stop collecting data. For
more information, see [Delete an AWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs record](delete-flow-log.md).

You can create flow logs for your transit gateways that can publish data to CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Data Firehose. For more information, see the following:

- [Create a Flow Log that publishes\
to CloudWatch Logs](flow-logs-cwl-create-flow-log.md)

- [Create a Flow Log that publishes\
to Amazon S3](flowlog-s3-create.md)

- [Create a Flow Log that\
publishes to Firehose](flow-logs-kinesis-create.md)

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to Transit Gateway Flow Logs:

- Multicast traffic is not supported.

- Connect attachments are not supported. All Connect flow logs appear under the
transport attachment and must therefore be enabled on the transit gateway or the Connect
transport attachment.

- Transit Gateway Flow Logs supports a maximum of 250 subscriptions per resource per account.
To create additional subscriptions on a resource that has reached this limit, you must first delete existing subscriptions.

## Transit Gateway Flow Log records

A flow log record represents a network flow in your transit gateway. Each record is a string
with fields separated by spaces. A record includes values for the different components
of the traffic flow, for example, the source, destination, and protocol.

When you create a flow log, you can use the default format for the flow log record, or
you can specify a custom format.

###### Contents

- [Default format](#flow-logs-default)

- [Custom format](#flow-logs-custom)

- [Available fields](#flow-logs-fields)

### Default format

With the default format, the flow log records includes all version 2 to version 6
fields, in the order shown in the [available\
fields](#flow-logs-fields) table. You cannot customize or change the default format. To
capture additional fields or a different subset of fields, specify a custom format
instead.

### Custom format

With a custom format, you specify which fields are included in the flow log
records and in which order. This enables you to create flow logs that are specific
to your needs, and to omit fields that are not relevant. Using a custom format can
reduce the need for separate processes to extract specific information from the
published flow logs. You can specify any number of the available flow log fields,
but you must specify at least one.

### Available fields

The following table describes all of the available fields for a transit gateway flow log
record. The **Version** column indicates which version
the field was introduced in.

When publishing flow log data to Amazon S3, the data type for the fields depends on the
flow log format. If the format is plain text, all fields are of type
STRING. If the format is Parquet, see the table for the field
data types.

If a field is not applicable or could not be computed for a specific record, the
record displays a '-' symbol for that entry. Metadata fields that do not come
directly from the packet header are best effort approximations, and their values
might be missing or inaccurate.

## Control the use of flow logs

By default, users do not have permission to work with flow logs. You can create a
user policy that grants users the permissions to create, describe, and delete flow
logs. For more information, see [Granting IAM Users Required Permissions for Amazon EC2 Resources](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/ec2-api-permissions.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 API Reference_.

The following is an example policy that grants users full permissions to create,
describe, and delete flow logs.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DeleteFlowLogs",
        "ec2:CreateFlowLogs",
        "ec2:DescribeFlowLogs"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

Some additional IAM role and permission configuration is required, depending on
whether you're publishing to CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. For more information, see [AWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs records in Amazon CloudWatch Logs](flow-logs-cwl.md) and [AWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs records in Amazon S3](flow-logs-s3.md).

## Transit Gateway Flow Logs pricing

Data ingestion and storage charges for vended logs apply when you publish transit gateway flow
logs. For more information about pricing when publishing vended logs, open [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing),
and then under **Paid tier**, select **Logs** and find
**Vended Logs**.
