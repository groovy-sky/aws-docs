# Update AWS Transit Gateway security group inbound rules

You can update any of the inbound security group rules associated with a transit gateway. You can update security group rules using either the Amazon VPC Console console or by using the command-line or API. For more
information about security group referencing, see [Security group referencing](tgw-vpc-attachments.md#vpc-attachment-security).

###### To update your security group rules using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Security groups**.

3. Select the security group, and choose **Actions**,
    **Edit inbound rules** to modify the inbound rules.

4. To add a rule, choose **Add rule** and specify the type,
    protocol, and port range. For **Source** (inbound rule),
    enter the ID of the security group in the VPC connected to the transit
    gateway.

###### Note

Security groups in a VPC connected to the transit gateway are not automatically displayed.

5. To edit an existing rule, change its values (for example, the source or the description).

6. To delete a rule, choose **Delete** next to the rule.

7. Choose **Save rules**.
