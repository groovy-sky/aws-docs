StepNotes[Step 1: Associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets](#vpc-migrate-ipv6-cidr)Associate an Amazon-provided or BYOIP IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC
and with your subnets.[Step 2: Update your route tables](#vpc-migrate-ipv6-routes)Update your route tables to route your IPv6 traffic. For a public
subnet, create a route that routes all IPv6 traffic from the subnet to the
internet gateway. For a private subnet, create a route that routes all
internet-bound IPv6 traffic from the subnet to an egress-only internet
gateway.[Step 3: Update your security group rules](#vpc-migrate-ipv6-sg-rules)Update your security group rules to include rules for IPv6 addresses.
This enables IPv6 traffic to flow to and from your instances. If you've
created custom network ACL rules to control the flow of traffic to and
from your subnet, you must include rules for IPv6 traffic.[Step 4: Assign IPv6 addresses to your instances](#vpc-migrate-assign-ipv6-address)Assign IPv6 addresses to your instances from the IPv6 address range
of your subnet.

## Step 1: Associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets

You can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, and then associate a
`/64` CIDR block from that range with each subnet.

###### To associate an IPv6 CIDR block with a VPC

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**.

3. Select your VPC.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Edit CIDRs** and then choose
    **Add new IPv6 CIDR**.

5. Select one of the following options, and then choose **Select CIDR**:

- **Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block** – Use an IPv6
CIDR block from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses. For **Network**
**Border Group**, choose the group from which AWS advertises
IP addresses.

- **IPAM-allocated IPv6 CIDR block** – Use an IPv6
CIDR block from an [IPAM pool](../ipam/how-it-works-ipam.md). Choose the IPAM pool and the IPv6 CIDR block.

- **IPv6 CIDR owned by me** – Use an IPv6 CIDR block
from your IPv6 address pool ( [BYOIP](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-byoip.md)). Choose the IPv6 address pool and the IPv6 CIDR block.

6. Choose **Close**.

###### To associate an IPv6 CIDR block with a subnet

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

3. Select a subnet.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Edit IPv6 CIDRs** and
    then choose **Add IPv6 CIDR**.

5. Edit the CIDR block as needed (for example, replace the `00`).

6. Choose **Save**.

7. Repeat this procedure for any other subnets in your VPC.

For more information, see [IPv6 VPC CIDR blocks](vpc-cidr-blocks.md#vpc-sizing-ipv6).

## Step 2: Update your route tables

When you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, we automatically add a local route
to each route table for the VPC to allow IPv6 traffic within the VPC.

You must update the route tables for your public subnets to enable instances (such
as web servers) to use the internet gateway for IPv6 traffic. You must also update the
route tables for your private subnets to enable instances (such as database instances)
to use an egress-only internet gateway for IPv6 traffic, because NAT gateways do not
support IPv6.

###### To update the route table for a public subnet

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**. Select the public subnet. On the
    **Route table** tab, choose the route table ID to open the
    details page for the route table.

3. Select the route table. On the **Routes** tab, choose
    **Edit routes**.

4. Choose **Add route**. Choose `::/0` for
    **Destination**. Choose the ID of the internet gateway for
    **Target**.

5. Choose **Save changes**.

###### To update the route table for a private subnet

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Egress-only internet gateways**.
    Choose **Create egress only internet gateway**. Choose your VPC
    from **VPC**, and then choose **Create egress only internet**
**gateway**.

For more information, see [Enable outbound IPv6 traffic using an egress-only internet gateway](egress-only-internet-gateway.md).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**. Select the private subnet.
    On the **Route table** tab, choose the route table ID to open the details
    page for the route table.

4. Select the route table. On the **Routes** tab, choose
    **Edit routes**.

5. Choose **Add route**. Choose `::/0` for
    **Destination**. Choose the ID of the egress-only internet gateway
    for **Target**.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

###### Note

A route table cannot have the same destination (::/0) pointing to both an internet gateway and an egress-only internet gateway simultaneously. If you receive an error message stating "There are existing ipv6 routes with next hop as internet Gateway" when configuring an egress-only internet gateway, you must first remove the existing IPv6 route to the internet gateway before adding the route to the egress-only internet gateway.

For more information, see [Example routing options](route-table-options.md).

## Step 3: Update your security group rules

To enable your instances to send and receive traffic over IPv6, you must update your
security group rules to include rules for IPv6 addresses. For example, in the example above,
you can update the web server security group ( `sg-11aa22bb11aa22bb1`) to add
rules that allow inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access from IPv6 addresses. You don't need
to make any changes to the inbound rules for your database security group; the rule that
allows all communication from `sg-11aa22bb11aa22bb1` includes IPv6 communication.

###### To update your inbound security group rules

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Security groups** and select your web server
    security group.

3. In the **Inbound rules** tab, choose **Edit**
**inbound rules**.

4. For each rule that allows IPv4 traffic, choose **Add**
**rule** and configure the rule to allow the corresponding IPv6
    traffic. For example, to add a rule that allows all HTTP traffic over
    IPv6, choose **HTTP** for **Type**
    and `::/0` for **Source**.

5. When you are finished adding rules, choose **Save rules**.

###### Update your outbound security group rules

When you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, we automatically add an outbound
rule to the security groups for the VPC that allows all IPv6 traffic. However, if
you modified the original outbound rules for your security group, this rule is not
automatically added, and you must add equivalent outbound rules for IPv6 traffic.

###### Update your network ACL rules

When you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with a VPC, we automatically add rules
to the default network ACL to allow IPv6 traffic. However, if you modified your
default network ACL or if you've created a custom network ACL, you must manually
add rules for IPv6 traffic. For more information, see
[Add and delete rules](create-network-acl.md#Rules).

## Step 4: Assign IPv6 addresses to your instances

All current generation instance types support IPv6. If your instance type does not support
IPv6, you must resize the instance to a supported instance type before you can assign an IPv6
address. The process that you'll use depends on whether the new instance type that you choose
is compatible with the current instance type. For more information, see [Change the instance type](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-instance-resize.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_. If you must launch an instance from a new AMI to
support IPv6, you can assign an IPv6 address to your instance during launch.

After you've verified that your instance type supports IPv6, you can assign an
IPv6 address to your instance using the Amazon EC2 console. The IPv6 address is assigned
to the primary network interface (for example, eth0) for the instance. For more information, see
[Assign an\
IPv6 address to an instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-instance-addressing.md#assign-ipv6-address) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

You can connect to an instance using its IPv6 address. For more information, see
[Connect to your Linux instance using an SSH client](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/connect-linux-inst-ssh.md#connect-linux-inst-sshClient) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

If you launched your instance using an AMI for a current version of your operating
system, your instance is configured for IPv6. If you can't ping an IPv6 address from
your instance, refer to the documentation for your operating system to configure IPv6.
