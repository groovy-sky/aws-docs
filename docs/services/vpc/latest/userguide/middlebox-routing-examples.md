# Middlebox scenarios

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides a wide range of networking capabilities that allow you to customize and control the routing of traffic within your virtual network. One such feature is the middlebox routing wizard, which enables fine-grained control over the routing path of traffic entering or leaving your VPC.

If you need to redirect traffic to a security appliance, load balancer, or other network device for inspection, monitoring, or optimization purposes, the middlebox routing wizard can simplify the process. This wizard automatically creates the necessary route tables and routes (hops) to redirect the specified traffic as needed, eliminating the manual effort required to set up complex routing configurations.

The middlebox routing wizard supports several different scenarios. For example, you can use it to inspect traffic destined for a particular subnet, configure middlebox traffic routing and inspection across your entire VPC, or selectively inspect traffic between specific subnets. This granular control over traffic routing allows you to implement advanced security policies, enable centralized network monitoring, or optimize the performance of your cloud-based applications.

The following examples describe scenarios for the middlebox routing wizard.
