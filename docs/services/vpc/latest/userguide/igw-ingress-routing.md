# Route internet traffic to a single network interface

You can route inbound internet traffic destined for large pools of public IP addresses to a single elastic network interface (ENI) in your VPC.

Previously, internet gateways only accepted traffic destined for public IP addresses that were directly associated with network interfaces in the VPC. Instance types have limits on the number of IP addresses that can be associated with network interfaces, creating challenges for industries like Telecommunications and Internet of Things (IoT) that need to handle traffic for IP pools larger than these limits.

This routing eliminates complex address translation on inbound internet connections. You can bring your own public IP pools (BYOIP) and configure your VPC internet gateway to accept and route traffic for the entire pool to a single network interface. This feature is particularly valuable for:

- **Telecommunications**: Managing large subscriber IP pools without address translation overhead

- **IoT applications**: Consolidating traffic from thousands of device IP addresses

- **Any scenario**: Requiring traffic routing beyond ENI association limits

You can integrate this routing with VPC Route Server for dynamic route updates during failover scenarios.

###### Key benefits

This routing approach provides the following benefits:

- **No address translation required** \- Direct routing
eliminates NAT complexity

- **Bypass ENI limits** \- Handle IP pools larger than
instance association limits

- **Industry-optimized** \- Purpose-built for Telco and IoT
requirements

- **Dynamic failover** \- Integrates with Route Server for
automatic updates

###### Availability

You can use this feature in all AWS commercial regions, AWS China regions, and AWS
GovCloud regions.

## Before you begin

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

1. **A BYOIP pool**: You must have already brought your own IP address range to AWS. Complete the steps in [Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in Amazon EC2](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-byoip.md).

2. **Verify your BYOIP pool**: Confirm your pool is ready by running:

```bash

aws ec2 describe-public-ipv4-pools --region us-east-1
```

Look for your pool in the output and ensure the `PoolAddressRanges` shows `Available` addresses.

3. **Appropriate permissions**: Ensure your AWS account has permissions to create VPC resources, EC2 instances, and manage BYOIP pools.

## How this feature works

This section explains the technical concepts behind internet gateway ingress routing and how traffic flows from the internet to your target instance.

### Why use internet gateway ingress routing

Previously, you needed to perform address translation to consolidate traffic for large numbers of IP addresses due to ENI association limits. This enhancement removes that complexity by allowing direct routing of BYOIP pools to target instances.

### How the routing works

This feature only works with the public IP CIDRs that you bring to AWS following the BYOIP process. The BYOIP process ensures that your account owns the public IP CIDR. Once you have the BYOIP public CIDR:

1. You associate this public IP address pool with an internet gateway route table. The internet gateway must already be associated with a VPC. This association allows the VPC to accept traffic destined for the IP CIDR. Ensure that the internet gateway has a dedicated route table that is not shared with any subnets.

2. Now that you have associated the BYOIP pool with the internet gateway route table, you can enter a route with a destination equal to the IP CIDR or a subset of it in the internet gateway route table. The target of this route would be the ENI where you want to route your traffic.

3. When your traffic destined for your BYOIP CIDR enters AWS, AWS looks at the internet gateway route table and accordingly routes traffic to the relevant VPC.

4. Inside the VPC, the internet gateway routes the traffic to the target ENI.

5. The target (an elastic network interface associated with your workload) processes the traffic.

**Best practices**

- **Keep route tables separate**: The internet gateway route table must be dedicated only to the internet gateway. Do not associate this route table with any VPC subnets. Use separate route tables for subnet routing.

- **Don't directly assign BYOIP IPs**: Do not associate public IP addresses from your BYOIP pool directly to EC2 instances or network interfaces. The internet gateway ingress routing feature routes traffic to instances without requiring direct IP association.

###### Important

If you are using [VPC Block Public Access (BPA)](security-vpc-bpa.md), when BPA is enabled, it will block traffic to
subnets using ingress routing, even if you've set a subnet-level BPA exclusion. Subnet-level
exclusions do not work for ingress routing. To allow ingress routing traffic with BPA
enabled:

- Disable BPA completely, or

- Use a VPC-level exclusion

## Step 1: Create a VPC

    --network-interface-id eni-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --region us-east-1
```

## Step 11: Configure the target instance

Complete this step to configure your target instance to properly handle traffic destined for BYOIP addresses.

**Important**: Complete this instance configuration step before testing connectivity (Step 12). The instance must be configured to respond to BYOIP addresses for the ingress routing to work properly.

**AWS console**

1. Connect to your target instance using EC2 Instance Connect:

- In the EC2 console, select your instance.

- Choose **Actions** \> **Connect**.

- Select **EC2 Instance Connect** tab.

- Choose **Connect**.

2. Add specific BYOIP IP address to your instance interface:

First, find your network interface name:

```bash

ip link show
```

Then add the IP address (replace `203.0.113.10` with an IP from your BYOIP range):

```bash

sudo ip addr add 203.0.113.10/32 dev eth0
```

**Note**: Replace `203.0.113.10` with any IP address from your BYOIP range that you want to test. The interface name may be `eth0`, `ens5`, or similar depending on your instance type.

3. In the EC2 console, disable source/destination check:

- Select your instance.

- Go to **Networking** tab, click on the network interface.

- Choose **Actions**, **Change source/dest check**, **Disable**.

**AWS CLI**

```bash

aws ec2 modify-network-interface-attribute \
    --network-interface-id eni-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --no-source-dest-check \
    --region us-east-1
```

## Step 12: Configure instance for traffic handling

Complete this step to add BYOIP addresses to your instance and disable source/destination checking to enable proper traffic handling.

**AWS console**

1. Connect to your target instance using EC2 Instance Connect:

- In the EC2 console, select your instance.

- Choose **Actions** \> **Connect**.

- Select **EC2 Instance Connect** tab.

- Choose **Connect**.

2. Add specific BYOIP IP address to your instance interface:

First, find your network interface name:

```bash

ip link show
```

Then add the IP address (replace `ens5` with your actual interface name):

```bash

sudo ip addr add 203.0.113.10/32 dev ens5
```

**Note**: Replace `203.0.113.10` with any IP address from your BYOIP range that you want to test. The interface name may be `eth0`, `ens5`, or similar depending on your instance type.

3. In the EC2 console, disable source/destination check:

- Select your instance.

- Go to **Networking** tab, click on the network interface.

- Choose **Actions**, **Change source/dest check**, **Disable**.

**AWS CLI**

```bash

aws ec2 modify-network-interface-attribute \
    --network-interface-id eni-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --no-source-dest-check \
    --region us-east-1
```

## Step 13: Test connectivity

Complete this step to verify that internet traffic is properly routed to your target instance through the BYOIP addresses.

1. On your target instance, monitor incoming traffic using tcpdump:

```bash

sudo tcpdump -i any icmp
```

2. From another terminal or computer, test connectivity to your BYOIP IP
    address:

```bash

ping 203.0.113.10
```

3. Expected results:

- Ping should succeed and show responses from your BYOIP IP address.

- tcpdump should show incoming packets for the BYOIP address, similar to:

```nohighlight

12:34:56.789012 IP 203.0.113.100 > 203.0.113.10: ICMP echo request, id 1234, seq 1, length 64
12:34:56.789123 IP 203.0.113.10 > 203.0.113.100: ICMP echo reply, id 1234, seq 1, length 64
```

- Traffic should appear to come from external IP addresses, proving the internet gateway ingress routing is delivering internet traffic to your instance.

## Troubleshooting

Use this section to resolve common issues you might encounter when setting up internet gateway ingress routing.

**Traffic not reaching the instance**

- Verify the route table has the correct ENI ID as the target.

- Confirm the BYOIP pool is associated with the internet gateway route table.

- Check that source/destination check is disabled on the instance.

- Ensure security groups allow the traffic type you're testing.

**Route creation fails**

- Verify the BYOIP pool is properly associated with the route table.

- Confirm the destination CIDR is within your BYOIP range.

- Check that the target ENI exists and is attached to a running instance.

- Ensure your BYOIP prefix is between /23 and /28 (prefixes outside this range are not supported).

**Ping/connectivity fails**

- Verify the IP addresses are added to the instance interface.

- Check security groups allow ICMP (for ping) or relevant ports.

- Confirm the instance is in a running state.

- Test from multiple external locations.

## Advanced option: Route server integration for dynamic routing

For environments requiring automatic failover, this feature integrates with VPC Route
Server to:

- **Dynamically update routes** during instance failures.

- **Eliminate manual intervention** for route management.

- **Provide enterprise-grade availability** for critical workloads.

This is particularly important for Telco and IoT use cases where high availability is essential.

###### Note

When using Route Server with multiple BGP peers, be aware that a maximum of 32 BGP peers can advertise the same prefix to the same route table using route server.

For environments requiring dynamic routing, automatic failover, and load distribution
across multiple instances, consider integrating with AWS Route Server. Route Server enables
BGP-based dynamic routing instead of static routes, providing:

- **Dynamic route advertisement** from instances through BGP.

- **Automatic failover** between multiple target instances.

- **Load distribution** across multiple endpoints.

- **Centralized route management** through BGP protocols.

This is an important use case for enterprise deployments where high availability and dynamic routing capabilities are required. For detailed Route Server setup instructions, see the [AWS Route Server documentation](dynamic-routing-route-server.md).
