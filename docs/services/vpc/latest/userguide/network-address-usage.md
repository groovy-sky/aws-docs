# Network Address Usage for your VPC

Network Address Usage (NAU) is a metric applied to resources in your virtual network
to help you plan for and monitor the size of your VPC. Each NAU unit contributes to a
total that represents the size of your VPC.

It's important to understand the total number of units that make up the NAU of
your VPC because the following VPC quotas limit the size of a VPC:

- [Network Address Usage](amazon-vpc-limits.md#vpc-size-limits) –
The maximum number of NAU units that a single VPC can have. Each VPC can have
up to 64,000 NAU units by default. You can request a quota increase up to
256,000.

- [Peered Network Address Usage](amazon-vpc-limits.md#vpc-size-limits) –
The maximum number of NAU units for a VPC and all of its peered VPCs. If a
VPC is peered with other VPCs in the same Region, the VPCs combined can have
up to 128,000 NAU units by default. You can request a quota increase up to
512,000. VPCs that are peered across different Regions do not contribute to
this limit.

You can use the NAU in the following ways:

- Before you create your virtual network, calculate the NAU units to help
you decide if you should spread workloads across multiple VPCs.

- After you’ve created your VPC, use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the NAU usage of
the VPC so that it doesn't grow beyond the NAU quota limits. For more information,
see [CloudWatch metrics for your VPCs](vpc-cloudwatch.md).

## How NAU is calculated

If you understand how NAU is calculated, it can help you plan for the scaling
of your VPCs.

The following table explains which resources make up the NAU count in a VPC and
how many NAU units each resource uses. Some AWS resources are represented as
single NAU units and some resources are represented as multiple NAU units. You
can use the table to learn how NAU is calculated.

## NAU examples

The following examples show how to calculate NAU.

###### Example 1 - Two VPCs connected using VPC peering

Peered VPCs in the same Region contribute to a combined NAU quota.

- VPC 1

- 50 Network Load Balancers in 2 subnets in separate Availability Zones - 600 NAU units

- 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address) in one
subnet and 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address)
in another subnet - 20,000 units

- 100 Lambda functions - 600 NAU units

- VPC 2

- 50 Network Load Balancers in 2 subnets in separate Availability Zones - 600 NAU units

- 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address) in one
subnet and 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address)
in another subnet - 20,000 units

- 100 Lambda functions - 600 NAU units

- Total peering NAU count: 42,400 units

- Default peering NAU quota: 128,000 units

###### Example 2 - Two VPCs connected using a transit gateway

VPCs that are connected using a transit gateway do not contribute to a combined NAU quota
as they do for peered VPCs.

- VPC 1

- 50 Network Load Balancers in 2 subnets in separate Availability Zones - 600 NAU units

- 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address) in one
subnet and 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address)
in another subnet - 20,000 units

- 100 Lambda functions - 600 NAU units

- VPC 2

- 50 Network Load Balancers in 2 subnets in separate Availability Zones - 600 NAU units

- 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address) in one
subnet and 5,000 instances (each with an IPv4 address and IPv6 address)
in another subnet - 20,000 units

- 100 Lambda functions - 600 NAU units

- Total NAU count per VPC: 21,200 units

- Default NAU quota per VPC: 64,000 units
