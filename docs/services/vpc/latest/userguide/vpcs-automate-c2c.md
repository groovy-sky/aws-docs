# Generate infrastructure-as-code from your VPC console actions with Console-to-Code

The console provides a guided path for creating resources and testing prototypes. If you
want to create the same resources at scale, you’ll need automation code. Console-to-Code is a feature
of Amazon Q Developer that can help you get started with your automation code. Console-to-Code records your
console actions, including default values and compatible parameters. It then uses generative
AI to suggest code in your preferred infrastructure-as-code (IaC) format for the actions you
want. Because the console workflow makes sure the parameter values that you specify are
valid together, the code that you generate by using Console-to-Code has compatible parameter
values. You can use the code as a starting point, and then customize it to make it
production-ready for your specific use case.

For example, with Console-to-Code you can record yourself using the VPC console to create subnets,
security groups, NACLs, a custom routing table, and an internet gateway and generate code in
CloudFormation JSON format. Then, you can copy that code and customize it for use in your CloudFormation
template.

Console-to-Code can currently generate infrastructure-as-code (IaC) in the following languages and formats:

- CDK Java

- CDK Python

- CDK TypeScript

- CloudFormation JSON

- CloudFormation YAML
