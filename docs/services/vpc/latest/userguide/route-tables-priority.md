# How route priority works

In general, we direct traffic using the most specific route that matches the traffic.
This is known as the longest prefix match. If your route table has overlapping or
matching routes, additional rules apply.

The following list shows a route priority summary with links to sections below with more detailed information and examples:

1. [Longest prefix](#route-table-longest-prefix-match) (for example, 10.10.2.15/32 has priority over 10.10.2.0/24)

2. [Static routes](#route-table-priority-propagated-routes) (like VPC peering and internet gateway connections)

3. [Prefix list routes](#route-priority-managed-prefix-list)

4. [Propagated routes](#route-table-priority-propagated-routes)

1. Direct Connect BGP routes (dynamic routes)

2. VPN static routes

3. VPN BGP routes (dynamic routes) (like virtual private gateways)

## Longest prefix match

Routes to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses or CIDR blocks are independent of each other. We use
the most specific route that matches either IPv4 traffic or IPv6 traffic to determine
how to route the traffic.

The following example subnet route table has a route for IPv4 internet traffic
( `0.0.0.0/0`) that points to an internet gateway, and a route for
`172.31.0.0/16` IPv4 traffic that points to a peering connection
( `pcx-11223344556677889`). Any traffic from the subnet that's
destined for the `172.31.0.0/16` IP address range uses the peering
connection, because this route is more specific than the route for internet gateway.
Any traffic destined for a target within the VPC ( `10.0.0.0/16`) is
covered by the `local` route, and therefore is routed within the VPC. All
other traffic from the subnet uses the internet gateway.

## Route priority for static and dynamically propagated routes

If you've attached a virtual private gateway to your VPC and enabled route
propagation on your subnet route table, routes representing your Site-to-Site VPN connection
automatically appear as propagated routes in your route table.

If the destination of a propagated route is identical to the destination of a static
route, the static route takes priority. The following resources use static routes:

- internet gateway

- NAT gateway

- Network interface

- Instance ID

- Gateway VPC endpoint

- Transit gateway

- VPC peering connection

- Gateway Load Balancer endpoint

For more information, see [Route tables and VPN route priority](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpnroutingtypes.md#vpn-route-priority) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.

The following example route table has a static route to an internet gateway and a
propagated route to a virtual private gateway. Both routes have a destination of
`172.31.0.0/24`. Because a static route to an internet gateway takes
priority, all traffic destined for `172.31.0.0/24` is routed to the
internet gateway.

## Route priority for prefix lists

If your route table references a prefix list, the following rules apply:

- If your route table contains a propagated route that matches a route that
references a prefix list, the route that references the prefix list takes
priority. Please note that for routes that overlap, more specific routes
always take priority irrespective of whether they are propagated routes,
static routes, or routes that reference prefix lists.

- If your route table references multiple prefix lists that have overlapping
CIDR blocks to different targets, we randomly choose which route takes
priority. Thereafter, the same route always takes priority.
