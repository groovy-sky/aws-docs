# Create a flow log that publishes to Amazon Data Firehose

You can create flow logs for your VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces.

###### Prerequisites

- Create the destination Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream. Use **Direct Put**
as the source. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream](../../../firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.md).

- The account creating the flow log must be using an IAM role that grants the following permissions to publish flow logs to Amazon Data Firehose.

JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "logs:CreateLogDelivery",
                  "logs:DeleteLogDelivery",
                  "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
                  "firehose:TagDeliveryStream"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
}

```

- If you're publishing flow logs to a different account, create the required IAM roles,
as described in [IAM roles for cross account delivery](firehose-cross-account-delivery.md).

###### To create a flow log that publishes to Amazon Data Firehose

01. Do one of the following:
    - Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).
       In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**.
       Select the checkbox for the network interface.

    - Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).
       In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**.
       Select the checkbox for the VPC.

    - Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).
       In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.
       Select the checkbox for the subnet.
02. Choose **Actions**, **Create flow log**.

03. For **Filter**, specify the type of traffic to log.

- **Accept** – Log only accepted traffic

- **Reject** – Log only rejected traffic

- **All** – Log accepted and rejected traffic

04. For **Maximum aggregation interval**, choose the maximum
     period of time during which a flow is captured and aggregated into one flow
     log record.

05. For **Destination**, choose either of the following options:

- **Send to Amazon Data Firehose in the same account** –
The delivery stream and the resource to monitor are in the same
account.

- **Send to Amazon Data Firehose in a different account**
– The delivery stream and the resource to monitor are in
different accounts.

06. For **Amazon Data Firehose** stream name, choose the
     delivery stream that you created.

07. \[Cross account delivery only\] For **Service access**,
     choose an existing [IAM service role for cross account delivery](firehose-cross-account-delivery.md) that has permissions to publish logs or choose **Set up permissions** to open the IAM console and create a service role.

08. For **Log record format**, specify the format for the
     flow log record.

- To use the default flow log record format, choose **AWS**
**default format**.

- To create a custom format, choose **Custom format**.
For **Log format**, choose the fields to include in
the flow log record.

09. For **Additional metadata**, select if you want to include metadata from Amazon ECS in the log format.

10. (Optional) Choose **Add tag** to apply tags to the flow
     log.

11. Choose **Create flow log**.

###### To create a flow log that publishes to Amazon Data Firehose using the command line

Use one of the following commands:

- [create-flow-logs](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-flow-logs.md)
(AWS CLI)

- [New-EC2FlowLog](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2flowlog.md)
(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

The following AWS CLI example creates a flow log that captures all traffic for the
specified VPC and delivers the flow logs to the specified Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream
in the same account.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-flow-logs --traffic-type ALL \
  --resource-type VPC \
  --resource-ids vpc-00112233344556677 \
  --log-destination-type kinesis-data-firehose \
  --log-destination arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:123456789012:deliverystream/flowlogs_stream
```

The following AWS CLI example creates a flow log that captures all traffic for the
specified VPC and delivers the flow logs to the specified Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream
in a different account.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-flow-logs --traffic-type ALL \
  --resource-type VPC \
  --resource-ids vpc-00112233344556677 \
  --log-destination-type kinesis-data-firehose \
  --log-destination arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:123456789012:deliverystream/flowlogs_stream \
  --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::source-account:role/mySourceRole \
  --deliver-cross-account-role arn:aws:iam::destination-account:role/AWSLogDeliveryFirehoseCrossAccountRole
```

As a result of creating the flow log, you can get the flow log data from the
destination that you configured for the delivery stream.
