# Add egress-only internet access to a subnet

The following tasks describe how to create an egress-only (outbound) internet
gateway for your private subnet and to configure routing for the subnet.

###### Tasks

- [1\. Create an egress-only internet gateway](#egress-only-internet-gateway-create)

- [2\. Create a custom route table](#egress-only-internet-gateway-routing)

- [3\. Delete an egress-only internet gateway](#egress-only-internet-gateway-delete)

- [Command line overview](#egress-only-internet-gateway-api-cli)

## 1\. Create an egress-only internet gateway

You can create an egress-only internet gateway for your VPC using the Amazon VPC
console.

###### To create an egress-only internet gateway

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Egress Only Internet Gateways**.

3. Choose **Create Egress Only Internet Gateway**.

4. (Optional) Add or remove a tag.

\[Add a tag\] Choose **Add new tag** and do the
    following:

- For **Key**, enter the key name.

- For **Value**, enter the key value.

\[Remove a tag\] Choose **Remove** to the right of the
tag’s Key and Value.

5. Select the VPC in which to create the egress-only internet gateway.

6. Choose **Create**.

## 2\. Create a custom route table

To send traffic destined outside the VPC to the egress-only internet gateway, you
must create a custom route table, add a route that sends traffic to the gateway, and
then associate it with your subnet.

###### To create a custom route table and add a route to the egress-only internet gateway

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Route Tables**,
    **Create route table**.

3. In the **Create route table** dialog box, optionally name
    your route table, then select your VPC and choose **Create route**
**table**.

4. Select the custom route table that you just created. The details pane displays tabs
    for working with its routes, associations, and route propagation.

5. On the **Routes** tab, choose **Edit**
**routes**, specify `::/0` in the
    **Destination** box, select the egress-only internet
    gateway ID in the **Target** list, and then choose
    **Save changes**.

6. On the **Subnet associations** tab, choose **Edit**
**subnet associations**, and select the check box for the subnet.
    Choose **Save**.

Alternatively, you can add a route to an existing route table that's associated
with your subnet. Select your existing route table, and follow steps 5 and 6 above
to add a route for the egress-only internet gateway.

For more information about route tables, see [Configure route tables](vpc-route-tables.md).

## 3\. Delete an egress-only internet gateway

If you no longer need an egress-only internet gateway, you can delete it. Any
route in a route table that points to the deleted egress-only internet gateway
remains in a `blackhole` status until you manually delete or update the
route.

###### To delete an egress-only internet gateway

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Egress Only Internet**
**Gateways**, and select the egress-only internet gateway.

3. Choose **Delete**.

4. Choose **Delete Egress Only Internet Gateway** in the
    confirmation dialog box.
