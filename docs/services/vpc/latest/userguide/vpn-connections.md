# Connect your VPC to remote networks using AWS Virtual Private Network

You can connect your VPC to remote networks and users using the following VPN connectivity options.

VPN connectivity optionDescriptionAWS Site-to-Site VPNYou can create an IPsec VPN connection between your VPC and your remote network. On the
AWS side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection, a virtual private gateway or transit
gateway provides two VPN endpoints (tunnels) for automatic failover. You
configure your _customer gateway device_ on the remote
side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection. For more
information, see the [AWS Site-to-Site VPN User\
Guide](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpc-vpn.md).AWS Client VPNAWS Client VPN is a managed client-based VPN service that enables you to securely access
your AWS resources or your on-premises network. With AWS Client VPN, you
configure an endpoint to which your users can connect to establish a secure
TLS VPN session. This enables clients to access resources in AWS or
on-premises from any location using an OpenVPN-based VPN client. For more information, see the [AWS Client VPN Administrator Guide](../../../vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin.md).AWS VPN CloudHubIf you have more than one remote network (for example, multiple branch offices), you can
create multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections through your virtual private gateway to
enable communication between these networks. For more information, see [Providing\
secure communication between sites using VPN CloudHub](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-cloudhub.md) in the
_AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.Third party software VPN applianceYou can create a VPN connection to your remote network by using an Amazon EC2 instance
in your VPC that's running a third party software VPN appliance. AWS does
not provide or maintain third party software VPN appliances; however, you
can choose from a range of products provided by partners and open source
communities. Find third party software VPN appliances on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results/ref=brs_navgno_search_box?searchTerms=vpn).

You can also use Direct Connect to create a dedicated private connection from a remote network to
your VPC. You can combine this connection with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN to create an
IPsec-encrypted connection. For more information, see [What is Direct Connect?](../../../directconnect/latest/userguide/welcome.md) in the
_Direct Connect User Guide_.
