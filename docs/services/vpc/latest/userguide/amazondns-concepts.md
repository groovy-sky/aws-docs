# Understanding Amazon DNS

As an AWS architect or administrator, one of the foundational networking components you'll
encounter is the Amazon DNS server, also known as the Route 53 Resolver. This DNS resolver
service is natively integrated into each Availability Zone within your AWS Region, providing a
reliable and scalable solution for domain name resolution within your Virtual Private Cloud
(VPC). In this section you'll learn about the Amazon DNS server's IP addresses, the private DNS hostnames it can resolve, and the rules
that govern its usage.

## Amazon DNS server

The Route 53 Resolver (also called "Amazon DNS server" or "AmazonProvidedDNS") is a DNS
Resolver service which is built into each Availability Zone in an AWS Region. The Route 53
Resolver is located at `169.254.169.253` (IPv4), `fd00:ec2::253` (IPv6),
and at the primary private IPV4 CIDR range provisioned to your VPC plus two. For example, if
you have a VPC with an IPv4 CIDR of `10.0.0.0/16` and an IPv6 CIDR of
`2001:db8::/32`, you can reach the Route 53 Resolver at
`169.254.169.253` (IPv4), `fd00:ec2::253` (IPv6), or
`10.0.0.2` (IPv4). Resources within a VPC use a [link local\
address](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-instance-addressing.md#link-local-addresses) for DNS queries. These queries are transported to the Route 53 Resolver
privately and are not visible on the network. In an IPv6-only subnet, the IPv4 link-local address (169.254.169.253) is still reachable as long as "AmazonProvidedDNS" is the name server in the DHCP option set.

When you launch an instance into a VPC, we provide the instance with a private DNS
hostname. We also provide a public DNS hostname if the instance is configured with a public
IPv4 address and the VPC DNS attributes are enabled.

The format of the private DNS hostname depends on how you configure the EC2 instance when you launch it. For
more information on the types of private DNS hostnames, see [Amazon EC2 instance hostname types](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-instance-naming.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

The Amazon DNS server in your VPC is used to resolve the DNS domain names that you specify
in a private hosted zone in Route 53. For more information about private hosted zones, see
[Working with private hosted\
zones](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/hosted-zones-private.md) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

## Rules and considerations

When using the Amazon DNS server, the following rules and considerations
apply.

- You cannot filter traffic to or from the Amazon DNS server using network
ACLs or security groups.

- Services that use the Hadoop framework, such as Amazon EMR, require instances
to resolve their own fully qualified domain names (FQDN). In such cases, DNS
resolution can fail if the `domain-name-servers` option is set to
a custom value. To ensure proper DNS resolution, consider adding a
conditional forwarder on your DNS server to forward queries for the domain
`region-name.compute.internal`
to the Amazon DNS server. For more information, see [Setting up a VPC to host\
clusters](../../../emr/latest/managementguide/emr-vpc-host-job-flows.md) in the _Amazon EMR Management Guide_.

- The Amazon Route 53 Resolver only supports recursive DNS queries.

## DNS hostnames for EC2 instances

When you launch an instance, it always receives a private IPv4 address and a private
DNS hostname that corresponds to its private IPv4 address. If your instance has a public IPv4
address, the DNS attributes for its VPC determines whether it receives a public DNS hostname
that corresponds to the public IPv4 address. For more information, see [DNS attributes for your VPC](#vpc-dns-support).

With the Amazon provided DNS server enabled, DNS hostnames are resolved as
follows.

###### Private IPv4 DNS name

The private IPv4 DNS hostname of an instance resolves to its private IPv4 address.
You can use the private IPv4 DNS hostname for communication between instances in the
same VPC or in connected VPCs. For more information, see [Private \
IPv4 addresses](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-instance-addressing.md#concepts-private-addresses) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

###### Public IPv4 DNS name

The public IPv4 DNS hostname of an instance resolves to its public IPv4 address
(outside the network of the instance) or its private IPv4 address (inside the network
of the instance). For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-instance-addressing.md#concepts-public-addresses) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

To resolve public IPv4 DNS names to private IPv4 addresses over a VPC peering
connection, you must enable DNS resolution for the peering connection. For more
information, see [Enable DNS resolution for a VPC peering connection](../peering/vpc-peering-dns.md).

###### Private resource DNS name

The RBN-based DNS name that can resolve to the A and AAAA DNS records selected for this
instance. This DNS hostname is visible in the instance details for instances in dual-stack
and IPv6-only subnets. For more information about RBN, see [EC2 instance hostname types](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-instance-naming.md)
in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## DNS attributes for your VPC

The following VPC attributes determine the DNS support provided for your VPC. If both
attributes are enabled, an instance launched into the VPC receives a public DNS hostname if it
is assigned a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address at creation. If you enable both
attributes for a VPC that didn't previously have them both enabled, instances that were
already launched into that VPC receive public DNS hostnames if they have a public IPv4 address
or an Elastic IP address.

To check whether these attributes are enabled for your VPC, see [View and update DNS attributes for your VPC](vpc-dns-updating.md).

AttributeDescription`enableDnsHostnames`

Determines whether the VPC supports assigning public DNS hostnames to
instances with public IP addresses.

The default for this attribute is `false` unless the VPC is a
default VPC. Note the **Rules and considerations** for
this attribute below.

`enableDnsSupport`

Determines whether the VPC supports DNS resolution through the Amazon provided
DNS server.

If this attribute is `true`, queries to the Amazon provided DNS
server succeed. For more information, see [Amazon DNS server](#AmazonDNS).

The default for this attribute is `true`. Note the **Rules and considerations** for this attribute below.

###### Rules and considerations

- If both attributes are set to `true`, the following occurs:

- Instances with public IP addresses receive corresponding public DNS
hostnames.

- The Route 53 Resolver server can resolve Amazon-provided
private DNS hostnames.

- If at least one of the attributes is set to `false`, the
following occurs:

- Instances with public IP addresses do not receive corresponding public
DNS hostnames.

- The Route 53 Resolver cannot resolve Amazon-provided private DNS hostnames.

- Instances receive custom private DNS hostnames if there is a custom
domain name in the [DHCP options\
set](vpc-dhcp-options.md). If you are not using the Route 53 Resolver
server, your custom domain name servers must resolve the hostname as
appropriate.

- If you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in
Amazon Route 53, or use private DNS with interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink),
you must set both the `enableDnsHostnames` and
`enableDnsSupport` attributes to `true`.

- The Route 53 Resolver can resolve private DNS hostnames to
private IPv4 addresses for all address spaces, including where the IPv4 address
range of your VPC falls outside of the private IPv4 addresses ranges specified
by [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918). However,
if you created your VPC before October 2016, the Route 53 Resolver
does not resolve private DNS hostnames if your VPC's IPv4 address range falls
outside of these ranges. To enable support for this, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

## DNS quotas

There is a 1024 packet per second (PPS) limit to services that use [link-local](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-instance-addressing.md#link-local-addresses) addresses. This limit includes the aggregate of Route 53 Resolver DNS queries,
[Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/instancedata-data-retrieval.md) requests, [Amazon Time Service Network Time\
Protocol (NTP)](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/set-time.md) requests, and [Windows Licensing Service (for Microsoft Windows based\
instances)](https://aws.amazon.com/windows/resources/licensing) requests. This quota cannot be increased.

The number of DNS queries per second supported by Route 53 Resolver varies by the type of query,
the size of the response, and the protocol in use. For more information and recommendations
for a scalable DNS architecture, see the [AWS\
Hybrid DNS with Active Directory](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-hybrid-dns-with-active-directory.pdf) Technical Guide.

If you reach the quota, the Route 53 Resolver rejects traffic. Some of the causes for reaching
the quota might be a DNS throttling issue, or instance metadata queries that use the
Route 53 Resolver network interface. For information about how to solve VPC DNS
throttling issues, see [How can I determine whether my DNS queries to the Amazon provided DNS server are failing due\
to VPC DNS throttling](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/vpc-find-cause-of-failed-dns-queries). For information about instance metadata retrieval, see [Retrieve\
instance metadata](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/instancedata-data-retrieval.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Private hosted zones

To access the resources in your VPC using custom DNS domain names, such as `example.com`,
instead of using private IPv4 addresses or AWS-provided private DNS
hostnames, you can create a private hosted zone in Route 53. A private hosted zone is a
container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and
its subdomains within one or more VPCs without exposing your resources to the internet.
You can then create Route 53 resource record sets, which determine how Route 53 responds to
queries for your domain and subdomains. For example, if you want browser requests for
example.com to be routed to a web server in your VPC, you'll create an A record in your
private hosted zone and specify the IP address of that web server. For more information
about creating a private hosted zone, see [Working with private hosted\
zones](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/hosted-zones-private.md) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

To access resources using custom DNS domain names, you must be connected to an instance
within your VPC. From your instance, you can test that your resource in your private hosted
zone is accessible from its custom DNS name by using the `ping` command; for
example, `ping mywebserver.example.com`. (You must ensure that your instance's
security group rules allow inbound ICMP traffic for the `ping` command to
work.)

Private hosted zones do not support transitive relationships outside of the VPC;
for example, you cannot access your resources using their custom private DNS names
from the other side of a VPN connection.

###### Important

If you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53,
you must set both the `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupport`
attributes to `true`.
