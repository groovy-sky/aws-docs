# Example: VPC for a test environment

This example demonstrates how to create a VPC that you can use as a development or test
environment. Because this VPC is not intended to be used in production, it is not necessary to
deploy your servers in multiple Availability Zones. To keep the cost and complexity low, you can
deploy your servers in a single Availability Zone.

## Overview

The following diagram provides an overview of the resources included in this example. The
VPC has a public subnet in a single Availability Zone and an internet gateway. The server is
an EC2 instance that runs in the public subnet. The security group for the instance allows SSH
traffic from your own computer, plus any other traffic specifically required for your
development or testing activities.

### Routing

When you create this VPC by using the Amazon VPC console, we create a route table for the
public subnet with local routes and routes to the internet gateway. The following is an
example of the route table with routes for both IPv4 and IPv6. If you create an IPv4-only
subnet instead of a dual stack subnet, your route table has only the IPv4 routes.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56`local0.0.0.0/0`igw-id`::/0`igw-id`

### Security

For this example configuration, you must create a security group for your instance that
allows the traffic that your application needs. For example, you might need to add a rule
that allows SSH traffic from your computer or HTTP traffic from your network.

The following are example inbound rules for a security group, with rules for both IPv4
and IPv6. If you create IPv4-only subnets instead of dual stack subnets, you need only the
rules for IPv4.

## 1\. Create the VPC

Use the following procedure to create a VPC with a public subnet in one Availability
Zone. This configuration is suitable for a development or testing environment.

###### To create the VPC

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the dashboard, choose **Create VPC**.

3. For **Resources to create**, choose **VPC**
**and more**.

4. **Configure the VPC**
1. For **Name tag auto-generation**, enter a name for the VPC.

2. For **IPv4 CIDR block**, you can keep the default suggestion, or
       alternatively you can enter the CIDR block required by your application or
       network. For more information, see [VPC CIDR blocks](vpc-cidr-blocks.md).

3. (Optional) If your application communicates by using IPv6 addresses, choose
       **IPv6 CIDR block**, **Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR**
      **block**.
5. **Configure the subnets**
1. For **Number of Availability Zones**, choose
       **1**. You can keep the default Availability Zone, or alternatively
       you can expand **Customize AZs** and select an Availability
       Zone.

2. For **Number of public subnets**, choose
       **1**.

3. For **Number of private subnets**, choose
       **0**.

4. You can keep the default CIDR block for the public subnet, or alternatively you
       can expand **Customize subnet CIDR blocks** and enter a CIDR block.
       For more information, see [Subnet CIDR blocks](subnet-sizing.md).
6. For **NAT gateways**, keep the default value, **None**.

7. For **VPC endpoints**, choose **None**. A gateway
    VPC endpoint for S3 is used only to access Amazon S3 from private subnets.

8. For **DNS options**, keep both options selected. As a result, your instance
    will receive a public DNS hostname that corresponds to its public IP address.

9. Choose **Create VPC**.

## 2\. Deploy your application

There are a variety of ways to deploy EC2 instances. For example:

- [Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md)

- [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide.md)

- [AWS CloudFormation](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide.md)

- [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](../../../ecs/index.md)

After you deploy an EC2 instance, you can connect to the instance, install the software
that you need for your application, and then create an image for future use. For more
information, see [Create an AMI](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/creating-an-ami-ebs.md)
in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. Alternatively, you can use [EC2 Image Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/image-builder) to create and manage your Amazon Machine Image
(AMI).

## 3\. Test your configuration

After you've finished deploying your application, you can test it. If you can't
connect to your EC2 instance, or if your application can't send or receive the traffic
that you expect, you can use Reachability Analyzer to help you troubleshoot. For
example, Reachability Analyzer can identify configuration issues with your route
tables or security groups. For more information, see the [Reachability Analyzer Guide](../reachability.md).

## 4\. Clean up

When you are finished with this configuration, you can delete it. Before you can delete the VPC,
you must terminate your instance. For more information, see [Delete your VPC](delete-vpc.md).
