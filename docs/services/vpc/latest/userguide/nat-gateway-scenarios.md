# NAT gateway use cases

The following are example use cases for public and private NAT gateways.

###### Scenarios

- [Access the internet from a private subnet](#public-nat-internet-access)

- [Access your network using allow-listed IP addresses](#private-nat-allowed-range)

- [Enable communication between overlapping networks](#private-nat-overlapping-networks)

## Access the internet from a private subnet

You can use a public NAT gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to send outbound
traffic to the internet, while preventing the internet from establishing connections to the
instances.

### Overview

The following diagram illustrates this use case. There are two Availability Zones,
with two subnets in each Availability Zone. The route table for each subnet determines how
traffic is routed. In Availability Zone A, the instances in the public subnet can reach
the internet through a route to the internet gateway, while the instances in the private
subnet have no route to the internet. In Availability Zone B, the public subnet contains a
NAT gateway, and the instances in the private subnet can reach the internet through a
route to the NAT gateway in the public subnet. Both private and public NAT gateways map the source private IPv4 address of the
instances to the private IPv4 address of the private NAT gateway, but in the case of a
public NAT gateway, the internet gateway then maps the private IPv4 address of the public
NAT gateway to the Elastic IP address associated with the NAT gateway. When sending
response traffic to the instances, whether it's a public or private NAT gateway, the NAT
gateway translates the address back to the original source IP address.

![A VPC with public and private subnets, a NAT gateway, and an internet gateway.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/userguide/images/public-nat-gateway-diagram.png)

Note that if the instances in the private subnet in Availability Zone A also need to reach
the internet, you can create a route from this subnet to the NAT gateway in Availability Zone B.
Alternatively, you can improve resiliency by creating a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone
that contains resources that require internet access. For an example diagram, see
[Example: VPC with servers in private subnets and NAT](vpc-example-private-subnets-nat.md).

### Routing

The following is the route table associated with the public subnet in Availability
Zone A. The first entry is the local route; it enables the instances in the subnet to
communicate with other instances in the VPC using private IP addresses. The second entry
sends all other subnet traffic to the internet gateway, which enables the instances in the
subnet to access the internet.

DestinationTarget`VPC CIDR`local0.0.0.0/0`internet-gateway-id`

The following is the route table associated with the private subnet in Availability
Zone A. The entry is the local route, which enables the instances in the subnet to
communicate with other instances in the VPC using private IP addresses. The instances
in this subnet have no access to the internet.

DestinationTarget`VPC CIDR`local

The following is the route table associated with the public subnet in Availability
Zone B. The first entry is the local route, which enables the instances in the subnet to
communicate with other instances in the VPC using private IP addresses. The second entry
sends all other subnet traffic to the internet gateway, which enables the NAT gateway in
the subnet to access the internet.

DestinationTarget`VPC CIDR`local0.0.0.0/0`internet-gateway-id`

The following is the route table associated with the private subnet in Availability
Zone B. The first entry is the local route; it enables the instances in the subnet to
communicate with other instances in the VPC using private IP addresses. The second entry
sends all other subnet traffic to the NAT gateway.

DestinationTarget`VPC CIDR`local0.0.0.0/0`nat-gateway-id`

For more information, see [Manage subnet route tables](workwithroutetables.md).

### Test the public NAT gateway

After you've created your NAT gateway and updated your route tables, you can ping
remote addresses on the internet from an instance in your private subnet to test whether
it can connect to the internet. For an example of how to do this, see [Test the internet connection](#nat-gateway-testing-example).

If you can connect to the internet, you can also test whether internet traffic is
routed through the NAT gateway:

- Trace the route of traffic from an instance in your private subnet. To do this,
run the `traceroute` command from a Linux instance in your private subnet.
In the output, you should see the private IP address of the NAT gateway in one of the
hops (usually the first hop).

- Use a third-party website or tool that displays the source IP address when you
connect to it from an instance in your private subnet. The source IP address should be
the Elastic IP address of the NAT gateway.

If these tests fail, see [Troubleshoot NAT gateways](nat-gateway-troubleshooting.md).

#### Test the internet connection

The following example demonstrates how to test whether an instance in a private
subnet can connect to the internet.

1. Launch an instance in your public subnet (use this as a bastion host).
    In the launch wizard, ensure that you
    select an Amazon Linux AMI, and assign a public IP address to your instance. Ensure that
    your security group rules allow inbound SSH traffic from the range of IP addresses
    for your local network, and outbound SSH traffic to the IP address range of your
    private subnet (you can also use `0.0.0.0/0` for both inbound and
    outbound SSH traffic for this test).

2. Launch an instance in your private subnet. In the launch wizard, ensure that you
    select an Amazon Linux AMI. Do not assign a public IP address to your instance.
    Ensure that your security group rules allow inbound SSH traffic from the
    private IP address of your instance that you launched in the public
    subnet, and all outbound ICMP traffic. You must choose the same key pair
    that you used to launch your instance in the public subnet.

3. Configure SSH agent forwarding on your local computer, and connect to your bastion
    host in the public subnet. For more information, see [To configure SSH agent forwarding for Linux or macOS](#ssh-forwarding-linux) or [To configure SSH agent forwarding for Windows](#ssh-forwarding-windows).

4. From your bastion host, connect to your instance in the private subnet, and then
    test the internet connection from your instance in the private subnet.
    For more information, see [To test the internet connection](#test-internet-connection).

###### To configure SSH agent forwarding for Linux or macOS

1. From your local machine, add your private key to the authentication agent.

For Linux, use the following command.

```nohighlight

ssh-add -c mykeypair.pem
```

For macOS, use the following command.

```nohighlight

ssh-add -K mykeypair.pem
```

2. Connect to your instance in the public subnet using the `-A` option to enable SSH
    agent forwarding, and use the instance's public address, as shown in the following
    example.

```nohighlight

ssh -A ec2-user@54.0.0.123
```

###### To configure SSH agent forwarding for Windows

You can use the OpenSSH client available in Windows, or install your preferred
SSH client (for example, PuTTY).

OpenSSH

Install OpenSSH for Windows as described in this article:
[Getting started with OpenSSH for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). Then add your key to the authentication
agent. For more information, see [Key-based authentication in OpenSSH for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement).

PuTTY

1. Download and install Pageant from the [PuTTY download page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty), if not already installed.

2. Convert your private key to .ppk format. For more information, see [Convert your\
    private key using PuTTYgen](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/connect-linux-inst-from-windows.md#putty-private-key) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

3. Start Pageant, right-click the Pageant icon on the taskbar (it may be hidden), and
    choose **Add Key**. Select the .ppk file that you created, enter the
    passphrase if necessary, and choose **Open**.

4. Start a PuTTY session and connect to your instance in the public subnet using its
    public IP address. For more information, see [Connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/connect-linux-inst-from-windows.md).
    In the **Auth** category, ensure
    that you select the **Allow agent forwarding** option,
    and leave the **Private key file for authentication**
    box blank.

###### To test the internet connection

1. From your instance in the public subnet, connect to your instance in your private subnet by
    using its private IP address as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

ssh ec2-user@10.0.1.123
```

2. From your private instance, test that you can connect to the internet by running the
    `ping` command for a website that has ICMP enabled.

```nohighlight

ping ietf.org
```

```nohighlight

PING ietf.org (4.31.198.44) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from mail.ietf.org (4.31.198.44): icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=86.0 ms
64 bytes from mail.ietf.org (4.31.198.44): icmp_seq=2 ttl=47 time=75.6 ms
...
```

Press **Ctrl+C** on your keyboard to cancel the `ping`
    command. If the `ping` command fails, see [Instances cannot access the internet](nat-gateway-troubleshooting.md#nat-gateway-troubleshooting-no-internet-connection).

3. (Optional) If you no longer require your instances, terminate them. For more information, see
    [Terminate your\
    instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/terminating-instances.md) in the
    _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Access your network using allow-listed IP addresses

You can use a private NAT gateway to enable communication from your VPCs to your on-premises
network using a pool of allow-listed addresses. Instead of assigning each instance a separate
IP address from the allow-listed IP address range, you can route traffic from the subnet
that is destined for the on-premises network through a private NAT gateway with an IP address
from the allow-listed IP address range.

- [Routing](#private-nat-allowed-range-routing)

### Overview

The following diagram shows how instances can access on-premises resources
through Site-to-Site VPN. Traffic from the instances is routed to a virtual private gateway,
over the VPN connection, to the customer gateway, and then to the destination in
the on-premises network. However, suppose that the destination allows traffic
only from a specific IP address range, such as 100.64.1.0/28. This would prevent
traffic from these instances from reaching the on-premises network.

![Access to an on-premises network using an Site-to-Site VPN connection.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/userguide/images/allowed-range.png)

The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this
scenario. The VPC has its original IP address range plus the allowed IP address range.
The VPC has a subnet from the allowed IP address range with a private NAT gateway.
Traffic from the instances that is destined for the on-premises network is sent
to the NAT gateway before being routed to the VPN connection. The on-premises
network receives the traffic from the instances with the source IP address of the
NAT gateway, which is from the allowed IP address range.

![VPC subnet traffic routed through private NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/userguide/images/private-nat-allowed-range.png)

### Resources

Create or update resources as follows:

- Associate the allowed IP address range with the VPC.

- Create a subnet in the VPC from the allowed IP address range.

- Create a private NAT gateway in the new subnet.

- Update the route table for the subnet with the instances to send traffic destined
for the on-premises network to the NAT gateway. Add a route to the route table for
the subnet with the private NAT gateway that sends traffic destined for the on-premises
network to the virtual private gateway.

### Routing

The following is the route table associated with the first subnet. There is a local
route for each VPC CIDR. Local routes enable resources in the subnet to communicate with
other resources in the VPC using private IP addresses. The third entry sends traffic
destined for the on-premises network to the private NAT gateway.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`100.64.1.0/24`local`192.168.0.0/16``nat-gateway-id`

The following is the route table associated with the second subnet. There is a local
route for each VPC CIDR. Local routes enable resources in the subnet to communicate with
other resources in the VPC using private IP addresses. The third entry sends traffic
destined for the on-premises network to the virtual private gateway.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`100.64.1.0/24`local`192.168.0.0/16``vgw-id`

## Enable communication between overlapping networks

You can use a private NAT gateway to enable communication between networks even if they
have overlapping CIDR ranges. For example, suppose that the instances in VPC A need to
access the services provided by the instances in VPC B.

![Two VPCs with overlapping CIDR ranges.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/userguide/images/overlapping-networks.png)

- [Resources](#private-nat-overlapping-networks-resources)

- [Routing](#private-nat-overlapping-networks-routing)

### Overview

The following diagram shows the key components of the configuration for this scenario.
First, your IP management team determines which address ranges can overlap (non-routable
address ranges) and which can't (routable address ranges). The IP management team
allocates address ranges from the pool of routable address ranges to projects on request.

Each VPC has its original IP address range, which is non-routable, plus the routable
IP address range assigned to it by the IP management team. VPC A has a subnet from its
routable range with a private NAT gateway. The private NAT gateway gets its IP address
from its subnet. VPC B has a subnet from its routable range with an Application Load Balancer. The Application Load Balancer gets
its IP addresses from its subnets.

Traffic from an instance in the non-routable subnet of VPC A that is destined for the
instances in the non-routable subnet of VPC B is sent through the private NAT gateway and
then routed to the transit gateway. The transit gateway sends the traffic to the Application Load Balancer,
which routes the traffic to one of the target instances in the non-routable subnet of VPC
B. The traffic from the transit gateway to the Application Load Balancer has the source IP address of the
private NAT gateway. Therefore, response traffic from the load balancer uses the address
of the private NAT gateway as its destination. The response traffic is sent to the transit
gateway and then routed to the private NAT gateway, which translates the destination to
the instance in the non-routable subnet of VPC A.

### Resources

Create or update resources as follows:

- Associate the assigned routable IP address ranges with their respective VPCs.

- Create a subnet in VPC A from its routable IP address range, and create a private
NAT gateway in this new subnet.

- Create a subnet in VPC B from its routable IP address range, and create an Application Load Balancer
in this new subnet. Register the instances in the non-routable subnet with the target
group for the load balancer.

- Create a transit gateway to connect the VPCs. Be sure to disable route propagation.
When you attach each VPC to the transit gateway, use the routable address range of the
VPC.

- Update the route table of the non-routable subnet in VPC A to send all traffic
destined for the routable address range of VPC B to the private NAT gateway. Update
the route table of the routable subnet in VPC A to send all traffic destined for the
routable address range of VPC B to the transit gateway.

- Update the route table of the routable subnet in VPC B to send all traffic
destined for the routable address range of VPC A to the transit gateway.

### Routing

The following is the route table for the non-routable subnet in VPC A.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`100.64.1.0/24`local`100.64.2.0/24``nat-gateway-id`

The following is the route table for the routable subnet in VPC A.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`100.64.1.0/24`local`100.64.2.0/24``transit-gateway-id`

The following is the route table for the non-routable subnet in VPC B.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`100.64.2.0/24`local

The following is the route table for the routable subnet in VPC B.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`100.64.2.0/24`local`100.64.1.0/24``transit-gateway-id`

The following is the transit gateway route table.
