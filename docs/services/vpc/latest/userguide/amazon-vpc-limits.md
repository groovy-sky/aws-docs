# Amazon VPC quotas

The following tables list the quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for Amazon VPC resources
for your AWS account. Unless indicated otherwise, these quotas are per Region.

If you request a quota increase that applies per resource, we increase the quota for all
resources in the Region.

## VPC and subnets

NameDefaultAdjustableComments

VPCs per Region

5

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-F678F1CE)

Increasing this quota increases the quota on internet gateways per Region by the
same amount.

You can increase this limit so that you can have hundreds of VPCs per
Region.

Subnets per VPC

200

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-407747CB)

IPv4 CIDR blocks per VPC

5

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-83CA0A9D)

(up to 50)

This primary CIDR block and all secondary CIDR blocks count toward this
quota.

IPv6 CIDR blocks per VPC

5

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-085A6257)

(up to 50)

The number of CIDRs you can allocate to a single VPC.VPC Block Public Access exclusions per account per Region50Yes. To request an increase, see [Request a service quota increase](../../../awssupport/latest/user/create-service-quota-increase.md) in the _AWS Support User Guide_.The number of [VPC BPA exclusions](security-vpc-bpa-basics.md#security-vpc-bpa-exclusions) you can create in an account.

## DNS

Each EC2 instance can send 1024 packets per second per network interface to Route 53 Resolver
(specifically the .2 address, such as 10.0.0.2 and 169.254.169.253). This quota cannot be increased.
The number of DNS queries per second supported by Route 53 Resolver varies by the type of query, the size of the
response, and the protocol in use. For more information and recommendations for a scalable DNS architecture,
see the [AWS Hybrid DNS with Active Directory](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-hybrid-dns-with-active-directory.pdf) Technical Guide.

## Elastic IP addresses

NameDefaultAdjustableCommentsElastic IP addresses per Region

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-5F53652F)You can request a quota increase up to 8.

## Gateways

NameDefaultAdjustableComments

Egress-only internet gateways per Region

5

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-45FE3B85)To increase this quota, increase the quota for VPCs per Region.

You can
attach only one egress-only internet gateway to a VPC at a time.

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-DFA99DE7)Carrier gateways per VPC1No

## Customer-managed prefix lists

While the default quotas for customer-managed prefix lists are adjustable, you cannot
request an increase using the Service Quotas console. You must open a support case. See [Request a service quota increase](../../../awssupport/latest/user/create-service-quota-increase.md) in the _AWS Support User Guide_.

NameDefaultAdjustableCommentsPrefix lists per Region100YesVersions per prefix list1,000YesIf a prefix list has 1,000 stored versions and you add a new version, the
oldest version is removed so that the new version can be added.Maximum number of entries per prefix list1,000Yes

You can resize a customer-managed prefix list up to 1000. For more information, see [Resize a prefix list](work-with-cust-managed-prefix-lists.md#resize-managed-prefix-list). When you
reference a prefix list in a resource, the maximum number of entries for the prefix
lists counts against the quota for the number of entries for the resource. For
example, if you create a prefix list with 20 maximum entries and you reference that
prefix list in a security group rule, this counts as 20 security group rules.

References to a prefix list per resource type10,000YesThis quota applies per resource type that can reference a prefix list. For
example, you can have 10,000 references to a prefix list across all of your security
groups plus 10,000 references to a prefix list across all of your subnet route tables.
If you share a prefix list with other AWS accounts, the other accounts' references
to your prefix list count toward your quota.

## Network ACLs

NameDefaultAdjustableComments

Network ACLs per VPC

200

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-B4A6D682)You can associate one network ACL to one or more subnets in a VPC.

Rules per network ACL

20

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-2AEEBF1A)

This quota determines both the maximum number of inbound rules and the maximum
number of outbound rules. This quota can be increased up to a maximum of 40 inbound
rules and 40 outbound rules (for a total of 80 rules), but network performance might
be impacted.

## Network interfaces

NameDefaultAdjustableCommentsNetwork interfaces per instanceVaries by instance typeNoFor more information, see [Network interfaces per instance type](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-eni.md#AvailableIpPerENI).

Network interfaces per Region

5,000

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-DF5E4CA3)This quota applies to individual AWS account VPCs and shared VPCs. This limit
is enforced per Availability Zone (AZ). If, for example, the network interfaces are in
three AZs, each AZ will have a limit of 5,000 limit and the Region will have a limit
of 15,000.

## Route tables

NameDefaultAdjustableComments

Route tables per VPC

200

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-589F43AA)The main route table counts toward this quota. Note that if you request a quota increase for route tables, you may also want to request a quota increase for subnets. While route tables can be shared with multiple subnets, a subnet can only be associated with a single route table.

Routes per route table

(non-propagated routes)

500

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-93826ACB)You can increase this quota up to a maximum of 1,000; however, network
performance might be impacted. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 routes and
IPv6 routes.

If you have more than 125 routes, we recommend that you paginate
calls to describe your route tables for better performance.

Propagated routes per route table

100No

If you require additional prefixes, advertise a default route.

## Route servers

NameDefaultAdjustableCommentsRoute servers per VPC5Yes. To request an increase, see [Request a service quota increase](../../../awssupport/latest/user/create-service-quota-increase.md) in the _AWS Support User Guide_.Route server endpoints per route server10Yes. To request an increase, see [Request a service quota increase](../../../awssupport/latest/user/create-service-quota-increase.md) in the _AWS Support User Guide_.Peering sessions per network interface20Yes. To request an increase, see [Request a service quota increase](../../../awssupport/latest/user/create-service-quota-increase.md) in the _AWS Support User Guide_.Route server endpoints per route server and subnet2NoYou can only have two endpoints in the same subnet for the same route server for
redundancy.Routes per route server peer100NoThis is the number of routes that can be dynamically advertised over a route server
peerRoutes per route server100NoThis is the number of routes that can be installed in the Forwarding
Information Base (FIB) of a route server.

## Security groups

NameDefaultAdjustableComments

VPC security groups per Region

2,500

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-E79EC296)This quota applies to individual AWS account VPCs and shared VPCs.

If you increase this quota to more than 5,000 security groups in a Region, we
recommend that you paginate calls to describe your security groups for better
performance.

Inbound or outbound rules per security group

60

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-0EA8095F)This quota is enforced separately for inbound and outbound rules. For an account with the default quota of 60 rules, a security group can have 60 inbound rules and 60 outbound rules. In addition, this quota is enforced separately for IPv4 rules and IPv6 rules. For an account with the default quota of 60 rules, a security group can have 60 inbound rules for IPv4 traffic and 60 inbound rules for IPv6 traffic. For more information, see [Security group size](security-group-rules.md#security-group-size).

A quota change applies to both inbound and outbound rules. This quota multiplied by
the quota for security groups per network interface cannot exceed 1,000.

Security groups per network interface

5

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-2AFB9258)

(up to 16)

This quota multiplied by the quota for rules per security group cannot exceed 1,000. To reduce the
security groups per network interface quota below the default value of 5, see [Request a service quota increase](../../../awssupport/latest/user/create-service-quota-increase.md) in the _AWS Support User Guide_. You use the same process to request a decrease as you do to request an increase.

## VPC subnet sharing

All standard VPC quotas apply to shared VPC subnets.

NameDefaultAdjustableComments

Participant accounts per VPC

100

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-2C462E13)The maximum number of distinct participant accounts that subnets in a VPC can be
shared with. This is a per VPC quota and applies across all the subnets shared in a
VPC.

VPC owners can view the network interfaces and security groups that are
attached to the participant resources.

Subnets that can be shared with an account

100

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-44499CD2)This is the maximum number of subnets that can be shared with an AWS account.

## Network Address Usage

Network Address Usage (NAU) is comprised of IP addresses, network interfaces, and CIDRs in managed prefix lists.
NAU is a metric applied to resources in a VPC to help you plan for and monitor the size of your VPC.
For more information, see [Network Address Usage](network-address-usage.md).

The resources that make up the NAU count have their own individual service quotas.
Even if a VPC has NAU capacity available, you won't be able to launch resources into the VPC
if the resources have exceeded their service quotas.

NameDefaultAdjustableComments

Network Address Usage

64,000

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-BB24F6E5) (up to to 256,000)The maximum number of NAU units per VPC.

Peered Network Address Usage

128,000

[Yes](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/vpc/quotas/L-CD17FD4B) (up to 512,000)The maximum number of NAU units for a VPC and all of its intra-Region peered
VPCs. VPCs that are peered across different Regions do not contribute to this
number.
