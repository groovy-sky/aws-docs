# Assess impact of VPC BPA and monitor VPC BPA

This section contains information on you can assess the impact of VPC BPA before you turn it on and how you monitor if traffic is being blocked after you turn it on.

## Assess the impact of VPC BPA using Network Access Analyzer

In this section, you'll use Network Access Analyzer to view the resources in your account that use an
internet gateway _before_ you enable VPC BPA and block access. Use this analysis
to understand the impact of turning on VPC BPA in your account and blocking traffic.

###### Note

- Network Access Analyzer does not support IPv6; so you will not be able to use it to view the
potential impact of VPC BPA on egress-only internet gateway outbound
IPv6 traffic.

- You are charged for the analyses you perform with Network Access Analyzer. For
more information, see [Pricing](../network-access-analyzer/what-is-network-access-analyzer.md#pricing) in the
_Network Access Analyzer Guide_.

- For
information about the regional availability of Network Access Analyzer, see [Limitations](../network-access-analyzer/how-network-access-analyzer-works.md#analyzer-limitations) in the _Network Access Analyzer Guide_.

AWS Management Console

01. Open the AWS Network Insights console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkinsights/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkinsights).

02. Choose **Network Access Analyzer**.

03. Choose **Create Network Access Scope**.

04. Choose **Assess impact of VPC Block Public Access** and choose **Next**.

05. The template is already configured to analyze traffic to and from the internet gateways in your account. You can view this under **Source** and **Destination**.

06. Choose **Next**.

07. Choose **Create Network Access Scope**.

08. Choose the scope you just created and choose **Analyze**.

09. Wait for the analysis to complete.

10. View the findings of the analysis. Each row under
     **Findings** shows a network path that a
     packet can take in a network to or from an internet gateway in
     your account. In this case, if you turn on VPC BPA and none of
     the VPCs and or subnets that appear in these findings are
     configured as VPC BPA exclusions, traffic to those VPCs and
     subnets will be restricted.

11. Analyze each finding to understand the impact of VPC BPA on
     resources in your VPCs.

The impact analysis is complete.

AWS CLI

1. Create a network access scope:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-network-insights-access-scope --region us-east-2 --match-paths "Source={ResourceStatement={ResourceTypes=["AWS::EC2::InternetGateway"]}}" "Destination={ResourceStatement={ResourceTypes=["AWS::EC2::InternetGateway"]}}"
```

2. Start the scope analysis:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 start-network-insights-access-scope-analysis  --region us-east-2 --network-insights-access-scope-id nis-id
```

3. Get the results of the analysis:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-network-insights-access-scope-analysis-findings  --region us-east-2 --network-insights-access-scope-analysis-id nisa-0aa383a1938f94cd1 --max-items 1
```

The results show the traffic to and from the internet gateways in all the VPCs in your account. The results are organized as "findings". "FindingId": "AnalysisFinding-1" indicates that this is the first finding in the analysis. Note that there are multiple findings and each indicates a traffic flow that will be impacted by turning on VPC BPA. The first finding will show that traffic started at an internet gateway ("SequenceNumber": 1), passed to an NACL ("SequenceNumber": 2) to a security group ("SequenceNumber": 3) and ended at an instance ("SequenceNumber": 4).

4. Analyze the findings to understand the impact of VPC BPA on
    resources in your VPCs.

The impact analysis is complete.

## Monitor VPC BPA impact with flow logs

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP
traffic going to and from Elastic network interfaces in your VPC. You can use this
feature to monitor traffic that is blocked by VPC BPA from reaching your instance
network interfaces.

Create a flow log for your VPC using the steps in [Work with flow logs](working-with-flow-logs.md).

When you create the flow log, make sure you use a custom format that includes the field `reject-reason`.

When you view the flow logs, if traffic to an ENI is rejected due to VPC BPA,
you'll see a `reject-reason` of `BPA` in the flow log
entry.

In addition to the standard [limitations](flow-logs-limitations.md) for VPC flow logs, note the following limitations specific
to VPC BPA:

- Flow logs for VPC BPA do not include [skipped records](flow-logs-records-examples.md#flow-log-example-no-data).

- Flow logs for VPC BPA do not include [bytes](flow-log-records.md#flow-logs-fields) even if you include the
`bytes` field in your flow log.

## Track exclusion deletion with CloudTrail

This section explains how you can use AWS CloudTrail to monitor and track the deletion of VPC BPA exclusions.

AWS Management Console

You can view any deleted exclusions in the **CloudTrail Event**
**history** by looking up **Resource type** >
`AWS::EC2::VPCBlockPublicAccessExclusion` in the AWS CloudTrail
console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrailv2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrailv2).

AWS CLI

You can use the `lookup-events` command to view the events related to deleting exclusions:

```nohighlight

aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=ResourceType,AttributeValue=AWS::EC2::VPCBlockPublicAccessExclusion
```

## Verify connectivity is blocked with Reachability Analyzer

[VPC Reachability Analyzer](../reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.md) can be used to evaluate whether or not certain network paths
can be reached given your network configuration, including VPC BPA settings.

For
information about the regional availability of Reachability Analyzer, see [Considerations](../reachability/how-reachability-analyzer-works.md#considerations) in the _Reachability Analyzer Guide_.

AWS Management Console

1. Open the AWS Network Insights console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkinsights/home#ReachabilityAnalyzer](https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkinsights/home).

2. Click **Create and analyze path**.

3. For the **Source Type**, choose
    **Internet Gateways** and select the internet
    gateway you want to block traffic from the **Source**
**dropdown**.

4. For the **Destination Type**, choose **Instances** and select the instance you want to block traffic to from the **Destination** dropdown.

5. Click **Create and analyze path**.

6. Wait for the analysis to complete. It could take a few minutes.

7. Once complete, you should see that the **Reachability**
**Status** is **Not reachable** and
    that the **Path details** shows that
    `VPC_BLOCK_PUBLIC_ACCESS_ENABLED ` is the cause of
    this reachability issue.

AWS CLI

1. Create a network path using the ID of the Internet Gateway you want to block traffic from (source) and the ID of the instance you want to block traffic to (destination):

```nohighlight

aws ec2 --region us-east-2 create-network-insights-path --source igw-id --destination instance-id --protocol TCP
```

2. Start an analysis on the network path:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 --region us-east-2 start-network-insights-analysis --network-insights-path-id nip-id
```

3. Retrieve the results of the analysis:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 --region us-east-2 describe-network-insights-analyses --network-insights-analysis-ids nia-id
```

4. Verify that `VPC_BLOCK_PUBLIC_ACCESS_ENABLED` is the `ExplanationCode` for the lack of reachability.
