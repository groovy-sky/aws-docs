# Manage network ACL associations for your VPC

Each subnet is associated with one network ACL. When you first create a subnet, it is
associated with the default network ACL for the VPC. You can create a custom network ACL and
associate it with one or more subnets, replacing the previous network ACL association.

###### Tasks

- [Describe your network ACL associations](#describe-network-acl-association)

- [Change the subnets associated with a network ACL](#DisassociateNetworkACL)

- [Change the network ACL associated with a subnet](#ChangeNetworkACL)

## Describe your network ACL associations

You can describe the network ACL that's associated with a subnet and you can also
describe which subnets are associated with a network ACL.

###### To describe the network ACL associated with a subnet using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

3. Select the subnet.

4. Select the **Network ACL** tab.

###### To describe the network ACL associated with a subnet using the AWS CLI

Use the following [describe-network-acls](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-network-acls.md)
command to list the network ACL associated with the specified subnet.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-network-acls --filters Name=association.subnet-id,Values=subnet-0d2d1b81e0bc9c6d4 --query NetworkAcls[*].NetworkAclId
```

The following is example output.

```json

[
    "acl-03701d1f82d8c3fd6"
]
```

###### To describe the subnets associated with a network ACL using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**.

3. Select the network ACL.

4. Select the **Subnet associations** tab.

###### To describe the subnets associated with a network ACL using the AWS CLI

Use the following [describe-network-acls](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-network-acls.md)
command to list the subnets associated with the specified network ACL.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-network-acls --network-acl-ids acl-060415a18fcc9afde --query NetworkAcls[*].Associations[].SubnetId
```

The following is example output.

```json

[
    "subnet-0d2d1b81e0bc9c6d4",
    "subnet-0e990c67809773b19",
    "subnet-0eb17d85f5dfd33b1",
    "subnet-0e01d500780bb7468"
]
```

## Change the subnets associated with a network ACL

You can disassociate a custom network ACL from a subnet. After you disassociate
a subnet from a custom network ACL, we automatically associate it with the default
network ACL for the VPC. The changes take effect after a short period of time.

###### To change the subnets associated with a network ACL

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**.

3. Select the network ACL.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Edit subnet associations**.

5. Remove the subnet from **Selected subnets**.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

## Change the network ACL associated with a subnet

You can change the network ACL that's associated with a subnet. For example, when you
create a subnet, it is initially associated with the default network ACL for the VPC.
If you create a custom network ACL, you apply the network ACL rules by associating the
network ACL with one or more subnets.

After you change the network ACL for a subnet, the changes take effect after a short
period of time.

###### To change the network ACL associated with a subnet

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

3. Select the subnet.

4. Choose **Actions**,
    **Edit network ACL association**.

5. For **Network ACL ID**, select the network ACL to associate
    with the subnet, and review the inbound and outbound rules for the selected
    network ACL.

6. Choose **Save**.

###### To replace a network ACL association using the command line

- [replace-network-acl-association](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/replace-network-acl-association.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Set-EC2NetworkAclAssociation](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/set-ec2networkaclassociation.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)
