# Work with shared prefix lists

AWS prefix lists provide a convenient way to manage and reference the IP address ranges used by various AWS services. In addition to the AWS-managed prefix lists, you also can create and share your own customer-managed prefix lists with other AWS accounts.

Sharing prefix lists can be particularly useful for organizations with complex networking requirements or those that need to coordinate IP address usage across multiple AWS workloads. By sharing a prefix list, you can ensure consistent IP address management and simplify networking configurations for your collaborators.

This section describes and how to share prefix lists and how to identify and use prefix lists that have been shared with your account.

## Share a prefix list

To share a prefix list, you must add it to a resource share. If you do not have a
resource share, you must first create one using the [AWS RAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram).

If you are part of an organization in AWS Organizations, and sharing within your
organization is enabled, consumers in your organization are automatically granted
access to the shared prefix list. Otherwise, consumers receive an invitation to join
the resource share and are granted access to the shared prefix list after accepting
the invitation.

You can create a resource share and share a prefix list that you own using the
AWS RAM console, or the AWS CLI.

###### Important

- To share a prefix list, you must own it. You cannot share a prefix list
that has been shared with you. You cannot share an AWS-managed prefix
list.

- To share a prefix list with your organization or an organizational unit in
AWS Organizations, you must enable sharing with AWS Organizations. For more information, see
[Enable sharing with AWS Organizations](../../../ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.md#getting-started-sharing-orgs) in the
_AWS RAM User Guide_.

###### To create a resource share and share a prefix list using the AWS RAM console

Follow the steps in [Create a resource share](../../../ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.md#getting-started-sharing-create) in the _AWS RAM User Guide_.
For **Select resource type**, choose **Prefix**
**Lists**, and then select the check box for your prefix list.

###### To add a prefix list to an existing resource share using the AWS RAM console

To add a managed prefix that you own to an existing resource share, follow the
steps in [Updating a resource share](../../../ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing.md#working-with-sharing-update) in the
_AWS RAM User Guide_. For **Select resource**
**type**, choose **Prefix Lists**, and then select
the check box for your prefix list.

###### To share a prefix list that you own using the AWS CLI

Use the following commands to create and update a resource share:

- [create-resource-share](../../../cli/latest/reference/ram/create-resource-share.md)

- [associate-resource-share](../../../cli/latest/reference/ram/associate-resource-share.md)

- [update-resource-share](../../../cli/latest/reference/ram/update-resource-share.md)

## Unshare a shared prefix list

When you unshare a prefix list, consumers can no longer view the prefix list or
its entries in their account, and they cannot reference the prefix list in their
resources. If the prefix list is already referenced in the consumer's resources,
those references continue to function as normal, and you can continue to [view those references](#sharing-identify-references). If you
update the prefix list to a new version, the references use the latest
version.

To unshare a shared prefix list that you own, you must remove it from the resource
share using AWS RAM.

###### To unshare a shared prefix list that you own using the AWS RAM console

See [Updating a resource share](../../../ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing.md#working-with-sharing-update) in the _AWS RAM User Guide_.

###### To unshare a shared prefix list that you own using the AWS CLI

Use the [disassociate-resource-share](../../../cli/latest/reference/ram/disassociate-resource-share.md) command.

## Identify a shared prefix list

Owners and consumers can identify shared prefix lists using the Amazon VPC console and
AWS CLI.

###### To identify a shared prefix list using the Amazon VPC console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Managed Prefix**
**Lists**.

3. The page displays the prefix lists that you own and the prefix lists that
    are shared with you. The **Owner ID** column shows the
    AWS account ID of the prefix list owner.

4. To view the resource share information for a prefix list, select the
    prefix list and choose **Sharing** in the lower
    pane.

###### To identify a shared prefix list using the AWS CLI

Use the [describe-managed-prefix-lists](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-managed-prefix-lists.md) command. The command returns the
prefix lists that you own and the prefix lists that are shared with you.
`OwnerId` shows the AWS account ID of the prefix list
owner.

## Identify references to a shared prefix list

Owners can identify the consumer-owned resources that are referencing a shared
prefix list.

###### To identify references to a shared prefix list using the Amazon VPC console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Managed Prefix**
**Lists**.

3. Select the prefix list and choose **Associations** in the
    lower pane.

4. The IDs of the resources that are referencing the prefix list are listed
    in the **Resource ID** column. The owners of the resources
    are listed in the **Resource Owner** column.

###### To identify references to a shared prefix list using the AWS CLI

Use the [get-managed-prefix-list-associations](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-managed-prefix-list-associations.md) command.
