# Example: VPC for web and database servers

This example demonstrates how to create a VPC that you can use for a two-tier architecture
in a production environment. To improve resiliency, you deploy the servers in two Availability
Zones.

## Overview

The following diagram provides an overview of the resources included in this example. The
VPC has public subnets and private subnets in two Availability Zones. The web servers run in
the public subnets and receive traffic from clients through a load balancer. The security
group for the web servers allows traffic from the load balancer. The database servers run in
the private subnets and receive traffic from the web servers. The security group for the
database servers allows traffic from the web servers. The database servers can connect to Amazon S3
by using a gateway VPC endpoint.

### Routing

When you create this VPC by using the Amazon VPC console, we create a route table for the
public subnets with local routes and routes to the internet gateway, and a route table for
each private subnet with local routes and a route to the gateway VPC endpoint.

The following is an example of a route table for the public subnets, with routes for
both IPv4 and IPv6. If you create IPv4-only subnets instead of dual stack subnets, your
route table has only the IPv4 routes.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56`local0.0.0.0/0`igw-id`::/0`igw-id`

The following is an example of a route table for the private subnets, with local routes for
both IPv4 and IPv6. If you created IPv4-only subnets, your route table has only the IPv4
route. The last route sends traffic destined for Amazon S3 to the gateway VPC endpoint.

DestinationTarget`10.0.0.0/16`local`2001:db8:1234:1a00::/56`local`s3-prefix-list-id``s3-gateway-id`

### Security

For this example configuration, you create a security group for the load balancer, a
security group for the web servers, and a security group for the database servers.

###### Load balancer

The security group for your Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer must allow inbound traffic from clients on
the load balancer listener port. To accept traffic from anywhere on the internet, specify
0.0.0.0/0 as the source. The load balancer security group must also allow outbound traffic
from the load balancer to the target instances on the instance listener port and the
health check port.

###### Web servers

The following security group rules allow the web servers to receive HTTP and HTTPS
traffic from the load balancer. You can optionally allow the web servers to receive SSH or
RDP traffic from your network. The web servers can send SQL or MySQL traffic to your
database servers.

## 1\. Create the VPC

Use the following procedure to create a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet
in two Availability Zones.

###### To create the VPC

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. On the dashboard, choose **Create VPC**.

3. For **Resources to create**, choose **VPC**
**and more**.

4. Configure the VPC:
1. Keep **Name tag auto-generation** selected to create Name tags for
       the VPC resources or clear it to provide your own Name tags for the VPC resources.

2. For **IPv4 CIDR block**, you can keep the default suggestion, or
       alternatively you can enter the CIDR block required by your application or network.
       For more information, see [VPC CIDR blocks](vpc-cidr-blocks.md).

3. (Optional) If your application communicates by using IPv6 addresses, choose
       **IPv6 CIDR block**, **Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR**
      **block**.

4. Choose a **Tenancy** option. This option defines if EC2 instances
       that you launch into the VPC will run on hardware that's shared with other
       AWS accounts or on hardware that's dedicated for your use only. If you choose the
       tenancy of the VPC to be `Default`, EC2 instances launched into this VPC
       will use the tenancy attribute specified when you launch the instance. For more
       information, see [Launch an instance\
       using defined parameters](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. If
       you choose the tenancy of the VPC to be `Dedicated`, the instances will
       always run as [Dedicated\
       Instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-instance.md) on hardware that's dedicated for your use.
5. Configure the subnets:
1. For **Number of Availability Zones**, choose
       **2**, so that you can launch instances in two Availability Zones
       to improve resiliency.

2. For **Number of public subnets**, choose
       **2**.

3. For **Number of private subnets**, choose
       **2**.

4. You can keep the default CIDR blocks for the subnets, or alternatively you can
       expand **Customize subnets CIDR blocks** and enter a CIDR block. For
       more information, see [Subnet CIDR blocks](subnet-sizing.md).
6. For **NAT gateways**, keep the default value, **None**.

7. For **VPC endpoints**, keep the default value, **S3**
**Gateway**. While there is no effect unless you access an S3 bucket, there is no
    cost to enable this VPC endpoint.

8. For **DNS options**, keep both options selected. As a result, your
    web servers will receive public DNS hostnames that correspond to their public IP
    addresses.

9. Choose **Create VPC**.

## 2\. Deploy your application

Ideally, you've already tested your web servers and database servers in a
development or test environment, and created the scripts or images that you'll
use to deploy your application in production.

You can use EC2 instances for your web servers. There are a variety of ways to deploy
EC2 instances. For example:

- [Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md)

- [AWS CloudFormation](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide.md)

- [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](../../../ecs/index.md)

To improve availability, you can use [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide.md) to deploy
servers in multiple Availability Zones and maintain the minimum server capacity that is
required by your application.

You can use [Elastic Load Balancing](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide.md) to distribute traffic evenly across
your servers. You can attach your load balancer to an Auto Scaling group.

You can use EC2 instances for your database servers, or one of our purpose-built database
types. For more information, see [Databases on AWS: How to choose](../../../documentation/latest/databases-on-aws-how-to-choose.md).

## 3\. Test your configuration

After you've finished deploying your application, you can test it. If your application
can't send or receive the traffic that you expect, you can use Reachability Analyzer to
help you troubleshoot. For example, Reachability Analyzer can identify configuration
issues with your route tables or security groups. For more information, see the [Reachability Analyzer Guide](../reachability.md).

## 4\. Clean up

When you are finished with this configuration, you can delete it. Before you can
delete the VPC, you must terminate your instances and delete the load balancer. For more
information, see [Delete your VPC](delete-vpc.md).
