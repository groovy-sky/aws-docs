# Generate the CloudFormation template using the console

After the first flow logs are delivered to your S3 bucket, you can integrate with Athena
by generating a CloudFormation template and using the template to create a stack.

###### Requirements

- The selected Region must support AWS Lambda and Amazon Athena.

- The Amazon S3 buckets must be in the selected Region.

- The log record format for the flow log must include the fields used by the
specific predefined queries that you'd like to run.

###### To generate the template using the console

1. Do one of the following:
   - Open the Amazon VPC console. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**
      and then select your VPC.

   - Open the Amazon VPC console. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**
      and then select your subnet.

   - Open the Amazon EC2 console. In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**
      and then select your network interface.
2. On the **Flow logs** tab, select a flow log that
    publishes to Amazon S3 and then choose **Actions**,
    **Generate Athena integration**.

3. Specify the partition load frequency. If you choose
    **None**, you must specify the partition start and end
    date, using dates that are in the past. If you choose
    **Daily**, **Weekly**, or
    **Monthly**, the partition start and end dates are
    optional. If you do not specify start and end dates, the CloudFormation
    template creates a Lambda function that loads new partitions on a recurring
    schedule.

4. Select or create an S3 bucket for the generated template, and an S3 bucket
    for the query results.

5. Choose **Generate Athena integration**.

6. (Optional) In the success message, choose the link to navigate to the bucket that you specified
    for the CloudFormation template, and customize the template.

7. In the success message, choose **Create CloudFormation**
**stack** to open the **Create Stack** wizard in
    the CloudFormation console. The URL for the generated CloudFormation template is
    specified in the **Template** section. Complete the wizard
    to create the resources that are specified in the template.

###### Resources created by the CloudFormation template

- An Athena database. The database name is
vpcflowlogsathenadatabase< _flow-logs-subscription-id_ >.

- An Athena workgroup. The workgroup name is
< _flow-log-subscription-id_ >< _partition-load-frequency_ >< _start-date_ >< _end-date_ >workgroup

- A partitioned Athena table that corresponds to your flow log records. The table
name is
< _flow-log-subscription-id_ >< _partition-load-frequency_ >< _start-date_ >< _end-date_ >.

- A set of Athena named queries. For more information, see [Predefined queries](flow-logs-run-athena-query.md#predefined-queries).

- A Lambda function that loads new partitions to the table on the specified
schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly).

- An IAM role that grants permission to run the Lambda functions.
