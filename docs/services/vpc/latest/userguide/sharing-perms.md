# Shared prefix list permissions

**Permissions for owners**

Owners are responsible for managing a shared prefix list and its entries.
Owners can view the IDs of the AWS resources that reference the prefix list.
However, they cannot add or remove references to a prefix list in AWS resources
that are owned by consumers.

Owners cannot delete a prefix list if the prefix list is referenced in a
resource that's owned by a consumer.

**Permissions for consumers**

Consumers can view the entries in a shared prefix list, and they can reference
a shared prefix list in their AWS resources. However, consumers can't modify,
restore, or delete a shared prefix list.
