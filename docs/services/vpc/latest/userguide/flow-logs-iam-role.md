# IAM role for publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs

The IAM role that's associated with your flow log must have sufficient
permissions to publish flow logs to the specified log group in CloudWatch Logs. The IAM role
must belong to your AWS account.

The IAM policy that's attached to your IAM role must include at least the
following permissions.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

Ensure that your role has the following trust policy, which allows the flow logs
service to assume the role.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

```

We recommend that you use the `aws:SourceAccount` and
`aws:SourceArn` condition keys to protect yourself against [the confused deputy problem](../../../iam/latest/userguide/confused-deputy.md).
For example, you could add the following condition block to the previous trust
policy. The source account is the owner of the flow log and the source ARN
is the flow log ARN. If you don't know the flow log ID, you can replace that
portion of the ARN with a wildcard (\*) and then update the policy after you
create the flow log.

```nohighlight

"Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
        "aws:SourceAccount": "account_id"
    },
    "ArnLike": {
        "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:region:account_id:vpc-flow-log/flow-log-id"
    }
}
```

## Create an IAM role for flow logs

You can update an existing role as described above. Alternatively, you can use
the following procedure to create a new role for use with flow logs. You'll specify
this role when you create the flow log.

###### To create an IAM role for flow logs

01. Open the IAM console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**.

03. Choose **Create policy**.

04. On the **Create policy** page, do the following:
    1. Choose **JSON**.

    2. Replace the contents of this window with the permissions policy
        at the start of this section.

    3. Choose **Next**.

    4. Enter a name for your policy and an optional description and
        tags, and then choose **Create policy**.
05. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

06. Choose **Create role**.

07. For **Trusted entity type**, choose **Custom**
    **trust policy**. For **Custom trust policy**,
     replace `"Principal": {},` with the following, then and choose
     **Next**.

    ```json

    "Principal": {
       "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"
    },
    ```

08. On the **Add permissions** page, select the checkbox
