# Delete an internet gateway

If you no longer need internet access for a VPC, you can detach the internet gateway
from the VPC and then delete it. You can't delete an internet gateway if it's still
attached to a VPC. You can't detach an internet gateway if the VPC has
resources with associated public IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses.
