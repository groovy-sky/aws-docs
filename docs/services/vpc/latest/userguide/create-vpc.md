# Create a VPC

Use the following procedures to create a virtual private cloud (VPC). A VPC must have
additional resources, such as subnets, route tables, and gateways, before you can create
AWS resources in the VPC.

- [Create a VPC only](#create-vpc-only)

- [Create a VPC using the AWS CLI](#create-vpc-cli)

For information about modifying a VPC, see [Add or remove a CIDR block from your VPC](add-ipv4-cidr.md).

## Create a VPC plus other VPC resources

Use the following procedure to create a VPC plus the additional VPC resources
that you need to run your application, such as subnets, route tables, internet
gateways, and NAT gateways. For example VPC configurations, see [VPC examples](vpc-examples-intro.md).

###### To create a VPC, subnets, and other VPC resources using the console

01. Open the Amazon VPC console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

02. On the VPC dashboard, choose **Create VPC**.

03. For **Resources to create**, choose **VPC and more**.

04. Keep **Name tag auto-generation** selected to create Name tags for
     the VPC resources or clear it to provide your own Name tags for the VPC resources.

05. For **IPv4 CIDR block**, enter an IPv4 address range for the VPC. A VPC must have an IPv4 address range.

06. (Optional) To support IPv6 traffic, choose **IPv6 CIDR block**,
     **Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block**.

07. Choose a **Tenancy** option. This option defines if EC2 instances that
     you launch into the VPC will run on hardware that's shared with other
     AWS accounts or on hardware that's dedicated for your use only. If you choose
     the tenancy of the VPC to be `Default`, EC2 instances launched into
     this VPC will use the tenancy attribute specified when you launch the instance.
     For more information, see [Launch an\
     instance using defined parameters](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) in the
     _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. If you choose the tenancy of the VPC
     to be `Dedicated`, the instances will always run as [Dedicated Instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-instance.md) on
     hardware that's dedicated for your use. If you're using AWS Outposts, your
     Outpost requires private connectivity; you must use `Default`
     tenancy.

08. For **Number of Availability Zones (AZs)**, we recommend that you
     provision subnets in at least two Availability Zones for a production
     environment. To choose the AZs for your subnets, expand **Customize**
    **AZs**. Otherwise, let AWS choose them for you.

09. To configure your subnets, choose values for **Number of public subnets**
     and **Number of private subnets**. To choose the IP address ranges
     for your subnets, expand **Customize subnets CIDR blocks**.
     Otherwise, let AWS choose them for you.

10. (Optional) If resources in a private subnet need access to the public internet over IPv4,
     for **NAT gateways**, choose the number of AZs in which to
     create NAT gateways. In production, we recommend that you deploy a NAT gateway
     in each AZ with resources that need access to the public internet. Note that
     there is a cost associated with NAT gateways. For more information, see [Pricing for NAT gateways](nat-gateway-pricing.md).

11. (Optional) If resources in a private subnet need access to the public internet over IPv6,
     for **Egress only internet gateway**, choose **Yes**.

12. (Optional) If you need to access Amazon S3 directly from your VPC, choose **VPC**
    **endpoints**, **S3 Gateway**. This creates a
     gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. For more information, see [Gateway\
     endpoints](../privatelink/gateway-endpoints.md) in the _AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

13. (Optional) For **DNS options**, both options for domain name resolution
     are enabled by default. If the default doesn't meet your needs, you can disable these options.

14. (Optional) To add a tag to your VPC, expand **Additional tags**,
     choose **Add new tag**, and enter a tag key and a tag value.

15. In the **Preview** pane, you can visualize the relationships between
     the VPC resources that you've configured. Solid lines represent relationships between resources.
     Dotted lines represent network traffic to NAT gateways, internet gateways, and gateway endpoints.
     After you create the VPC, you can visualize the resources in your VPC in this format at any time
     using the **Resource map** tab. For more information, see [Visualize the resources in your VPC](view-vpc-resource-map.md).

16. When you are finished configuring your VPC, choose **Create VPC**.

## Create a VPC only

Use the following procedure to create a VPC with no additional VPC resources
using the Amazon VPC console.

###### To create a VPC with no additional VPC resources using the console

01. Open the Amazon VPC console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

02. On the VPC dashboard, choose **Create VPC**.

03. For **Resources to create**, choose **VPC only**.

04. (Optional) For **Name tag**, enter a name for your
     VPC. Doing so creates a tag with a key of `Name` and the
     value that you specify.

05. For **IPv4 CIDR block**, do one of the following:
    - Choose **IPv4 CIDR manual input** and enter
       an IPv4 address range for your VPC.

    - Choose **IPAM-allocated IPv4 CIDR block**, select your Amazon VPC IP
       Address Manager (IPAM) IPv4 address pool and a netmask. The size of the
       CIDR block is limited by the allocation rules on the IPAM pool. IPAM is
       a VPC feature that makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor
       IP addresses for your AWS workloads. For more information, see the [Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide](../ipam/what-it-is-ipam.md).

      If you are using IPAM to manage your IP addresses, we recommend that you choose this
       option. Otherwise, the CIDR block that you specify for your VPC might
       overlap with an IPAM CIDR allocation.
06. (Optional) To create a dual stack VPC, specify an IPv6 address range
     for your VPC. For **IPv6 CIDR block**, do one of the
     following:

- Choose **IPAM-allocated IPv6 CIDR block** if you are using Amazon VPC IP Address Manager and
you want to provision a IPv6 CIDR from an IPAM pool. If you use the
IPAM-allocated IPv6 CIDR block to provision IPv6 CIDRs to VPCs, you get
the benefit of contiguous IPv6 CIDRs for VPC creation.
Contiguously-allocated CIDRs are CIDRs that are allocated sequentially.
They enable you to simplify your security and networking rules; the IPv6
CIDRs can be aggregated in a single entry across networking and security
constructs like access control lists, route tables, security groups, and
firewalls.

You have two options for provisioning an IP address range to the VPC
under **CIDR block**:

- **Netmask length**: Choose this option to select a netmask length for
the CIDR. Do one of the following:

- If there is a default netmask length selected for the IPAM pool, you can choose
**Default to IPAM netmask length** to use
the default netmask length set for the IPAM pool by the IPAM
administrator. For more information about the optional default
netmask length allocation rule, see [Create a\
Regional IPv6 pool](../ipam/create-ipv6-reg-pool.md) in the
_Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide_.

- If there is no default netmask length selected for the IPAM pool, choose a netmask length
that's more specific than the netmask length of the IPAM
pool CIDR. For example, if the IPAM pool CIDR is /50,
you can choose a netmask length between
**/52** to **/60**
for the VPC. Possible netmask lengths are between
**/44** and
**/60** in increments of /4.

- **Select a CIDR**: Choose this option to manually enter an IPv6 address. You
can only choose a netmask length that's more specific than the
netmask length of the IPAM pool CIDR. For example, if the IPAM
pool CIDR is /50, you can choose a netmask length between
**/52** to **/60** for the
VPC. Possible IPv6 netmask lengths are between
**/44** and **/60** in
increments of /4.

- Choose **Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block** to
request an IPv6 CIDR block from an Amazon pool of IPv6 addresses.
For **Network Border Group**, select the group
from which AWS advertises IP addresses. Amazon provides a fixed
IPv6 CIDR block size of **/56**.

- Choose **IPv6 CIDR owned by me** to provision an IPv6 CIDR that you have
already brought to AWS. For more information about bringing your own
IP address ranges to AWS, see [Bring your own IP addresses\
(BYOIP)](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-byoip.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. You can
provision an IP address range for the VPC using the following options
for **CIDR block**:

- **No preference**: Choose this option to use netmask length of
**/56**.

- **Select a CIDR**: Choose this option to manually enter an IPv6
address and choose a netmask length that's more specific than
the size of BYOIP CIDR. For example, if the BYOIP pool CIDR is
/50, you can choose a netmask length between
**/52** to **/60** for the
VPC. Possible IPv6 netmask lengths are between
**/44** and **/60** in
increments of /4.

07. (Optional) Choose a **Tenancy** option. This option defines if EC2 instances that
     you launch into the VPC will run on hardware that's shared with other
     AWS accounts or on hardware that's dedicated for your use only. If you choose
     the tenancy of the VPC to be `Default`, EC2 instances launched
     into this VPC will use the tenancy attribute specified when you launch the
     instance -- For more information, see [Launch an\
     instance using defined parameters](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) in the
     _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. If you choose the tenancy of the VPC
     to be `Dedicated`, the instances will always run as [Dedicated Instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-instance.md) on
     hardware that's dedicated for your use. If you're using AWS Outposts, your
     Outpost requires private connectivity; you must use `Default`
     tenancy.

08. (Optional) To add a tag to your VPC, choose **Add new tag**
     and enter a tag key and a tag value.

09. Choose **Create VPC**.

10. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets. For more information, see
     [Create a subnet](create-subnets.md).

## Create a VPC using the AWS CLI

The following procedure contains example AWS CLI commands to create a VPC plus the additional
VPC resources needed to run an application. If you run all of the commands in this
procedure, you'll create a VPC, a public subnet, a private subnet, a route table for
each subnet, an internet gateway, an egress-only internet gateway, and a public NAT
gateway. If you do not need all of these resources, you can use only the example
commands that you need.

###### Prerequisites

Before you begin, install and configure the AWS CLI. When you configure the AWS CLI,
you are prompted for AWS credentials. The examples in this procedure assume that
you also configured a default Region. Otherwise, add the `--region` option
to each command. For more information, see
[Installing or updating the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md) and
[Configuring the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.md).

###### Tagging

You can add tags to a resource after you create it by using the [create-tags](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-tags.md) command.
Alternatively, you can add the `--tag-specification` option to the
creation command for the resource as follows.

```nohighlight

--tag-specifications ResourceType=vpc,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=my-project}]
```

###### To create a VPC plus VPC resources by using the AWS CLI

1. Use the following [create-vpc](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc.md)
    command to create a VPC with the specified IPv4 CIDR block.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/24 --query Vpc.VpcId --output text
```

Alternatively, to create a dual stack VPC, add the `--amazon-provided-ipv6-cidr-block`
    option to add an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block, as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/24 --amazon-provided-ipv6-cidr-block --query Vpc.VpcId --output text
```

These commands return the ID of the new VPC. The following is an example.

```nohighlight

vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3
```

2. \[Dual stack VPC\] Get the IPv6 CIDR block that's associated with your VPC by using the
    following [describe-vpcs](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs.md)
    command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-vpcs --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --query Vpcs[].Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet[].Ipv6CidrBlock --output text
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

2600:1f13:cfe:3600::/56
```

3. Create one or more subnets, depending on your use case. In production, we recommend that
    you launch resources in at least two Availability Zones. Use one of the
    following commands to create each subnet.

   - IPv4-only subnet – To create a subnet with a specific IPv4 CIDR block, use the following
      [create-subnet](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-subnet.md) command.

     ```nohighlight

     aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/20 --availability-zone us-east-2a --query Subnet.SubnetId --output text
     ```

   - Dual stack subnet – If you created a dual stack VPC, you can use the
      `--ipv6-cidr-block` option to create a dual stack subnet, as shown
      in the following command.

     ```nohighlight

     aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/20 --ipv6-cidr-block 2600:1f13:cfe:3600::/64 --availability-zone us-east-2a --query Subnet.SubnetId --output text
     ```

   - IPv6-only subnet – If you created a dual stack VPC,
      you can use the `--ipv6-native` option to create an IPv6-only
      subnet, as shown in the following command.

     ```nohighlight

     aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --ipv6-native --ipv6-cidr-block 2600:1f13:cfe:3600::/64 --availability-zone us-east-2a --query Subnet.SubnetId --output text
     ```

These commands return the ID of the new subnet. The following is an example.

```nohighlight

subnet-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3
```

4. If you need a public subnet for your web servers, or for a NAT gateway, do the following:
1. Create an internet gateway by using the following [create-internet-gateway](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-internet-gateway.md) command. The command returns the ID
       of the new internet gateway.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-internet-gateway --query InternetGateway.InternetGatewayId --output text
      ```

2. Attach the internet gateway to your VPC by using the following [attach-internet-gateway](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/attach-internet-gateway.md) command. Use the internet gateway
       ID returned from the previous step.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --internet-gateway-id igw-id
      ```

3. Create a custom route table for your public subnet by using the following [create-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route-table.md) command. The command returns the ID of
       the new route table.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --query RouteTable.RouteTableId --output text
      ```

4. Create a route in the route table that sends all IPv4 traffic to the internet gateway by
       using the following [create-route](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route.md) command. Use the ID of the route table for the
       public subnet.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-id-public --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id igw-id
      ```

5. Associate the route table with the public subnet by using the following [associate-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-route-table.md) command. Use the ID of the route
       table for the public subnet and the ID of the public subnet.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id rtb-id-public --subnet-id subnet-id-public-subnet
      ```
5. \[IPv6\] You can add an egress-only internet gateway so that instances in a private subnet
    can access the internet over IPv6 (for example, to get software updates), but
    hosts on the internet can't access your instances.
1. Create an egress-only internet gateway by using the following [create-egress-only-internet-gateway](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-egress-only-internet-gateway.md) command. The command
       returns the ID of the new internet gateway.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-egress-only-internet-gateway --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --query EgressOnlyInternetGateway.EgressOnlyInternetGatewayId --output text
      ```

2. Create a custom route table for your private subnet by using the following [create-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route-table.md) command. The command returns the ID of
       the new route table.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --query RouteTable.RouteTableId --output text
      ```

3. Create a route in the route table for the private subnet that sends all IPv6 traffic to
       the egress-only internet gateway by using the following [create-route](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route.md)
       command. Use the ID of the route table returned in the previous
       step.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-id-private --destination-cidr-block ::/0 --egress-only-internet-gateway eigw-id
      ```

4. Associate the route table with the private subnet by using the following [associate-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-route-table.md) command.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id rtb-id-private --subnet-id subnet-id-private-subnet
      ```
6. If you need a NAT gateway for your resources in a private subnet, do the following:
1. Create an elastic IP address for the NAT gateway by using the following [allocate-address](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-address.md) command.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc --query AllocationId --output text
      ```

2. Create the NAT gateway in the public subnet by using the following [create-nat-gateway](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-nat-gateway.md) command. Use the allocation ID returned
       from the previous step.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-nat-gateway --subnet-id subnet-id-public-subnet --allocation-id eipalloc-id
      ```

3. (Optional) If you already created a route table for the private subnet in step 5, skip
       this step. Otherwise, use the following [create-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route-table.md) command to create a route table for your
       private subnet. The command returns the ID of the new route
       table.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id vpc-1a2b3c4d5e6f1a2b3 --query RouteTable.RouteTableId --output text
      ```

4. Create a route in the route table for the private subnet that sends all IPv4 traffic to
       the NAT gateway by using the following [create-route](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route.md)
       command. Use the ID of the route table for the private subnet, which you
       created either in this step or in step 5.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id rtb-id-private --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id nat-id
      ```

5. (Optional) If you already associated a route table with the private subnet in step 5,
       skip this step. Otherwise, use the following [associate-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-route-table.md) command to associate the route table
       with the private subnet. Use the ID of the route table for the private
       subnet, which you created either in this step or in step 5.

      ```nohighlight

      aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id rtb-id-private --subnet-id subnet-id-private-subnet
      ```
