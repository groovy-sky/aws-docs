# Publish flow logs to Amazon S3

Flow logs can publish flow log data to Amazon S3. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a
highly scalable and durable object storage service. It is designed to store and retrieve
any amount of data, from anywhere on the web. S3 offers industry-leading durability and
availability, with built-in features for data versioning, encryption, and access
control.

When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log data is
published to an existing Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Flow log records for all of the
monitored network interfaces are published to a series of log file objects that are stored
in the bucket. If the flow log captures data for a VPC, the flow log publishes flow log
records for all of the network interfaces in the selected VPC.

To create an Amazon S3 bucket for use with flow logs, see [Create a bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

For more information about how to streamline VPC flow log ingestion, flow log
processing, and flow log visualization, see [Centralized Logging with OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/centralized-logging-with-opensearch) in the
AWS Solutions Library.
