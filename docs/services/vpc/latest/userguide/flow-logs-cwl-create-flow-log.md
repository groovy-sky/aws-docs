# Create a flow log that publishes to CloudWatch Logs

You can create flow logs for your VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces. If you
perform these steps as a user using a particular IAM role, ensure that the role has permissions to use the
`iam:PassRole` action.

###### Prerequisite

Verify that the IAM principal that you are using to make the request has permissions
to call the `iam:PassRole` action.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/flow-log-role-name"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### To create a flow log using the console

01. Do one of the following:
    - Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).
       In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**.
       Select the checkbox for the network interface.

    - Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).
       In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**.
       Select the checkbox for the VPC.

    - Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).
       In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.
       Select the checkbox for the subnet.
02. Choose **Actions**, **Create flow log**.

03. For **Filter**, specify the type of traffic to log.
     Choose **All** to log accepted and rejected traffic,
     **Reject** to log only rejected traffic, or
     **Accept** to log only accepted traffic.

04. For **Maximum aggregation interval**, choose the maximum
     period of time during which a flow is captured and aggregated into one flow
     log record.

05. For **Destination**, choose **Send to CloudWatch**
    **Logs**.

06. For **Destination log group**, choose the name of an
     existing log group or enter the name of a new log group. If you enter a
     name, we create the log group when there is traffic to log.

07. For **Service access**, choose an existing [IAM service\
     role](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access.md) that has permissions to publish logs to CloudWatch Logs or choose to create a new service role.

08. For **Log record format**, select the format for the
     flow log record.

- To use the default format, choose **AWS**
**default format**.

- To use a custom format, choose **Custom format**
and then select fields from **Log format**.

09. For **Additional metadata**, select if you want to include metadata from Amazon ECS in the log format.

10. (Optional) Choose **Add new tag** to apply tags to the flow
     log.

11. Choose **Create flow log**.

###### To create a flow log using the command line

Use one of the following commands.

- [create-flow-logs](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-flow-logs.md)
(AWS CLI)

- [New-EC2FlowLog](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2flowlog.md)
(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

The following AWS CLI example creates a flow log that captures all accepted traffic for
the specified subnet. The flow logs are delivered to the specified log group. The
`--deliver-logs-permission-arn` parameter specifies the IAM role
required to publish to CloudWatch Logs.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type Subnet --resource-ids subnet-1a2b3c4d --traffic-type ACCEPT --log-group-name my-flow-logs --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/publishFlowLogs
```
