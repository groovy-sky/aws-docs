# Control traffic entering your VPC using a gateway route table

To control traffic entering your VPC with a gateway route table, you can associate or disassociate an internet gateway or a virtual private gateway with a route
table. For more information, see [Gateway route tables](gateway-route-tables.md).

###### To associate or disassociate a gateway with a route table using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Route tables**, and then
    select the route table.

3. From the **Edge associations** tab, choose **Edit**
**edge associations**.

4. Select or deselect the checkbox for the gateway.

5. Choose **Save changes**.

###### To associate a gateway with a route table using the AWS CLI

Use the [associate-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-route-table.md) command. The following example associates
the specified route table with the specified internet gateway.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 associate-route-table
    --route-table-id rtb-01234567890123456 \
    --gateway-id igw-11aa22bb33cc44dd1
```

###### To disassociate a gateway from a route table using the AWS CLI

Use the [disassociate-route-table](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/disassociate-route-table.md) command. Specify the ID of the association
between the route table and the gateway.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 disassociate-route-table \
    --association-id rtbassoc-0abcdef1234567890
```
