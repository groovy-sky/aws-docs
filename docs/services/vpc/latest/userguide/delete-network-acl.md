# Delete a network ACL for your VPC

When you are finished with a network ACL, you can delete it. You can't delete
a network ACL if there are subnets associated with it. You can't delete the default
network ACL.

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**. The
    **Associated with** column indicates the number of subnets
    associated with each network ACL. This column is `-` if there are
    no associated subnets.

3. Select the network ACL.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Edit subnet associations**.

5. Remove the subnet associations.

6. Choose **Save changes**.
