# Manage subnet route tables

Use the following procedures to manage VPC routing using route tables.

###### Tasks

- [Determine the route table for a subnet](#SubnetRouteTables)

- [Determine the explicit associations](#Route_Which_Associations)

- [Add, modify, and remove routes](#AddRemoveRoutes)

- [Enable or disable route propagation](#EnableDisableRouteProp)

- [Change the route table for a subnet](#ChangeRouteTable)

## Determine the route table for a subnet

You can determine which route table a subnet is associated with by looking at the subnet
details in the Amazon VPC console.

###### To determine the route table for a subnet using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.

3. Select the subnet.

4. Choose the **Route table** tab to view information about the
    route table and its routes. To determine whether the association is to the main
    route table, and if that association is explicit, see [Determine the explicit associations](#Route_Which_Associations).

## Determine the explicit associations

You can determine how many and which subnets or gateways are explicitly associated with
a route table.

The main route table can have explicit and implicit subnet associations. Custom route
tables have only explicit associations.

Subnets that aren't explicitly associated with any route table have an implicit
association with the main route table. You can explicitly associate a subnet with
the main route table. For an example of why you might do that, see [Replace the main route table](route-replacing-main-table.md).

###### To determine which subnets are explicitly associated using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Route tables**.

3. Check the **Explicit subnet association** column to determine the explicitly
    associated subnets and the **Main** column to determine
    whether this is the main route table.

4. Select the route table and choose the **Subnet associations**
    tab.

5. The subnets under **Explicit subnet associations** are explicitly
    associated with the route table. The subnets under **Subnets without**
**explicit associations** belong to the same VPC as the route
    table, but are not associated with any route table, so they are implicitly
    associated with the main route table for the VPC.

###### To determine which gateways are explicitly associated using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Route tables**.

3. Select the route table and choose the **Edge**
**associations** tab.

###### To describe one or more route tables and view its associations using the AWS CLI

Use the [describe-route-tables](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-route-tables.md) command.

## Add, modify, and remove routes

You can add, modify, and delete routes for your route tables.

For more information about working with static routes for a Site-to-Site VPN connection, see
[Editing Static Routes for a Site-to-Site VPN Connection](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/setupvpnconnections.md#vpn-edit-static-routes) in the
_AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.

###### Considerations

- You can only modify routes that you've added.

- When you modify or delete a route, existing connections that use these routes
are affected. Connections that use the other routes are not affected.

- There is a quota on the number of routes that you can add per route table. For more
information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](amazon-vpc-limits.md).

###### To update the routes for a route table using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Route tables**, and select the
    route table.

3. Choose **Actions**, **Edit routes**.

4. To add a route, choose **Add route**. For
    **Destination** enter an IP address range, a single IP
    address, or the ID of a prefix list. For **Target**, select
    the resource type and then enter the ID of the resource.

5. To modify a route, enter the new destination CIDR block or prefix list ID and choose
    a target.

6. To delete a route, choose **Remove**.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

###### To update the routes for a route table using the AWS CLI

If you add a route using a command line tool or the API, the destination CIDR
block is automatically modified to its canonical form. For example, if you
specify `100.68.0.18/18` for the CIDR block, we create a route with a
destination CIDR block of `100.68.0.0/18`.

- [create-route](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-route.md)

- [replace-route](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/replace-route.md)

- [delete-route](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/delete-route.md)

## Enable or disable route propagation

Route propagation allows a virtual private gateway to automatically propagate routes to
your route tables. This means that you don't need to manually add or remove VPN
routes.

To complete this process, you must have a virtual private gateway.

For more information, see [Site-to-Site VPN routing\
options](../../../vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpnroutingtypes.md) in the _Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_.

###### To enable or disable route propagation using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Route tables**, and then select the route
    table.

3. Choose **Actions**, **Edit route propagation**.

4. Select or clear the **Enable** check box next to the virtual private gateway.

5. Choose **Save**.

###### To enable or disable route propagation using the AWS CLI

- [enable-vgw-route-propagation](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/enable-vgw-route-propagation.md)

- [disable-vgw-route-propagation](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/disable-vgw-route-propagation.md)

## Change the route table for a subnet

You can change the route table association for a subnet.

When you change the route table, your existing connections in the subnet are
dropped unless the new route table contains a route for the same traffic to the same
target.

###### To change a subnet route table association using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**, and then select the
    subnet.

3. From the **Route table** tab, choose **Edit route table**
**association**.

4. For **Route table ID**, select the new route table.

5. Choose **Save**.

###### To change the route table associated with a subnet using the AWS CLI

Use the [replace-route-table-association](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/replace-route-table-association.md) command.
