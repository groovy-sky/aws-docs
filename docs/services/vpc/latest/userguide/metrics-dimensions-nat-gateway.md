# NAT gateway metrics and dimensions

The following metrics are available for your NAT gateways. The description column
includes a description of each metrics as well as the [units](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-concepts.md#Unit)
and [statistics](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/statistics-definitions.md).

MetricDescription`ActiveConnectionCount`

The total number of concurrent active TCP connections through the
NAT gateway.

A value of zero indicates that there are no active connections through the NAT
gateway.

Units: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Max`.

`BytesInFromDestination`

The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from the
destination.

If the value for `BytesOutToSource` is less than
the value for `BytesInFromDestination`, there might be
data loss during NAT gateway processing, or traffic being actively
blocked by the NAT gateway.

Units: Bytes

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`BytesInFromSource`

The number of bytes received by the NAT gateway from clients in
your VPC.

If the value for `BytesOutToDestination` is less
than the value for `BytesInFromSource`, there might be
data loss during NAT gateway processing.

Units: Bytes

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`BytesOutToDestination`

The number of bytes sent out through the NAT gateway to the
destination.

A value greater than zero indicates that there is traffic
going to the internet from clients that are behind the NAT gateway.
If the value for `BytesOutToDestination` is less than the
value for `BytesInFromSource`, there might be data loss
during NAT gateway processing.

Unit: Bytes

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`BytesOutToSource`

The number of bytes sent through the NAT gateway to the clients in
your VPC.

A value greater than zero indicates that there is traffic
coming from the internet to clients that are behind the NAT gateway.
If the value for `BytesOutToSource` is less than the
value for `BytesInFromDestination`, there might be data
loss during NAT gateway processing, or traffic being actively
blocked by the NAT gateway.

Units: Bytes

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`ConnectionAttemptCount`

The number of connection attempts made through the NAT
gateway. This includes only the initial SYN. In some cases,
`ConnectionAttemptCount` may be lower than
`ConnectionEstablishedCount` due to SYN
retransmission.

If the value for `ConnectionEstablishedCount` is less than the value for
`ConnectionAttemptCount`, this indicates that clients
behind the NAT gateway attempted to establish new connections for
which there was no response.

Unit: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`ConnectionEstablishedCount`

The number of connections established through the NAT gateway.
This includes SYN and SYN retransmissions.

If the value for `ConnectionEstablishedCount` is less than the value for
`ConnectionAttemptCount`, this indicates that clients
behind the NAT gateway attempted to establish new connections for
which there was no response.

Unit: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`ErrorPortAllocation`

The number of times the NAT gateway could not allocate a source
port.

A value greater than zero indicates that too many concurrent connections are open
through the NAT gateway.

Units: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`IdleTimeoutCount`

The number of connections that transitioned from the active state to the idle state. An active connection transitions to idle if it was not closed gracefully and there was no activity for the last 350 seconds.

A value greater than zero indicates that there are connections
that have been moved to an idle state. If the value for
`IdleTimeoutCount` increases, it might indicate that
clients behind the NAT gateway are re-using stale connections.

Unit: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`PacketsDropCount`

The number of packets dropped by the NAT gateway.

To calculate the number of dropped packets as a percentage of the overall packet traffic, use this formula: `PacketsDropCount/(PacketsInFromSource+PacketsInFromDestination)*100`. If this value exceeds 0.01 percent of the total traffic on the NAT gateway, there may be an issue with Amazon VPC service. Use the [AWS service health\
dashboard](http://status.aws.amazon.com/) to identify any issues with the service that may be causing NAT gateways to drop packets.

Units: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`PacketsInFromDestination`

The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from the
destination.

If the value for `PacketsOutToSource` is less than
the value for `PacketsInFromDestination`, there might be
data loss during NAT gateway processing, or traffic being actively
blocked by the NAT gateway.

Unit: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`PacketsInFromSource`

The number of packets received by the NAT gateway from clients in
your VPC.

If the value for `PacketsOutToDestination` is less
than the value for `PacketsInFromSource`, there might be
data loss during NAT gateway processing.

Unit: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`PacketsOutToDestination`

The number of packets sent out through the NAT gateway to the
destination.

A value greater than zero indicates that there is traffic
going to the internet from clients that are behind the NAT gateway.
If the value for `PacketsOutToDestination` is less than
the value for `PacketsInFromSource`, there might be data
loss during NAT gateway processing.

Unit: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`PacketsOutToSource`

The number of packets sent through the NAT gateway to the clients
in your VPC.

A value greater than zero indicates that there is traffic
coming from the internet to clients that are behind the NAT gateway.
If the value for `PacketsOutToSource` is less than the
value for `PacketsInFromDestination`, there might be data
loss during NAT gateway processing, or traffic being actively
blocked by the NAT gateway.

Unit: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Sum`.

`PeakBytesPerSecond`

This metric reports the highest 10-second bytes per second average in a given minute.

Units: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Maximum`.

`PeakPacketsPerSecond`

This metric calculates the average packet rate (packets processed per second) every 10 seconds for 60 seconds and then reports the maximum of the six rates (the highest average packet rate).

Units: Count

Statistics: The most useful statistic is `Maximum`.

To filter the metric data, use the following dimension.

DimensionDescription`NatGatewayId`Filter the metric data by the NAT gateway ID.
