# Compare IPv4 and IPv6

The following table summarizes the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 in Amazon EC2 and
Amazon VPC.

For a list of AWS services that support dual-stack configuration (IPv4 and IPv6)
and IPv6-only configurations, see [Services that support IPv6](aws-ipv6-support.md#ipv6-service-support).

CharacteristicIPv4IPv6VPC sizeUp to 5 CIDRs from /16 to /28. This [quota](amazon-vpc-limits.md#vpc-limits-vpcs-subnets) is adjustable.Up to 5 CIDRs from /44 to /60 in increments of /4. This [quota](amazon-vpc-limits.md#vpc-limits-vpcs-subnets) is adjustable.Subnet sizeFrom /16 to /28.From /44 to /64 in increments of /4.Address selectionYou can choose the IPv4 CIDR block for your VPC or you can allocate a
CIDR block from Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM). For more information, see [What is IPAM?](../ipam/what-it-is-ipam.md) in the
_Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide_.
You can bring your own IPv6 CIDR block to AWS for your VPC, choose an
Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block, or you can allocate a CIDR block from Amazon VPC IP
Address Manager (IPAM). For more information, see [What is IPAM?](../ipam/what-it-is-ipam.md) in the
_Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide_.
Internet accessRequires an [internet gateway](vpc-internet-gateway.md).Requires an internet gateway. Supports outbound-only communication using an [egress-only internet gateway](egress-only-internet-gateway.md).Elastic IP addressesSupported. Gives an EC2 instance a permanent, static public IPv4 address.Not supported. EIPs keep the public IPv4 address of an instance static on
instance restart. IPv6 addresses are static by default.NAT gateways

Supported. Instances in private subnets can connect to the internet using a
public NAT gateway or to resources in other VPCs using a private NAT gateway.

Supported. You can use a NAT gateway with NAT64 to enable instances in IPv6-only
subnets to communicate with IPv4-only resources within VPCs, between VPCs, in your
on-premises networks, or over the internet.DNS namesInstances receive Amazon-provided IPBN or RBN-based DNS names. The DNS name
resolves to the DNS records selected for the instance.Instance receive Amazon-provided IPBN or RBN-based DNS names. The DNS name
resolves to the DNS records selected for the instance.
