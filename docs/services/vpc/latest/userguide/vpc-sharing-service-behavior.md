†
You can connect to all AWS services that support PrivateLink using a VPC endpoint in a shared VPC. For a list of services that support PrivateLink, see [AWS services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink](../privatelink/aws-services-privatelink-support.md) in the _AWS PrivateLink Guide_.

This list is intended to include all services that support launching resources in shared VPC subnets.
Despite our best efforts, there might be services that support launching resources in shared VPC subnets
but are not listed here. We encourage you to submit documentation feedback if you have questions.
