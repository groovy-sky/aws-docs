# Control subnet traffic with network access control lists

A _network access control list (ACL)_ allows or denies specific inbound
or outbound traffic at the subnet level. You can use the default network ACL for your VPC, or
you can create a custom network ACL for your VPC with rules that are similar to the rules for
your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

There is no additional charge for using network ACLs.

The following diagram shows a VPC with two subnets. Each subnet has a network ACL. When
traffic enters the VPC (for example, from a peered VPC, VPN connection, or the internet), the
router sends the traffic to its destination. Network ACL A determines which traffic destined for
subnet 1 is allowed to enter subnet 1, and which traffic destined for a location outside subnet
1 is allowed to leave subnet 1. Similarly, network ACL B determines which traffic is allowed to
enter and leave subnet 2.

## Network ACL basics

The following are the basic things to know about network ACLs before you begin.

###### Network ACL associations

- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly
associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the
[default network ACL](default-network-acl.md).

- You can create a [custom network ACL](custom-network-acl.md) and
associate it with a subnet to allow or deny specific inbound or outbound traffic at
the subnet level.

- You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can be
associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with a
subnet, the previous association is removed.

###### Network ACL rules

- A network ACL has inbound rules and outbound rules. There are [quotas (or limits) to the number of rules you can have per network ACL](amazon-vpc-limits.md#vpc-limits-nacls). Each
rule can either allow or deny traffic. Each rule has a number from 1 to 32766. We evaluate
the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, when deciding whether allow or
deny traffic. If the traffic matches a rule, the rule is applied and we do not evaluate
any additional rules. We recommend that you start by creating rules in increments (for
example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules later on, if
needed.

- We evaluate the network ACL rules when traffic enters and leaves the subnet, not as it
is routed within a subnet.

- NACLs are _stateless_, which means that information
about previously sent or received traffic is not saved. If, for example, you create a NACL
rule to allow specific inbound traffic to a subnet, responses to that traffic are not
automatically allowed. This is in contrast to how security groups work. Security groups
are _stateful_, which means that information about
previously sent or received traffic is saved. If, for example, a security group allows
inbound traffic to an EC2 instance, responses are automatically allowed regardless of
outbound security group rules.

###### Limitations

- There are quotas (also known as limits) for network ACLs. For more information, see
[Network ACLs](amazon-vpc-limits.md#vpc-limits-nacls).

- Network ACLs can't block DNS requests to or from the Route 53 Resolver (also known as the VPC+2
IP address or AmazonProvidedDNS). To filter DNS requests through the Route 53 Resolver, you can
enable [Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/resolver-dns-firewall.md).

- Network ACLs can't block traffic to the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). To manage
access to IMDS, see [Configure the instance metadata options](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- Network ACLs do not filter traffic destined to and from the following:

- Amazon Domain Name Services (DNS)

- Amazon Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

- Amazon EC2 instance metadata

- Amazon ECS task metadata endpoints

- License activation for Windows instances

- Amazon Time Sync Service

- Reserved IP addresses used by the default VPC router
