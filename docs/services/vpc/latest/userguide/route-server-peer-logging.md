# Route server peer logging

Use VPC Route Server peer logging when you need to:

- Monitor BGP and BFD session health

- Troubleshoot connection issues

- Review historical session changes

- Track network status

## Pricing

- **CloudWatch**: Data ingestion and archival
charges for vended logs apply when you publish route server peer logs to
CloudWatch Logs.

- **S3**: Data ingestion and archival charges
for vended logs apply when you publish route server peer logs to Amazon
S3.

- **Data Firehose**: Standard ingestion and
delivery charges apply.

Vended logs are logs from specific AWS services that are available at
volume tiered pricing and delivered to CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon
Data Firehose. For more information, open [Amazon CloudWatch\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing), select **Logs** and find
**Vended Logs**.

## Example log format

```nohighlight

{
    "resource_arn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:route-server-peer/rsp-1234567890abcdef0",
    "event_timestamp": 1746643505367,
    "type": "RouteStatus",
    "status": "ADVERTISED",
    "message": {
        "prefix": "10.24.34.0/32",
        "asPath": "65000",
        "med": 100,
        "nextHopIp": "10.24.34.1"
    }
}

{
    "resource_arn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:route-server-peer/rsp-1234567890abcdef0",
    "event_timestamp": 1746643490000,
    "type": "BGPStatus",
    "status": "UP",
    "message": null
}
```

Where:

- The `resource_arn` is the ARN for the route server peer.

- The `event_timestamp` is the timestamp of the event.

- The `type` of log events we produce ( `RouteStatus`, `BGPStatus`, `BFDStatus`).

- The `status` field is the status update.

- For `RouteStatus` type messages

- `ADVERTISED` (route was advertised by the
peer)

- `UPDATED` (existing route was updated by the peer)

- `WITHDRAWN` (route was withdrawn by peer)

- For `BFDStatus` and `BGPStatus` updates

- `UP`, `DOWN`.

- The `message` field is currently only used for route attributes for the RouteStatus message type but may be populated with relevant information for any type.

AWS Management Console

To create route server peer logs:

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, under **Virtual private cloud**, choose **Route servers**.

3. On the **Route servers** page, choose **Route server peers**.

4. Choose the **Log delivery** tab.

5. Choose **Add log delivery**.

6. Choose a destination and configure the settings:

- Amazon CloudWatch Logs

- **Log type**: Types of logs to deliver. The only supported log
type is EVENT\_LOGS.

- **Destination log group**: The CloudWatch log group where logs will be sent. You can pick an existing log group or create a new one (example: /aws/vpc/route-server-peers).

- **Field selection**: Data fields to include in your
logs.

- **Output format**: How logs
are formatted:

- JSON: Structured format for computer processing

- Text: Plain text format

- **Field delimiter**: When using Text format, this is the character that separates fields (example: comma, tab, space).

- Cross account - Sending logs to different AWS accounts

- **Log type**: Types of logs to deliver. The only supported log
type is EVENT\_LOGS.

- **Delivery destination ARN**: The Amazon Resource Name of the S3 bucket in another AWS account where logs will be sent.

- **Field selection**: Data fields to include in your
