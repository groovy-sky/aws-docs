# Search flow log records

You can search your flow log records that are published to CloudWatch Logs using the
CloudWatch Logs console. You can use [metric filters](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/logs/filterandpatternsyntax.md) to filter flow log records. Flow log records are space
delimited.

###### To search flow log records using the CloudWatch Logs console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, **Log**
**groups**.

3. Select the log group that contains your flow log, and then select the
    log stream, if you know the network interface that you are searching for.
    Alternatively, choose **Search log group**. This might take some
    time if there are many network interfaces in your log group, or depending on
    the time range that you select.

4. Under **Filter events**, enter the string below. This
    assumes that the flow log record uses the [default format](flow-log-records.md#flow-logs-default).

```nohighlight

[version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus]
```

5. Modify the filter as needed by specifying values for the fields. The
    following examples filter by specific source IP addresses.

```nohighlight

[version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr = 10.0.0.1, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus]
[version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr = 10.0.2.*, dstaddr, srcport, dstport, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus]
```

The following examples filter by destination port, the number of bytes,
    and whether the traffic was rejected.

```nohighlight

[version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport = 80 || dstport = 8080, protocol, packets, bytes, start, end, action, logstatus]
[version, accountid, interfaceid, srcaddr, dstaddr, srcport, dstport = 80 || dstport = 8080, protocol, packets, bytes >= 400, start, end, action = REJECT, logstatus]
```
