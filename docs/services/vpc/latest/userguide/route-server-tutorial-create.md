# Step 2: Create a route server

Complete the steps in this section to create a route server.

The route server component updates your VPC and internet gateway route tables with the IPv4 or IPv6 routes in your Forwarding Information Base (FIB). The route server represents a single FIB and Routing Information Base (RIB).

AWS Management Console

###### To create a route server

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, under **Virtual private cloud**, choose **Route**
**servers**.

3. On the **Route servers** page, choose **Create route**
**server**.

4. On the **Create route server** page, configure the following settings:

- For **Name**, enter a name for your route server (e.g.,
"my-route-server-01"). The name must be 255
characters or less in length.

- For **Amazon Side**
**ASN**, enter a BGP ASN value. This value must be in
the range of 1-4294967295. We recommend using a
private ASN in the 64512–65534 (16-bit ASN) or
4200000000–4294967294 (32-bit ASN) range.

- For **Persist**
**routes**, choose either **Enable** or **Disable**. This option determines whether routes should
be maintained after all BGP sessions are
terminated:

- If enabled: Routes will be preserved in the
route server's routing database even if all BGP
sessions end

- If disabled: Routes will be removed from the
routing database when all BGP sessions end

- If you enabled persist routes, for **Persist**
**duration**, enter a value between 1-5
minutes. This duration specifies how long the route
server will wait after BGP is re-established to
unpersist the routes. For example, if you set it to 1
minute, your device has 1 minute after re-establishing
BGP to relearn and advertise its routes before the route
server resumes normal functionality. While 1 minute is
typically sufficient, you can set up to 5 minutes if
your BGP network needs more time to fully re-establish
and re-learn all routes.

- (Optional) To enable SNS notifications for BGP status
changes, toggle the **Enable SNS**
**notifications** switch. Enabling SNS
notifications persists BGP or BFD session status changes
on route server peers and maintenance notifications for
route server endpoints to an SNS topic provisioned by
AWS. For details about these notifications, see the
**SNS notification**
**details** table below.

5. (Optional) To add tags to your route server,
    scroll down to the **Tags -**
**optional** section and choose **Add new**
**tag**. Enter a key and an optional value for each tag.
    You can add up to 50 tags.

6. Review your settings and choose **Create route server**.

7. Wait for the route server to be created. Once complete, you will be redirected to the **Route**
**servers** page, where you can see your new route server listed
    with a status of _Available_.

Command line

Use the following procedure to create a new route server to manage dynamic routing in a VPC.

For `--amazon-side-asn`, enter a BGP ASN value. This value must be in the range of 1-4294967295. We recommend using a private ASN in the 64512–65534 (16-bit ASN) or 4200000000–4294967294 (32-bit ASN) range.

1. Command:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-route-server --amazon-side-asn 65000
```

Response:

```nohighlight

{
       "RouteServer": {
           "RouteServerId": "rs-1",
           "AmazonSideAsn": 65000,
           "State": "pending"
       }
}
```

2. Wait for the route server to be available.

Command:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-route-servers

```

Response:

```nohighlight

{
       "RouteServer": {
           "RouteServerId": "rs-1",
           "AmazonSideAsn": 65000,
           "State": "available"
       }
}
```
