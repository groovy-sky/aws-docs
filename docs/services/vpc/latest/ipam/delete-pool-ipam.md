# Delete a pool

An IPAM pool in AWS represents a defined range of IP addresses that can be allocated and managed within a specific AWS environment or organization. Pools are used to organize IP address space, enable automated IP address management, and enforce IP address governance policies across your cloud infrastructure.

You may want to delete an IPAM pool to remove unused or unnecessary IP address space and
reclaim it for other purposes. You cannot delete an IP address pool if there are allocations
in it. You must first release the allocations and [Deprovision CIDRs from a pool](depro-pool-cidr-ipam.md) before you can delete the pool.

Follow the steps in this section to delete an IPAM pool.
