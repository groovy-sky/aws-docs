# Modify IPAM operating Regions

Operating Regions are AWS Regions where the IPAM is allowed to manage IP address CIDRs. IPAM only discovers and monitors resources in the AWS Regions you select as operating Regions.

Adding an operating region to an IPAM allows you to manage IP address space across multiple AWS Regions. This can improve IP address utilization, enable regional segmentation, and support geographically distributed infrastructure. Expanding the IPAM's Regional scope provides greater flexibility and control over your overall IP address management.
