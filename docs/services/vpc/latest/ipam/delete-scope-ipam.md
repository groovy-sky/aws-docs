# Delete a scope

You may want to delete an IPAM scope if it no longer serves its intended purpose, such as when you restructure your network, consolidate regions, or adjust your IP address allocation. Deleting unused scopes can help streamline your IPAM configuration and optimize your IP address management within AWS.

###### Note

You can't delete a scope if either of the following is true:

- The scope is a default scope. When you create an IPAM, two default scopes (one public, one
private) are created automatically, and cannot be deleted. To see if a scope is
a default scope, view the **Scope type** in the details of the
scope.

- There are one or more pools in the scope.
You must first [Delete a pool](delete-pool-ipam.md)
before you can delete the scope.
