# IPAM resource utilization metrics

IPAM publishes IP utilization metrics for resources that the IPAM monitors to Amazon CloudWatch. These resources include:

- VPCs (IPv4 and IPv6)

- Subnets (IPv4)

- Public IPv4 pools

IPAM calculates and publishes IP utilization metrics separately by IP address family (IPv4 or IPv6). The IP utilization of a resource is calculated across all of its CIDRs of the same address family.

For each resource type and address family combination, IPAM uses three rules to determine which metrics to publish:

- Up to 50 resources with the highest IP utilization. You can use this information to configure alarms to be alerted if an IP utilization threshold is breached.

- Up to 50 resources with the lowest IP utilization. You can use this information to decide if you want to keep or delete resources that are underutilized.

- Up to 50 other resources. You can use this information to consistently track the
IP utilization of resources that may not be captured within the high or low
utilization group.

- Up to 50 VPCs containing a CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool (prioritized by total size of CIDR blocks).

- Up to 50 subnets whose VPC contains a CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool (prioritized by total size of CIDR blocks).

- Up to 50 public IPv4 pools containing a CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool (prioritized by total size of CIDR blocks).

After applying each rule, the metrics are aggregated and published under the same
metric name for each resource type. See below for detailed information on the metric
names and their dimensions.

###### Important

There is a unique limit for each resource type, address family, and rule combination. The default value of each limit is 50. You can adjust these limits by contacting the AWS Support Center as described in [AWS service quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md) in
the _AWS General Reference_.

###### Example

Let’s say that your IPAM monitors 2,500 VPCs and 10,000 subnets, all with IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs. IPAM publishes the following IP utilization metrics:

- Up to 150 metrics for VPC IPv4 IP utilization, including:

- The 50 VPCs with the highest IPv4 IP utilization

- The 50 VPCs with the lowest IPv4 utilization

- Up to 50 VPCs containing an IPv4 CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool

- Up to 150 metrics for VPC IPv6 utilization, including:

- The 50 VPCs with the highest IPv6 IP utilization

- The 50 VPCs with the lowest IPv6 utilization

- Up to 50 VPCs containing an IPv6 CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool

- Up to 150 metrics for subnet IPv4 utilization, including:

- The 50 subnets with the highest IPv4 IP utilization

- The 50 subnets with the lowest IPv4 IP utilization

- Up to 50 subnets whose VPC contains an IPv4 CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool

## VPC metrics

The VPC metric name and description is listed below.

Metric nameDescriptionVpcIPUsageThe total IPs covered by CIDRs in the VPC’s subnets divided by
the total IPs covered by CIDRs in the VPC. This is calculated across
all VPC CIDRs in the same IPAM Scope and separately for IPv4 and
IPv6 CIDRs.

The dimensions you can use to filter VPC metrics are listed below.

DimensionDescriptionAddressFamilyThe IP address family for resource CIDRs (IPv4 or IPv6).OwnerIDThe ID of the VPC owner.RegionThe AWS Region where the VPC is located.ScopeIDThe ID of the IPAM scope that the VPC belongs to.VpcIDThe ID of the VPC.

## Subnet metrics

The subnet metric name and description is listed below.

Metric nameDescriptionSubnetIPUsageThe number of active IPs divided by total IPs in the subnet's IPv4
CIDR.

The dimensions you can use to filter subnet metrics are listed below.

DimensionDescriptionAddressFamilyThe IP address family for resource CIDRs (IPv4 only).OwnerIDThe ID of the subnet owner.RegionThe AWS Region where the subnet is located.ScopeIDThe ID of the IPAM scope that the subnet belongs to.SubnetIDThe ID of the subnet.VpcIDThe ID of the VPC that the subnet belongs to.

## Public IPv4 pool metrics

The public IPv4 pool metric name and description is listed below.

Metric nameDescriptionPublicIPv4PoolIPUsageThe number of EIPs from the public IPv4 Pool divided by total IPs in the pool.

The dimensions you can use to filter the public IPv4 pool metrics are listed below.

DimensionDescriptionOwnerIDThe ID of the public IPv4 pool owner.PublicIPv4PoolIDThe ID of the public IPv4 pool.RegionThe AWS Region where the public IPv4 pool is located.ScopeIDThe ID of the IPAM scope that the public IPv4 pool belongs to.

## Public IP insight metrics

The [public IP insight](view-public-ip-insights.md) metric names and descriptions are listed below.

Metric nameDescriptionAmazonOwnedElasticIPsThe number of Amazon-owned Elastic IP addresses that you have
provisioned or assigned to resources in your AWS account.AssociatedAmazonOwnedElasticIPsThe number of Amazon-owned Elastic IP addresses that you have
associated with resources in your AWS account.AssociatedBringYourOwnIPsThe number of public IPv4 addresses that you have brought to
AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and have associated
with resources in your AWS account.BringYourOwnIPsThe number of public IPv4 addresses that you have brought to
AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).EC2PublicIPsThe number of public IPv4 addresses assigned to EC2 instances when the instances were launched into a default subnet or into a subnet configured to automatically assign a public IPv4 address.ServiceManagedBringYourOwnIPs The number of public IPv4 addresses that you have brought to
AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) that are provisioned
and managed by an AWS service.ServiceManagedIPsThe number of public IPv4 addresses provisioned and managed by an
AWS service.UnassociatedAmazonOwnedElasticIPsThe number of Amazon-owned Elastic IP addresses that you have not associated with resources in your AWS account.UnassociatedBringYourOwnIPsThe number of public IPv4 addresses that you have brought to AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and have not associated with any resources in your AWS account.

The dimensions you can use to filter the public IP insight metrics are listed below.

DimensionDescriptionIpamIdThe ID of the IPAM that the IP address belongs to.RegionThe AWS Region where the public IP address is located.

## Quick tip for creating alarms

To quickly create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for resources with high IP address utilization, open the
CloudWatch console, choose **Metrics**, **All**
**metrics**, choose the **Query** tab, choose the
**Namespace** `AWS/IPAM > VPC IP Usage Metrics`, `AWS/IPAM > Subnet IP Usage Metrics`, or `AWS/IPAM > Public IPv4 Pool IP Usage Metrics`, choose the **Metric**
**name** `MAX(VpcIPUsage)`, `MAX(SubnetIPUsage)`, or `MAX(PublicIPv4PoolIPUsage)`, and choose **Create alarm**. For
more information, see [Create alarms on Metrics Insights queries](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-metrics-insights-alarms.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User_
_Guide_.
