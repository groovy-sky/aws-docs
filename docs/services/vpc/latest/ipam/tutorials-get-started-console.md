# Tutorial: Create an IPAM and pools using the console

In this tutorial, you create an IPAM, integrate with AWS Organizations, create IP address pools,
and create a VPC with a CIDR from an IPAM pool.

This tutorial shows you how you can use IPAM to organize IP address space based on different
development needs. Once you’ve completed this tutorial, you’ll have one IP address pool for
pre-production resources. You can then create other pools based on your routing and security
needs, such as a pool for production resources.

While you can use IPAM as a single user, integrating with AWS Organizations enables you to manage
IP addresses across accounts in your organization. This tutorial covers integrating IPAM with
accounts in an organization. It does not cover how to [Integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organization](enable-integ-ipam-outside-org.md).

###### Note

For the purposes of this tutorial, the instructions will tell you to name IPAM resources
in a particular way, create IPAM resources in specific Regions, and use specific IP address
CIDR ranges for your pools. This is intended to streamline the choices available in IPAM and
get you started with IPAM quickly. Once you’ve completed this tutorial, you may decide to
create a new IPAM and configure it differently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have set up an AWS Organizations account with at least one member
account. For how-to instructions, see [Creating and managing an\
organization](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-org.md) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

## How AWS Organizations integrates with IPAM

This section shows an example of the AWS Organizations accounts you use in this tutorial. There are
three accounts in your organization that you use when you integrate with IPAM in this
tutorial:

- The management account (called **example-management-account** in the following image) to log into the IPAM
console and delegate an IPAM admin. You cannot use the organization’s management account
as your IPAM admin.

- A member account (called _example-member-account-1_
in the following image) as the IPAM admin account. The IPAM admin account is responsible
for creating an IPAM and using it to manage and monitor IP address usage across the
organization. Any member account in your organization can be delegated as the IPAM
admin.

- A member account (called _example-member-account-2_
in the following above) as the developer account. This account creates a VPC with a CIDR
allocated from an IPAM pool.

![An example of an AWS Organizations org with example management and member accounts.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-10_4.png)

In addition to the accounts, you’ll need the ID of the organizational unit ( **ou-fssg-q5brfv9c** in the preceding image) that contains the member
account you’ll use as the developer account. You need this ID so that, in a later step, when
you share your IPAM pool, you can share it with this OU.

###### Note

For more information about AWS Organizations account types like _management_
and _member_ accounts, see [AWS Organizations\
terminology and concepts](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-getting-started-concepts.md).

## Step 1: Delegate an IPAM administrator

In this step, you’ll delegate an AWS Organizations member account as the IPAM admin. When you
delegate an IPAM admin, [a service-linked role](iam-ipam-slr.md) is automatically created in each of your AWS Organizations member accounts. IPAM monitors the IP
address usage in these accounts by assuming the service-linked role in each member account. It
can then discover the resources and their CIDRs regardless of their Organizational Unit.

You cannot complete this step unless you have the required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions.
For more information, see [Integrate IPAM with accounts in an AWS Organization](enable-integ-ipam.md).

###### To delegate an IPAM admin account

1. Using the AWS Organizations management account, open the IPAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam).

2. In the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you want to work
    with IPAM.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Organization settings**.

4. Choose **Delegate**. The **Delegate** option is
    available only if you logged in to the console as the AWS Organizations management account.

5. Enter the AWS account ID for an organization member account. The IPAM administrator
    must be an AWS Organizations member account, not the management account.

![The edit settings option in the IPAM console where you delegate an IPAM administrator.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-_U_2bIBCUfjFZXB4le6FUg.png)

6. Choose **Save changes**. The **Delegated**
**administrator** information is populated with details related to the member
    account.

## Step 2: Create an IPAM

In this step you’ll create an IPAM. When you create an IPAM, IPAM automatically creates
two scopes for the IPAM: the private scope that’s intended for all private space, and the
public scope that’s intended for all public space. The
scopes, together with pools and allocations, are key components of your IPAM. For more
information, see [How IPAM works](how-it-works-ipam.md).

###### To create an IPAM

1. Using the AWS Organizations member account delegated as the IPAM admin in [the\
    previous step](#1-delegate-an-ipam-administrator), open the IPAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam).

2. In the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you want to create
    the IPAM. Create the IPAM in your main Region of operations.

3. On the service home page, choose **Create IPAM**.

4. Select **Allow Amazon VPC IP Address Manager to replicate data**
**from source account(s) into the IPAM delegate account**. If you do not select
    this option, you cannot create an IPAM.

![Create an IPAM page in the IPAM console that includes a description of the Allow Amazon VPC IP Address Manager to replicate data from source account(s) into the IPAM delegate account checkbox.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-HxHJCv2B3DfNcq--wo_gGg.png)

5. Under **Operating Regions**, choose the AWS Regions
    in which this IPAM can manage and discover resources. The AWS Region in which you are
    creating your IPAM is automatically selected as one of the operating Regions. In this
    tutorial, the home Region of our IPAM is us-east-1, so we’ll choose us-west-1 and
    us-west-2 as additional operating Regions. If you forget an operating Region, you can edit
    your IPAM settings later and add or remove Regions.

![IPAM settings section in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-D85nBxGA1n7iyDVmB7HOCw.png)

6. Choose **Create IPAM**.

![The result page in the IPAM console after you successfully create an IPAM.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-FUAVxduwVP5FBYU2GLnlkQ.png)

## Step 3: Create a top-level IPAM pool

In this tutorial, you create a hierarchy of pools starting with the top-level IPAM pool. In
the subsequent steps, you’ll create a pair of Regional pools and a pre-production development
pool in one of the regional pools.

For more information about pool hierarchies that you can build with IPAM, see [Example IPAM pool plans](planning-examples-ipam.md).

###### To create a top-level pool

01. Using the IPAM admin account, open the IPAM console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Pools**.

03. Choose the private scope.

    ![Choosing the private scope in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-2QXpOvOj0i1rotyKoLjeMQ_update.png)

04. Choose **Create pool**.

05. Under **IPAM scope**, leave the private scope selected.

06. (Optional) Add a **Name tag** for the pool and a
     description for the pool, such as “Global pool”.

07. Under **Source**, choose **IPAM scope**. Because this is our
     top level pool, it will not have a source pool.

08. Under **Address family**, choose
     **IPv4**.

09. Under **Resource planning**, leave **Plan IP**
    **space within the scope** selected. For more information
     about using this option to plan for subnet IP space within a VPC, see
     [Tutorial: Plan VPC IP address space for subnet IP allocations](tutorials-subnet-planning.md).

10. For the **Locale**, choose **None**.
     Locales are the AWS Regions where you want this IPAM pool to be available for
     allocations. You’ll set the locale for the Regional pools that you create in the next
     section of this tutorial.

    ![Creating a pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-daejldSm0ArWYGkedgKekQ.png)

11. Choose a CIDR to provision for the pool. In this example, we provision 10.0.0.0/16.

    ![Defining which CIDRs to provision for a pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-inrC8QzrnWgW6nmdPkk1rw.png)

12. Leave **Configure this pool’s allocation rule settings**
     disabled. This is our top-level pool, and you will not be allocating CIDRs to VPCs
     directly from this pool. Instead, you will allocate them from a sub-pool that you create
     from this pool.

    ![Choosing allocation rule settings for a pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-8j4A_Tr5hG95xWIFfi1wkw.png)

13. Choose **Create pool**. The pool is created and the
     CIDR is in a **Pending-provision** state:

    ![Pending provision message in the IPAM console after you create a pool.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-2_1.png)

14. Wait for the state to be **Provisioned** before you go
     to the next step.

    ![Provisioned message in the IPAM console after you successfully create a pool.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-3_1.png)

Now that you have created your top-level pool, you’ll create Regional pools in us-west-1 and
us-west-2.

## Step 4: Create Regional IPAM pools

This section shows you how to organize your IP addresses using two Regional pools. In
this tutorial, we’re following one of [the example\
IPAM pool plans](planning-examples-ipam.md) and creating two Regional pools which can be used by the member
accounts in your organization for allocating CIDRs to their VPCs.

###### To create a Regional pool

01. Using the IPAM admin account, open the IPAM console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Pools**.

03. Choose the private scope.

    ![Choosing the private scope in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-Jb3iudGe4fGJDkVVMqnCpA_update.png)

04. Choose **Create pool**.

05. Under **IPAM scope**, leave the private scope selected.

06. (Optional) Add a **Name tag** for the pool and a
     description for the pool, such as **Regional pool us-west-1**.

    ![Adding a name for a pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-U9TfeMAvqPNqdM3o18oNCA.png)

07. Under **Source**, select **IPAM pool** and select the top-level pool
     (“Global pool”) that you created in [Step 3: Create a top-level IPAM pool](#3-create-a-toplevel-ipam-pool). Then, under
     **Locale**, choose **us-west-1**.

    ![Choosing a source pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-Qg017oruyE3w2MEkQXr1EQ.png)

08. Under **Resource planning**, leave **Plan IP**
    **space within the scope** selected. For more information
     about using this option to plan for subnet IP space within a VPC, see
     [Tutorial: Plan VPC IP address space for subnet IP allocations](tutorials-subnet-planning.md).

09. Under **CIDRs to provision**, enter 10.0.0.0/18, which
     will give this pool around 16,000 available IP addresses.

    ![Choosing CIDRs to provision for the pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-os9vwNonWgaIGDkbq3Pjbg.png)

10. Leave **Configure this pool’s allocation rule settings**
     disabled. You will not be allocating CIDRs to VPCs directly from this pool. Instead, you
     will allocate them from a sub-pool that you create from this pool.

    ![The Configure this pool’s allocation rule settings toggle in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-8j4A_Tr5hG95xWIFfi1wkw.png)

11. Choose **Create pool**.

12. Return to the **Pools** view to see the hierarchy of
     IPAM pools that you’ve created.

    ![Pools view with two pools in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-Ki7fsgUEn6miZE5Hg2TmrA_update.png)

13. Repeat the steps in this section and create a second Regional pool in **us-west-2** locale with the CIDR **10.0.64.0/18** provisioned to it. When you complete that process, you’ll have
     three pools in a hierarchy similar to this one:

    ![Pools view with three pools in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-5_update.png)

## Step 5: Create a pre-production development pool

Follow the steps in this section to create a development pool for pre-production resources
within one of your Regional pools.

###### To create a pre-production development pool

1. In the same way that you did in the previous section, using the IPAM admin account,
    create a pool called **Pre-prod pool**, but this time use **Regional pool us-west-1** as the source pool.

![Creating a pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-BxJv7N7ierzIQDRiC4_R0Q.png)

2. Specify a CIDR of 10.0.0.0/20 to provision, which will give this pool around 4,000 IP
    addresses.

![Choosing CIDRs for a pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-jn0QtJsRo5iF5R5oHp7Sqw.png)

3. Toggle the option for **Configure this pool's allocation rule**
**settings**. Do the following:

1. Under **CIDR management**, for **Automatically import discovered resources**, leave the
    default **Don't allow** option selected. This option
    would enable IPAM to automatically import resource CIDRs it discovers in the pool's
    locale. A detailed description of this option is outside the scope of this tutorial,
    but you can read more about the option in [Create a top-level IPv4 pool](create-top-ipam.md).

2. Under **Netmask compliancy**, choose **/24** for the minimum, default, and maximum netmask length. A
    detailed description of this option is outside the scope of this tutorial, but you can
    read more about the option in [Create a top-level IPv4 pool](create-top-ipam.md). What’s important to note is that the VPC that you create
    later with a CIDR from this pool will be limited to /24 based on what we set here.

3. Under **Tag compliance**, enter **environment/pre-prod**. This tag will be required for VPCs to
    allocate space from the pool. We will demonstrate later how this works.

![View of all pool settings when creating a pool in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-D2Yr4efRG3X7MeME2urYJA.png)

4. Choose **Create pool**.

5. The pool hierarchy now includes an additional subpool under **Regional**
**pool us-west-1**:

![Pool view with four pools in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-DrNlvRjI9cFmNfq7Xa4x0w_update.png)

Now you’re ready to share the IPAM pool with another member account in your organization and
enable that account to allocate a CIDR from the pool to create a VPC.

## Step 6: Share the IPAM pool

Follow the steps in this section to share the pre-production IPAM pool using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM).

This section consists of two subsections:

- [Step 6.1. Enable resource sharing in AWS RAM](#61-enable-resource-sharing-in-aws-ram): This step must be done by the
AWS Organizations management account.

- [Step 6.2. Share an IPAM pool using AWS RAM](#62-share-an-ipam-pool-using-aws-ram): This step must be done by the
IPAM admin.

### Step 6.1. Enable resource sharing in AWS RAM

After you create your IPAM, you’ll want to share IP address pools with other accounts in
your organization. Before you share an IPAM pool, complete the steps in this section to
enable resource sharing with AWS RAM.

###### To enable resource sharing

1. Using the AWS Organizations management account, open the AWS RAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Settings**,
    choose **Enable sharing with AWS Organizations**, and then choose **Save settings**.

![Enabling organization sharing in the AWS RAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-Jv8YJhg2J82EFdJrgsXA5w.png)

You can now share an IPAM pool with other members of the organization.

### Step 6.2. Share an IPAM pool using AWS RAM

In this section you’ll share the pre-production development pool with another AWS Organizations
member account. For complete instructions on sharing IPAM pools, including information on
the required IAM permissions, see [Share an IPAM pool using AWS RAM](share-pool-ipam.md).

###### To share an IPAM pool using AWS RAM

01. Using the IPAM admin account, open the IPAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Pools**.

03. Choose the private scope, choose the pre-production IPAM pool, and choose **Actions** \> **View details**.

04. Under **Resource sharing**, choose **Create resource share**. The AWS RAM console opens. You'll share
     the pool using AWS RAM.

05. Choose **Create a resource share**.

    ![Creating a resource share in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-6_1.png)

    The AWS RAM console opens.

06. In the AWS RAM console, choose **Create a resource share** again.

07. Add a **Name** for the shared pool.

08. Under **Select resource type**, choose **IPAM pools,** and then choose the ARN of the pre-production
     development pool.

    ![Creating a resource share in the AWS RAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-El4fIIE4FoenE75KV43GtQ.png)

09. Choose **Next**.

10. Leave the default **AWSRAMDefaultPermissionsIpamPool**
     permission selected. The details of the permission options are out of scope for this
     tutorial, but you can find out more about these options in [Share an IPAM pool using AWS RAM](share-pool-ipam.md).

    ![Associating permissions on a resource share in the AWS RAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-lNweqIyKpC9LFvxpwrkmiw.png)

11. Choose **Next**.

12. Under **Principals**, choose **Allow**
    **sharing only within your organization.** Enter your AWS Organizations organization unit
     ID (as mentioned in [How AWS Organizations integrates with IPAM](#how-aws-organizations-integrates-with-ipam), and then choose **Add**
     .

    ![Granting access to a resource share in the AWS RAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-dvLWZpvLDwh-grXeuUwPFQ.png)

13. Choose **Next**.

14. Review the resource share options and the principals that you’ll be sharing with,
     and then choose **Create**.

Now that the pool has been shared, go to the next step to create a VPC with a CIDR
allocated from an IPAM pool.

## Step 7: Create a VPC with a CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool

Follow the steps in this section to create a VPC with a CIDR allocated from the
pre-production pool. This step should be completed by the member account in the OU that the
IPAM pool was shared with in the previous section (called **example-member-account-2** in [How AWS Organizations integrates with IPAM](#how-aws-organizations-integrates-with-ipam)). For more information about
the IAM permissions that are required to create VPCs, see [Amazon VPC policy examples](../userguide/vpc-policy-examples.md) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

###### To create a VPC with a CIDR allocated from an IPAM pool

1. Using the member account, open the VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc) as
    the member account that you'll use as the developer
    account.

2. Choose **Create VPC**.

3. Do the following:

1. Enter a name, such as **Example VPC.**

2. Choose **IPAM-allocated IPv4 CIDR block.**

3. Under **IPv4 IPAM pool**, choose the ID of the
    pre-production pool.

4. Choose a **Netmask** length. Because you limited
    the available netmask length for this pool to /24 (in [Step 5: Create a pre-production development pool](#5-create-a-preproduction-development-pool)), the only netmask option available
    is /24.

![Creating a VPC in the Amazon VPC console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-jP9gQ6vF0cRtH2b-7CGNAA.png)

4. For demonstration purposes, under **Tags**, do not add
    any additional tags at this time. When you created the pre-prod pool (in [Step 5: Create a pre-production development pool](#5-create-a-preproduction-development-pool)), you added an allocation rule that
    required any VPCs that are created with CIDRs from this pool to have an
    environment/pre-prod tag. Leave the environment/pre-prod tag off for now so that you can
    see that an error appears telling you that a required tag was not added.

5. Choose **Create VPC**.

6. An error appears telling you that a required tag was not added. The error appears because you
    set an allocation rule when you created the pre-prod pool (in [Step 5: Create a pre-production development pool](#5-create-a-preproduction-development-pool)). The allocation rule
    required any VPCs that are created with CIDRs from this pool to have an environment/pre-prod tag.

![Creating a VPC error in the Amazon VPC console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-wxP7WfFbl-2ThufLus_Usw.png)

7. Now, under **Tags**, add the tag **environment/pre-prod** and choose **Create**
**VPC** again.

![Adding tags to a VPC in the Amazon VPC console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-w8R8_7bmW-Bp-CPSImwmEA.png)

8. The VPC is created successfully, and the VPC complies with the tag rule on the
    pre-production pool:

![Successfully creating a VPC in the Amazon VPC console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-D3roKYnuSRCdzlFfGT7-pg.png)

In the **Resources** pane of the IPAM console, the IPAM
admin will be able to see and manage the VPC and its allocated CIDR. Note that it takes some
time for the VPC to appear in the **Resources** pane.

## Step 8: Cleanup

In this tutorial, you created an IPAM with a delegated admin, created multiple pools, and
enabled a member account in your organization to allocate a VPC CIDR from a pool.

Follow the steps in this section to clean up the resources that you created in this tutorial.

###### To cleanup the resources created in this tutorial

1. Using the member account that created the example VPC, delete the VPC. For detailed
    instructions, see [Delete your VPC](../userguide/delete-vpc.md)
    in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.

2. Using the IPAM admin account, delete the example resource share in the AWS RAM console.
    For detailed instructions, see [Deleting\
    a resource share in AWSAWS RAM](../../../ram/latest/userguide/working-with-sharing-delete.md) in the _AWS Resource Access Manager User Guide_.

3. Using the IPAM admin account, log into the RAM console and disable sharing with
    AWS Organizations that you enable in [Step 6.1. Enable resource sharing in AWS RAM](#61-enable-resource-sharing-in-aws-ram).

4. Using the IPAM admin account, delete the example IPAM by selecting the IPAM in the
    IPAM console and then choosing **Actions** \> **Delete**. For detailed instructions, see [Delete an IPAM](delete-ipam.md).

5. When you’re prompted to delete the IPAM, choose **Cascade**
**delete**. This will delete all scopes and pools within the IPAM before
    deleting the IPAM.

![Deleting an IPAM in the IPAM console.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/tutorials-get-started-console-wzlnq9726bqxf3M_F71QUQ.png)

6. Enter **delete** and then choose **Delete**.

7. Using the AWS Organizations management account, log into the IPAM console, choose **Settings**, and remove the delegated administrator account.

8. (Optional) When you integrate IPAM with AWS Organizations, [IPAM automatically\
    creates a service-linked role in each member account](iam-ipam-slr.md). Using each AWS Organizations member
    account, log into IAM and delete the **AWSServiceRoleForIPAM** service
    linked role in each member account.

9. Cleanup is complete.
