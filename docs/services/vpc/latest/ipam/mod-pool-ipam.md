# Edit an IPAM pool

[Create a top-level IPv4 pool](create-top-ipam.md).

- Modify the pool's name, description, or other metadata to improve organization and visibility
within IPAM.

- Change pool options like auto-import discovered resources to optimize IPAM's automated IP address management.

Follow the steps in this section to edit an IPAM pool.
