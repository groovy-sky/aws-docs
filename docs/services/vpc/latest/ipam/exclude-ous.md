# Exclude organizational units from IPAM

If your IPAM is integrated with AWS Organizations, you can exclude an [organizational unit (OU)](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-getting-started-concepts.md#organizationalunit) from being managed by IPAM. When you exclude an OU, IPAM will not manage the IP addresses in accounts in that OU.
This feature gives you more
flexibility in how you use IPAM.

You can use OU exclusions in the following ways:

- **Enable IPAM for specific parts of your**
**business**: If you have multiple business units or subsidiaries in
AWS Organizations, you can now use IPAM just for the ones that need it.

- **Keep your sandbox accounts separate**: You can
exclude your sandbox accounts from IPAM, focusing only on the accounts that really
matter for your IP management.

## How OU exclusions work

The diagrams in this section demonstrate two use cases for adding OU exclusions in
IPAM.

The first diagram shows the impact of adding an organization unit (OU) exclusion on a
parent OU only. As a result, IPAM will not manage the IP addresses in accounts in the
parent OU. IPAM will manage the IP addresses in accounts in the other OUs outside the
exclusion.

![Diagram of OU exclusion on parent OU](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/vpc/latest/ipam/images/ipam-ou-1.png)

The second diagram shows the impact of adding an organization unit (OU) exclusion on a
parent OU _and_ all child OUs. As a result, IPAM will
not manage the IP addresses in accounts in the parent OU or in accounts in any child
OUs. IPAM will manage the IP addresses in accounts in the OUs outside of the
exclusion.

## Add or remove OU exclusions

Complete the steps in this section to add or remove OU exclusions.

###### Note

- The delegated IPAM admin account is not excluded even if it's within an OU that's
excluded.

- Your IPAM must be integrated with AWS Organizations to add an OU exclusion. The
Organization must have OUs in it.

- You must be the delegated IPAM admin to view, add, or remove OU exclusions.

- It takes time for IPAM to discover recently created organizational
units.

- There is a default quota for the number of exclusions you can add per
resource discovery. For more information, see _Organizational unit exclusions per resource discovery_ in [Quotas for your IPAM](quotas-ipam.md).

- If you [share a resource discovery with another account](res-disc-work-with-share.md), that account can
see the OU exclusions on it, which contains information such as the Org ID,
Root ID, and organizational unit IDs of the resource discovery owner's
Organization.

AWS Management Console

###### To add or remove OU exclusions

1. Open the IPAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Resource discoveries**.

3. Choose your default resource discovery.

4. Choose **Edit**.

5. Under **Organizational unit exclusions**, do the following:

- **To add an OU exclusion**:

- If you want to exclude the OU and all its child
OUs:

- Find the OU in the table and select the
checkbox. All child OUs are automatically
selected.

- If you want to exclude only parent OU accounts:

- Find the OU in the table and select the
checkbox. All child OUs are automatically
selected. Deselect all child OUs.

- Alternatively, you can use the **Actions** column to select
only a parent OU or parent and child OUs:

- **Select all child OUs**:
Include any child OUs in the exclusion. As a
result of choosing an OU, the OU is added on
screen. Each OU contains the ID and the [entity path](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-last-accessed-view-data-orgs.md#access_policies_last-accessed-viewing-orgs-entity-path) of the OU exclusion.

- **Select only this OU**:
Include only this OU in the exclusion. As a result
of choosing an OU, the OU is added on screen. Each
OU contains the ID and the [entity path](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-last-accessed-view-data-orgs.md#access_policies_last-accessed-viewing-orgs-entity-path) of the OU exclusion.

- **Copy OU entity path**:
Copy the organization entity path
to use as needed.

- If you know the AWS Organizations entity path
already or you want to build it:

- Choose **Input organizational unit**
**exclusion** and enter the [entity path](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-last-accessed-view-data-orgs.md#access_policies_last-accessed-viewing-orgs-entity-path) of the OU exclusion. Build
the path for the OU(s) using AWS
Organizations IDs separated by a `/`.
Include all child OUs by ending the path with
`/*`.

- Example 1

- Path to a child OU:
`o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-ghi0-awsccccc/ou-jkl0-awsddddd/`

- In this example, `o-a1b2c3d4e5`
is the organization ID,
`r-f6g7h8i9j0example` is the root ID,
`ou-ghi0-awsccccc` is an OU ID, and
`ou-jkl0-awsddddd` is a child OU
ID.

- IPAM will not manage the IP addresses in
accounts in the child OU.

- Example 2

- Path where all child OUs will be part of the
exclusion:
`o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-ghi0-awsccccc/*`

- In this example, IPAM will not manage the IP
addresses in accounts in the OU
( `ou-ghi0-awsccccc`) or in accounts in
any OUs that are children of the OU.

- **To remove an OU**
**exclusion**:

- Choose the **X** next to an OU
that's already been added. The `/*` after
the OU ID indicates that it's a parent OU and that
child OUs are part of the OU exclusion.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

Command line

The commands in this section link to the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.
The documentation provides detailed descriptions of the options that you can use
when you run the commands.

1. View resource discovery details to get the ID of the default resource discovery for the next
    step with [describe-ipam-resource-discoveries](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/describe-ipam-resource-discoveries.html).

Input:

```xml

aws ec2 describe-ipam-resource-discoveries
```

Output:

```json

{
       "IpamResourceDiscoveries": [
           {
               "OwnerId": "111122223333",
               "IpamResourceDiscoveryId": "ipam-res-disco-1234567890abcdef0",
               "IpamResourceDiscoveryArn": "arn:aws:ec2::111122223333:ipam-resource-discovery/ipam-res-disco-1234567890abcdef0",
               "IpamResourceDiscoveryRegion": "us-east-1",
               "OperatingRegions": [
                   {
                       "RegionName": "us-east-1"
                   },
                   {
                       "RegionName": "us-west-1"
                   },
                   {
                       "RegionName": "us-west-2"
                   }
               ],
               "IsDefault": true,
               "State": "modify-complete",
               "Tags": []
           }
       ]
}

```

2. Add or remove an organizational unit exclusion from a resource discovery with [modify-ipam-resource-discovery](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/modify-ipam-resource-discovery.html) and the
    `--add-organizational-unit-exclusions` or
    `--remove-organizational-unit-exclusions` options.
    You'll need enter an AWS Organizations entity path.
    Build the path for the OU(s) using AWS Organizations
    IDs separated by a `/`. Include all child OUs by ending
    the path with `/*`. You can't include the same entity
    path more than once in the add or remove parameters.

- Example 1

- Path to a child OU: `o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-ghi0-awsccccc/ou-jkl0-awsddddd/`

- In this example, `o-a1b2c3d4e5` is the organization ID, `r-f6g7h8i9j0example` is the root ID, `ou-ghi0-awsccccc` is an OU ID, and `ou-jkl0-awsddddd` is a child OU ID.

- IPAM will not manage the IP addresses in accounts in the child OU.

- Example 2

- Path where all child OUs will be part of the exclusion: `o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-ghi0-awsccccc/*`

- In this example, IPAM will not manage the IP addresses in accounts in the OU ( `ou-ghi0-awsccccc`) or in accounts in any OUs that are children of the OU.

###### Note

The resulting set of exclusions must not "overlap",
meaning two or more OU exclusions must not exclude the same OU.

**Example of non-overlapping entity**
**paths:**

- Path 1 ="o-1/r-1/ou-1/"

- Path 2 ="o-1/r-1/ou-1/ou-2/"

These paths are do not overlap because Path 1 only excludes the
accounts under ou-1 and Path 2 only excludes accounts under
ou-2.

**Example of overlapping entity**
**paths:**

- Path 1 ="o-1/r-1/ou-1/\*"

- Path 2 ="o-1/r-1/ou-1/ou-2/"

These paths overlap because Path 1
represents both "o-1/r-1/ou-1/" and "o-1/r-1/ou-1/ou-2/", and
"o-1/r-1/ou-1/ou-2/" overlaps with Path 2.

Input:

```xml

aws ec2 modify-ipam-resource-discovery \
    --ipam-resource-discovery-id ipam-res-disco-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --add-organizational-unit-exclusions OrganizationsEntityPath='o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-ghi0-awsccccc/*' \
    --remove-organizational-unit-exclusions OrganizationsEntityPath='o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-ghi0-awsccccc/ou-jkl0-awsddddd/' \
    --region us-east-1
```

Output:

```json

{
    "IpamResourceDiscovery": {
        "OwnerId": "111122223333",
        "IpamResourceDiscoveryId": "ipam-res-disco-1234567890abcdef0",
        "IpamResourceDiscoveryArn": "arn:aws:ec2::111122223333:ipam-resource-discovery/ipam-res-disco-1234567890abcdef0",
        "IpamResourceDiscoveryRegion": "us-east-1",
        "OperatingRegions": [
            {
                "RegionName": "us-east-1"
            }
        ],
        "IsDefault": false,
        "State": "modify-in-progress",
        "OrganizationalUnitExclusions": [
            {
                "OrganizationsEntityPath": "o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-ghi0-awsccccc/*"
            }
        ]
    }
}
