# Release an allocation

If you are planning to delete a pool, you might need to release a pool allocation. An
allocation is a CIDR assignment from an IPAM pool to another resource or IPAM pool.

You cannot delete pools if the pools have CIDRs provisioned, and you cannot deprovision CIDRs if the CIDRs are allocated to resources.

###### Note

- To release a manual allocation, use the steps in this section or call the [ReleaseIpamPoolAllocation API](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-releaseipampoolallocation.md).

- To release an allocation in a private scope, you must ignore or delete the
resource CIDR. For more information, see [Change the monitoring state of VPC CIDRs](change-monitoring-state-ipam.md). After some time, Amazon VPC
IPAM will automatically release the allocation on your behalf.

###### Example

**Example**

If you have a VPC CIDR in a private scope, to release the allocation you
must either ignore or delete
the VPC CIDR. After some time, Amazon VPC IPAM will automatically release
the VPC CIDR allocation from the IPAM pool.

- To release an allocation in a public scope, you must delete the resource CIDR. You cannot
ignore public resource CIDRs. For more information, see _Cleanup_ in [Bring your own public IPv4 CIDR to IPAM using only the AWS CLI](tutorials-byoip-ipam-ipv4.md) or _Cleanup_ in [Bring your own IPv6 CIDR to IPAM using only the AWS CLI](tutorials-byoip-ipam-ipv6.md). After some time, Amazon VPC
IPAM will automatically release the allocation on your behalf.

For Amazon VPC IPAM to release allocations on your behalf, all account permissions must be properly configured for either [single-account use](enable-single-user-ipam.md) or [multi-account use](enable-integ-ipam.md).

When you release a CIDR that’s managed by your IPAM, Amazon VPC IPAM recycles the CIDR
back into an IPAM pool. If you are using IPAM in the Advanced Tier, it takes a few minutes
for the CIDR to become available for future allocations. If you are using IPAM in the Free
Tier, it will take up to 48 hours for the CIDR to become available for future allocations.
For more information about pools and allocations, see [How IPAM works](how-it-works-ipam.md).

AWS Management Console

###### To release a pool allocation

1. Open the IPAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ipam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Pools**.

3. From the dropdown menu at the top of the content pane, choose the
    scope you want to use. For more information about scopes, see [How IPAM works](how-it-works-ipam.md).

4. In the content pane, choose the pool that the allocation is in.

5. Choose the **Allocations** tab.

6. Select one or more allocations. You can identify allocations by their
    **Resource type**:

- **custom**: A custom allocation.

- **vpc**: A VPC allocation.

- **ipam-pool**: An IPAM pool allocation.

- **ec2-public-ipv4-pool**: A public IPv4 pool allocation.

- **subnet**: A subnet allocation.

7. Choose **Actions** \> **Release custom allocation**.

8. Choose **Deallocate CIDR**.

Command line

The commands in this section link to the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.
The documentation provides detailed descriptions of the options that you can use
when you run the commands.

Use the following AWS CLI commands to release a pool allocation:

1. Get an IPAM pool ID: [describe-ipam-pools](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-ipam-pools.md)

2. View your current allocations in the pool: [get-ipam-pool-allocations](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-ipam-pool-allocations.md)

3. Release an allocation: [release-ipam-pool-allocation](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/release-ipam-pool-allocation.md)

4. View your updated allocations: [get-ipam-pool-allocations](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-ipam-pool-allocations.md)

To add a new allocation, see [Allocate CIDRs from an IPAM pool](allocate-cidrs-ipam.md). To delete the pool after releasing allocations,
you must first [Deprovision CIDRs from a pool](depro-pool-cidr-ipam.md).
