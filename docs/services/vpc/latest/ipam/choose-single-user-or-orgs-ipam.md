# Configure integration options for your IPAM

This section describes your options for how you can integrate IPAM with AWS Organizations, other AWS accounts, or use it with a single AWS account.

Before you
begin using IPAM, you must choose one of the options in this section to enable IPAM to
monitor CIDRs associated with EC2 networking resources and store metrics:

- To enable IPAM to integrate with AWS Organizations to enable the Amazon VPC
IPAM service to manage and monitor networking resources created by all AWS
Organizations member accounts, see [Integrate IPAM with accounts in an AWS Organization](enable-integ-ipam.md).

- After you integrate with AWS Organizations, to integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organization, see [Integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organization](enable-integ-ipam-outside-org.md).

- To use a single AWS account with IPAM and enable the Amazon VPC IPAM service to
manage and monitor the networking resources you create with the single account, see
[Use IPAM with a single account](enable-single-user-ipam.md).

If you do not choose one of these options, you can still create IPAM resources, such as
pools, but you won't see metrics in your dashboard and you will not be able to monitor the
status of resources.
