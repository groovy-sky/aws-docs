# Monitor IPAM with Amazon CloudWatch

IPAM automatically stores metrics related to IP address usage (such as the IP address
space available in your IPAM pools and the number of resource CIDRs that comply with
allocation rules) and resource utilization in the `AWS/IPAM` [Amazon CloudWatch namespace](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-concepts.md#Namespace) in the home Region of your IPAM.

Integrating IPAM with CloudWatch enhances your ability to monitor, analyze, and optimize your IP address management within AWS.

Use cases include:

- **Tracking IP address utilization trends**: CloudWatch can monitor CIDR
pool usage, scope allocation, and other IPAM metrics, helping you proactively
identify potential IP address exhaustion risks.

- **Setting utilization-based alerts**: You can configure CloudWatch
alarms to notify you when CIDR utilization reaches predetermined thresholds,
enabling timely intervention and optimization.

- **Monitoring IPAM events**: CloudWatch can capture and analyze
IPAM-related events, such as CIDR allocations, deallocations, and scope
modifications, providing visibility into IP address management activities.

- **Generating custom dashboards**: By combining IPAM data with
other AWS metrics, you can create comprehensive dashboards to visualize and
analyze your IP address landscape alongside related infrastructure and performance
indicators.
