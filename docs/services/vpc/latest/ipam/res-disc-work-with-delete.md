# Delete a resource discovery

This section describes how to delete a resource discovery.

###### Note

You cannot delete a default resource discovery. A default resource discovery is one that is
created automatically when you create an IPAM. The default resource discovery is
deleted, however, if you delete the IPAM.

This step must be completed by the **Secondary Org Admin**
**Account**. For more information about the roles involved in this process,
see [Process overview](enable-integ-ipam-outside-org-process.md).
