# Tutorial: Bring your IP addresses to IPAM

The tutorials in this section walk you through the process of bringing public IP address space to AWS and managing the space with IPAM.

Managing public IP address space with IPAM has the following benefits:

- **Improves public IP addresses utilization across your**
**organization**: You can use IPAM to share IP address space across AWS
accounts. Without using IPAM, you cannot share your public IP space across AWS
Organizations accounts.

- **Simplifies the process of bringing public IP space to AWS**:
You can use IPAM to onboard public IP address space once, and then use IPAM to
distribute your public IPs across Regions to resources like EC2 instances and [application load balancers](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-ip-pools.md). Without IPAM, you have to onboard your
public IPs for each AWS Region.
