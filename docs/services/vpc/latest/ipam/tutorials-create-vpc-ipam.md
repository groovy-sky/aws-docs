# Tutorial: Create an IPAM and pools using the AWS CLI

Follow the steps in this tutorial to use the AWS CLI to create an IPAM, create IP address pools,
and allocate a VPC with a CIDR from an IPAM pool.

The following is an example hierarchy of the pool structure that you will create by
following the steps in this section:

- IPAM operating in AWS Region 1, AWS Region 2

- Private scope

- Top-level pool

- Regional pool in AWS Region 2

- Development pool

- Allocation for a VPC

###### Note

In this section, you'll create an IPAM. By default, you can only create one IPAM. For more
information, see [Quotas for your IPAM](quotas-ipam.md). If you have
already delegated an IPAM account and created an IPAM, you can skip steps 1 and
2.

- [Step 8. Create a VPC](#cli-tut-create-vpc-ipam)

- [Step 9. Cleanup](#cli-tut-cleanup-ipam)

## Step 1: Enable IPAM in your organization

This step is optional. Complete this step to enable IPAM in your organization and
configure your delegated IPAM using the AWS CLI. For more information about the role
of the IPAM account, see [Integrate IPAM with accounts in an AWS Organization](enable-integ-ipam.md).

This request must be made from an AWS Organizations management account. When you run
the following command, ensure that you’re using a role with an IAM policy that permits
the following actions:

- `ec2:EnableIpamOrganizationAdminAccount`

- `organizations:EnableAwsServiceAccess`

- `organizations:RegisterDelegatedAdministrator`

- `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`

```nohighlight

aws ec2 enable-ipam-organization-admin-account --region us-east-1 --delegated-admin-account-id 11111111111
```

You should see the following output, indicating that enabling was successful.

```json

{
    "Success": true
}

```

## Step 2: Create an IPAM

Follow the steps in this section to create an IPAM and view additional information
about the scopes that are created. You will use this IPAM when you create pools and
provision IP address ranges for those pools in later steps.

###### Note

The operating Regions option determines which AWS Regions the IPAM pools can be used for.
For more information about operating Regions, see [Create an IPAM](create-ipam.md).

###### To create an IPAM using the AWS CLI

1. Run the following command to create the IPAM instance.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-ipam --description my-ipam --region us-east-1 --operating-regions RegionName=us-west-2
```

When you create an IPAM, AWS automatically does the following:

- Returns a globally unique resource ID ( `IpamId`) for the IPAM.

- Creates a default public scope ( `PublicDefaultScopeId`) and a default private scope
( `PrivateDefaultScopeId`).

```json

{
    "Ipam": {
        "OwnerId": "123456789012",
        "IpamId": "ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
        "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
        "PublicDefaultScopeId": "ipam-scope-02a24107598e982c5",
        "PrivateDefaultScopeId": "ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
        "ScopeCount": 2,
        "Description": "my-ipam",
        "OperatingRegions": [
            {
                "RegionName": "us-west-2"
            },
            {
                "RegionName": "us-east-1"
            }
        ],
        "Tags": []
    }
}
```

2. Run the following command to view additional information related to the
    scopes. The public scope is intended for IP addresses that are going to be
    accessed through the public internet. The private scope is intended for IP addresses
    that are not going to be accessed through the public internet.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-ipam-scopes --region us-east-1
```

In the output, you see the available scopes. You'll use the private scope ID
    in the next step.

```json

{
       "IpamScopes": [
           {
               "OwnerId": "123456789012",
               "IpamScopeId": "ipam-scope-02a24107598e982c5",
               "IpamScopeArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-scope/ipam-scope-02a24107598e982c5",
               "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
               "IpamScopeType": "public",
               "IsDefault": true,
               "PoolCount": 0
           },
           {
               "OwnerId": "123456789012",
               "IpamScopeId": "ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
               "IpamScopeArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-scope/ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
               "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
               "IpamScopeType": "private",
               "IsDefault": true,
               "PoolCount": 0
           }
       ]
}
```

## Step 3: Create an IPv4 address pool

Follow the steps in this section to create an IPv4 address pool.

###### Important

You won't use the `--locale` option on this top-level pool. You will set the locale option later on the Regional pool. The locale is the AWS Region where you want a pool to be available for CIDR allocations. As a result of not setting the locale on the top-level pool, the locale will default to `None`. If a pool has a locale of `None`, the pool won't be available to VPC resources in any AWS Region. You can only manually allocate IP address space in the pool to reserve space.

###### To create an IPv4 address pool for all of your AWS resources using the AWS CLI

1. Run the following command to create an IPv4 address pool. Use the ID of the
    private scope of the IPAM that you created in the previous step.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-ipam-pool --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c --description "top-level-pool" --address-family ipv4
```

In the output, you'll see a state of `create-in-progress` for the
    pool.

```json

{
       "IpamPool": {
           "OwnerId": "123456789012",
           "IpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
           "IpamPoolArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-pool/ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
           "IpamScopeArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-scope/ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
           "IpamScopeType": "private",
           "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
           "Locale": "None",
           "PoolDepth": 1,
           "State": "create-in-progress",
           "Description": "top-level-pool",
           "AutoImport": false,
           "AddressFamily": "ipv4",
           "Tags": []
       }
}
```

2. Run the following command until you see a state of
    `create-complete` in the output.

```

aws ec2 describe-ipam-pools
```

The following example output shows the correct state.

```json

{
       "IpamPools": [
           {
               "OwnerId": "123456789012",
               "IpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
               "IpamPoolArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-pool/ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
               "IpamScopeArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-scope/ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
               "IpamScopeType": "private",
               "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
               "Locale": "None",
               "PoolDepth": 1,
               "State": "create-complete",
               "Description": "top-level-pool",
               "AutoImport": false,
               "AddressFamily": "ipv4"
           }
       ]
}
```

## Step 4: Provision a CIDR to the top-level pool

Follow the steps in this section to provision a CIDR to the top-level pool, and then
verify that the CIDR is provisioned. For more information, see [Provision CIDRs to a pool](prov-cidr-ipam.md).

###### To provision a CIDR block to the pool using the AWS CLI

1. Run the following command to provision the CIDR.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 provision-ipam-pool-cidr --region us-east-1 --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9 --cidr 10.0.0.0/8
```

In the output, you can verify the state of the provisioning.

```json

{
       "IpamPoolCidr": {
           "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
           "State": "pending-provision"
       }
}
```

2. Run the following command until you see a state of `provisioned` in
    the output.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-cidrs --region us-east-1 --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9
```

The following example output shows the correct state.

```json

{
       "IpamPoolCidrs": [
           {
               "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/8",
               "State": "provisioned"
           }
       ]
}
```

## Step 5. Create a Regional pool with CIDR sourced from the top-level pool

When you create an IPAM pool, the pool belongs to the AWS Region of the IPAM by
default. When you create a VPC, the pool that the VPC draws from must be in the same
Region as the VPC. You can use the `--locale` option when you create a pool
to make the pool available to services in a Region other than the Region of the IPAM.
Follow the steps in this section to create a Regional pool in another locale.

###### To create a pool with a CIDR sourced from the previous pool using the AWS CLI

1. Run the following command to create the pool and insert space with a known
    available CIDR from the previous pool.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-ipam-pool --description "regional--pool" --region us-east-1 --ipam-scope-id ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c --source-ipam-pool-id
ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9 --locale us-west-2 --address-family ipv4
```

In the output, you'll see the ID of the pool that you created. You'll need
    this ID in the next step.

```json

{
       "IpamPool": {
           "OwnerId": "123456789012",
           "IpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b",
           "SourceIpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
           "IpamPoolArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-pool/ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b",
           "IpamScopeArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-scope/ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
           "IpamScopeType": "private",
           "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
           "Locale": "us-west-2",
           "PoolDepth": 2,
           "State": "create-in-progress",
           "Description": "regional--pool",
           "AutoImport": false,
           "AddressFamily": "ipv4",
           "Tags": []
       }
}
```

2. Run the following command until you see a state of
    `create-complete` in the output.

```

aws ec2 describe-ipam-pools
```

In the output, you see the pools that you have in your IPAM. In this tutorial,
    we created a top-level and a Regional pool, so you'll see them both.

```json

{
       "IpamPools": [
           {
               "OwnerId": "123456789012",
               "IpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
               "IpamPoolArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-pool/ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
               "IpamScopeArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-scope/ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
               "IpamScopeType": "private",
               "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
               "Locale": "None",
               "PoolDepth": 1,
               "State": "create-complete",
               "Description": "top-level-pool",
               "AutoImport": false,
               "AddressFamily": "ipv4"
           },
           {
               "OwnerId": "123456789012",
               "IpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b",
               "SourceIpamPoolId": "ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9",
               "IpamPoolArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-pool/ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b",
               "IpamScopeArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-scope/ipam-scope-065e7dfe880df679c",
               "IpamScopeType": "private",
               "IpamArn": "arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam/ipam-0de83dba6694560a9",
               "Locale": "us-west-2",
               "PoolDepth": 2,
               "State": "create-complete",
               "Description": "regional--pool",
               "AutoImport": false,
               "AddressFamily": "ipv4"
           }
       ]
}
```

## Step 6: Provision a CIDR to the Regional pool

Follow the steps in this section to assign a CIDR block to the pool, and validate that
it’s been successfully provisioned.

###### To assign a CIDR block to the Regional pool using the AWS CLI

1. Run the following command to provision the CIDR.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 provision-ipam-pool-cidr --region us-east-1 --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b --cidr 10.0.0.0/16
```

In the output, you see the state of the pool.

```json

{
       "IpamPoolCidr": {
           "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
           "State": "pending-provision"
       }
}
```

2. Run the following command until you see the state of `provisioned`
    in the output.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-cidrs --region us-east-1 --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b
```

The following example output shows the correct state.

```json

{
       "IpamPoolCidrs": [
           {
               "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
               "State": "provisioned"
           }
       ]
}
```

3. Run the following command to query the top-level pool to view the allocations.
    The Regional pool is considered an allocation within the top-level pool.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-ipam-pool-allocations --region us-east-1 --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9
```

In the output, you see the Regional pool as an allocation in the top-level
    pool.

```json

{
       "IpamPoolAllocations": [
           {
               "Cidr": "10.0.0.0/16",
               "IpamPoolAllocationId": "ipam-pool-alloc-fbd525f6c2bf4e77a75690fc2d93479a",
               "ResourceId": "ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b",
               "ResourceType": "ipam-pool",
               "ResourceOwner": "123456789012"
           }
       ]
}
```

## Step 7. Create a RAM share for enabling IP assignments across accounts

This step is optional. You can complete this step only if you completed [Integrate IPAM with accounts in an AWS Organization](enable-integ-ipam.md).

When you create an IPAM pool AWS RAM share, it enables IP assignments across
accounts. RAM sharing is only available in your home AWS Region. Note that you create
this share in the same Region as the IPAM, not in the local Region for the pool. All
administrative operations on IPAM resources are made through the home Region of your IPAM. The
example in this tutorial creates a single share for a single pool, but you can add
multiple pools to a single share. For more information, including an explanation of the
options that you must enter, see [Share an IPAM pool using AWS RAM](share-pool-ipam.md).

Run the following command to create a resource share.

```nohighlight

aws ram create-resource-share --region us-east-1 --name pool_share --resource-arns arn:aws:ec2::123456789012:ipam-pool/ipam-pool-0dec9695bca83e606 --principals 123456
```

The output shows that the pool was created.

```json

{
    "resourceShare": {
        "resourceShareArn": "arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/3ab63985-99d9-1cd2-7d24-75e93EXAMPLE",
        "name": "pool_share",
        "owningAccountId": "123456789012",
        "allowExternalPrincipals": false,
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "creationTime": 1565295733.282,
        "lastUpdatedTime": 1565295733.282
    }
}
```

## Step 8. Create a VPC

Run the following command to create a VPC and assign a CIDR block to the VPC from the
pool in your newly created IPAM.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-vpc --region us-east-1 --ipv4-ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-04111dca0d960186e --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/24
```

The output shows that the VPC was created.

```json

{
    "Vpc": {
        "CidrBlock": "10.0.0.0/24",
        "DhcpOptionsId": "dopt-19edf471",
        "State": "pending",
        "VpcId": "vpc-0983f3c454f3d8be5",
        "OwnerId": "123456789012",
        "InstanceTenancy": "default",
        "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet": [],
        "CidrBlockAssociationSet": [
            {
                "AssociationId": "vpc-cidr-assoc-00b24cc1c2EXAMPLE",
                "CidrBlock": "10.0.0.0/24",
                "CidrBlockState": {
                    "State": "associated"
                }
            }
        ],
        "IsDefault": false
    }
}
```

## Step 9. Cleanup

Follow the steps in this section to delete the IPAM resources you've created in this tutorial.

1. Delete the VPC.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 delete-vpc --vpc-id vpc-0983f3c454f3d8be5
```

2. Delete the IPAM pool RAM share.

```nohighlight

aws ram delete-resource-share --resource-share-arn arn:aws:ram:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-share/3ab63985-99d9-1cd2-7d24-75e93EXAMPLE
```

3. Deprovision pool CIDR from the Regional pool.

```nohighlight

    aws ec2 deprovision-ipam-pool-cidr --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0da89c821626f1e4b --region us-east-1
```

4. Deprovision pool CIDR from the top-level pool.

```nohighlight

    aws ec2 deprovision-ipam-pool-cidr --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-0008f25d7187a08d9 --region us-east-1
```
