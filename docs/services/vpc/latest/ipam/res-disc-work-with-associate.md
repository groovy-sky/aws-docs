# Associate a resource discovery with an IPAM

This section describes how to associate a resource discovery with an IPAM. When you
associate a resource discovery with an IPAM, the IPAM monitors all resources CIDRs and
accounts discovered under the resource discovery. When you create an IPAM, a default
resource discovery is created for your IPAM and automatically associated with your
IPAM.

The default quota for resource discovery associations is 5. For more information (including how to adjust this quota), see [Quotas for your IPAM](quotas-ipam.md).

###### Note

Creating, sharing, and associating resource discoveries is part of the process of integrating
IPAM with accounts outside of your organizations (see [Integrate IPAM with accounts outside of your organization](enable-integ-ipam-outside-org.md)). If you are not creating
an IPAM and integrating it with accounts outside your organization, you do not need to create, share, or associate resource discoveries.

If you are integrating an IPAM with accounts outside of your organizations, this is a
required step that must be completed by the **Primary Org IPAM**
**Account**. For more information about the roles involved in this process,
see [Process overview](enable-integ-ipam-outside-org-process.md).
