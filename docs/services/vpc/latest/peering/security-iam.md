# Identity and access management for VPC peering

By default, users cannot create or modify VPC peering connections. To grant access
to VPC peering resources, attach an IAM policy to an IAM identity, such as a role.

###### Examples

- [Create a VPC peering connection](#vpc-peering-iam-create)

- [Accept a VPC peering connection](#vpc-peering-iam-accept)

- [Delete a VPC peering connection](#vpc-peering-iam-delete)

- [Work within a specific account](#vpc-peering-iam-account)

- [Manage VPC peering connections in the console](#peering-connection-console-iam)

For a list of Amazon VPC actions, and the supported resources and conditions keys for each action,
see [Actions, resources, and condition keys\
for Amazon EC2](../../../service-authorization/latest/reference/list-amazonec2.md) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.

## Example: Create a VPC peering connection

The following policy grants users permission to create VPC peering connection requests using
VPCs that are tagged with `Purpose=Peering`. The first statement applies a condition
key ( `ec2:ResourceTag`) to the VPC resource. Note that the VPC resource for the
`CreateVpcPeeringConnection` action is always the requester VPC.

The second statement grants users permission to create the VPC peering connection
resources, and therefore uses the \* wildcard in place of a specific resource ID.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:ResourceTag/Purpose": "Peering"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc-peering-connection/*"
    }
  ]
}

```

The following policy grants users in the specified AWS account permission to create VPC
peering connections using any VPC in the specified Region, but only if the VPC that accepts
the peering connection is a specific VPC in specific account.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc-peering-connection/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "ec2:AccepterVpc": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:vpc/vpc-1234567890abcdef0"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Accept a VPC peering connection

The following policy grants users permission to accept VPC peering connection requests
from a specific AWS account. This helps to prevent users from accepting VPC peering
connection requests from unknown accounts. The statement uses the
`ec2:RequesterVpc` condition key to enforce this.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:AcceptVpcPeeringConnection",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc-peering-connection/*",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "ec2:RequesterVpc": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:vpc/*"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:AcceptVpcPeeringConnection",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/*"
    }
  ]
}

```

The following policy grants users permission to accept VPC peering requests
if the VPC has the tag `Purpose=Peering`.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:AcceptVpcPeeringConnection",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc-peering-connection/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:AcceptVpcPeeringConnection",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:ResourceTag/Purpose": "Peering"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Example: Delete a VPC peering connection

The following policy grants users in the specified account permission to delete any VPC peering
connection, except those that use the specified VPC, which is in the same account. The
policy specifies both the `ec2:AccepterVpc` and `ec2:RequesterVpc`
condition keys, as the VPC might have been the requester VPC or the peer VPC in the
original VPC peering connection request.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DeleteVpcPeeringConnection",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc-peering-connection/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnNotEquals": {
                    "ec2:AccepterVpc": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/vpc-1234567890abcdef0",
                    "ec2:RequesterVpc": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:vpc/vpc-0abcdef1234567890"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Work within a specific account

The following policy grants users permission to work with VPC peering connections
within a specific account. Users can view, create, accept, reject, and delete VPC peering
connections, provided they are all within the same AWS account.

The first statement grants users permission to view all VPC peering connections. The
`Resource` element requires a \* wildcard in this case, as this API action
( `DescribeVpcPeeringConnections`) currently does not support resource-level
permissions.

The second statement grants users permission to create VPC peering connections, and
access to all VPCs in the specified account in order to do so.

The third statement uses a \* wildcard as part of the `Action` element to
grant permission for all VPC peering connection actions. The condition keys ensure that the actions can
only be performed on VPC peering connections with VPCs that are part of the account. For
example, a user is cannot delete a VPC peering connection if either the accepter
or requester VPC is in a different account. A user cannot create a VPC peering
connection with a VPC in a different account.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeVpcPeeringConnections",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection",
                "ec2:AcceptVpcPeeringConnection"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:111122223333:vpc/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:*VpcPeeringConnection",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:111122223333:vpc-peering-connection/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "ec2:AccepterVpc": "arn:aws:ec2:*:111122223333:vpc/*",
                    "ec2:RequesterVpc": "arn:aws:ec2:*:111122223333:vpc/*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Manage VPC peering connections using the console

To view VPC peering connections in the Amazon VPC console, users must have permission to
use the `ec2:DescribeVpcPeeringConnections` action. To use the
**Create Peering Connection** page, users must have permission to
use the `ec2:DescribeVpcs` action. This grants them permission to view and select a VPC.
You can apply resource-level permissions to all the `ec2:*PeeringConnection`
actions, except `ec2:DescribeVpcPeeringConnections`.

The following policy grants users permission to view VPC peering connections, and to use the
**Create VPC Peering Connection** dialog box to create a VPC
peering connection using a specific requester VPC only. If users try to create a VPC
peering connection with a different requester VPC, the request fails.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeVpcPeeringConnections", "ec2:DescribeVpcs"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:CreateVpcPeeringConnection",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:vpc/vpc-1234567890abcdef0",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:vpc-peering-connection/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
