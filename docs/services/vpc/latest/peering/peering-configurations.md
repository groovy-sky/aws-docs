# Common VPC peering connection configurations

This section describes two common types of VPC peering configurations that you can implement:

- **VPC peering configurations with routes to an entire VPC**: In
this configuration, you create a route in each VPC's route table that sends all traffic
destined for the peer VPC to the VPC peering connection. This allows any resource in one
VPC to communicate with any resource in the peer VPC, simplifying management. However,
it also means that all traffic between the VPCs will flow through the peering
connection, which could become a bottleneck if the traffic volume is high.

- **VPC peering configurations with specific routes**:
Alternatively, you can create more granular routes in each VPC's route table that only
send traffic to specific subnets or resources in the peer VPC. This allows you to limit
the traffic flowing through the peering connection to only what is necessary, which can
be more efficient. However, it also requires more maintenance, as you'll need to update
the route tables any time you add new resources in the peer VPC that need to
communicate.

The best approach depends on factors like the size and complexity of your VPC architecture, the volume of traffic expected between the VPCs, and your organizational needs around security and resource access. Many enterprises use a hybrid approach, with broad routes for common traffic patterns and specific routes for more sensitive or bandwidth-intensive use cases.
