# Disable trusted access in Reachability Analyzer

After you disable trusted access, the users in the management account and delegated
administrator accounts can't run a new cross-account analysis in Reachability Analyzer. However, they can
still see the previously run analyses. Before you can disable trusted access, you must
deregister the delegated administrator accounts.

You can enable trusted access again after disabling it. However, you must first
re-register the delegated administrator accounts.

###### To disable trusted access using the console

1. Sign in to the management account.

2. Open the Network Manager console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home).

3. From the navigation pane, choose **Reachability Analyzer**,
    **Settings**.

4. For **Trusted Access**, choose **Turn off trusted**
**access**.

5. Do not close or navigate away from this page until you see a success
    notification indicating that trusted access is turned off. This can take
    several minutes.

###### To disable trusted access using the AWS CLI

From the management account, use the [disable-aws-service-access](../../../cli/latest/reference/organizations/disable-aws-service-access.md) command.
