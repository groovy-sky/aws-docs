# Troubleshoot cross-account analyses in Reachability Analyzer

The following information can help you troubleshoot common issues with running
cross-account analyses in Reachability Analyzer.

###### Issues

- ["StackSet is not empty" or "StackSet already exists"](#stackset-not-empty)

- ["Error fetching resources"](#error-fetching-resources)

- ["Organizational unit not found in StackSet"](#organizational-unit-not-found)

## "StackSet is not empty" or "StackSet already exists"

If you receive one of these errors while enabling trusted access, do the following
to resolve the issue.

###### To resolve the issue

1. Choose **Turn off trusted access**.

2. Wait until you see a banner at the top of the screen indicating that the operation
    was successful.

3. Choose **Turn on trusted access**.

## "Error fetching resources"

If you receive this error while attempting to access resources from another
account in the organization, it usually indicates that your account doesn't
have all permissions required.

- Verify that you have permission to call the `AssumeRole` and
`SetSourceIdentity` API actions. For example, the following policy
grants permission to call these actions.
JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "sts:AssumeRole",
                  "sts:SetSourceIdentity"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
}

```

- Verify that you have permission to call CloudFormation API actions. For example, the
[AWSCloudFormationFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awscloudformationfullaccess.md) and [AWSCloudFormationReadOnlyAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awscloudformationreadonlyaccess.md) policies grant permissions to
call these actions.

- Verify that you have permission to call AWS Organizations API actions. For example, the
[AWSOrganizationsFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsorganizationsfullaccess.md) and [AWSOrganizationsReadOnlyAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsorganizationsreadonlyaccess.md) policies grant permissions to
call these actions.

## "Organizational unit not found in StackSet"

If you receive this error while disabling trusted access, do the following to
resolve the issue.

###### To resolve the issue

1. Open the CloudFormation console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**.

3. Select `ReachabilityAnalyzerCrossAccountResourceAccessStackSet`
    and then choose **Actions**, **Delete StackSet**.

4. Return to the Reachability Analyzer settings page and refresh the page.

5. Choose **Turn off trusted access**.
