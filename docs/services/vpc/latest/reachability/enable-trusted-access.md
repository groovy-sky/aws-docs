# Enable trusted access in Reachability Analyzer

When you enable trusted access, Reachability Analyzer deploys the [AWSServiceRoleForReachabilityAnalyzer](using-service-linked-roles.md)
service-linked role and the required [cross-account access roles](cross-account-access-roles.md) to all accounts in your organization.

###### To enable trusted access using the console

1. Sign in to the management account.

2. Open the Network Manager console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home).

3. From the navigation pane, choose **Reachability Analyzer**,
    **Settings**.

4. For **Trusted Access**, choose **Turn on trusted**
**access**.

5. Do not close or navigate away from this page until you see a success
    notification indicating that trusted access is turned on. This can take
    several minutes.

###### To enable trusted access using the AWS CLI

From the management account, use the [enable-reachability-analyzer-organization-sharing](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/enable-reachability-analyzer-organization-sharing.md) command.
