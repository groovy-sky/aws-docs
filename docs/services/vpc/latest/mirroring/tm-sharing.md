# Share a traffic mirror target

A traffic mirror target can be owned by an AWS account that is different from the
traffic mirror source.

You can use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a traffic mirror target across accounts. Use the
following procedure to share a traffic mirror target that you own.

You must create a traffic mirror target before you share it. For more information, see
[Create or delete a traffic mirror target](create-traffic-mirroring-target.md).

###### To share a traffic mirror target

1. Open the AWS Resource Access Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram).

2. Choose **Create a resource share**.

3. Under **Description**, for **Name**, enter a
    descriptive name for the resource share.

4. For **Select resource type**, choose **Traffic Mirror**
**Targets**. Select the traffic mirror target.

5. For **Principals**, add principals to the resource share. For each
    AWS account, OU, or organization, specify its ID and choose
    **Add**.

For **Allow external accounts**, choose whether to allow sharing
    for this resource with AWS accounts that are external to your organization.

6. (Optional) Under **Tags**, enter a tag key and tag value pair for
    each tag. These tags are applied to the resource share but not to the traffic mirror
    target.

7. Choose **Create resource share**.
