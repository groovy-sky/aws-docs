# Identity and access management for Traffic Mirroring

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps an administrator securely control access
to AWS resources. Administrators control who can be _authenticated_
(signed in) and _authorized_ (have permissions) to use traffic mirror
resources.

To allow access to traffic mirror resources, you create and attach an IAM policy
to an IAM role and users or groups assume that role.

The IAM role must be given permission to use specific traffic mirror resources and
API actions. When you attach a policy to a role, it allows or
denies permission to perform the specified tasks on the specified resources.

You can also use resource-level permissions to restrict what resources users can use when
they invoke APIs.

###### Example: CreateTrafficMirrorSession policy

The following IAM policy allows users to use the
`CreateTrafficMirrorSession` API, but restricts the action to a
specific traffic mirror target ( `tmt-12345645678`). To create a
traffic mirror session, users must also have permission to use the traffic mirror
filter and network interface resources. Therefore, you must include these resources
in the IAM policy attached to the role.
