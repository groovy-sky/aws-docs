# Create or delete a traffic mirror target

A traffic mirror target is the destination for mirrored traffic. For more information, see
[Understand traffic mirror target concepts](traffic-mirroring-targets.md).

Before you can delete a traffic mirror target, you must remove it from any traffic mirror sessions.

After you create a target, assign it to a traffic mirror session. For more
information, see [Create, modify, or delete a traffic mirror session](create-traffic-mirroring-session.md).

You must configure a security group for the traffic mirror target that allows VXLAN traffic
(UDP port 4789) from the traffic mirror source.

You can share a traffic mirror target across accounts. For more information, see
[Share a traffic mirror target](tm-sharing.md).
