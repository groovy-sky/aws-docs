# Manage DNS names for VPC endpoint services

Service providers can configure private DNS names for their endpoint services. Suppose
that a service provider makes their service available through a public endpoint and as an
endpoint service. If the service provider uses the DNS name of the public endpoint as the
private DNS name of the endpoint service, then service consumers can access the public
endpoint or the endpoint service using the same client application, without modification. If a
request comes from the service consumer VPC, the private DNS servers resolve the DNS name to
the IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces. Otherwise, the public DNS servers resolve
the DNS name to the public endpoint.

Before you can configure a private DNS name for your endpoint service, you must prove
that you own the domain by performing a domain ownership verification check.

###### Considerations

- An endpoint service can have only one private DNS name.

- When the consumer creates an interface endpoint to connect to your service, we create
a private hosted zone and associate it with the service consumer VPC. We create a CNAME
record in the private hosted zone that maps the private DNS name of the endpoint service
to the regional DNS name of the VPC endpoint. When a consumer sends a request to the
public DNS name of the service, the private DNS servers resolve the request to the IP
addresses of the endpoint network interfaces.

- To verify a domain, you must have a public hostname or a public DNS provider.

- You can verify the domain of a subdomain. For example, you can verify
_example.com_, instead of
_a.example.com_. Each DNS label can have up to 63 characters
and the whole domain name must not exceed a total length of 255 characters.

If you add an additional subdomain, you must verify the subdomain, or the
domain. For example, let's say you had _a.example.com_, and
verified _example.com_. You now add
_b.example.com_ as a private DNS name. You must verify
_example.com_ or _b.example.com_
before service consumers can use the name.

- Private DNS names are not supported for Gateway Load Balancer endpoints.

## Domain ownership verification

Your domain is associated with a set of domain name service (DNS) records that you
manage through your DNS provider. A TXT record is a type of DNS record that provides
additional information about your domain. It consists of a name and a value. As part of the
verification process, you must add a TXT record to the DNS server for your public
domain.

Domain ownership verification is complete when we detect the existence of the
TXT record in your domain's DNS settings.

After you add a record, you can check the status of the domain verification process
using the Amazon VPC console. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint**
**services**. Select the endpoint service and check the value of **Domain**
**verification status** in the **Details** tab. If domain
verification is pending, wait a few minutes and refresh the screen. If needed, you can
initiate the verification process manually. Choose **Actions**,
**Verify domain ownership for private DNS name**.

The private DNS name is ready for use by service consumers when the verification
status is **verified**. If the verification status changes, new
connection requests are denied but existing connections are not affected.

If the verification status is **failed**, see [Troubleshoot domain verification issues](#troubleshoot-domain-verification).

## Get the name and value

We provide you with the name and value that you use in the TXT record. For example,
the information is available in the AWS Management Console. Select the endpoint service and see
**Domain verification name** and **Domain verification value**
on the **Details** tab for the endpoint service. You can also use the
following [describe-vpc-endpoint-service-configurations](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoint-service-configurations.md) AWS CLI command to retrieve
information about the configuration of the private DNS name for the specified endpoint
service.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-service-configurations \
    --service-ids vpce-svc-071afff70666e61e0 \
    --query ServiceConfigurations[*].PrivateDnsNameConfiguration
```

The following is example output. You'll use `Value` and `Name`
when you create the TXT record.

```json

[
    {
        "State": "pendingVerification",
        "Type": "TXT",
        "Value": "vpce:l6p0ERxlTt45jevFwOCp",
        "Name": "_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m"
    }
]
```

For example, suppose that your domain name is _example.com_ and that
`Value` and `Name` are as shown in the preceding example output. The
following table is an example of the TXT record settings.

NameTypeValue

\_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m.example.com

TXT

vpce:l6p0ERxlTt45jevFwOCp

We suggest that you use `Name` as the record subdomain because the base domain
name might already be in use. However, if your DNS provider does not allow DNS record names
to contain underscores, you can omit the "\_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m" and simply use "example.com"
in the TXT record.

After we verify "\_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m.example.com", service consumers can use "example.com"
or a subdomain (for example, "service.example.com" or "my.service.example.com").

## Add a TXT record to your domain's DNS server

The procedure for adding TXT records to your domain's DNS server depends on who provides your DNS service.
Your DNS provider might be Amazon Route 53 or another domain name registrar.

Create a record for your public hosted zone using a simple routing policy. Use the following values:

- For **Record name** enter the domain or subdomain.

- For **Record type**, choose **TXT**.

- For **Value/Route traffic to**, enter the domain verification value.

- For **TTL (seconds)**, enter `1800`.

For more information, see [Create records using the console](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/resource-record-sets-creating.md) in the _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

Go to the website for your DNS provider and sign in to your account. Find the page
to update the DNS records for your domain. Add a TXT record with the name and value that
we provided. It can take up to 48 hours for DNS record updates to take effect, but they
often take effect much sooner.

For more specific directions, consult the documentation from your DNS provider. The
following table provides links to the documentation for several common DNS providers.

## Check whether the TXT record is published

You can verify that your private DNS name domain ownership verification TXT record is
published correctly to your DNS server using the following steps. You'll run the
**nslookup** command, which is available for Windows and Linux.

You'll query the DNS servers that serve your domain because those servers contain the
most up-to-date information for your domain. Your domain information takes time to propagate
to other DNS servers.

###### To verify that your TXT record is published to your DNS server

1. Find the name servers for your domain using the following command.

```nohighlight

nslookup -type=NS example.com
```

The output lists the name servers that serve your domain. You'll query one of
    these servers in the next step.

2. Verify that the TXT record is correctly published using the following command,
    where `name_server` is one of the name servers that you
    found in the previous step.

```nohighlight

nslookup -type=TXT  _6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m.example.com name_server
```

3. In the output of the previous step, verify that the string that follows
    `text =` matches the TXT value.

In our example, if the record is correctly published, the output includes the
    following.

```nohighlight

_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m.example.com text = "vpce:l6p0ERxlTt45jevFwOCp"
```

## Troubleshoot domain verification issues

If the domain verification process fails, the following information can help you
troubleshoot issues.

- Check whether your DNS provider allows underscores in TXT record names. If your DNS
provider does not allow underscores, you can omit the domain verification name (for
example, "\_6e86v84tqgqubxbwii1m") from the TXT record.

- Check whether your DNS provider appended the domain name to the end of the TXT record.
Some DNS providers automatically append the name of your domain to the attribute name of
the TXT record. To avoid this duplication of the domain name, add a period to the end of
the domain name when you create the TXT record. This tells your DNS provider that it isn't
necessary to append the domain name to the TXT record.

- Check whether your DNS provider modified the DNS record value to use only lowercase
letters. We verify your domain only when there is a verification record with an
attribute value that exactly matches the value that we provided. If the DNS provider
changed your TXT record values to use only lowercase letters, contact them for
assistance.

- You might need to verify your domain more than once because you're supporting
multiple Regions or multiple AWS accounts. If your DNS provider doesn't allow you to
have more than one TXT record with the same attribute name, check whether your DNS
provider allows you to assign multiple attribute values to the same TXT record.
For example, if your DNS is managed by Amazon Route 53, you can use the following procedure.

1. In the Route 53 console, choose the TXT record that you created when you
    verified your domain in the first Region.

2. For **Value**, go to the end of the existing
    attribute value, and then press Enter.

3. Add the attribute value for the additional Region, and then save the
    record set.

If your DNS provider doesn't allow you to assign multiple values to the same
TXT record, you can verify the domain once with the value in the attribute name
of the TXT record, and one other time with the value removed from the attribute
name. However, you can only verify the same domain two times.
