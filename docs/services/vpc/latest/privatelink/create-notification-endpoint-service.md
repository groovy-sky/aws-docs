# Receive alerts for endpoint service events

You can create a notification to receive alerts for specific events related to your
endpoint service. For example, you can receive an email when a connection request is
accepted or rejected.

###### Tasks

- [Create an SNS notification](#create-sns-notification-endpoint-service)

- [Add an access policy](#add-access-policy-endpoint-service)

- [Add a key policy](#add-key-policy-endpoint-service)

## Create an SNS notification

Use the following procedure to create an Amazon SNS topic for the notifications and
subscribe to the topic.

###### To create a notification for an endpoint service using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. From the **Notifications** tab, choose **Create**
**notification**.

5. For **Notification ARN**, choose the ARN for the
    SNS topic that you created.

6. To subscribe to an event, select it from **Events**.

- **Connect** – The service consumer created the interface endpoint.
This sends a connection request to the service provider.

- **Accept** – The service provider accepted the connection request.

- **Reject** – The service provider rejected the connection request.

- **Delete** – The service consumer deleted the interface endpoint.

7. Choose **Create notification**.

###### To create a notification for an endpoint service using the command line

- [create-vpc-endpoint-connection-notification](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc-endpoint-connection-notification.md) (AWS CLI)

- [New-EC2VpcEndpointConnectionNotification](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2vpcendpointconnectionnotification.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)

## Add an access policy

Add an access policy to the SNS topic that allows AWS PrivateLink to publish notifications
on your behalf, such as the following. For more information, see [How do I edit my Amazon SNS\
topic's access policy?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/sns-edit-topic-access-policy) Use the `aws:SourceArn` and
`aws:SourceAccount` global condition keys to protect against the [confused deputy problem](../../../iam/latest/userguide/confused-deputy.md).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "vpce.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "SNS:Publish",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:topic-name",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111111111111:vpc-endpoint-service/service-id"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "111111111111"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Add a key policy

If you're using encrypted SNS topics, the resource policy for the KMS key must trust
AWS PrivateLink to call AWS KMS API operations. The following is an example key policy.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "vpce.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111111111111:key/key-id",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111111111111:vpc-endpoint-service/service-id"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "111111111111"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```
