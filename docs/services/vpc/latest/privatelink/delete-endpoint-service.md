# Delete an endpoint service

When you are finished with an endpoint service, you can delete it. You can't delete
an endpoint service if there are any endpoints connected to the endpoint service that
are in the `available` or `pending-acceptance` state.

Deleting an endpoint service does not delete the associated load balancer and does
not affect the application servers registered with the load balancer target groups.

###### To delete an endpoint service using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Delete endpoint services**.

5. When prompted for confirmation, enter `delete` and
    then choose **Delete**.
