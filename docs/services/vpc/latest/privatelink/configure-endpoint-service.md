# Configure an endpoint service

After you create an endpoint service, you can update its configuration.

###### Tasks

- [Manage permissions](#add-remove-permissions)

- [Accept or reject connection requests](#accept-reject-connection-requests)

- [Manage load balancers](#associate-load-balancer)

- [Associate a private DNS name](#associate-private-dns-name)

- [Modify the supported Regions](#manage-supported-regions)

- [Modify the supported IP address types](#supported-ip-address-types)

- [Manage tags](#add-remove-endpoint-service-tags)

## Manage permissions

The combination of permissions and acceptance settings help you control which
service consumers (AWS principals) can access your endpoint service. For example,
you can grant permissions to specific principals that you trust and automatically
accept all connection requests, or you can grant permissions to a wider group of
principals and manually accept specific connection requests that you trust.

By default, your endpoint service is not available to service consumers. You must add
permissions that allow specific AWS principals to create an interface VPC endpoint to
connect to your endpoint service. To add permissions for an AWS principal, you need its
Amazon Resource Name (ARN). The following list includes example ARNs for supported AWS
principals.

###### ARNs for AWS principals

AWS account (includes all principals in the account)

arn:aws:iam:: `account_id`:root

Role

arn:aws:iam:: `account_id`:role/ `role_name`

User

arn:aws:iam:: `account_id`:user/ `user_name`

All principals in all AWS accounts

\*

###### Considerations

- If you grant everyone permission to access the endpoint service and configure the
endpoint service to accept all requests, your load balancer will be public even if it has
no public IP address.

- If you remove permissions, it does not affect existing connections between
the endpoint and the service that were previously accepted.

###### To manage permissions for your endpoint service using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service and choose the **Allow principals**
    tab.

4. To add permissions, choose **Allow principals**. For
    **Principals to add**, enter the ARN of the principal. To add
    another principal, choose **Add principal**. When you are finished
    adding principals, choose **Allow principals**.

5. To remove permissions, select the principal and choose **Actions**,
    **Delete**. When prompted for confirmation, enter `delete`
    and then choose **Delete**.

###### To add permissions for your endpoint service using the command line

- [modify-vpc-endpoint-service-permissions](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-endpoint-service-permissions.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Edit-EC2EndpointServicePermission](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2endpointservicepermission.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)

## Accept or reject connection requests

The combination of permissions and acceptance settings help you control which
service consumers (AWS principals) can access your endpoint service. For example,
you can grant permissions to specific principals that you trust and automatically
accept all connection requests, or you can grant permissions to a wider group of
principals and manually accept specific connection requests that you trust.

You can configure your endpoint service to accept connection requests automatically.
Otherwise, you must accept or reject them manually. If you do not accept a connection
request, the service consumer can't access your endpoint service.

If you grant everyone permission to access the endpoint service and configure the
endpoint service to accept all requests, your load balancer will be public even if it has
no public IP address.

You can receive a notification when a connection request is accepted or rejected.
For more information, see [Receive alerts for endpoint service events](create-notification-endpoint-service.md).

###### To modify the acceptance setting using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Modify endpoint acceptance**
**setting**.

5. Select or clear **Acceptance required**.

6. Choose **Save changes**

###### To modify the acceptance setting using the command line

- [modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Edit-EC2VpcEndpointServiceConfiguration](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2vpcendpointserviceconfiguration.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)

###### To accept or reject a connection request using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. From the **Endpoint connections** tab, select the
    endpoint connection.

5. To accept the connection request, choose **Actions**,
    **Accept endpoint connection request**. When prompted for
    confirmation, enter `accept` and then choose
    **Accept**.

6. To reject the connection request, choose **Actions**,
    **Reject endpoint connection request**. When prompted for
    confirmation, enter `reject` and then choose
    **Reject**.

###### To accept or reject a connection request using the command line

- [accept-vpc-endpoint-connections](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/accept-vpc-endpoint-connections.md) or [reject-vpc-endpoint-connections](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/reject-vpc-endpoint-connections.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Approve-EC2EndpointConnection](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/approve-ec2endpointconnection.md) or [Deny-EC2EndpointConnection](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/deny-ec2endpointconnection.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)

## Manage load balancers

You can manage the load balancers that are associated with your endpoint service. You
can't disassociate a load balancer if there are endpoints connected to your endpoint
service.

If you enable another Availability Zone for your load balancers, the Availability Zone
will appear under the **Load Balancers** tab on the **Endpoint**
**services** page. However, it won't be enabled for the endpoint service or listed
in the **Details** tab of your endpoint service on the AWS Management Console. You need
to enable the endpoint service for the new Availability Zone.

It might take a few minutes for the load balancer’s Availability Zone to be ready for
your endpoint service. If you are using an automation, we recommend that you add a wait in
your automation process before you enable the endpoint service for the new Availability
Zone.

###### To manage the load balancers for your endpoint service using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Associate or disassociate load**
**balancers**.

5. Change the endpoint service configuration as needed. For example:
   - Select the check box for a load balancer to associate it with the endpoint service.

   - Clear the check box for a load balancer to disassociate it from the endpoint service.
      You must keep at least one load balancer selected.
6. Choose **Save changes**

The endpoint service will be enabled for any new Availability Zones you added to
    your load balancer. The new Availability Zone is listed under the **Load**
**Balancers** tab and the **Details** tab of the endpoint
    service.

After you enable an Availability Zone for the endpoint service, service consumers can
add a subnet from that Availability Zone to their interface VPC endpoints.

###### To manage the load balancers for your endpoint service using the command line

- [modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Edit-EC2VpcEndpointServiceConfiguration](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2vpcendpointserviceconfiguration.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)

To enable the endpoint service in an Availability Zone that was recently enabled for
the load balancer, simply call the command with the ID of the endpoint service.

## Associate a private DNS name

You can associate a private DNS name with your endpoint service. After you associate
a private DNS name, you must update the entry for the domain on your DNS server. Before
service consumers can use the private DNS name, the service provider must verify that
they own the domain. For more information, see [Manage DNS names](manage-dns-names.md).

###### To modify an endpoint service private DNS name using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Modify private DNS name**.

5. Select **Associate a private DNS name with the service** and
    enter the private DNS name.

- Domain names must use lowercase.

- You can use wildcards in domain names (for example,
`*.myexampleservice.com`).

6. Choose **Save changes**.

7. The private DNS name is ready for use by service consumers when the verification
    status is **verified**. If the verification status changes, new
    connection requests are denied but existing connections are not affected.

###### To modify an endpoint service private DNS name using the command line

- [modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Edit-EC2VpcEndpointServiceConfiguration](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2vpcendpointserviceconfiguration.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)

###### To initiate the domain verification process using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Verify domain ownership**
**for private DNS name**.

5. When prompted for confirmation, enter `verify` and
    then choose **Verify**.

###### To initiate the domain verification process using the command line

- [start-vpc-endpoint-service-private-dns-verification](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-vpc-endpoint-service-private-dns-verification.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Start-EC2VpcEndpointServicePrivateDnsVerification](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/start-ec2vpcendpointserviceprivatednsverification.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)

## Modify the supported Regions

You can modify the set of supported Regions for your endpoint service. Before you can
add an opt-in Region, you must opt in. You can't remove the Region that hosts your endpoint
service.

After you remove a Region, service consumers can't create new endpoints that specify
it as the service Region. Removing a Region doesn't affect existing endpoints that
specify it as the service Region. When you remove a Region, we recommend that you reject
any existing endpoint connections from that Region.

###### To modify the supported Regions for your endpoint service

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the endpoint service.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Modify supported Regions**.

5. Select and deselect Regions as needed.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

## Modify the supported IP address types

You can change the IP address types that are supported by your endpoint service.

###### Consideration

To enable your endpoint service to accept IPv6 requests, its Network Load Balancers must use the
dualstack IP address type. The targets do not need to support IPv6 traffic. For more
information, see [IP\
address type](../../../elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/network-load-balancers.md#ip-address-type) in the _User Guide for Network Load Balancers_.

###### To modify the supported IP address types using the console

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoint services**.

3. Select the VPC endpoint service.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Modify supported IP address types**.

5. For **Supported IP address types**, do one of the following:

- Select **IPv4** – Enable the endpoint service to accept
IPv4 requests.

- Select **IPv6** – Enable the endpoint service to accept
IPv6 requests.

- Select **IPv4** and **IPv6** – Enable the
endpoint service to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 requests.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

###### To modify the supported IP address types using the command line

- [modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-endpoint-service-configuration.md) (AWS CLI)

- [Edit-EC2VpcEndpointServiceConfiguration](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2vpcendpointserviceconfiguration.md) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)
