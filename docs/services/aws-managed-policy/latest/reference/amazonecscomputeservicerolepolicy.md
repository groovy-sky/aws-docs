# AmazonECSComputeServiceRolePolicy

**Description**: Policy to enable Amazon ECS Compute to manage your EC2 instances and related resources as part of ECS managed instances

`AmazonECSComputeServiceRolePolicy` is an [AWS managed policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies).

## Using this policy

This policy is attached to a service-linked role that allows the service to perform actions on
your behalf. You cannot attach this policy to your users, groups, or roles.

## Policy details

- **Type**: Service-linked role policy

- **Creation time**: March 24, 2025, 17:37 UTC

- **Edited time:** February 12, 2026, 17:57 UTC

- **ARN**:
`arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/aws-service-role/AmazonECSComputeServiceRolePolicy`

## Policy version

**Policy version:** v6 (default)

The policy's default version is the version that defines the permissions for the policy. When a user or role with the policy makes a
request to access an AWS resource, AWS checks the default version of the policy to determine whether to allow the request.
