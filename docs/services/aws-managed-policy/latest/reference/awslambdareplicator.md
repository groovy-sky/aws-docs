# AWSLambdaReplicator

**Description**: Grants Lambda Replicator necessary permissions to replicate functions across regions

`AWSLambdaReplicator` is an [AWS managed policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies).

## Using this policy

This policy is attached to a service-linked role that allows the service to perform actions on
your behalf. You cannot attach this policy to your users, groups, or roles.

## Policy details

- **Creation time**: May 23, 2017, 17:53 UTC

- **Edited time:** December 08, 2017, 00:17 UTC

## Policy version

The policy's default version is the version that defines the permissions for the policy. When a user or role with the policy makes a
request to access an AWS resource, AWS checks the default version of the policy to determine whether to allow the request.
