## Using this policy

This policy is attached to a service-linked role that allows the service to perform actions on
your behalf. You cannot attach this policy to your users, groups, or roles.

## Policy version

The policy's default version is the version that defines the permissions for the policy. When a user or role with the policy makes a
request to access an AWS resource, AWS checks the default version of the policy to determine whether to allow the request.
