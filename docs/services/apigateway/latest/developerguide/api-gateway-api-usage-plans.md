# Usage plans and API keys for REST APIs in API Gateway

After you create, test, and deploy your APIs, you can use API Gateway usage plans to make them available as product
offerings for your customers. You can configure usage plans and API keys to allow customers to access selected APIs,
and begin throttling requests to those APIs based on defined limits and quotas. These can be set at the API, or API
method level.

## What are usage plans and API keys?

A _usage plan_ specifies who can access one or more deployed API stages and
methods—and optionally sets the target request rate to start throttling requests. The plan uses API keys to
identify API clients and who can access the associated API stages for each key.

_API keys_ are alphanumeric string values that you distribute to
application developer customers to grant access to your API. You can use API keys
together with [Lambda authorizers](apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.md), [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/permissions.html), or
[Amazon Cognito](apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.md) to control
access to your APIs. API Gateway can generate API keys on your behalf, or you can import them
from a [CSV file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-key-file-format.html). You can generate an API key
in API Gateway, or import it into API Gateway from an external source. For more information, see
[Set up API keys for REST APIs in API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-setup-api-keys.html).

An API key has a name and a value. (The terms "API key" and "API key value" are often
used interchangeably.) The name cannot exceed 1024 characters. The value is an alphanumeric string between 20 and 128
characters, for example, `apikey1234abcdefghij0123456789`.

###### Important

API key values must be unique. If you try to create two API keys with different
names and the same value, API Gateway considers them to be the same API key.

An API key can be associated with more than one usage plan. A usage plan can be
associated with more than one stage. However, a given API key can only be associated
with one usage plan for each stage of your API.

A _throttling limit_ sets the target point at which request throttling should start. This
can be set at the API or API method level.

A _quota limit_ sets the target maximum number of requests with a given API key that can be
submitted within a specified time interval. You can configure individual API methods to require API key
authorization based on usage plan configuration.

Throttling and quota limits apply to requests for individual API keys that are aggregated across all API
stages within a usage plan.

###### Note

Usage plan throttling and quotas are not hard limits, and are applied on a best-effort basis. In some cases,
clients can exceed the quotas that you set. Don’t rely on usage plan quotas or throttling to control costs or
block access to an API. Consider using [AWS Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) to monitor costs and
[AWS WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) to manage API
requests.

## Best practices for API keys and usage plans

The following are suggested best practices to follow when using API keys and usage
plans.

###### Important

- Don't use API keys for authentication or authorization to control access to your APIs. If you have
multiple APIs in a usage plan, a user with a valid API key for one API in that usage plan can access
_all_ APIs in that usage plan. Instead, to control access to your API, use an IAM
role, a [Lambda authorizer](apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.md), or an [Amazon Cognito user pool](apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.md).

- Use API keys that API Gateway generates. API keys shouldn't include confidential information; clients typically transmit them in headers that can be logged.

- If you're using a developer portal to publish your APIs, note that all your APIs in a given usage plan can
be subscribed to by customers, even if you haven't made them visible to your customers.

- In some cases, clients can exceed the quotas that you set. Don’t rely on usage plans to control costs.
Consider using [AWS Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) to monitor costs and [AWS WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) to manage API requests.

- After you add an API key to a usage plan, the update operation might take a few minutes to complete.
