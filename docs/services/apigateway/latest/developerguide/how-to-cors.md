# CORS for REST APIs in API Gateway

[Cross-origin resource\
sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP
requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser. For more information, see [What is CORS?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cross-origin-resource-sharing).

## Determining whether to enable CORS support

A _cross-origin_ HTTP request is one that is made to:

- A different _domain_ (for example, from
`example.com` to `amazondomains.com`)

- A different _subdomain_ (for example, from
`example.com` to `petstore.example.com`)

- A different _port_ (for example, from
`example.com` to `example.com:10777`)

- A different _protocol_ (for example, from
`https://example.com` to `http://example.com`)

If you cannot access your API and receive an error message that contains `Cross-Origin Request Blocked`,
you might need to enable CORS.

Cross-origin HTTP requests can be divided into two types: _simple_
requests and _non-simple_ requests.

## Enabling CORS for a simple request

An HTTP request is _simple_ if all of the following conditions are
true:

- It is issued against an API resource that allows only `GET`,
`HEAD`, and `POST` requests.

- If it is a `POST` method request, it must include an
`Origin` header.

- The request payload content type is `text/plain`,
`multipart/form-data`, or
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

- The request does not contain custom headers.

- Any additional requirements that are listed in the [Mozilla CORS documentation for simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

For simple cross-origin `POST` method requests, the response from your
resource needs to include the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:'origin'`.

All other cross-origin HTTP requests are _non-simple_ requests.

## Enabling CORS for a non-simple request

If
your API's resources receive non-simple requests, you must enable additional CORS support depending on your integration type.

### Enabling CORS for non-proxy integrations

For these integrations, the [CORS\
protocol](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) requires the browser to send a preflight request to the server and wait for approval (or a
request for credentials) from the server before sending the actual request. You must configure your API to send
an appropriate response to the preflight request.

To create a preflight response:

1. Create an `OPTIONS` method with a mock integration.

2. Add the following response headers to the 200 method response:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`

- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

3. Set the integration passthrough behavior to `NEVER`. In this case, the method request of an
    unmapped content type will be rejected with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response. For more information, see
    [Method request behavior for payloads without mapping templates for REST APIs in API Gateway](integration-passthrough-behaviors.md).

4. Enter values for the response headers. To allow all origins, all methods, and common headers, use the following header values:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: 'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token'`

- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: 'DELETE,GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,POST,PATCH'`

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'`

After creating the preflight request, you must return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'` or
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin:'origin'` header for all CORS-enabled methods for at least all 200 responses.

### Enabling CORS for non-proxy integrations using the AWS Management Console

You can use the AWS Management Console to enable CORS. API Gateway creates an `OPTIONS` method and adds the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to your existing method
integration responses. This doesn’t always work, and sometimes you need to manually
modify the integration response to return the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for all CORS-enabled methods for at least all 200 responses.

If you have binary media types set to `*/*` for your API, when API Gateway creates an
`OPTIONS` method, change the `contentHandling`
to `CONVERT_TO_TEXT`.

The following
[update-integration](../../../cli/latest/reference/apigateway/update-integration.md) command changes the
`contentHandling` to `CONVERT_TO_TEXT` for an integration request:

```nohighlight

aws apigateway update-integration \
  --rest-api-id abc123 \
  --resource-id aaa111 \
  --http-method OPTIONS \
  --patch-operations op='replace',path='/contentHandling',value='CONVERT_TO_TEXT'
```

The following [update-integration-response](../../../cli/latest/reference/apigateway/update-integration-response.md) command changes the
`contentHandling` to `CONVERT_TO_TEXT` for an integration response:

```nohighlight

aws apigateway update-integration-response \
  --rest-api-id abc123 \
  --resource-id aaa111 \
  --http-method OPTIONS \
  --status-code 200 \
  --patch-operations op='replace',path='/contentHandling',value='CONVERT_TO_TEXT'
```

## Enabling CORS support for proxy integrations

For a Lambda proxy integration or HTTP proxy integration, your backend is responsible for returning the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`,
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and
`Access-Control-Allow-Headers` headers, because a proxy integration doesn't return an integration response.

The following example Lambda functions return the required CORS headers:

Node.js

```javascript

export const handler = async (event) => {
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        headers: {
            "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" : "Content-Type",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://www.example.com",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "OPTIONS,POST,GET"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
    };
    return response;
};
```

Python 3

```python

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'headers': {
            'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://www.example.com',
            'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS,POST,GET'
        },
        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')
    }
```
