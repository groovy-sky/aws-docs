# Export HTTP APIs from API Gateway

After you've created an HTTP API, you can export an OpenAPI 3.0 definition of your
API from API Gateway. You can either choose a stage to export, or export the latest configuration
of your API. You can also import an exported API definition into API Gateway to create another,
identical API. To learn more about importing API definitions, see [Importing an HTTP API](http-api-open-api.md#http-api-import).

## Export an OpenAPI 3.0 definition of a stage by using the AWS CLI

The following
[export-api](../../../cli/latest/reference/apigatewayv2/export-api.md) command exports an OpenAPI definition of an API stage named
`prod` to a YAML file named `stage-definition.yaml`.
The exported definition file includes [API Gateway extensions](api-gateway-swagger-extensions.md) by default.

```nohighlight

aws apigatewayv2 export-api \
    --api-id api-id  \
    --output-type YAML  \
    --specification OAS30 \
    --stage-name prod \
    stage-definition.yaml
```

## Export an OpenAPI 3.0 definition of your API's latest changes by using the AWS CLI

The following [export-api](../../../cli/latest/reference/apigatewayv2/export-api.md) command exports an
OpenAPI definition of an HTTP API to a JSON file named `latest-api-definition.json`.
Because the command doesn't specify a stage, API Gateway exports the latest configuration of your API, whether it has
been deployed to a stage or not. The exported definition file doesn't include [API Gateway extensions](api-gateway-swagger-extensions.md).

```nohighlight

aws apigatewayv2 export-api \
    --api-id api-id  \
    --output-type JSON  \
    --specification OAS30 \
    --no-include-extensions \
    latest-api-definition.json
```

## Export an OpenAPI 3.0 definition by using the API Gateway console

The following procedure shows how to export an OpenAPI definition of an HTTP API.

###### To export an OpenAPI 3.0 definition using the API Gateway console

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

2. Choose an HTTP API.

3. On the main navigation pane, under **Develop**, choose **Export**.
