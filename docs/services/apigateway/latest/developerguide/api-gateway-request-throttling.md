# Throttle requests to your REST APIs for better throughput in API Gateway

You can configure throttling and quotas for your APIs to help protect them from being overwhelmed by too many
requests. Both throttles and quotas are applied on a best-effort basis and should be thought of as targets rather
than guaranteed request ceilings.

API Gateway throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token counts for a request.
Specifically, API Gateway examines the rate and a burst of request submissions against all APIs in your account, per
Region. In the token bucket algorithm, a burst can allow pre-defined overrun of those limits, but other factors can
also cause limits to be overrun in some cases.

When request submissions exceed the steady-state request rate and burst limits, API Gateway begins to throttle
requests. Clients may receive `429 Too Many Requests` error responses at this point. Upon catching such
exceptions, the client can resubmit the failed requests in a way that is rate limiting.

As an API developer, you can set the target limits for individual API stages or methods to improve overall
performance across all APIs in your account. Alternatively, you can enable usage plans to set throttles on client
request submissions based on specified requests rates and quotas.

## How throttling limit settings are applied in API Gateway

Before you configure throttle and quota settings for your API, it's useful to understand the types of
throttling-related settings for your API and how API Gateway applies them.

Amazon API Gateway provides four basic types of throttling-related settings:

- _AWS throttling limits_ are applied across all accounts and clients in a Region.
These limit settings exist to prevent your API—and your account—from being overwhelmed by too many requests.
These limits are set by AWS and can't be changed by a customer.

- Per-account limits are applied to all APIs in an account in a specified Region. The account-level rate
limit can be increased upon request - higher limits are possible with APIs that have shorter timeouts and
smaller payloads. To request an increase of account-level throttling limits per Region, contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home). For more information, see [Amazon API Gateway quotas](limits.md). Note that these limits can't be higher than the AWS throttling limits.

- Per-API, per-stage throttling limits are applied at the API method level for a stage. You
can configure the same settings for all methods, or configure different throttle settings for each method.
Note that these limits can't be higher than the AWS throttling limits.

- _Per-client throttling limits_ are applied to clients that use API keys associated with
your usage plan as client identifier. Note that these limits can't be higher than the per-account limits.

API Gateway applies your throttling-related settings in the following order:

1. [Per-client or per-method throttling\
    limits](#apigateway-method-level-throttling-in-usage-plan) that you set for an API stage in a [usage\
    plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-usage-plans.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create)

2. [Per-method throttling limits that you set for an API stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-stages.html#how-to-stage-settings)

3. [Account-level throttling per\
    Region](#apig-request-throttling-account-level-limits)

4. AWS Regional throttling

## Account-level throttling per Region

By default, API Gateway limits the steady-state requests per second (RPS) across all APIs within an AWS
account, per Region. It also limits the burst (that is, the maximum bucket size) across all APIs within an AWS
account, per Region. In API Gateway, the burst limit represents the target maximum number of concurrent request
submissions that API Gateway will fulfill before returning `429 Too Many Requests` error responses. For more
information on throttling quotas, see [Amazon API Gateway quotas](limits.md).

## Configuring API-level and stage-level throttling targets in a usage plan

In a [usage plan](api-gateway-api-usage-plans.md), you can set a per-method throttling target
for all methods at the API or stage level. You can specify a _throttling rate_, which is the rate, in requests per second, that tokens are added to the token bucket.
You can also specify a _throttling burst_, which is the capacity of the token bucket.

You can use the AWS CLI, SDKs, and the AWS Management Console to create a usage plan. For more information about how to create a usage plan, see [Usage plans and API keys for REST APIs in API Gateway](api-gateway-api-usage-plans.md).

## Configuring stage-level throttling targets

You can use the AWS CLI, SDKs, and the AWS Management Console to create stage-level throttling targets.

For more
information about how to use the AWS Management Console to create stage-level throttling targets, see [Modify stage settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-stages.html#how-to-stage-settings). For more information
about how to use the AWS CLI to create stage-level throttling targets, see [create-stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/create-stage.html).

## Configuring method-level throttling targets in a usage plan

You can set additional throttling targets at the method level in **Usage Plans** as shown in
[Create a usage plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-usage-plans.html#api-gateway-usage-plan-create). In the API Gateway
console, these are set by specifying `Resource=<resource>`,
`Method=<method>` in the **Configure Method**
**Throttling** setting. For example, for the [PetStore\
example](api-gateway-create-api-step-by-step.md), you might specify `Resource=/pets`, `Method=GET`.
