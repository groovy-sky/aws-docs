# What is Amazon API Gateway?

Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and
securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that
access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing). As an API Gateway
API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make
your APIs available to third-party app developers. For more information, see [Who uses API Gateway?](api-gateway-overview-developer-experience.md#apigateway-who-uses-api-gateway).

API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that:

- Are HTTP-based.

- Enable stateless client-server communication.

- Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

For more information about API Gateway REST APIs and HTTP APIs, see [Choose between REST APIs and HTTP APIs](http-api-vs-rest.md), [API Gateway HTTP APIs](http-api.md), [Use API Gateway to create REST APIs](api-gateway-overview-developer-experience.md#api-gateway-overview-rest), and [Develop REST APIs in API Gateway](rest-api-develop.md).

API Gateway creates WebSocket APIs that:

- Adhere to the [WebSocket](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455)
protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and
server.

- Route incoming messages based on message content.

For more information about API Gateway WebSocket APIs, see [Use API Gateway to create WebSocket APIs](api-gateway-overview-developer-experience.md#api-gateway-overview-websocket) and [Overview of WebSocket APIs in API Gateway](apigateway-websocket-api-overview.md).

## Architecture of API Gateway

The following diagram shows API Gateway architecture.

![API Gateway architecture diagram](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/Product-Page-Diagram_Amazon-API-Gateway-How-Works.png)

This diagram illustrates how the APIs you build in Amazon API Gateway provide you or your
developer customers with an integrated and consistent developer experience for building
AWS serverless applications. API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and
processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls. These tasks include
traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version
management.

API Gateway acts as a "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or
functionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time communication
applications.

## Features of API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway offers features such as the following:

- Support for stateful ( [WebSocket](apigateway-websocket-api.md)) and stateless ( [HTTP](http-api.md) and
[REST](apigateway-rest-api.md)) APIs.

- Powerful, flexible [authentication](apigateway-control-access-to-api.md) mechanisms, such as AWS Identity and Access Management policies, Lambda
authorizer functions, and Amazon Cognito user pools.

- [Canary release deployments](canary-release.md) for safely
rolling out changes.

- [CloudTrail](cloudtrail.md) logging and monitoring of API usage and
API changes.

- CloudWatch access logging and execution logging, including the ability to set
alarms. For more information, see [Monitor REST API execution with Amazon CloudWatch metrics](monitoring-cloudwatch.md) and
[Monitor WebSocket API execution with CloudWatch metrics](apigateway-websocket-api-logging.md).

- Ability to use CloudFormation templates to enable API creation. For more information,
see [Amazon API Gateway Resource\
Types Reference](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-apigateway.md) and [Amazon API Gateway V2 Resource\
Types Reference](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-apigatewayv2.md).

- Support for [custom domain\
names](how-to-custom-domains.md).

- Integration with [AWS WAF](apigateway-control-access-aws-waf.md) for protecting your APIs against common web exploits.

- Integration with [AWS X-Ray](apigateway-xray.md) for
understanding and triaging performance latencies.

For a complete list of API Gateway feature releases, see [Document history](history.md).

## Accessing API Gateway

You can access Amazon API Gateway in the following ways:

- **AWS Management Console** – The AWS Management Console provides a web interface for creating
and managing APIs. After you complete the steps in [Set up to use API Gateway](setting-up.md), you can access the API Gateway
console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

- **AWS SDKs** – If you're using a
programming language that AWS provides an SDK for, you can use an SDK to access
API Gateway. SDKs simplify authentication, integrate easily with your development
environment, and provide access to API Gateway commands. For more information, see
[Tools for Amazon Web\
Services](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools).

- **API Gateway V1 and V2 APIs** – If you're using
a programming language that an SDK isn't available for, see the [Amazon API Gateway Version 1 API Reference](../api/api-operations.md)
and [Amazon API Gateway Version 2 API Reference](../../../apigatewayv2/latest/api-reference/api-reference.md).

- **AWS Command Line Interface** – For more information, see
[Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide.md) in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

- **AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell** – For more information, see
[Setting Up the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](../../../powershell/latest/userguide.md) in the
_AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide_.

## Part of AWS serverless infrastructure

Together with [AWS Lambda](../../../lambda/latest/dg.md), API Gateway forms the app-facing
part of the AWS serverless infrastructure. To learn more about getting started with serverless, see the
[Serverless Developer Guide](../../../serverless/latest/devguide/welcome.md).

For an app to call publicly available AWS services, you can use Lambda to interact
with required services and expose Lambda functions through API methods in API Gateway.
AWS Lambda runs your code on a highly available computing infrastructure. It performs the
necessary execution and administration of computing resources. To enable serverless
applications, API Gateway supports [streamlined\
proxy integrations](api-gateway-set-up-simple-proxy.md) with AWS Lambda and HTTP endpoints.

## How to get started with Amazon API Gateway
