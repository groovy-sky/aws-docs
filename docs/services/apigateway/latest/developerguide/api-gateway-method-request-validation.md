# Request validation for REST APIs in API Gateway

You can configure API Gateway to perform basic validation of an API request before proceeding
with the integration request. When the validation fails, API Gateway immediately fails the
request, returns a 400 error response to the caller, and publishes the validation results in
CloudWatch Logs. This reduces unnecessary calls to the backend. More importantly, it lets you
focus on the validation efforts specific to your application. You can validate a
request body by verifying that required request parameters are valid and non-null or by specifying a model schema for more complicated data validation.

## Overview of basic request validation in API Gateway

API Gateway can perform the basic request validation, so that you can focus on app-specific validation in the backend. For validation, API Gateway verifies
either or both of the following conditions:

- The required request parameters in the URI, query string, and headers of an incoming request are included
and not blank. API Gateway only checks the existence of a parameter and doesn't check the type or
format.

- The applicable request payload adheres to the configured [JSON schema](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) request of the
method for a given content type. If no matching content type is found, request validation is not performed.
To use the same model regardless of the content type, set the content type for your data model to
`$default`.

To turn on validation, you specify validation rules in a [request validator](../api/api-requestvalidator.md), add the validator to the API's [map of request validators](../api/api-requestvalidator.md), and assign the validator to
individual API methods.

###### Note

Request body validation and [Method request behavior for payloads without mapping templates for REST APIs in API Gateway](integration-passthrough-behaviors.md) are two separate topics. When a request payload does not
have a matching model schema, you can choose to passthrough or block the original payload. For more information,
see [Method request behavior for payloads without mapping templates for REST APIs in API Gateway](integration-passthrough-behaviors.md).
