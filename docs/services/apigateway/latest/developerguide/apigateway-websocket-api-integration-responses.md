# Set up a WebSocket API integration response in API Gateway

The following section provides a brief overview of integration responses for WebSocket API and how to set up
an integration response for a WebSocket API.

## Overview of integration responses

API Gateway's integration response is a way of modeling and manipulating the response
from a backend service. There are some differences in setup of a REST API versus a
WebSocket API integration response, but conceptually the behavior is the
same.

WebSocket routes can be configured for two-way or one-way communication.

- When a route is configured for two-way communication, an integration
response allows you to configure transformations on the returned message
payload, similar to integration responses for REST APIs.

- If a route is configured for one-way communication, then regardless of any
integration response configuration, no response will be returned over the
WebSocket channel after the message is processed.

API Gateway will not pass the backend response through to the route response, unless you set up a route
response. To learn about setting up a route response, see [Set up route responses for WebSocket APIs in API Gateway](apigateway-websocket-api-route-response.md).

## Integration responses for two-way communication

Integrations can be divided into _proxy_ integrations and
_non-proxy_ integrations.

###### Important

For _proxy integrations_, API Gateway automatically passes the
backend output to the caller as the complete payload. There is no integration
response.

For _non-proxy integrations_, you must set up at least one
integration response:

- Ideally, one of your integration responses should act as a catch-all when
no explicit choice can be made. This default case is represented by setting
an integration response key of `$default`.

- In all other cases, the integration response key functions as a regular
expression. It should follow a format of `"/expression/"`.

For non-proxy HTTP integrations:

- API Gateway will attempt to match the HTTP status code of the backend response.
The integration response key will function as a regular expression in this
case. If a match cannot be found, then `$default` is chosen as
the integration response.

- The template selection expression, as described above, functions
identically. For example:

- `/2\d\d/`: Receive and transform successful
responses

- `/4\d\d/`: Receive and transform bad request
errors

- `$default`: Receive and transform all unexpected
responses

For more information about template selection expressions, see [Template selection expressions](websocket-api-data-transformations.md#apigateway-websocket-api-template-selection-expressions).

## Set up an integration response using the API Gateway console

To set up a route integration response for a WebSocket API using the API Gateway
console:

01. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

02. Choose your WebSocket API and choose your route.

03. Choose the **Integration request** tab, and then in the **Integration response settings** section, choose **Create integration response**.

04. For **Response key**, enter a value that will be found in the response key in the outgoing message after evaluating the response selection expression. For instance, you can enter `/4\d\d/` to receive and transform bad request
     errors or enter `$default` to receive and transform all responses that match the template selection expression.

05. For **Template selection expression**, enter a selection expression to evaluate the outgoing message.

06. Choose **Create response**.

07. You can also define a mapping template to configure transformations of your returned message payload. Choose **Create template**.

08. Enter a key name. If you are choosing the default template selection expression, enter `\$default`.

09. For **Response template**, enter your mapping template in the code editor.

10. Choose **Create template**.

11. Choose **Deploy API** to deploy your API.

Use the following [wscat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wscat) command to connect to your API. For more information about `wscat`, see [Use wscat to connect to a WebSocket API and send messages to it](apigateway-how-to-call-websocket-api-wscat.md).

```nohighlight

wscat -c wss://api-id.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/test
```

When you call your route, the returned message payload should return.

## Set up an integration response using the AWS CLI

The following [create-integration-response](../../../cli/latest/reference/apigatewayv2/create-integration-response.md) command creates a
`$default` integration response:

```nohighlight

aws apigatewayv2 create-integration-response \
    --api-id vaz7da96z6 \
    --integration-id a1b2c3 \
    --integration-response-key '$default'
```
