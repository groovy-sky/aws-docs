# Security policy for HTTP APIs in API Gateway
<a name="http-api-ciphers"></a>

API Gateway enforces a security policy of `TLS_1_2` for all HTTP API endpoints.

A *security policy* is a predefined combination of minimum TLS version and cipher suites offered by Amazon API Gateway. The TLS protocol addresses network security problems such as tampering and eavesdropping between a client and server. When your clients establish a TLS handshake to your API through the custom domain, the security policy enforces the TLS version and cipher suite options your clients can choose to use. This security policy accepts TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 traffic and rejects TLS 1.0 traffic.

## Supported TLS protocols and ciphers for HTTP APIs
<a name="http-api-ciphers-list"></a>

The following table describes the supported TLS protocols for HTTP APIs.

| **TLS protocols** | **TLS\_1\_2 security policy** |
| --- | --- |
| TLSv1.3 | ![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/success_icon.png) Yes |
| TLSv1.2 | ![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/success_icon.png) Yes |

The following table describes the TLS ciphers that are available for the TLS 1\_2 security policy for HTTP APIs.

## OpenSSL and RFC cipher names
<a name="apigateway-secure-connections-openssl-rfc-cipher-names-http"></a>

OpenSSL and IETF RFC 5246 use different names for the same ciphers. For a list of the cipher names, see [OpenSSL and RFC cipher names](apigateway-security-policies-list.md#apigateway-secure-connections-openssl-rfc-cipher-names).
