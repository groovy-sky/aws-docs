# Choose an API key source in API Gateway
<a name="api-gateway-api-key-source"></a>

When you associate a usage plan with an API and enable API keys on API methods, every incoming request to the API must contain an [API key](api-gateway-basic-concept.md#apigateway-definition-api-key). API Gateway reads the key and compares it against the keys in the usage plan. If there is a match, API Gateway throttles the requests based on the plan's request limit and quota. Otherwise, it throws an `InvalidKeyParameter` exception. As a result, the caller receives a `403 Forbidden` response.

Your API Gateway API can receive API keys from one of two sources:

**`HEADER`**
You distribute API keys to your customers and require them to pass the API key as the `X-API-Key` header of each incoming request.

**`AUTHORIZER`**
You have a Lambda authorizer return the API key as part of the authorization response. For more information on the authorization response, see [Output from an API Gateway Lambda authorizer](api-gateway-lambda-authorizer-output.md).

**Note**
For best practices to consider, see [Best practices for API keys and usage plans](api-gateway-api-usage-plans.md#apigateway-usage-plans-best-practices).

The following procedure shows how to choose an API key source for an API.

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To choose an API key source for an API**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console.

1. Choose an existing API or create a new one.

1. In the main navigation pane, choose **API settings**.

1. In the **API details** section, choose **Edit**.

1.  Under **API key source**, select `Header` or `Authorizer` from the dropdown list.

1. Choose **Save changes**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

The following [update-rest-api](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/update-rest-api.html) command updates an API to set the API key source to `AUTHORIZER`:

```
aws apigateway update-rest-api --rest-api-id 1234123412 --patch-operations op=replace,path=/apiKeySource,value=AUTHORIZER
```

To have the client submit an API key, set the `value` to `HEADER` in the previous command.

------
#### [ REST API ]

To choose an API key source for an API by using the API Gateway REST API, call [`restapi:update`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_UpdateRestApi.html) as follows:

```
PATCH /restapis/fugvjdxtri/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: apigateway.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
X-Amz-Date: 20160603T205348Z
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential={access_key_ID}/20160603/us-east-1/apigateway/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-length;content-type;host;x-amz-date, Signature={sig4_hash}

{
  "patchOperations" : [
    {
        "op" : "replace",
        "path" : "/apiKeySource",
        "value" : "HEADER"
    }
  ]
}
```

To have an authorizer return an API key, set the `value` to `AUTHORIZER` in the previous `patchOperations` input.
