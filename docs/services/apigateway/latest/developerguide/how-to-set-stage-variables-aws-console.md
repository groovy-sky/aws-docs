# Set up stage variables for REST APIs in API Gateway
<a name="how-to-set-stage-variables-aws-console"></a>

This section shows how to set up various stage variables for two deployment stages of a sample API by using the Amazon API Gateway console. To understand how to use stage variables in API Gateway, we recommend that you follow all procedures in this section.

## Prerequisites
<a name="how-to-set-stage-variables-aws-console-prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
+ You must have an API available in API Gateway. Follow the instructions in [Develop REST APIs in API Gateway](rest-api-develop.md).
+ You must have deployed the API at least once. Follow the instructions in [Deploy REST APIs in API Gateway](how-to-deploy-api.md).
+ You must have created the first stage for a deployed API. Follow the instructions in [Create a new stage](set-up-stages.md#how-to-create-stage-console).

## Invoke an HTTP endpoint through an API with a stage variable
<a name="how-to-set-stage-variables-aws-console-http-endpoint"></a>

This procedure describes how to create a stage variable for an HTTP endpoint and two stages for your API. In addition, you create the stage variables, `url`, `stageName`, and `function` that are used in the following procedures in this section.

**To invoke an HTTP endpoint through an API with a stage variable**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

1. Create an API, and then create a `GET` method on the API's root resource. Set the integration type to **HTTP** and set the **Endpoint URL** to **http://${stageVariables.url}**.

1. Deploy the API to a new stage named **beta**.

1. In the main navigation pane, choose **Stages**, and then select the **beta** stage.

1. On the **Stage variables** tab, choose **Edit**.

1. Choose **Add stage variable**.

1. For **Name**, enter **url**. For **value**, enter **httpbin.org/get**.

1. Choose **Add stage variable**, and then do the following:

   For **Name**, enter **stageName**. For **value**, enter **beta**.

1. Choose **Add stage variable**, and then do the following:

   For **Name**, enter **function**. For **value**, enter **HelloWorld**.

1. Choose **Save**.

1.  Now create a second stage. From the **Stages** navigation pane, choose **Create stage**. For **Stage name**, enter **prod**. Select a recent deployment from **Deployment**, and then choose **Create stage**.

1.  As with the **beta** stage, set the same three stage variables (**url**, **stageName**, and **function**) to different values (**petstore-demo-endpoint.execute-api.com/petstore/pets**, **prod**, and **HelloEveryone**), respectively.

1. In the **Stages** navigation pane, choose **beta**. Under **Stage details**, choose the copy icon to copy your API's invoke URL, and then enter your API's invoke URL in a web browser. This starts the **beta** stage `GET` request on the root resource of the API.
**Note**
The **Invoke URL** link points to the root resource of the API in its **beta** stage. Entering the URL in a web browser calls the **beta** stage `GET` method on the root resource. If methods are defined on child resources and not on the root resource itself, entering the URL in a web browser returns a `{"message":"Missing Authentication Token"}` error response. In this case, you must append the name of a specific child resource to the **Invoke URL** link.

1. The response you get from the **beta** stage `GET` request is shown next. You can also verify the result by using a browser to navigate to **http://httpbin.org/get**. This value was assigned to the `url` variable in the **beta** stage. The two responses are identical.

1. In the **Stages** navigation pane, choose the **prod** stage. Under **Stage details**, choose the copy icon to copy your API's invoke URL, and then enter your API's invoke URL in a web browser. This starts the **prod** stage `GET` request on the root resource of the API.

1. The response you get from the **prod** stage `GET` request is shown next. You can verify the result by using a browser to navigate to **http://petstore-demo-endpoint.execute-api.com/petstore/pets**. This value was assigned to the `url` variable in the **prod** stage. The two responses are identical.

## Pass stage-specific metadata into an HTTP backend
<a name="how-to-set-stage-variables-aws-console-stage-metadata"></a>

This procedure describes how to use a stage variable value in a query parameter expression to pass stage-specific metadata into an HTTP backend. We will use the `stageName` stage variable declared in the previous procedure.

**To pass stage-specific metadata into an HTTP backend**

1. In the **Resource** navigation pane, choose the **GET** method.

   To add a query string parameter to the method's URL, choose the **Method request** tab, and then in the **Method request settings** section, choose **Edit**.

1. Choose **URL query string parameters** and do the following:

   1. Choose **Add query string**.

   1. For **Name**, enter **stageName**.

   1. Keep **Required** and **Caching** turned off.

1. Choose **Save**.

1. Choose the **Integration request** tab, and then in the **Integration request settings** section, choose **Edit**.

1. For **Endpoint URL**, append **?stageName=${stageVariables.stageName}** to the previously defined URL value, so the entire **Endpoint URL** is **http://${stageVariables.url}?stageName=${stageVariables.stageName}**.

1. Choose **Deploy API** and select the **beta** stage.

1. In the main navigation pane, choose **Stages**. In the **Stages** navigation pane, choose **beta**. Under **Stage details**, choose the copy icon to copy your API's invoke URL, and then enter your API's invoke URL in a web browser.
**Note**
 We use the beta stage here because the HTTP endpoint (as specified by the `url` variable "http://httpbin.org/get") accepts query parameter expressions and returns them as the `args` object in its response.

1. You get the following response. Notice that `beta`, assigned to the `stageName` stage variable, is passed in the backend as the `stageName` argument.

## Invoke a Lambda function through an API with a stage variable
<a name="how-to-set-stage-variables-aws-console-lambda-function"></a>

This procedure describes how to use a stage variable to call a Lambda function as a backend of your API. You use the `function` stage variable declared in [Invoke an HTTP endpoint through an API with a stage variable](#how-to-set-stage-variables-aws-console-http-endpoint).

 When setting a Lambda function as the value of a stage variable, use the function's local name, possibly including its alias or version specification, as in **HelloWorld**, **HelloWorld:1** or **HelloWorld:alpha**. Do not use the function's ARN (for example, **arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld**). The API Gateway console assumes the stage variable value for a Lambda function as the unqualified function name and expands the given stage variable into an ARN.

**To invoke a Lambda function through an API with a stage variable**

1. Create a Lambda function named **HelloWorld** using the default Node.js runtime. The code must contain the following:

   ```
   export const handler = function(event, context, callback) {
       if (event.stageName)
           callback(null, 'Hello, World! I\'m calling from the ' + event.stageName + ' stage.');
       else
           callback(null, 'Hello, World! I\'m not sure where I\'m calling from...');
   };
   ```

   For more information on how to create a Lambda function, see [Getting started with the REST API console](getting-started-rest-new-console.md#getting-started-rest-new-console-create-function).

1. In the **Resources** pane, select **Create resource**, and then do the following:

   1. For **Resource path**, select **/**.

   1. For **Resource name**, enter **lambdav1**.

   1. Choose **Create resource**.

1. Choose the **/lambdav1** resource, and then choose **Create method**.

   Then, do the following:

   1. For **Method type**, select **GET**.

   1. For **Integration type**, select **Lambda function**.

   1. Keep **Lambda proxy integration** turned off.

   1. For **Lambda function**, enter `${stageVariables.function}`.
![Create a GET method integrated with a Lambda function as specified by the function stage variable.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/stageVariables-new-console-create-lambda-get-method.png)
**Tip**
When prompted with the **Add permission command**, copy the [add-permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/add-permission.html) command. Run the command on each Lambda function that will be assigned to the `function` stage variable. For example, if the `$stageVariables.function` value is `HelloWorld`, run the following AWS CLI command:

      ```
      aws lambda add-permission --function-name arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:{{account-id}}:function:HelloWorld --source-arn arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:{{account-id}}:{{api-id}}/*/GET/lambdav1 --principal apigateway.amazonaws.com --statement-id {{statement-id-guid}} --action lambda:InvokeFunction
      ```
 Failing to do so results in a `500 Internal Server Error` response when invoking the method. Replace `${stageVariables.function}` with the Lambda function name that is assigned to the stage variable.

![AWS CLI command to add permission to the Lambda function to be invoked by the method you created.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/stageVariables-new-console-add-permission-to-lambda-function.png)

   1. Choose **Create method**.

1. Deploy the API to both the **prod** and **beta** stages.

1. In the main navigation pane, choose **Stages**. In the **Stages** navigation pane, choose **beta**. Under **Stage details**, choose the copy icon to copy your API's invoke URL, and then enter your API's invoke URL in a web browser. Append **/lambdav1** to the URL before you press enter.

   You get the following response.

   ```
   "Hello, World! I'm not sure where I'm calling from..."
   ```

## Pass stage-specific metadata to a Lambda function through a stage variable
<a name="pass-version-info-to-lambda-backend-with-stage-variable"></a>

This procedure describes how to use a stage variable to pass stage-specific configuration metadata into a Lambda function. You create a `POST` method and an input mapping template to generate payload using the `stageName` stage variable you declared earlier.

**To pass stage-specific metadata to a Lambda function through a stage variable**

1. Choose the **/lambdav1** resource, and then choose **Create method**.

   Then, do the following:

   1. For **Method type**, select **POST**.

   1. For **Integration type**, select **Lambda function**.

   1. Keep **Lambda proxy integration** turned off.

   1. For **Lambda function**, enter `${stageVariables.function}`.

   1. When prompted with the **Add permission command**, copy the the [add-permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/add-permission.html) command. Run the command on each Lambda function that will be assigned to the `function` stage variable.

   1. Choose **Create method**.

1. Choose the **Integration request** tab, and then in the **Integration request settings** section, choose **Edit**.

1. Choose **Mapping templates**, and then choose **Add mapping template**.

1. For **Content type**, enter **application/json**.

1. For **Template body**, enter the following template:

   ```
   #set($inputRoot = $input.path('$'))
   {
       "stageName" : "$stageVariables.stageName"
   }
   ```
**Note**
 In a mapping template, a stage variable must be referenced within quotes (as in `"$stageVariables.stageName"` or `"${stageVariables.stageName}"`). In other places, it must be referenced without quotes (as in `${stageVariables.function}`).

1. Choose **Save**.

1. Deploy the API to both the **beta** and **prod** stages.

1. To use a REST API client to pass stage-specific metadata, do the following:

   1. In the **Stages** navigation pane, choose **beta**. Under **Stage details**, choose the copy icon to copy your API's invoke URL, and then enter your API's invoke URL in the input field of a REST API client. Append **/lambdav1** before you submit your request.

      You get the following response.

      ```
      "Hello, World! I'm calling from the beta stage."
      ```

   1. In the **Stages** navigation pane, choose **prod**. Under **Stage details**, choose the copy icon to copy your API's invoke URL, and then enter your API's invoke URL in the input field of a REST API client. Append **/lambdav1** before you submit your request.

      You get the following response.

      ```
      "Hello, World! I'm calling from the prod stage."
      ```

1. To use the **Test** feature to pass stage-specific metadata, do the following:

   1. In the **Resources** navigation pane, choose the **Test** tab. You might need to choose the right arrow button to show the tab.

   1. For **function**, enter **HelloWorld**.

   1. For **stageName**, enter **beta**.

   1. Choose **Test**. You do not need to add a body to your `POST` request.

      You get the following response.

      ```
      "Hello, World! I'm calling from the beta stage."
      ```

   1. You can repeat the previous steps to test the **Prod** stage. For **stageName**, enter **Prod**.

      You get the following response.

      ```
      "Hello, World! I'm calling from the prod stage."
      ```
