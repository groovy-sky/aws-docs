# Use VPC endpoint policies for private APIs in API Gateway

To improve the security of your private API, you can create a VPC endpoint policy. A VPC endpoint policy is an
IAM resource policy that you attach to a VPC endpoint. For more
information, see [Controlling Access\
to Services with VPC Endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.md).

You might want to create a VPC endpoint policy to do the
following tasks.

- Allow only certain organizations or resources to access your VPC endpoint and invoke your API.

- Use a single policy and avoid session-based or role-based policies to control traffic to your API.

- Tighten the security perimeter of your application while migrating from on premises to AWS.

## VPC endpoint policy considerations

The following are considerations for your VPC endpoint policy:

- The identity of the invoker is evaluated based on the
`Authorization` header value. The VPC endpoint policy
is evaluated first, and then API Gateway evaluates the request, based on the type of authorization configured
on the method request. The following table shows how the VPC endpoint policy is evaluated based on the content
of the `Authorization` header value.

Content of the `Authorization` header value

How the VPC endpoint policy is evaluated

No contentThe invoker is evaluated as an anonymous userValid [SigV4 or SigV4a](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-sigv.md) signatureThe invoker is evaluated as the authenticated IAM identity from the signatureInvalid [SigV4 or SigV4a](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-sigv.md) signatureAPI Gateway denies accessNon-SigV4 authorization information such as a bearer tokenThe invoker is evaluated as an anonymous user

- If your access control depends on using a bearer token, such as a Lambda or Amazon Cognito authorizer, you can
control your security perimeter by using [properties of the resource](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resource-properties).

- If your authorization controls use IAM
authorization, you can control your security perimeter by using [properties of the resource](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resource-properties) and
[properties of the principal](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md#condition-keys-resource-principal).

- VPC endpoint policies can be used together with API Gateway resource policies. The API Gateway resource policy
specifies which principals can access the API. The endpoint policy specifies who can access the VPC and which
APIs can be called from the VPC endpoint. Your private API needs a resource policy but you don't need to
create a custom VPC endpoint policy.

## VPC endpoint policy examples

You can create policies for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud endpoints for Amazon API Gateway in which you can
specify the following.

- The principal that can perform actions.

- The actions that can be performed.

- The resources that can have actions performed on them.

This might depend on the contents of your authorization header. For more information, see [VPC endpoint policy considerations](#apigateway-vpc-endpoint-policies-considerations). For additional example policies, see [Data perimeter policy examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/data-perimeter-policy-examples) on the GitHub website.

To attach the policy to the VPC endpoint, you'll need to use the VPC console. For more
information, see [Controlling Access to Services\
with VPC Endpoints](../../../vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.md).

## Example 1: VPC endpoint policy granting access to two APIs

The following example policy grants access to only two specific APIs via the VPC endpoint that the policy is attached to.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "execute-api:Invoke"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:123412341234:a1b2c3d4e5/*",
                "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:123412341234:aaaaa11111/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example 2: VPC endpoint policy granting access to GET methods

The following example policy grants users access to `GET` methods for a
specific API via the VPC endpoint that the policy is attached to.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "execute-api:Invoke"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:123412341234:a1b2c3d4e5/stageName/GET/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example 3: VPC endpoint policy granting a specific user access to a specific API

The following example policy grants a specific user access to a specific API via
the VPC endpoint that the policy is attached to.

In this case, because the policy restricts access to specific IAM principals, you must set the `authorizationType` of the method to
`AWS_IAM` or `NONE`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::123412341234:user/MyUser"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "execute-api:Invoke"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:123412341234:a1b2c3d4e5/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example 4: VPC endpoint policy granting users access to a specific custom domain name and every API mapped to the domain

The following example policy grants users access to a specific custom domain name for private APIs via the VPC endpoint that
the policy is attached to. With this policy, as long as a user has created a domain name access association
between the VPC endpoint and the custom domain name and is granted access to invoke the custom domain name and any
private API's mapped to the custom domain name, the user can invoke any APIs mapped to this
custom domain name. For more information, see [Custom domain names for private APIs in API Gateway](apigateway-private-custom-domains.md).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
       "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "execute-api:viaDomainArn": "arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:111122223333:/domainnames/private.test.com+f4g5h6",
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Example 5: VPC endpoint policy granting or denying access to specific APIs and domain resources

The following example policy grants users access to specific APIs and domain resources. With this policy, as
long as a user has created a domain name access association between the VPC endpoint and the custom domain name
and is granted access to invoke the custom domain name and any private API's mapped to the custom domain name, the
user can invoke allowed private APIs and domain resources. For more information, see [Custom domain names for private APIs in API Gateway](apigateway-private-custom-domains.md).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:111122223333:/domainnames/private.test.com+f4g5h6",
        "arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:111122223333:a1b2c3d4e5/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:111122223333:a1b2c3d4e5/admin/*",
        "arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:111122223333:bcd123455/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Example 6: VPC endpoint policy granting or denying access by principals and resources belonging to an organization

The following example policy grants access to principals and resources that belong to an organization.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceOrgID": "o-abcd1234",
                    "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "o-abcd1234"
                }
            },
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Sid": "AllowRequestsByOrgsIdentitiesToOrgsResources"
        }
    ]
}

```
