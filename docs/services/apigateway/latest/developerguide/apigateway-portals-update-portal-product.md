# Update a portal product in API Gateway

When you update a portal product, you can change the name, description, or the display order of how your product
REST endpoints and product pages appear. To modify the display order, you modify the page list for product pages and
the section name for product endpoints. If you do this using the AWS CLI or SDKs, you specify the product page ARN or
the product REST endpoint ARN. You need to
republish any portals that use your products for your API consumers to see the changes reflected in a portal.

## Update a portal product

The following procedure shows how to change the section list to reorder the product REST endpoints as they
will appear in a portal. In this procedure, we assume you have at least two product REST endpoints in your portal
product.

###### To update a portal product

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

2. In the main navigation pane, choose
    **Portal products**.

3. Choose a product.

4. In the **Documentation** tab, for
    **Product pages**, choose **Manage**.

5. Drag and drop the product REST endpoints to reorder them. You can also move product REST endpoints and
    product pages into the draft pages section. Pages in the draft pages are won't be visible in your portal.

6. (Optional) Rename the product
    REST endpoint names or add a new API reference section. These changes won't impact your REST APIs.

7. Choose **Save changes**.
