# Grant permissions for API Gateway to create a VPC link (legacy)
<a name="grant-permissions-to-create-vpclink"></a>

**Note**
The following implementation of private integrations uses VPC links V1. VPC links V1 are legacy resources. We recommend that you use [VPC links V2 for REST APIs](apigateway-vpc-links-v2.md).

For you or a user in your account to create and maintain a VPC link, you or the user must have permissions to create, delete, and view VPC endpoint service configurations, change VPC endpoint service permissions, and examine load balancers. To grant such permissions, use the following steps.

**To grant permissions to create, update, and delete a VPC link**

1. Create an IAM policy similar to the following:

   ```

       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "apigateway:POST",
                   "apigateway:GET",
                   "apigateway:PATCH",
                   "apigateway:DELETE"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:apigateway:{{us-east-1}}::/vpclinks",
                   "arn:aws:apigateway:{{us-east-1}}::/vpclinks/*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ec2:CreateVpcEndpointServiceConfiguration",
                   "ec2:DeleteVpcEndpointServiceConfigurations",
                   "ec2:DescribeVpcEndpointServiceConfigurations",
                   "ec2:ModifyVpcEndpointServicePermissions"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   If you want to enable tagging for your VPC link, make sure to allow tagging operations. For more information, see [Allow tagging operations](apigateway-tagging-iam-policy.md#allow-tagging).

1. Create or choose an IAM role and attach the preceding policy to the role.

1. Assign the IAM role to you or a user in your account who is creating VPC links.
