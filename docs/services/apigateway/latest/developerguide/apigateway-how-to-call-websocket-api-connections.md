# Use `@connections` commands in your backend service

Your backend service can use the following WebSocket connection HTTP requests to send a callback message to a
connected client, get connection information, or disconnect the client.

###### Important

These requests use [IAM authorization](apigateway-websocket-control-access-iam.md), so you
must sign them with [Signature Version 4 (SigV4)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/create-signed-request.md). To do
this, you can use the API Gateway Management API. For more information, see [ApiGatewayManagementApi](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/apigatewaymanagementapi.html).

In the following command, you need to replace `{api-id}` with the actual
API ID, which is displayed in the API Gateway console or returned by the AWS CLI [create-api](../../../cli/latest/reference/apigatewayv2/create-api.md) command.
You must establish the connection before using this command.

To send a callback message to the client, use:

```nohighlight

POST https://{api-id}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{stage}/@connections/{connection_id}
```

You can test this request by using `Postman` or by
calling `awscurl` as in the following
example:

```nohighlight

awscurl --service execute-api -X POST -d "hello world" https://{prefix}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{stage}/@connections/{connection_id}
```

You need to URL-encode the command as in the following example:

```nohighlight

awscurl --service execute-api -X POST -d "hello world" https://aabbccddee.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/%40connections/R0oXAdfD0kwCH6w%3D
```

To get the latest connection status of the client, use:

```nohighlight

GET https://{api-id}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{stage}/@connections/{connection_id}
```

To disconnect the client, use:

```nohighlight

DELETE https://{api-id}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{stage}/@connections/{connection_id}
```

You can dynamically build a callback URL by using the `$context` variables in your integration. For
example, if you use Lambda proxy integration with a `Node.js` Lambda function, you can build the URL and
send a message to a connected client as follows:

```javascript

import {
  ApiGatewayManagementApiClient,
  PostToConnectionCommand,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-apigatewaymanagementapi";

export const handler = async (event) => {
  const domain = event.requestContext.domainName;
  const stage = event.requestContext.stage;
  const connectionId = event.requestContext.connectionId;
  const callbackUrl = `https://${domain}/${stage}`;
  const client = new ApiGatewayManagementApiClient({ endpoint: callbackUrl });

  const requestParams = {
    ConnectionId: connectionId,
    Data: "Hello!",
  };

  const command = new PostToConnectionCommand(requestParams);

  try {
    await client.send(command);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
  };
};
```

If you use a custom domain name for your WebSocket API, remove the `stage` variable from your
function code.

When sending a callback message, your Lambda function must have permission to call the API Gateway Management API.
You might receive an error that contains `GoneException` if you post a message before the connection is established,
or after the client has disconnected.
