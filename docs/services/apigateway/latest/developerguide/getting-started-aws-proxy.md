# Tutorial: Create a REST API with an AWS integration
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy"></a>

 Both the [Tutorial: Create a REST API with a Lambda proxy integration](api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.md) and [Tutorial: Create a REST API with a Lambda non-proxy integration](getting-started-lambda-non-proxy-integration.md) topics describe how to create an API Gateway API to expose the integrated Lambda function. In addition, you can create an API Gateway API to expose other AWS services, such as Amazon SNS, Amazon S3, Amazon Kinesis, and even AWS Lambda. This is made possible by the `AWS` integration. The Lambda integration or the Lambda proxy integration is a special case, where the Lambda function invocation is exposed through the API Gateway API.

 All AWS services support dedicated APIs to expose their features. However, the application protocols or programming interfaces are likely to differ from service to service. An API Gateway API with the `AWS` integration has the advantage of providing a consistent application protocol for your client to access different AWS services.

 In this walkthrough, we create an API to expose Amazon SNS. For more examples of integrating an API with other AWS services, see [Amazon API Gateway tutorials and workshops](api-gateway-tutorials.md).

 Unlike the Lambda proxy integration, there is no corresponding proxy integration for other AWS services. Hence, an API method is integrated with a single AWS action. For more flexibility, similar to the proxy integration, you can set up a Lambda proxy integration. The Lambda function then parses and processes requests for other AWS actions.

 API Gateway does not retry when the endpoint times out. The API caller must implement retry logic to handle endpoint timeouts.

 This walkthrough builds on the instructions and concepts in [Tutorial: Create a REST API with a Lambda non-proxy integration](getting-started-lambda-non-proxy-integration.md). If you have not yet completed that walkthrough, we suggest that you do it first.

## Prerequisites
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin this walkthrough, do the following:

1. Complete the steps in [Set up to use API Gateway](setting-up.md).

1.  Create a new API named `MyDemoAPI`. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a REST API with an HTTP non-proxy integration](api-gateway-create-api-step-by-step.md).

1. Deploy the API at least once to a stage named `test`. For more information, see [Deploy the API](getting-started-lambda-non-proxy-integration.md#getting-started-deploy-api) in [Choose an AWS Lambda integration tutorial](getting-started-with-lambda-integration.md).

1. Complete the rest of the steps in [Choose an AWS Lambda integration tutorial](getting-started-with-lambda-integration.md).

1. Create at least one topic in Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). You will use the deployed API to get a list of topics in Amazon SNS that are associated with your AWS account. To learn how to create a topic in Amazon SNS, see [Create a Topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html). (You do not need to copy the topic ARN mentioned in step 5.)

## Step 1: Create the AWS service proxy execution role
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-add-roles"></a>

 To allow the API to invoke Amazon SNS actions, you must have the appropriate IAM policies attached to an IAM role. In this step, you create a new IAM role.

**To create the AWS service proxy execution role**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. Choose **Roles**.

1. Choose **Create role**.

1.  Choose **AWS service** under **Select type of trusted entity**, and then select **API Gateway** and select **Allows API Gateway to push logs to CloudWatch Logs**.

1.  Choose **Next**, and then choose **Next**.

1. For **Role name**, enter **APIGatewaySNSProxyPolicy**, and then choose **Create role**.

1. In the **Roles** list, choose the role you just created. You may need to scroll or use the search bar to find the role.

1. For the selected role, select the **Add permissions** tab.

1. Choose **Attach policies** from the dropdown list.

1. In the search bar, enter **AmazonSNSReadOnlyAccess** and choose **Add permissions**.
**Note**
This tutorial uses a managed policy for simplicity. As a best practice, you should create your own IAM policy to grant the minimum permissions required.

1. Note the newly created **Role ARN**, you will use it later.

## Step 2: Create the resource
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-add-resources"></a>

In this step, you create a resource that enables the AWS service proxy to interact with the AWS service.

**To create the resource**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

1. Choose your API.

1. Select the root resource, **/**, represented by a single forward slash (**/**), and then choose **Create resource**.

1. Keep **Proxy resource** turned off.

1. Keep **Resource path** as `/`.

1. For **Resource name**, enter **mydemoawsproxy**.

1. Keep **CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)** turned off.

1. Choose **Create resource**.

## Step 3: Create the GET method
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-add-methods"></a>

In this step, you create a GET method that enables the AWS service proxy to interact with the AWS service.

**To create the `GET` method**

1. Select the **/mydemoawsproxy** resource, and then choose **Create method**.

1. For method type, select **GET**.

1. For **Integration type**, select **AWS service**.

1. For **AWS Region**, select the AWS Region where you created your Amazon SNS topic.

1. For **AWS service**, select **Amazon SNS**.

1. Keep **AWS subdomain** blank.

1. For **HTTP method**, select **GET**.

1. For **Action type**, select **Use action name**.

1. For **Action name**, enter **ListTopics**.

1. For **Execution role**, enter the role ARN for **APIGatewaySNSProxyPolicy**.

1. Choose **Create method**.

## Step 4: Specify method settings and test the method
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-set-methods"></a>

You can now test your `GET` method to verify that it has been properly set up to list your Amazon SNS topics.

**To test the `GET` method**

1. Choose the **Test** tab. You might need to choose the right arrow button to show the tab.

1. Choose **Test**.

   The result displays response similar to the following:

   ```
   {
     "ListTopicsResponse": {
       "ListTopicsResult": {
         "NextToken": null,
         "Topics": [
           {
             "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MySNSTopic-1"
           },
           {
             "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MySNSTopic-2"
           },
           ...
           {
             "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MySNSTopic-N"
           }
         ]
       },
       "ResponseMetadata": {
         "RequestId": "abc1de23-45fa-6789-b0c1-d2e345fa6b78"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Step 5: Deploy the API
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-deploy"></a>

In this step, you deploy the API so that you can call it from outside of the API Gateway console.

**To deploy the API**

1. Choose **Deploy API**.

1. For **Stage**, select **New stage**.

1. For **Stage name**, enter **test**.

1. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a description.

1. Choose **Deploy**.

## Step 6: Test the API
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-test"></a>

In this step, you go outside of the API Gateway console and use your AWS service proxy to interact with the Amazon SNS service.

1. In the main navigation pane, choose **Stage**.

1. Under **Stage details**, choose the copy icon to copy your API's invoke URL.

   It should look like this:

   ```
   https://{{my-api-id}}.execute-api.{{region-id}}.amazonaws.com/test
   ```

1. Enter the URL into the address box of a new browser tab.

1. Append `/mydemoawsproxy` so that the URL looks like this:

   ```
   https://{{my-api-id}}.execute-api.{{region-id}}.amazonaws.com/test/mydemoawsproxy
   ```

   Browse to the URL. Information similar to the following should be displayed:

   ```
   {"ListTopicsResponse":{"ListTopicsResult":{"NextToken": null,"Topics":[{"TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MySNSTopic-1"},{"TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MySNSTopic-2"},...{"TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MySNSTopic-N}]},"ResponseMetadata":{"RequestId":"abc1de23-45fa-6789-b0c1-d2e345fa6b78}}}
   ```

## Step 7: Clean up
<a name="getting-started-aws-proxy-clean-up"></a>

You can delete the IAM resources the AWS service proxy needs to work.

**Warning**
If you delete an IAM resource an AWS service proxy relies on, that AWS service proxy and any APIs that rely on it will no longer work. Deleting an IAM resource cannot be undone. If you want to use the IAM resource again, you must re-create it.

**To delete the associated IAM resources**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. In the **Details** area, choose **Roles**.

1. Select **APIGatewayAWSProxyExecRole**, and then choose **Role Actions**, **Delete Role**. When prompted, choose **Yes, Delete**.

1. In the **Details** area, choose **Policies**.

1. Select **APIGatewayAWSProxyExecPolicy**, and then choose **Policy Actions**, **Delete**. When prompted, choose **Delete**.
