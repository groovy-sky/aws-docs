# Troubleshooting issues with HTTP API JWT authorizers

The following provides troubleshooting advice for errors and issues that you might
encounter when using JSON Web Token (JWT) authorizers with HTTP APIs.

## Issue: My API returns `401 {"message":"Unauthorized"}`

Check the `www-authenticate` header in the response from the API.

The following command uses `curl` to send a request to an API with a JWT
authorizer that uses `$request.header.Authorization` as its identity
source.

```nohighlight

$curl -v -H "Authorization: token" https://api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/route
```

The response from the API includes a `www-authenticate` header.

```

...
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 04:07:30 GMT
< Content-Length: 26
< Connection: keep-alive
< www-authenticate: Bearer scope="" error="invalid_token" error_description="the token does not have a valid audience"
< apigw-requestid: Mc7UVioPPHcEKPA=
<
* Connection #0 to host api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com left intact
{"message":"Unauthorized"}}
```

In this case, the `www-authenticate` header shows that the token wasn't
issued for a valid audience. For API Gateway to authorize a request, the JWT's
`aud` or `client_id` claim must match one of the audience entries that's configured for
the authorizer. API Gateway validates `client_id`
only if `aud` is not present. When both `aud` and
`client_id` are present, API Gateway evaluates `aud`.

You can also decode a JWT and verify that it matches the issuer, audience, and scopes
that your API requires. The website [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) can
debug JWTs in the browser. The OpenID Foundation maintains a [list of libraries for working with JWTs](https://openid.net/developers/jwt-jws-jwe-jwk-and-jwa-implementations).
