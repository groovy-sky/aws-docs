# Turn off a canary release
<a name="delete-canary-deployment"></a>

To turn off a canary release deployment is to set the [`canarySettings`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html#canarySettings) to null to remove it from the stage.

You can disable a canary release deployment using the API Gateway console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.

## Turn off a canary release using the API Gateway console
<a name="delete-canary-release-console"></a>

To use the API Gateway console to turn off a canary release deployment, use the following steps:

**To turn off a canary release deployment**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console and choose an existing API in the main navigation pane.

1. In the main navigation pane, choose **Stages**, and then choose an existing stage.

1.  Choose the **Canary** tab.

1.  Choose **Delete**.

1.  Confirm you want to delete the canary by choosing **Delete**.

As a result, the [`canarySettings`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html#canarySettings) property becomes `null` and is removed from the deployment [stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html). You can verify this using the AWS CLI. For example, see [Turn off a canary release using the AWS CLI](#delete-canary-release-cli).

## Turn off a canary release using the AWS CLI
<a name="delete-canary-release-cli"></a>

The following [update-stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/apigateway/update-stage.html) command turns off the canary release deployment:

```
aws apigateway update-stage \
    --rest-api-id abcd1234 \
    --stage-name canary \
    --patch-operations '[{"op":"remove", "path":"/canarySettings"}]'
```

The output looks like the following:

```
{
    "stageName": "prod",
    "accessLogSettings": {
        ...
    },
    "cacheClusterEnabled": false,
    "cacheClusterStatus": "NOT_AVAILABLE",
    "deploymentId": "nfcn0x",
    "lastUpdatedDate": 1511309280,
    "createdDate": 1511152939,
    "methodSettings": {
        ...
    }
}
```

 As shown in the output, the [canarySettings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html#canarySettings) property is no longer present in the [stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_Stage.html) of a canary-disabled deployment.
