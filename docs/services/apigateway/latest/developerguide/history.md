through a [VpcLink](../api/api-vpclink.md)
resource. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a REST API with a private integration](getting-started-with-private-integration.md) and [Set up a private integration](set-up-private-integration.md).November 30, 2017Deploy a Canary for API testingAdd a canary release to an existing API deployment to test a newer
version of the API while keeping the current version in operation on the
same stage. You can set a percentage of stage traffic for the canary

separate CloudWatch Logs logs. For more information, see [Set up an API Gateway canary release deployment](canary-release.md).November 28, 2017Access LoggingLog client access to your API with data derived from [$context variables](api-gateway-mapping-template-reference.md#context-variable-reference) in a

November 20, 2017Regional API endpointSpecify a regional API endpoint to create an API for non-mobile
clients. A non-mobile client, such as an EC2 instance, runs in the same
AWS Region where the API is deployed. As with an edge-optimized API, you
can create a custom domain name for a regional API. For more
information, see [API endpoint types for REST APIs in API Gateway](api-gateway-api-endpoint-types.md) and [Set up a Regional custom domain name in API Gateway](apigateway-regional-api-custom-domain-create.md).November 2, 2017Custom request authorizer Use custom request authorizer to supply user-authenticating

failed to reach the integration backend. A customized gateway message
can provide the caller with API-specific custom error messages,
including returning needed CORS headers, or can transform the gateway
response data to a format of an external exchange. For more information,
see [Setting up gateway responses to customize error responses](api-gateway-gatewayresponse-definition.md#customize-gateway-responses).June 6, 2017Mapping Lambda custom error properties to method response
headers Map individual custom error properties returned from Lambda to the
method response header parameters using the
`integration.response.body` parameter, relying API Gateway to
deserialize the stringified custom error object at run time. For more
information, see [Handle custom Lambda errors in API Gateway](handle-errors-in-lambda-integration.md#handle-custom-errors-in-lambda-integration).June 6, 2017Throttling limits increase Increase the account-level steady-state request rate limit to 10,000
requests per second (rps) and the bust limit to 5000 concurrent
requests. For more information, see [Throttle requests to your REST APIs for better throughput in API Gateway](api-gateway-request-throttling.md).June 6, 2017Validating method requestsConfigure basic request validators on the API level or method levels
so that API Gateway can validate incoming requests. API Gateway verifies that
required parameters are set and not blank, and verifies that the format
of applicable payloads conforms to the configured model. For more
information, see [Request validation for REST APIs in API Gateway](api-gateway-method-request-validation.md).April 11, 2017Integrating with ACMUse ACM Certificates for your API's custom domain names. You can
create a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager or import an existing PEM-formatted
certificate into ACM. You then refer to the certificate's ARN when
setting a custom domain name for your APIs. For more information, see

an IAM policy. For more information, see [Output from an API Gateway Lambda authorizer](api-gateway-lambda-authorizer-output.md). December 1, 2016Supporting binary payloadsSet [binaryMediaTypes](../api/api-restapi.md#apigw-Type-RestApi-binaryMediaTypes) on your API to support binary payloads of
a request or response. Set the `contentHandling` property on an [Integration](../api/api-integration.md) or
[IntegrationResponse](../api/api-integrationresponse.md) to specify whether to handle a binary
payload as the native binary blob, as a Base64-enocded string, or as a
passthrough without modifications. For more information, see [Binary media types for REST APIs in API Gateway](api-gateway-payload-encodings.md). November 17, 2016Enabling a proxy integration with an HTTP or Lambda backend through a
