# Infrastructure security in Amazon API Gateway

As a managed service, Amazon API Gateway is protected by AWS global network security. For
information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security). To design your AWS
environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure\
Protection](../../../wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.md) in _Security Pillar AWS Well‐Architected_
_Framework_.

You use AWS published API calls to access API Gateway through the network. Clients must
support the following:

- Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

- Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral
Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems
such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

You can call these API operations from any network location, but API Gateway does support resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions
based on the source IP address. You can also use resource-based policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints or
specific VPCs. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given API Gateway resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network.
