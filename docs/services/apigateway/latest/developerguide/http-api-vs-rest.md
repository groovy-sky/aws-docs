# Choose between REST APIs and HTTP APIs
<a name="http-api-vs-rest"></a>

REST APIs and HTTP APIs are both RESTful API products. REST APIs support more features than HTTP APIs, while HTTP APIs are designed with minimal features so that they can be offered at a lower price. Choose REST APIs if you need features such as API keys, per-client throttling, request validation, AWS WAF integration, or private API endpoints. Choose HTTP APIs if you don't need the features included with REST APIs.

The following sections summarize core features that are available in REST APIs and HTTP APIs. When necessary, additional links are provided to navigate between the REST API and HTTP API sections of the API Gateway Developer Guide.

## Endpoint type
<a name="http-api-vs-rest.differences.endpoint-type"></a>

The endpoint type refers to the endpoint that API Gateway creates for your API. For more information, see [API endpoint types for REST APIs in API Gateway](api-gateway-api-endpoint-types.md).

## Security
<a name="http-api-vs-rest.differences.security"></a>

API Gateway provides a number of ways to protect your API from certain threats, like malicious actors or spikes in traffic. To learn more, see [Protect your REST APIs in API Gateway](rest-api-protect.md) and [Protect your HTTP APIs in API Gateway](http-api-protect.md).

## Authorization
<a name="http-api-vs-rest.differences.authorization"></a>

API Gateway supports multiple mechanisms for controlling and managing access to your API. For more information, see [Control and manage access to REST APIs in API Gateway](apigateway-control-access-to-api.md) and [Control and manage access to HTTP APIs in API Gateway](http-api-access-control.md).

1 You can use Amazon Cognito with a [JWT authorizer](http-api-jwt-authorizer.md).

2 You can use a [Lambda authorizer](apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.md) to validate JWTs for REST APIs.

## API management
<a name="http-api-vs-rest.differences.management"></a>

Choose REST APIs if you need API management capabilities such as API keys and per-client rate limiting. For more information, see [Distribute your REST APIs to clients in API Gateway](rest-api-distribute.md), [Custom domain name for public REST APIs in API Gateway](how-to-custom-domains.md), and [Custom domain names for HTTP APIs in API Gateway](http-api-custom-domain-names.md).
