# Enable CORS on a resource using the API Gateway console

You can use the API Gateway console to enable CORS support for one or all methods on a REST
API resource that you have created. After you enable COR support, set the integration passthrough behavior to `NEVER`. In this case, the method request of an
unmapped content type will be rejected with an HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type response. For more information, see
[Method request behavior for payloads without mapping templates for REST APIs in API Gateway](integration-passthrough-behaviors.md)

###### Important

Resources can contain child resources. Enabling CORS support for a resource and
its methods does not recursively enable it for child resources and their
methods.

###### To enable CORS support on a REST API resource

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

2. Choose an API.

3. Choose a resource under **Resources**.

4. In the **Resource details** section,
    choose **Enable CORS**.

![In the Resources pane, choose Enable CORS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/amazon-api-gateway-new-console-enable-cors.png)

5. In the **Enable CORS** box, do the following:

1. (Optional) If you created a custom gateway response and want to enable CORS support for a response, select a gateway response.

2. Select each method to enable CORS support. The `OPTION` method must have CORS enabled.

      If you enable CORS support for an `ANY` method, CORS is enabled for all methods.

3. In the **Access-Control-Allow-Headers** input field,
       enter a static string of a comma-separated list of headers that the
       client must submit in the actual request of the resource. Use the
       console-provided header list of

       `'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token'`
       or specify your own headers.

4. Use the console-provided value of `'*'` as the
       **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header value to
       allow access requests from all origins, or specify an origin to be
       permitted to access the resource.

5. Choose **Save**.

###### Important

When applying the above instructions to the `ANY` method in a
proxy integration, any applicable CORS headers will not be set. Instead,
your backend must return the applicable CORS headers, such as
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

After CORS is enabled on the `GET` method, an `OPTIONS` method
is added to the resource, if it is not already there. The `200` response of
the `OPTIONS` method is automatically configured to return the three
`Access-Control-Allow-*` headers to fulfill preflight handshakes. In
addition, the actual ( `GET`) method is also configured by default to return
the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its 200 response as well. For
other types of responses, you will need to manually configure them to return
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin'` header with '\*' or specific origins, if
you do not want to return the `Cross-origin access` error.

After you enable CORS support on your resource, you must deploy or redeploy the API
for the new settings to take effect. For more information, see [Create a deployment](set-up-deployments.md#create-deployment).

###### Note

If you cannot enable CORS support on your resource after following the procedure, we recommend that you compare your CORS configuration to the
example API `/pets` resource. To learn how to create the example API, see [Tutorial: Create a REST API by importing an example](api-gateway-create-api-from-example.md).
