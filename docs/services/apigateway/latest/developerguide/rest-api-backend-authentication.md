# Present client certificates to backend services with mutual TLS in API Gateway
<a name="rest-api-backend-authentication"></a>

API Gateway can present a client certificate to your backend during the TLS handshake. Your backend can then verify that requests come from API Gateway. This creates a mutual TLS connection between API Gateway and your backend service.

You can choose from two approaches:
+ **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates** – Import your own CA-signed certificate from ACM and attach it to your API stage. With this approach, you get full certificate chains, automatic renewal, and integration with your existing PKI infrastructure.
+ **API Gateway-generated certificates** – Generate a self-signed certificate in API Gateway. This approach requires no external certificate infrastructure. The certificate expires after 365 days and must be rotated manually.
