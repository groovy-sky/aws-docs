 ** insecureSkipVerification **   <a name="apigw-Type-TlsConfig-insecureSkipVerification"></a>
Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the certificate for an integration endpoint is issued by a supported certificate authority. This isn’t recommended, but it enables you to use certificates that are signed by private certificate authorities, or certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API Gateway still performs basic certificate validation, which includes checking the certificate's expiration date, hostname, and presence of a root certificate authority. Supported only for `HTTP` and `HTTP_PROXY` integrations.
Enabling `insecureSkipVerification` isn't recommended, especially for integrations with public HTTPS endpoints. If you enable `insecureSkipVerification`, you increase the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
