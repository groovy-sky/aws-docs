AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Configuring your data encryption settings
<a name="settings-KMS"></a>

You can choose how you encrypt your data in AWS Audit Manager. Audit Manager automatically creates a unique AWS managed key for the secure storage of your data. By default, your Audit Manager data is encrypted with this KMS key. However, if you want to customize your data encryption settings, you can specify your own symmetric encryption customer managed key. Using your own KMS key gives you more flexibility, including the ability to create, rotate, and disable keys.

Using a customer managed key also provides an additional layer of protection for your assessment reports. Audit Manager encrypts reports with your KMS key before writing them to Amazon S3. The report contents are unreadable without access to your key. This protects your data even if your assessment report destination S3 bucket is compromised.

## Prerequisites
<a name="settings-KMS-prerequisites"></a>

If you provide a customer managed key, it must be in the same AWS Region as your assessment in order to generate assessment reports and export evidence finder search results successfully.

## Procedure
<a name="settings-KMS-procedure"></a>

You can update your data encryption settings using the Audit Manager console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Audit Manager API.

**Note**
When you change your Audit Manager data encryption settings, these changes apply to any new assessments that you create. This includes any assessment reports and evidence finder exports that you create from your new assessments.
The changes don't apply to existing assessments that you created before you changed your encryption settings. This includes new assessment reports and CSV exports that you create from existing assessments, in addition to existing assessment reports and CSV exports. Existing assessments—and all their assessment reports and CSV exports—continue to use the old KMS key. If the IAM identity that generates the assessment report can't use the old KMS key, grant permissions at the key policy level.

#### [ Audit Manager console ]

**To update your data encryption settings on the Audit Manager console**

1. From the **General** settings tab, go to the **Data encryption** section.

1. To use the default KMS key that's provided by Audit Manager, clear the **Customize encryption settings (advanced)** check box.

1. To use a customer managed key, select the **Customize encryption settings (advanced)** check box. You can then choose an existing KMS key, or create a new one.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To update your data encryption settings in the AWS CLI**
Run the [update-settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/auditmanager/update-settings.html) command and use the `--kms-key` parameter to specify your own customer managed key.

In the following example, replace the {{placeholder text}} with your own information.

```
aws auditmanager update-settings --kms-key {{arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab}}
```

------
#### [ Audit Manager API ]

**To update your data encryption settings using the API**
Call the [UpdateSettings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateSettings.html) operation and use the [kmsKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateSettings.html#auditmanager-UpdateSettings-request-kmsKey) parameter to specify your own customer managed key.

For more information, choose the previous links to read more in the *Audit Manager API Reference*. This includes information about how to use this operation and parameter in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs.
