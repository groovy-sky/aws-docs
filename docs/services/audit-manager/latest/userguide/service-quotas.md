# Understanding quotas and restrictions for AWS Audit Manager

Your AWS account has default quotas, formerly referred to as _limits_, for each AWS service. Unless otherwise noted, each quota is
Region-specific. You can request increases for some quotas, and other quotas can’t be
increased.

Most Audit Manager quotas, but not all, are listed under the AWS Audit Manager namespace in the Service Quotas
console. To learn how to request a quota increase, see [Managing your Audit Manager quotas](#managing-your-service-quotas).

## Managing your Audit Manager quotas

AWS Audit Manager is integrated with Service Quotas, an AWS service that enables you to view and
manage your quotas from a central location. Service Quotas makes it easy to look up the value
of your Audit Manager quotas.

###### To view Audit Manager service quotas using the console

1. Open the Service Quotas console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **AWS services**.

3. From the **AWS services** list, search for and select
    **AWS Audit Manager**.

4. In the **Service quotas** list, you can see the
    service quota name, applied quota value (if it's available), AWS default quota
    value, and whether the quota is adjustable.

5. To view additional information about a service quota, such as the description,
    choose the quota name.

6. (Optional) To request a quota increase, select the quota that you want to
    increase, select **Request quota increase**, enter
    or select the required information, and select **Request**.
