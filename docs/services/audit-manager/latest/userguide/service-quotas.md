# Understanding quotas and restrictions for AWS Audit Manager
<a name="service-quotas"></a>

Your AWS account has default quotas, formerly referred to as *limits*, for each AWS service. Unless otherwise noted, each quota is Region-specific. You can request increases for some quotas, and other quotas can’t be increased.

Most Audit Manager quotas, but not all, are listed under the AWS Audit Manager namespace in the Service Quotas console. To learn how to request a quota increase, see [Managing your Audit Manager quotas](#managing-your-service-quotas).

## Managing your Audit Manager quotas

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AWS services**.

1. From the **AWS services** list, search for and select **AWS Audit Manager**.

1. In the **Service quotas** list, you can see the service quota name, applied quota value (if it's available), AWS default quota value, and whether the quota is adjustable.

1. To view additional information about a service quota, such as the description, choose the quota name.

1. (Optional) To request a quota increase, select the quota that you want to increase, select **Request quota increase**, enter or select the required information, and select **Request**.
