## What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?

[AWS\
Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected) is a framework that can help you to build secure,
high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for your applications and
workloads. Based on six pillars—operational excellence, security, reliability,
performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability—AWS
Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for you and your partners to evaluate
architectures and implement designs that can scale over time.

## Using this framework

You can use the AWS Well-Architected Framework to help you prepare for audits. This
framework describes the key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices
for designing and running workloads in the cloud. Out of the six pillars that AWS
Well-Architected is based on, the security and reliability pillars are the pillars that
AWS Audit Manager offers a prebuilt framework and controls for. You can also customize this
framework and its controls to support internal audits with specific requirements.

Using the framework as a starting point, you can create an Audit Manager assessment and start
collecting evidence that’s relevant for your audit. After you create an assessment, Audit Manager
starts to assess your AWS resources. It does this based on the controls that are defined
in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. When it's time for an audit, you—or a
delegate of your choice—can review the evidence that Audit Manager collected. Either, you
can browse the evidence folders in your assessment and choose which evidence you want to
include in your assessment report. Or, if you enabled evidence finder, you can search for
specific evidence and export it in CSV format, or create an assessment report from your
search results. Either way, you can use this assessment report to show that your controls
are working as intended.

###### Important

To ensure that this framework collects the intended evidence from AWS Security Hub CSPM, make sure
that you enabled all standards in Security Hub CSPM.

To ensure that this framework collects the intended evidence from AWS Config, make sure
that you enable the necessary AWS Config rules. To review the AWS Config rules that are used
as data source mappings in this standard framework, download the [AuditManager\_ConfigDataSourceMappings\_AWS-Well-Architected-Framework-WAF-v10.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/samples/AuditManager_ConfigDataSourceMappings_AWS-Well-Architected-Framework-WAF-v10.zip)
file.

The controls in this framework aren't intended to verify if your systems are
compliant. Moreover, they can't guarantee that you'll pass an audit.
