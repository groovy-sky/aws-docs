## What is FedRAMP?

FedRAMP was established in 2011. It provides a cost-effective, risk-based approach for
the adoption and use of cloud services by the U.S. federal government. FedRAMP empowers
federal agencies to use modern cloud technologies, with an emphasis on the security and
protection of federal information.

For more information about the FedRAMP moderate baseline controls, see the [FedRAMP Moderate Security Test Case Procedures Template](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SAP-Appendix-A-FedRAMP-Moderate-Security-Test-Case-Procedures-Template.xlsx).

## Using this framework

You can use the FedRAMP r4 framework to help you prepare for audits. This framework
includes a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These
controls are grouped into control sets according to FedRAMP r4 requirements. You can also
customize this framework and its controls to support internal audits with specific
requirements.

Using the framework as a starting point, you can create an Audit Manager assessment and start
collecting evidence that’s relevant for your audit. After you create an assessment, Audit Manager
starts to assess your AWS resources. It does this based on the controls that are defined
in the framework. When it's time for an audit, you—or a delegate of your
choice—can review the evidence that Audit Manager collected. Either, you can browse the
evidence folders in your assessment and choose which evidence you want to include in your
assessment report. Or, if you enabled evidence finder, you can search for specific
evidence and export it in CSV format, or create an assessment report from your search
results. Either way, you can use this assessment report to show that your controls are
working as intended.

###### Important

To ensure that this framework collects the intended evidence from AWS Security Hub CSPM, make sure
that you enabled all standards in Security Hub CSPM.

To ensure that this framework collects the intended evidence from AWS Config, make sure
that you enable the necessary AWS Config rules. To review the AWS Config rules that are used
as data source mappings in this standard framework, download the [AuditManager\_ConfigDataSourceMappings\_FedRAMP-Security-Baseline-Controls-r4-Moderate.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/samples/AuditManager_ConfigDataSourceMappings_FedRAMP-Security-Baseline-Controls-r4-Moderate.zip)
file.

The controls in this framework aren't intended to verify if your systems are compliant
with FedRAMP r4. Moreover, they can't guarantee that you'll pass a FedRAMP audit. AWS Audit Manager
doesn't automatically check procedural controls that require manual evidence
collection.
