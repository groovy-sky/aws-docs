Before you can generate an assessment report, you must add at least one piece of evidence to your assessment report. You can either add an entire evidence folder, or you can add individual evidence items from within a folder.

To ensure that your assessment report is generated successfully, review our [Configuration tips for your assessment report destination](settings-destination.md#settings-assessment-report-destination-tips).
