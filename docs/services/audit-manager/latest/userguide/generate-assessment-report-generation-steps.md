# Generating an assessment report

When you're ready to generate your assessment report, follow these steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you can generate an assessment report, you must add at least one piece of evidence
to your assessment report. You can either add an entire evidence folder, or you can add
individual evidence items from within a folder.

To ensure that your assessment report is generated successfully, review our [Configuration tips for your assessment report destination](settings-destination.md#settings-assessment-report-destination-tips).

## Procedure

###### To generate an assessment report

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Assessments**.

3. Choose the name of the assessment that you want to generate an assessment report for.

4. Choose the **Assessment report selection** tab, and then choose
    **Generate assessment report**.

###### Tip

If **Generate assessment report** is greyed out, this means that no
evidence was added to the assessment report yet.

5. In the pop-up window, provide a name and description for the assessment report, and
    review the assessment report details.

6. Choose **Generate assessment report** and wait a few minutes while your
    assessment report is generated.

7. Find and download your assessment report from the **Download center**
    page of the Audit Manager console.
   - Alternatively, you can go to your assessment report destination S3 bucket and download
      the assessment report from there.
