# Adding evidence to an assessment report
<a name="generate-assessment-report-include-evidence"></a>

Before you can generate an assessment report, you must add at least one piece of evidence to your assessment report. You can either add an entire evidence folder, or you can add specific evidence items from within a folder.

## Procedure

To include evidence in an assessment report, follow these steps.

**To add evidence to an assessment report**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Assessments** and then choose an assessment.

1. On the **Controls** tab, scroll down to the **Control sets** table and choose a control with evidence that you want to include in the assessment report.

1. Choose how you want to add evidence to your assessment report.

   1.  To add an entire evidence folder, scroll down to **Evidence folders**, select the folder that you want to add, and then choose **Add to assessment report**.
**Tip**
If you can't see the folder that you're looking for, change the dropdown filter to **All time**. Otherwise, you'll see the last seven days of folders by default.
If **Add to assessment report** is greyed out, the evidence folder was already added to the assessment report.

   1. To add specific evidence, choose an evidence folder to open its contents. Select one or more items from the list, and then choose **Add to assessment report**.
**Tip**
If **Add to assessment report** is greyed out, make sure that you selected the check box next to the evidence, and then try again.

1. After you add the evidence to the assessment report, a green success banner appears. Choose **View evidence in assessment report** to see the evidence that will be included in your assessment report.
   + Alternatively, you can see the evidence that will be included in your assessment report by navigating back to your assessment and choosing the **Assessment report selection** tab.
