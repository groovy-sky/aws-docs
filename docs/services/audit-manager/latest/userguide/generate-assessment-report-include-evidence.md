# Adding evidence to an assessment report

Before you can generate an assessment report, you must add at least one piece of evidence
to your assessment report. You can either add an entire evidence folder, or you can add specific
evidence items from within a folder.

## Procedure

To include evidence in an assessment report, follow these steps.

###### To add evidence to an assessment report

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Assessments** and then choose an
    assessment.

3. On the **Controls** tab, scroll down to the **Control**
**sets** table and choose a control with evidence that you want to include in the
    assessment report.

4. Choose how you want to add evidence to your assessment report.
1. To add an entire evidence folder, scroll down to **Evidence**
      **folders**, select the folder that you want to add, and then choose **Add**
      **to assessment report**.

      ###### Tip

      If you can't see the folder that you're looking for, change the dropdown filter to
      **All time**. Otherwise, you'll see the last seven days of folders by
      default.

      If **Add to assessment report** is greyed out, the evidence folder
      was already added to the assessment report.

2. To add specific evidence, choose an evidence folder to open its contents. Select one
       or more items from the list, and then choose **Add to assessment report**.

      ###### Tip

      If **Add to assessment report** is greyed out, make sure that you
      selected the check box next to the evidence, and then try again.
5. After you add the evidence to the assessment report, a green success banner appears.
    Choose **View evidence in assessment report** to see the evidence that will
    be included in your assessment report.
   - Alternatively, you can see the evidence that will be included in your assessment
      report by navigating back to your assessment and choosing the **Assessment report**
     **selection** tab.
