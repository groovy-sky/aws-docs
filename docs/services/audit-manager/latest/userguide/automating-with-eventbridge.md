AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see

# Monitoring AWS Audit Manager with Amazon EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge helps you automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events
such as application availability issues or resource changes.

You can use EventBridge
rules to detect and react to Audit Manager events. Based on the rules that you create, EventBridge invokes one
or more target actions when an event matches the values that you specify in a rule. Depending
on the type of event, you might want to send notifications, capture event information, take
corrective action, initiate events, or take other actions.

For example, you can detect whenever the following Audit Manager events occur in your account:

- An audit owner creates, updates, or deletes an assessment

- An audit owner delegates a control set for review

- A delegate completes their review and submits the reviewed control set back to the
audit owner

- An audit owner updates the status of an assessment control

The actions that can be automatically triggered include the following:

- Use an AWS Lambda function to pass a notification to a Slack channel.

- Push data about the check to an Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to support comprehensive and real-time
status monitoring.

- Send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to your email.

- Get notified with an Amazon CloudWatch alarm action.

###### Note

Audit Manager delivers events on a _durable_ basis. This means
that Audit Manager will successfully attempt to deliver events to EventBridge at least once. In cases
where events can't be delivered because of an EventBridge service disruption, they will be retried
again later by Audit Manager for up to 24 hours.

## Prerequisites for creating an EventBridge rule

Before you create rules for Audit Manager events, we recommend that you do the following:

- Familiarize yourself with events, rules, and targets in EventBridge. For more
information, see [What is Amazon EventBridge?](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.md) in the _Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

- Create a target to use in your event rule. For example, you can create an Amazon SNS
topic so that whenever a control set review is completed, you'll receive a text
message or email. For more information, see [EventBridge targets](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.md).

## Creating an EventBridge rule for Audit Manager

Follow these steps to create an EventBridge rule that triggers on an event emitted by Audit Manager.
Events are emitted on a best effort basis.

###### To create an EventBridge rule for Audit Manager

01. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**.

03. Choose **Create rule**.

04. On the **Define rule detail** page, enter a name and description
     for the rule.

05. Keep the default values for **Event bus** and **Rule**
    **type**, and then choose **Next**.

06. On the **Build event pattern** page, for **Event**
    **source**, choose **AWS events or EventBridge partner**
    **events**.

07. For **Creation method**, choose **Custom pattern (JSON**
    **editor)**.

08. Under **Event pattern**, write an event pattern in JSON and specify
     the fields that you want to use for matching.

    To match an Audit Manager event, you can use the following simple pattern:

    ```nohighlight

    {
      "detail-type": ["Event"]
    }
    ```

    Replace `Event` with one of the following supported
     values:

    1. Enter `Assessment Created` to get notifications when an assessment is
        created.

    2. Enter `Assessment Updated` to get notifications when an assessment is
        updated.

    3. Enter `Assessment Deleted` to get notifications when an assessment is
        deleted.

    4. Enter `Assessment ControlSet Delegation Created` to get notifications
        when a control set is delegated for review.

    5. Enter `Assessment ControlSet Reviewed` to get notifications when an
        assessment control set is reviewed.

    6. Enter `Assessment Control Reviewed` to get notifications when an
        assessment control is reviewed.

###### Tip

Add more fields to your event pattern as needed. For more information about available fields,
see [Amazon EventBridge event patterns](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.md).

09. Choose **Next**.

10. On the **Select target(s)** page, choose the target that you
     created for this rule, and then configure any additional options that are required for
     that type. For example, if you choose Amazon SNS, make sure that your SNS topic is configured
     correctly so that you'll be notified by email or SMS.

    ###### Tip

    The fields displayed vary depending on the service selected. For more
    information about available targets, see [Targets available in the EventBridge console](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.md#eb-console-targets).

11. For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target. In these
     cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role that's needed for your rule to run.
    1. To create an IAM role automatically, choose **Create a new role for**
       **this specific resource**.

    2. To use an IAM role that you created earlier, choose **Use existing**
       **role**.
12. (Optional) Choose **Add another target** to add another target for
     this rule.

13. Choose **Next**.

14. (Optional) On the **Configure tags** page, add any tags and then
     choose **Next**.

15. On the **Review and create** page, review your rule setup and
     ensure that it meets your event monitoring requirements.

16. Choose **Create rule**. Your rule will now monitor for Audit Manager events and then send them to the target that you specified.
