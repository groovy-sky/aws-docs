title: "Monitoring AWS Audit Manager with Amazon EventBridge"
---

AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Monitoring AWS Audit Manager with Amazon EventBridge
<a name="automating-with-eventbridge"></a>

Amazon EventBridge helps you automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events such as application availability issues or resource changes.

You can use EventBridge rules to detect and react to Audit Manager events. Based on the rules that you create, EventBridge invokes one or more target actions when an event matches the values that you specify in a rule. Depending on the type of event, you might want to send notifications, capture event information, take corrective action, initiate events, or take other actions.

For example, you can detect whenever the following Audit Manager events occur in your account:
+ An audit owner creates, updates, or deletes an assessment
+ An audit owner delegates a control set for review
+ A delegate completes their review and submits the reviewed control set back to the audit owner
+ An audit owner updates the status of an assessment control

 The actions that can be automatically triggered include the following:
+ Use an AWS Lambda function to pass a notification to a Slack channel.
+ Push data about the check to an Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to support comprehensive and real-time status monitoring.
+ Send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to your email.
+ Get notified with an Amazon CloudWatch alarm action.

**Note**
Audit Manager delivers events on a *durable *basis. This means that Audit Manager will successfully attempt to deliver events to EventBridge at least once. In cases where events can't be delivered because of an EventBridge service disruption, they will be retried again later by Audit Manager for up to 24 hours.

## Prerequisites for creating an EventBridge rule
<a name="eventbridge-prerequisites"></a>

Before you create rules for Audit Manager events, we recommend that you do the following:
+ Familiarize yourself with events, rules, and targets in EventBridge. For more information, see [What is Amazon EventBridge?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html) in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.
+ Create a target to use in your event rule. For example, you can create an Amazon SNS topic so that whenever a control set review is completed, you'll receive a text message or email. For more information, see [EventBridge targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html).

## Creating an EventBridge rule for Audit Manager
<a name="creating-a-rule-with-eventbridge"></a>

Follow these steps to create an EventBridge rule that triggers on an event emitted by Audit Manager. Events are emitted on a best effort basis.

**To create an EventBridge rule for Audit Manager**

1. Open the Amazon EventBridge console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**.

1. Choose **Create rule**.

1. On the **Define rule detail** page, enter a name and description for the rule.

1. Keep the default values for **Event bus** and **Rule type**, and then choose **Next**.

1. On the **Build event pattern** page, for **Event source**, choose **AWS events or EventBridge partner events**.

1. For **Creation method**, choose **Custom pattern (JSON editor)**.

1. Under **Event pattern**, write an event pattern in JSON and specify the fields that you want to use for matching.

   To match an Audit Manager event, you can use the following simple pattern:

   ```
   {
     "detail-type": ["{{Event}}"]
   }
   ```

   Replace {{Event}} with one of the following supported values:

   1. Enter `Assessment Created` to get notifications when an assessment is created.

   1. Enter `Assessment Updated` to get notifications when an assessment is updated.

   1. Enter `Assessment Deleted` to get notifications when an assessment is deleted.

   1. Enter `Assessment ControlSet Delegation Created` to get notifications when a control set is delegated for review.

   1. Enter `Assessment ControlSet Reviewed` to get notifications when an assessment control set is reviewed.

   1. Enter `Assessment Control Reviewed` to get notifications when an assessment control is reviewed.
**Tip**
Add more fields to your event pattern as needed. For more information about available fields, see [Amazon EventBridge event patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.html).

1. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Select target(s)** page, choose the target that you created for this rule, and then configure any additional options that are required for that type. For example, if you choose Amazon SNS, make sure that your SNS topic is configured correctly so that you'll be notified by email or SMS.
**Tip**
The fields displayed vary depending on the service selected. For more information about available targets, see [Targets available in the EventBridge console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html#eb-console-targets).

1. For many target types, EventBridge needs permissions to send events to the target. In these cases, EventBridge can create the IAM role that's needed for your rule to run.

   1. To create an IAM role automatically, choose **Create a new role for this specific resource**.

   1. To use an IAM role that you created earlier, choose **Use existing role**.

1. (Optional) Choose **Add another target** to add another target for this rule.

1. Choose **Next**.

1. (Optional) On the **Configure tags **page, add any tags and then choose **Next**.

1. On the **Review and create** page, review your rule setup and ensure that it meets your event monitoring requirements.

1. Choose **Create rule**. Your rule will now monitor for Audit Manager events and then send them to the target that you specified.
