Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view controls in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).
