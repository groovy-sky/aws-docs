AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Assessment reports

An _assessment report_ summarizes the selected evidence
that was collected for an assessment. It also contains links to PDF files with details about
each piece of evidence. The specific contents, organization, and naming convention of an
assessment report depend on the parameters that you choose when you [generate the\
report](generate-assessment-report.md).

Assessment reports help you to select and compile the evidence that's relevant for your
audit. However, they don't assess the compliance of the evidence itself. Instead, Audit Manager simply
provides the selected evidence details as an output that you can share with your auditor.

## Understanding the assessment report folder structure

When you download an assessment report, Audit Manager produces a zip folder. This contains your
assessment report and related evidence files in nested subfolders.

The zip folder is structured as follows:

- **Assessment folder** (example:
`myAssessmentName-a1b2c3d4`) – The root folder.

- **Assessment report folder** (example:
`reportName-a1b2c3d4e5f6g7`) – A subfolder where you can find the
AssessmentReportSummary.pdf, digest.txt, and README.txt files.

- **Evidence by control folder** (example:
`controlName-a1b2c3d4e5f6g`) – A subfolder that groups
evidence files by the related control.

- **Evidence by data source folder** (example:
`CloudTrail`, `Security Hub CSPM`) – A subfolder that groups
evidence files by the data source type.

- **Evidence by date folder** (example:
`2022-07-01` ) – A subfolder that groups evidence
files by the evidence collection date.

- **Evidence files** – The files
that contain details about individual pieces of evidence.

## Navigating an assessment report

Start by opening the zip folder and navigating one level down to the assessment report
folder. Here, you can find the assessment report PDF and the README.txt file.

You can review the README.txt file to understand the structure and the contents of the zip
folder. It also provides reference information about the naming conventions for each file.
This information can help you navigate directly to a subfolder or evidence file if you’re
looking for a specific item.

Otherwise, to browse evidence and locate the information that you need, open the
assessment report PDF. This gives you a high-level overview of the report, and a summary of
the assessment that the report was created from.

Next, use the table of contents (TOC) to explore the report. You can choose any
hyperlinked control in the TOC to jump directly to a summary of that control.

When you're ready to review evidence details for a control, you can do so by choosing the
hyperlinked evidence name. For automated evidence, the hyperlink opens a new PDF file with
details about that evidence. For manual evidence, the hyperlink takes you to the S3 bucket
that contains the evidence.

###### Tip

The breadcrumb navigation at the top of each page shows your current location in the
assessment report as you browse controls and evidence. Select the hyperlinked TOC to
navigate back to the TOC at any time.

## Reviewing the sections of an assessment report

Use the following information to learn more about each section of an assessment
report.

###### Note

When you see a hyphen (-) next to any of the attributes in the following sections, this
indicates that the value of that attribute is null, or a value doesn't exist.

- [Cover page](#assessment-report-cover-page)

- [Overview page](#assessment-report-overview)

- [Table of contents page](#assessment-report-toc)

- [Control page](#assessment-report-control)

### Cover page

The cover page includes the name of the assessment report. It also displays the date and
time that the report was generated, along with the account ID of the user who generated the
report.

The cover page is formatted as follows. Audit Manager replaces the
`placeholders` with the information that's relevant to your
report.

```nohighlight

### Table of contents page

The TOC displays the full contents of the assessment report. The contents are grouped
and organized based on the control sets that are included in the assessment. Controls are
listed underneath their respective control set.

Choose any item in the table of contents to navigate directly to that section of the
report. You can either choose a control set or go directly to a control.

### Control page

The control page has two parts: a summary of the control itself, and a summary of the
evidence that was collected for the control.

#### Control summary

This section includes the following information.

NameDescription

**Control name**

The name of the control.

**Description**

The description of the control. **Control set**

This section shows the evidence that was collected for the control. The evidence is
grouped by folders, which are organized and named by the evidence collection date. Next to

Underneath each evidence folder name is a list of hyperlinked evidence names.

- Automated evidence names start with an evidence collection timestamp, followed by
the service code, event name (up to 20 characters), account ID, and a unique
12-character unique ID.

For example:
`21-30-24_IAM_CreateUser_111122223333_a1b2c3d4e5f6`

For automated evidence, the hyperlinked name opens a new PDF file with a summary
and further details.

`manual` label, account ID, and a 12-character unique ID. They also
include the first 10 characters of the file name, and the file extension (up to 10

## Validating an assessment report

When you generate an assessment report, Audit Manager produces a report file checksum called
`digest.txt`. You can use this file to validate the integrity of the report and
ensure that no evidence was modified after the report was created. It contains a JSON object
with signatures and hashes that are invalidated if any part of the report archive is altered.

To validate the integrity of an assessment report, use the [ValidateAssessmentReportIntegrity](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-validateassessmentreportintegrity.md) API that's provided by Audit Manager.
