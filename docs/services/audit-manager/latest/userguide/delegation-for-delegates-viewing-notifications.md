# Viewing your notifications for incoming delegation requests

When an audit owner requests your assistance with reviewing a control set, you receive a
notification that informs you of the control set that they delegated to you.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view notifications in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

###### To view your notifications

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. Choose **Notifications** in the left navigation pane.

3. On the **Notifications** page, review the list of control sets that
    have been delegated to you for review. The table includes the following
    information:

NameDescription

**Date**

The date when the control set was delegated.

**Assessment**

The name of the assessment that's associated with the control set.

**Control set**

The name of the control set.

**Source**

The user or role that delegated the control set to you. **Description**

Instructions that are provided by the audit owner.

###### Tip

You can also subscribe to an SNS topic to receive email alerts when a control set is
delegated to you for review. For more information, see [Notifications in AWS Audit Manager](notifications.md).

## Next steps

When you're ready to start reviewing the controls that were delegated to you, see
[Reviewing the delegated control set and its related evidence](delegation-for-delegates-reviewing-control-set-and-evidence.md).
