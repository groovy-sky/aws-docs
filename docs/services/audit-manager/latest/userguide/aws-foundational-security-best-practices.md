## What is the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard?
<a name="what-is-aws-foundational-security-best-practices"></a>

The AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard is a set of controls that detect when your deployed accounts and resources deviate from security best practices.

You can use this standard to continually evaluate all of your AWS accounts and workloads and quickly identify areas of deviation from best practices. The standard provides actionable and prescriptive guidance on how to improve and maintain your organization’s security posture.

The controls include best practices from across multiple AWS services. Each control is assigned a category that reflects the security function that it applies to. For more information, see [Control categories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/control-categories.html) in the *AWS Security Hub CSPM User Guide*.

## Using this framework
<a name="framework-aws-foundational-security-best-practices"></a>

You can use the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices framework to help you prepare for audits. This framework includes a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped into control sets according to AWS Foundational Security Best Practices requirements. You can also customize this framework and its controls to support internal audits with specific requirements.

Using the framework as a starting point, you can create an Audit Manager assessment and start collecting evidence that’s relevant for your audit. After you create an assessment, Audit Manager starts to assess resources in your AWS accounts and services. It does this based on the controls that are defined in the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices framework. When it's time for an audit, you—or a delegate of your choice—can review the evidence that Audit Manager collected. Either, you can browse the evidence folders in your assessment and choose which evidence you want to include in your assessment report. Or, if you enabled evidence finder, you can search for specific evidence and export it in CSV format, or create an assessment report from your search results. Either way, you can use this assessment report to show that your controls are working as intended.

The AWS Foundational Security Best Practices framework details are as follows:

| Framework name in AWS Audit Manager | Number of automated controls | Number of manual controls | Number of control sets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Foundational Security Best Practices | 146 | 0 | 31 |

**Important**
To ensure that this framework collects the intended evidence from AWS Security Hub CSPM, make sure that you enabled all standards in Security Hub CSPM.

The controls in this AWS Audit Manager framework aren't intended to verify if your systems are compliant with AWS Foundational Security Best Practices. Moreover, they can't guarantee that you'll pass an AWS Foundational Security Best Practices audit.
