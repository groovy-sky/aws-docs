AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Deleting a custom control in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="delete-controls"></a>

If you created a custom control and you no longer need it, you can delete it from your Audit Manager environment. This enables you to clean up your workspace and focus on the custom controls that are relevant to your current tasks and priorities.

## Prerequisites
<a name="delete-controls-prequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created a custom control.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to delete a custom control in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
<a name="delete-controls-procedure"></a>

You can delete custom controls using the Audit Manager console, the Audit Manager API, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

**Important**
When you delete a custom control, this action removes the control from any custom frameworks or assessments that it's currently related to. As a result, Audit Manager will stop collecting evidence for that custom control in all of your assessments. This includes assessments that you previously created before you deleted the custom control.

#### [ Audit Manager console ]

**To delete a custom control on the Audit Manager console**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Control library** and then choose the **Custom controls** tab.

1. Select the control that you want to delete, and then choose **Delete**.

1. In the pop-up window that appears, choose **Delete** to confirm deletion.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To delete a custom control in the AWS CLI**

1. First, identify the custom control that you want to delete. To do this, run the [list-controls](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-controls.html) command and specify the `--control-type` as `Custom`.

   ```
    aws auditmanager list-controls --control-type Custom
   ```

   The response returns a list of custom controls. Find the control that you want to delete, and take note of the control ID.

1. Next, run the [delete-control](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/delete-control.html) command and use the `--control-id` parameter to specify the control that you want to delete.

   In the following example, replace the {{placeholder text}} with your own information.

   ```
   aws auditmanager delete-control --control-id {{a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}}
   ```

------
#### [ Audit Manager API ]

**To delete a custom control using the API**

1. Use the [ListControls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListControls.html) operation and specify the [controlType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListControls.html#auditmanager-ListControls-request-controlType) as `Custom`. From the response, find the control that you want to delete and note the control ID.

1. Use the [DeleteControl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteControl.html) operation to delete the custom control. In the request, use the [controlId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteControl.html#auditmanager-DeleteControl-request-controlId) parameter to specify the control that you want to delete.

For more information about these API operations, choose any of the links in the previous procedure to read more in the *AWS Audit Manager API Reference*. This includes information about how to use these operations and parameters in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs.
