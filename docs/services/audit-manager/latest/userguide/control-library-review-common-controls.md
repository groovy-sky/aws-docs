AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Reviewing a common control

When you need to review the details of a control, you'll find the information organized
into several sections on the control details page. These sections help you easily access and
understand the relevant information for that control.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view common controls in
Audit Manager. More specifically, you need the following permissions to view the common controls,
control objectives, and control domains that are provided by AWS Control Catalog:

- `controlcatalog:ListCommonControls`

- `controlcatalog:ListDomains`

- `controlcatalog:ListObjectives`

A suggested policy that grants these permissions is [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md).

## Procedure

You can review a common control using the Audit Manager console, the AWS Control Catalog API,
or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

Audit Manager console

###### To view common control details on the Audit Manager console

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Control library**.

3. Choose **Common** to see the common controls that are
    provided by AWS.

4. Choose any common control name to view the details for that control.

5. Review the common control details using the following information as
    reference.

**Overview section**

This section describes the common control.

**Evidence sources tab**

This tab includes the following information:

NameDescription

**Core controls**

These are the core controls that collect evidence to support the
common control.

- When you collect evidence for this common control, you
automatically collect evidence for all of the core controls that
are listed here. When each of these core controls is implemented
successfully, this helps to demonstrate that you’re meeting the
requirements of the common control.

- Each core control uses a predefined grouping of data sources
to collect evidence about an AWS service. AWS manages these
data sources for you. This means that they’re automatically
updated whenever regulations and standards change and new data
sources are identified. Choose any core control to see the
underlying data sources.

**Related requirements tab**

When you collect evidence for this common control, the same evidence can
help you to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the related standard
controls that are listed on this tab. Choose any standard control to see more
details.

###### Note

- The common control might produce evidence that demonstrates only
partial compliance with a standard control. It’s possible that you might
need additional evidence to demonstrate full compliance with a standard
control.

- At this time, the **Related requirements** tab shows
related standard controls only. Although a common control can be related
to one or more custom controls, those relationships aren't displayed in
this tab.

AWS CLI

###### To view common control details in the AWS CLI

1. Run the [list-common-controls](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/controlcatalog/list-common-controls.html) command to see a list of available common
    controls. When you use this operation, you can apply an optional
    `common-control-filter` to see common controls that have a specific
    objective.

```

aws controlcatalog list-common-controls
```

2. In the response, identify the common control that you want to review and take
    note of its details.

AWS Control Catalog API

###### To view common control details using the API

1. Use the [ListCommonControls](../../../../reference/controlcatalog/latest/apireference/api-listcommoncontrols.md) operation to see a list of available common
    controls. When you use this operation, you can apply an optional
    `commonControlFilter` to see a list of controls that have a
    specific objective.

2. In the response, identify the control that you want to review and take note
    of its details.

For more information about these API operations, choose the link in this
procedure to read more in the _AWS Control Catalog API_
_Reference_. This includes information about how to use these operations
and parameters in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs.

## Next steps

You can choose the common controls that represent your goals and use them as building
blocks to create a custom control. Each automated common control maps to a predefined
grouping of AWS data sources that Audit Manager handles for you. This means that you don’t have
to be an AWS expert to know which data sources collect the relevant evidence for your
goals. Moreover, you don't have to maintain these data source mappings yourself.

For instructions on how to create a custom control that uses common controls as an
evidence source, see [Creating a custom control in AWS Audit Manager](create-controls.md).
