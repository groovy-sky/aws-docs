# Searching for evidence in evidence finder

You can use evidence finder to perform targeted searches and quickly surface relevant
evidence for review.

On this page, you'll learn how to filter your searches by criteria like assessment, date

search scope to just the evidence you need. You can also group your results by certain fields to
better analyze patterns.

instructions, see [Enabling evidence finder](evidence-finder-settings-enable.md).

finder. For an example permission policy that you can use, see [Allow users to run search queries in evidence finder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#evidence-finder-query-access).
