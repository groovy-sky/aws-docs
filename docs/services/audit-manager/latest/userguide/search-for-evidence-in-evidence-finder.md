# Searching for evidence in evidence finder
<a name="search-for-evidence-in-evidence-finder"></a>

You can use evidence finder to perform targeted searches and quickly surface relevant evidence for review.

On this page, you'll learn how to filter your searches by criteria like assessment, date range, resource compliance status, and additional attributes. Applying these filters narrows your search scope to just the evidence you need. You can also group your results by certain fields to better analyze patterns.
