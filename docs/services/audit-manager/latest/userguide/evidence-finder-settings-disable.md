# Disabling evidence finder
<a name="evidence-finder-settings-disable"></a>

If you no longer want to use evidence finder, you can disable the feature at any time.

Follow these steps to learn how to disable evidence finder. Pay close attention to the prerequisites, as you'll need specific permissions to delete the event data store in CloudTrail Lake that was created when you enabled evidence finder.

## Prerequisites

### Required permissions to disable evidence finder
<a name="evidence-finder-disable-permissions"></a>

To disable evidence finder, you need permissions to delete an event data store in CloudTrail Lake. For an example policy that you can use, see [Permissions to disable evidence finder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#full-administrator-access-disable-evidence-finder).

If you need help with permissions, contact your AWS administrator. If you're an AWS administrator, you can [attach the required permission statement to an IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#add-policies-console).

## Procedure
<a name="evidence-finder-settings-disable-procedure"></a>

You can complete this task using the Audit Manager console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Audit Manager API.

**Warning**
Disabling evidence finder deletes the CloudTrail Lake event data store that Audit Manager created. As a result, you can't re-enable the feature. To re-use evidence finder after you disable it, you must [disable AWS Audit Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/general-settings.html#disable), and then [re-enable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/setup-audit-manager.html) the service completely.
