## Prerequisites
<a name="review-controls-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created at least one assessment. If you haven’t created an assessment yet, you won’t see any results when you follow these steps.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

### Control details section
<a name="review-control-detail"></a>

You can use the **Control details** section to see a summary of the assessment control.

In this section, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** |  The description that's provided for this control. |
| **Control status** | The status of the control. +  **Under review** – The control hasn't been reviewed yet. Evidence is still being collected for this control, and you can add manual evidence. This is the default status. <br />+  **Reviewed** – The evidence for this control is reviewed. Evidence is still being collected, and you can add manual evidence.  <br />+  **Inactive** – Automated evidence collection is stopped for this control. You can no longer add manual evidence.   |

### Evidence folders tab
<a name="review-evidence-folders"></a>

You can use this tab to see the evidence that's collected for this control. It's organized into folders on a daily basis. From here, you can also take the following actions:
+ **Review an evidence folder **– To see details for any evidence folder, choose the hyperlinked folder name.
+ **Add an evidence folder to an assessment report** – To include an evidence folder, select it and choose **Add to assessment report**.
+ **Remove an evidence folder from an assessment report** – To exclude a folder, select it and choose **Remove from assessment report**.
+ **Add manual evidence** – For instructions, see [Adding manual evidence in AWS Audit Manager](upload-evidence.md).

In this section, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Evidence folder** | The name of the evidence folder. The name is based on the date when the evidence was collected or manually added. |
| **Compliance check** | The number of issues in the evidence folder. This number represents the total number of security issues that were reported directly from AWS Security Hub CSPM, AWS Config, or both. <br />If you see **Not applicable**, this indicates that you either don't have Security Hub CSPM or AWS Config enabled, or the evidence comes from a different data source type. |
| Total evidence | The total number of evidence items inside the folder. |
| Assessment report selection | The number of evidence items within the folder that are included in the assessment report. |

**Tip**
If you can't see the evidence folder that you're looking for, change the dropdown filter to **All time**. Otherwise, you'll see the last seven days of folders by default.

### Details tab
<a name="review-details"></a>

In this section, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Testing information** | The recommended procedure to test that the control is working as intended. |
| Action plan | The recommended actions to take if the control needs to be remediated.  |

### Evidence sources tab
<a name="review-data-sources"></a>

You can use this tab to see where the assessment control collects evidence from. The evidence sources can include any of the following:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Common controls** | These are the common controls that collect evidence to support the assessment control.<br />Common controls collect evidence using underlying data sources that AWS manages for you. For every common control that’s listed, Audit Manager collects the relevant evidence for all of the supporting core controls. Choose a common control to see the related core controls. |
| **Core controls** | These are the core controls that collect evidence to support the assessment control.<br />Core controls collect evidence by using a predefined group of data sources that AWS manages for you. Choose a core control to see the underlying data sources. |
| Data sources | These are the individual data sources that collect evidence to support the assessment control.+  **Name** – The name of the data source. <br />+  **Type** – The type of data source that the evidence comes from.   If Audit Manager collects the evidence, the type can be *AWS Security Hub CSPM*, *AWS Config*, *AWS CloudTrail*, or *AWS API calls*.    If you upload your own evidence, the type is *Manual*. A description indicates if the required manual evidence is a *File upload* or a *Text response*.   <br />+  **Mapping** – The specific keyword that's used to collect evidence.   If the type is *AWS Config*, the mapping is an AWS Config rule (such as `SNS_ENCRYPTED_KMS`)   If the type is *AWS Security Hub CSPM*, the mapping is a Security Hub CSPM control (such as `EC2.1`).   If the type is *AWS API calls*, the mapping is an API call (such as `kms_ListKeys`).   If the type is *AWS CloudTrail*, the mapping is a CloudTrail event (such as `CreateAccessKey`).   <br />+  **Frequency** – How often Audit Manager collects evidence for an AWS API call data source.  |

### Comments tab

In this tab, you can add a comment about the control and its evidence. You can also see a list of previous comments.

+ Under **Previous comments**, you can view a list of previous comments along with the date the comment was made and the associated user ID.

### Changelog tab
<a name="review-changelog"></a>

You can use this tab to see the user activity for the assessment control. The same information is available as audit trail logs in AWS CloudTrail. With the user activity that's captured directly in Audit Manager, you can easily review an audit trail of activity for a given control.
