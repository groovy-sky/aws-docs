## What is the GLBA?
<a name="what-is-the-gramm-leach-bliley-act"></a>

The GLBA (or the GLB Act), also known as the Financial Service Modernization Act of 1999, is a federal law enacted in the United States to control the ways that financial institutions deal with the private information of individuals. The Act consists of three sections. The first is the Financial Privacy Rule, which regulates the collection and disclosure of private financial information. The second is the Safeguards Rule, which stipulates that financial institutions must implement security programs to protect such information. The third is the Pretexting provisions, which prohibit the practice of pretexting (accessing private information using false pretenses). The Act also requires financial institutions to give customers written privacy notices that explain their information-sharing practices.

## Using this framework
<a name="framework-gramm-leach-bliley-act"></a>

You can use the GLBA 2016 framework to help you prepare for audits. This framework includes a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped into control sets according to GLBA requirements. You can also customize this framework and its controls to support internal audits with specific requirements.

Using the GLBA framework as a starting point, you can create an Audit Manager assessment and start collecting evidence that’s relevant for a GLBA audit. In your assessment, you can specify the AWS accounts that you want to include in the scope of your audit. After you create an assessment, Audit Manager starts to assess your AWS resources. It does this based on the controls that are defined in the GLBA framework. When it's time for an audit, you—or a delegate of your choice—can review the evidence that Audit Manager collected. Either, you can browse the evidence folders in your assessment and choose which evidence you want to include in your assessment report. Or, if you enabled evidence finder, you can search for specific evidence and export it in CSV format, or create an assessment report from your search results. Either way, you can use this assessment report to show that your controls are working as intended.

The framework details are as follows:

| Framework name in AWS Audit Manager | Number of automated controls | Number of manual controls | Number of control sets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) | 0 | 120 | 16 |

The controls in this AWS Audit Manager framework aren't intended to verify if your systems are compliant with the GLBA standard. Moreover, they can't guarantee that you'll pass a GLBA audit. AWS Audit Manager doesn't automatically check procedural controls that require manual evidence collection.
