AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Troubleshooting framework issues

You can use the information on this page to resolve common framework issues in
Audit Manager.

###### General framework issues

## On my custom framework details page, I’m prompted to recreate my custom framework

![Screenshot of the pop-up message that prompts you to recreate your assessment.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/troubleshooting-recreate-framework-post-common-controls-console.png)

If you see a message that says **Updated control definitions are**
**available**, this indicates that Audit Manager now provides newer definitions
for some of the standard controls that are in your custom framework.

Standard controls can now collect evidence from [AWS managed source](concepts.md#aws-managed-source). This means that whenever Audit Manager updates the
underlying data sources for a common or core control, the same update is
automatically applied to the related standard controls. This helps you to ensure
continuous compliance as the cloud compliance environment changes. To make sure that
you benefit from these AWS managed sources, we recommend that you replace the
controls in your custom framework.

In your custom framework, Audit Manager indicates which controls have replacements
available. You’ll need to replace these controls before you can make a copy of your
custom framework. The next time that you edit your custom framework, we’ll prompt
you to replace these controls along with any other edits you’d like to make.

There are two ways to replace the controls in your custom framework:

###### 1\. Recreate your custom framework

If a large number of controls have replacements available, we recommend that
you recreate your custom framework. This is likely to be the best option if your
custom framework is based on a standard framework.

- For example, let’s say you created your custom framework using [NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5](nist800-53r5.md) as the starting
point. This standard framework has 1007 standard controls, and you added 20
custom controls.

- In this case, the most efficient option is to find `NIST 800-53 (Rev.
                              5) Low-Moderate-High` in the framework library and [make an editable copy of that framework](create-custom-frameworks-from-existing.md). During this process,
you can add the same 20 custom controls that you used before. Because you’re
now using the latest definition of the standard framework as your starting
point, your custom framework automatically inherits the latest definitions
for all of the 1007 standard controls.

###### 2\. Edit your custom framework

If a small number of controls have replacements available, we recommend that
you edit your custom framework and replace the controls manually.

- For example, let’s say you created your custom framework from scratch. In
your custom framework, you added 20 custom controls that you created
yourself, and eight standard controls from the [ACSC Essential Eight](essential-eight.md) standard
framework.

- In this case, because a maximum of eight controls would have updates
available, the most efficient option is to edit your custom framework and
replace those controls one by one. For instructions, see the following
procedure.

###### To manually replace controls in your custom framework

01. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Framework**
    **library**, then choose the **Custom**
    **frameworks** tab.

03. Select the framework that you want to edit, choose
     **Actions**, and then choose
     **Edit**.

04. On the **Edit framework details** page, choose
     **Next**.

05. On the **Edit control sets** page, review the
     name of each control set to see if any of its controls have
     replacements available.

06. Choose an affected control set to expand it and identify which of
     its controls need to be replaced.

    ###### Tip

    To more quickly identify controls, enter
    `Replacement available` in the search
    box.

07. Remove affected controls by selecting the check box and choosing
     **Remove from control set**.

08. Re-add the same controls. This action replaces the controls that
     you just removed with the latest control definition.
    1. Under **Add controls**, use the
        **Control type** dropdown list and
        select **Standard controls**.

    2. Find the replacement for the control that you just
        removed.

       ###### Tip

       In some cases, the replacement control name might not
       be exactly the same as the original. In this event, the
       replacement control name is likely to be very similar to
       the original. In rare cases, one control might be
       replaced by two controls (or the other way
       around).

       If you can't find a replacement control, we recommend
       that you do a partial search. To do this, enter part of
       the original control name or a keyword that represents
       what you're looking for. You can also search by
       compliance type to further narrow the list of
       results.

    3. Select the check box next to a control and choose
        **Add to control set**.

    4. In the pop-up window that appears, choose
        **Add** to confirm.
09. Repeat steps 6-8 as needed until you have replaced all
     controls.

10. Choose **Next**.

11. On the **Review and save** page, choose
     **Save changes**.

## I can’t make a copy of my custom framework

If the **Make a copy** button is unavailable on the framework
details page, this means that you need to replace some of the controls in your
custom framework.

For instructions on how to proceed, see [On my custom framework details page, I’m prompted to recreate my custom framework](#recreate-framework-post-common-controls).

## My sent share request status displays as _Failed_

If you try to share a custom framework and the operation fails, we recommend that
you check the following:

1. Make sure that Audit Manager is enabled in the recipient's AWS account and in the
    specified Region. For a list of supported AWS Audit Manager Regions, see [AWS Audit Manager\
    endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/audit-manager.md) in the _Amazon Web Services_
_General Reference_.

2. Make sure that you entered the correct AWS account ID when you specified
    the recipient account.

3. Make sure that you didn't specify an AWS Organizations management account as the
    recipient. You can share a custom framework with a delegated administrator,
    but if you try to share a custom framework with a management account, the
    operation fails.

4. If you use a customer managed key to encrypt your Audit Manager data, make sure that your
    KMS key is enabled. If your KMS key is disabled and you try to share a
    custom framework, the operation fails. For instructions on how to enable a
    disabled KMS key, see [Enabling and\
    disabling keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/enabling-keys.md) in the _AWS Key Management Service_
_Developer Guide_.

## My share request has a blue dot next to it. What does this mean?

A blue dot notification indicates that a share request needs your attention.

A blue notification dot appears next to sent share requests with a status
of _Expiring_. Audit Manager displays the blue dot
notification so that you can remind the recipient to take action on the
share request before it expires.

For the blue notification dot to disappear, the recipient must accept or
decline the request. The blue dot also disappears if you revoke the share
request.

You can use the following procedure to check for any expiring share
requests, and send an optional reminder to the recipient to take
action.

**To view notifications for sent**
**requests**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. If you have a share request notification, Audit Manager displays a red dot
    next to the navigation menu icon.

![Screenshot of the minimized navigation menu icon, with a red dot that indicates a notification.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/framework_sharing-navigation_minimized_notification-console.png)

3. Expand the navigation pane and look next to **Share**
**requests**. A notification badge indicates the number
    of share requests that need attention.

![Screenshot of the expanded navigation menu, with Shared framework requests highlighted and a notification badge showing 1 notification.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/framework_sharing-navigation_expanded_notification-console.png)

4. Choose **Share requests**, and then choose the
    **Sent requests** tab.

5. Look for the blue dot to identify share requests that expire
    within the next 30 days. Alternatively, you can also view expiring
    share requests by selecting **Expiring** from the
    **All statuses** filter dropdown.

![Screenshot of a received share request with a blue dot next to the framework name.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/framework_sharing-blue_dot_notification-sent_requests-console.png)

6. (Optional) Remind the recipient that they need to take action on
    the share request before it expires. This step is optional, as Audit Manager
    sends a notification in the console to inform the recipient when a
    share request is active or expiring. However, you can also send your
    own reminder to the recipient using your preferred communication
    channel.

A blue notification dot appears next to received share requests with a
status of _Active_ or _Expiring_. Audit Manager displays the blue dot
notification to remind you to take action on the share request before it
expires. For the blue notification dot to disappear, you must [accept or decline](responding-to-shared-framework-requests.md#responding-to-shared-framework-requests-step-2) the request. The blue dot also disappears if
the sender revokes the share request.

You can use the following procedure to check for active and expiring share
requests.

**To view notifications for received**
**requests**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. If you have a share request notification, Audit Manager displays a red dot
    next to the navigation menu icon.

![Screenshot of the minimized navigation menu icon, with a red dot that indicates a notification.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/framework_sharing-navigation_minimized_notification-console.png)

3. Expand the navigation pane and look next to **Share**
**requests**. A notification badge indicates the number
    of share requests that need your attention.

![Screenshot of the expanded navigation menu, with Share requests highlighted and a notification badge showing one notification.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/framework_sharing-navigation_expanded_notification-console.png)

4. Choose **Share requests**. By default, this page
    opens on the **Received requests** tab.

5. Identify the share requests that need your action by looking for
    items with a blue dot.

![Screenshot of a received share request with a blue dot next to the framework name.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/framework_sharing-blue_dot_notification-console.png)

6. (Optional) To view only requests that expire in the next 30 days,
    find the **All statuses** dropdown list and select
    **Expiring**.

## My shared framework has controls that use custom AWS Config rules as a data source. Can the recipient collect evidence for these controls?

Yes, your recipient can collect evidence for these controls, but a few steps are
needed to achieve this.

For Audit Manager to collect evidence using an AWS Config rule as a data source mapping, the
following must be true. These criteria apply to both managed rules and custom
rules.

- The rule must exist in the recipient’s AWS environment.

- The rule must be enabled in the recipient’s AWS environment.

Remember that the AWS Config rules in your account likely don’t exist already in the
recipient’s AWS environment. Moreover, when the recipient accepts the share
request, Audit Manager doesn’t recreate any of your custom rules in their account. For the
recipient to collect evidence using your custom rules as a data source mapping, they
must create the same custom rules in their instance of AWS Config. After the recipient
[creates](../../../config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config-develop-rules-nodejs.md) and then [enables](../../../config/latest/developerguide/setting-up-aws-config-rules-with-console.md) the rules in AWS Config, Audit Manager can collect evidence from that data
source.

We recommend that you communicate with the recipient to let them know if any
custom AWS Config rules should be created in their instance of AWS Config.

## I updated a custom rule that's used in a shared framework. Do I need to take any action?

###### For rule updates within your AWS environment

When you update a custom rule within your AWS environment, no action is
needed in Audit Manager. Audit Manager detects and handles rule updates in the way that's
described in the following table. Audit Manager doesn't notify you when a rule update is
detected.

ScenarioWhat Audit Manager doesWhat you need to do

A custom rule is **updated** in
your instance of AWS Config.

Audit Manager continues to report findings for that rule using the updated
rule definition.No action is needed.

A custom rule is **deleted** in
your instance of AWS Config.

Audit Manager stops reporting findings for the deleted rule.

No action is needed.

If you want to, you can [edit\
the custom controls](edit-controls.md) that used the deleted rule as a
data source mapping. You can then remove the deleted rule to
clean up your control's data source settings. Otherwise, the
deleted rule name remains as an unused data source
mapping.

###### For rule updates outside your AWS environment

In the recipient’s AWS environment, Audit Manager doesn’t detect the rule update.
This is because senders and recipients each work in separate AWS environments.
The following table provides recommended actions for this scenario.

Your roleScenarioRecommended action

Sender

- You shared a framework that uses custom rules as a
data source mapping.

- After you shared the framework, you updated or deleted
one of those rules in AWS Config.

Contact the recipient to let them know about the update. That
way, they can make the same update and stay in sync with the latest
rule definition.Recipient

- You accepted a shared framework that uses custom rules
as a data source mapping.

- After you recreated the custom rules in your instance
of AWS Config, the sender updated or deleted one of those
rules.

Make the corresponding rule update in your own instance of
AWS Config.
