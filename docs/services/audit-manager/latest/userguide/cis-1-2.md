# CIS AWS Benchmark v1.2.0

AWS Audit Manager provides two prebuilt frameworks that support the Center for Internet Security
(CIS) Amazon Web Services (AWS) Benchmark v1.2.0 _._

###### Note

- For information about the Audit Manager frameworks that support v1.3.0, see [CIS AWS Benchmark v1.3.0](cis-1-3.md).

- For information about the Audit Manager frameworks that support v1.4.0, see [CIS AWS Benchmark v1.4.0](cis-1-4.md).

## What is CIS?

The CIS is a nonprofit that developed the [CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf). This benchmark serves as a set of security
configuration best practices for AWS. These industry-accepted best practices go beyond
the high-level security guidance already available in that they provide you with clear,
step-by-step implementation and assessment procedures.

For more information, see the [CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark\
blog posts](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/tag/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark) on the _AWS Security Blog_.

###### Difference between CIS Benchmarks and CIS Controls

_CIS Benchmarks_ are security best practice
guidelines that are specific to vendor products. Ranging from operating systems to cloud
services and networks devices, the settings that are applied from a benchmark protect
the specific systems that your organization use. _CIS_
_Controls_ are foundational best practice guidelines for organization-level
systems to follow to help protect against known cyberattack vectors.

###### Examples

- CIS Benchmarks are prescriptive. They typically reference a specific setting that
can be reviewed and set in the vendor product.

**Example:** CIS AWS Benchmark v1.2.0 - Ensure MFA
is enabled for the "root user" account.

This recommendation provides prescriptive guidance on how to check for this and
how to set this on the root account for the AWS environment.

- CIS Controls are for your organization as a whole. They aren't specific to only
one vendor product.

**Example:** CIS v7.1 - Use Multi-Factor
Authentication for All Administrative Access

This control describes what's expected to be applied within your organization. It
doesn't describe how you should apply it for the systems and workloads that you're
running (regardless of where they are).

## Using this framework

You can use the CIS AWS Benchmark v1.2 frameworks in AWS Audit Manager to help you prepare
for CIS audits. You can also customize these frameworks and their controls to support
internal audits with specific requirements.

Using the frameworks as a starting point, you can create an Audit Manager assessment and start
collecting evidence that’s relevant for your audit. After you create an assessment, Audit Manager
starts to assess your AWS resources. It does this based on the controls that are defined
in the CIS framework. When it's time for an audit, you—or a delegate of your
choice—can review the evidence that Audit Manager collected. Either, you can browse the
evidence folders in your assessment and choose which evidence you want to include in your
assessment report. Or, if you enabled evidence finder, you can search for specific
evidence and export it in CSV format, or create an assessment report from your search
results. Either way, you can use this assessment report to show that your controls are
working as intended.

The framework details are as follows:

Framework name in AWS Audit ManagerNumber of automated controlsNumber of manual controlsNumber of control setsCenter for Internet Security (CIS) Amazon Web Services (AWS) Benchmark
v1.2.0, Level 13334Center for Internet Security (CIS) Amazon Web Services (AWS) Benchmark
v1.2.0, Level 1 and 24544

###### Important

To ensure that these frameworks collect the intended evidence from AWS Security Hub CSPM, make
sure that you enabled all standards in Security Hub CSPM.

To ensure that these frameworks collect the intended evidence from AWS Config, make sure
that you enable the necessary AWS Config rules. To review a list of the AWS Config rules that
are used as data source mappings for these standard frameworks, download the following
files:

1. [AuditManager\_ConfigDataSourceMappings\_CIS-AWS-Benchmark-v1.2.0,-Level-1.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/samples/AuditManager_ConfigDataSourceMappings_CIS-AWS-Benchmark-v1.2.0,-Level-1.zip)

2. [AuditManager\_ConfigDataSourceMappings\_CIS-AWS-Benchmark-v1.2.0,-Level-1-and-2.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/samples/AuditManager_ConfigDataSourceMappings_CIS-AWS-Benchmark-v1.2.0,-Level-1-and-2.zip)

The controls in these frameworks aren't intended to verify if your systems are
compliant with CIS AWS Benchmark best practices. Moreover, they can't guarantee that
you'll pass a CIS audit. AWS Audit Manager doesn't automatically check procedural controls that
require manual evidence collection.

### Prerequisites for using these frameworks

Many controls in the CIS AWS Benchmark v1.2 frameworks use AWS Config as a data source
type. To support these controls, you must [enable AWS Config](../../../config/latest/developerguide/getting-started.md) on all
accounts in each AWS Region where you enabled Audit Manager. You must also make sure that
specific AWS Config rules are enabled, and that these rules are configured correctly.

The following AWS Config rules and parameters are required to collect the correct evidence
and capture an accurate compliance status for the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.2.
For instructions on how to enable or configure a rule, see [Working with\
AWS Config Managed Rules](../../../config/latest/developerguide/managing-aws-managed-rules.md).
