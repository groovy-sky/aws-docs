AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Configuring your Audit Manager notifications

You can configure Audit Manager to send notifications to the Amazon SNS topic of your choice. If
you're subscribed to that SNS topic, you receive notifications directly whenever you
sign in to Audit Manager.

Follow the steps on this page to learn how to view and update your notification
settings to suit your preferences. You can use either a standard SNS topic or a FIFO
(first-in-first-out) SNS topic. Although Audit Manager supports sending notifications to FIFO
topics, the order that messages are sent in isn't guaranteed.

## Prerequisites

If you want to use an Amazon SNS topic that you don't own, you must configure your
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy for this. More specifically, you must configure it to allow
publishing from the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the topic. For an example policy
that you can use, see [Example 1 (Permissions for the SNS topic)](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#sns-topic-permissions).

## Procedure

You can update this setting using the Audit Manager console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the
Audit Manager API.

Audit Manager console

###### To update your notification settings on the Audit Manager console

1. From the **Assessment** settings tab, go to
    the **Notifications** section.

2. To use an existing SNS topic, select the topic name from the
    dropdown menu.

3. To create a new SNS topic, choose **Create new**
**topic**.

4. When you’re done, choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

###### To update your notification settings in the AWS CLI

Run the [update-settings](../../../cli/latest/reference/auditmanager/update-settings.md) command and use the
`--sns-topic` parameter to specify an SNS
topic.

In the following example, replace the `placeholder
                                text` with your own information:

```nohighlight

aws auditmanager update-settings --sns-topic arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:my-assessment-topic
```

Audit Manager API

###### To update your notification settings using the API

Call the [UpdateSettings](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-updatesettings.md) operation and use the [snsTopic](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-updatesettings.md#auditmanager-UpdateSettings-request-snsTopic) parameter to specify an SNS topic.
