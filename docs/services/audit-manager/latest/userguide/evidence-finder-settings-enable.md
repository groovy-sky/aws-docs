AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Enabling evidence finder
<a name="evidence-finder-settings-enable"></a>

You can enable the evidence finder feature in Audit Manager to search for evidence in your AWS account. If you're a delegated administrator for Audit Manager, you can search for evidence for all member accounts in your organization.

Follow these steps to learn how to enable evidence finder. Pay close attention to the prerequisites, as you'll need specific permissions to create and manage an event data store in CloudTrail Lake for this functionality.

## Prerequisites
<a name="evidence-finder-settings-enable-prerequisites"></a>

### Required permissions to enable evidence finder
<a name="evidence-finder-required-permissions"></a>

To enable evidence finder, you need permissions to create and manage an event data store in CloudTrail Lake. To use the feature, you need permissions to perform CloudTrail Lake queries. For an example permission policy that you can use, see [Example 3 (Permissions to enable evidence finder)](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#full-administrator-access-enable-evidence-finder).

If you need help with permissions, contact your AWS administrator. If you're an AWS administrator, you can copy the required permission statement and [attach it to an IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#add-policies-console).
