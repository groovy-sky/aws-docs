# Changing the status of an assessment control in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="change-assessment-control-status"></a>

You can change the status of an assessment control within your active assessment. Updating a control's status enables you to track its progress and indicate when you have reviewed it, keeping your assessment organized and up-to-date.

## Prerequisites
<a name="change-assessment-control-status-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created an assessment, and its current status is active.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to manage an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
<a name="change-assessment-control-status-procedure"></a>

You can update an assessment control status using the Audit Manager console, the Audit Manager API, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

**Note**
Changing a control status to *Reviewed* is final. After you set the status of a control to *Reviewed*, you can no longer change the status of that control or revert to a previous status.

   ```

   In the response, find the control that you want to update and take note of the control ID and its control set ID.

   + `--assessment-id` – The assessment that the control belongs to.
   + `--control-set-id` – The control set that the control belongs to.
   + `--control-id` – The control that you want to update.
   + `--control-status` – Set this value to `UNDER_REVIEW`, `REVIEWED`, or `INACTIVE`.
