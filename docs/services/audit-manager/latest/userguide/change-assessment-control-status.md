# Changing the status of an assessment control in AWS Audit Manager

You can change the status of an assessment control within your active assessment. Updating a
control's status enables you to track its progress and indicate when you have reviewed it,
keeping your assessment organized and up-to-date.

## Prerequisites

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created an assessment, and its
current status is active.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to manage an assessment in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

You can update an assessment control status using the Audit Manager console, the Audit Manager API, or the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

###### Note

Changing a control status to _Reviewed_ is final. After
you set the status of a control to _Reviewed_, you can no
longer change the status of that control or revert to a previous status.

Audit Manager console

###### To change an assessment control status on the Audit Manager console

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Assessments**.

3. Choose the name of the assessment to open it.

4. From the assessment page, choose the **Controls** tab, scroll down to
    the **Control sets** table, and then choose the name of a control to open
    it.

5. Choose **Update control status** at the top right of the page, and
    then choose a status:

StatusDescription

**Under review**

Choose this status if you haven't reviewed the control yet.

**Reviewed**

Choose this status if you have finished reviewing the evidence for this control,
and you want to continue collecting or adding evidence.**Inactive**

Choose this status if you want to stop collecting automated evidence for this
control.

6. Choose **Update control status** to confirm your choice.

AWS CLI

###### To change an assessment control status in the AWS CLI

1. Run the [list-assessments](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-assessments.html) command.

```

    aws auditmanager list-assessments
```

The response returns a list of assessments. Find the assessment that contains the
    control that you want to update, and take note of the assessment ID.

2. Run the [get-assessment](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/get-assessment.html) command and specify the assessment ID from step 1.

In the following example, replace the `placeholder text` with
    your own information.

```nohighlight

    aws auditmanager get-assessment --assessment-id 1a2b3c4d-1a2b-1a2b-1a2b-1a2b3c4e5f6g
```

In the response, find the control that you want to update and take note of the control
    ID and its control set ID.

3. Run the [update-assessment-control](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/update-assessment-control.html) command and specify the following parameters:

- `--assessment-id` – The assessment that the control belongs
to.

- `--control-set-id` – The control set that the control belongs
to.

- `--control-id` – The control that you want to update.

- `--control-status` – Set this value to `UNDER_REVIEW`,
`REVIEWED`, or `INACTIVE`.

In the following example, replace the `placeholder text` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

aws auditmanager update-assessment-control --assessment-id 1a2b3c4d-1a2b-1a2b-1a2b-1a2b3c4e5f6g --control-set-id "My control set" --control-id 2b3c4d5e-2b3c-2b3c-2b3c-2b3c4d5f6g7h --control-status REVIEWED
```

Audit Manager API

###### To change an assessment control status using the API

1. Use the [ListAssessments](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-listassessments.md) operation.

In the response, find the assessment that contains the control that you want to
    update, and take note of the assessment ID.

2. Use the [GetAssessment](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-getassessment.md) operation and specify the assessment ID from
    step 1.

In the response, find the control that you want to update and take note of the control
    ID and its control set ID.

3. Use the [UpdateAssessmentControl](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/update-assessment-control.html) operation and specify the following parameters:

- `assessmentId` – The assessment that the control belongs
to.

- `controlSetId` – The control set that the control belongs
to.

- `controlId` –The control that you want to update.

- `controlStatus` – Set this value to `UNDER_REVIEW`,
`REVIEWED`, or `INACTIVE`.

procedure to read more in the _AWS Audit Manager API Reference_. This

language-specific AWS SDKs.
