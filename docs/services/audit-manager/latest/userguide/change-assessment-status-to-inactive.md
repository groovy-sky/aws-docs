AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Changing the status of an assessment to inactive in AWS Audit Manager

When you no longer need to collect evidence for an assessment, you can change the assessment
status to _Inactive_. When the status of an assessment changes
to inactive, the assessment stops collecting evidence. As a result, you no longer incur any
charges for that assessment.

In addition to stopping evidence collection, Audit Manager makes the following changes to the
controls that are within the inactive assessment:

- All control sets change to _Reviewed_ status.

- All controls that are _Under review_ change to _Reviewed_ status.

- Delegates for the inactive assessment can no longer view or edit its controls and control
sets.

## Prerequisites

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created an assessment, and its
current status is active.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to manage an assessment in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

You can update an assessment status using the Audit Manager console, the Audit Manager API, or the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI).

###### Warning

This action is irreversible. We recommend that you proceed with caution and make sure that
you want to mark your assessment as inactive. When an assessment is inactive, you have
read-only access to its contents. This means that you can still review previously collected
evidence and generate assessment reports. However, you can’t edit the inactive assessment, add
comments, or upload any manual evidence.

Audit Manager console

###### To change an assessment status to inactive on the Audit Manager console

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Assessments**.

3. Choose the name of the assessment to open it.

4. On the upper-right corner of the page, choose **Update assessment**
**status**, and then choose **Inactive**.

5. Choose **Update status** in the pop-up window to confirm that you
    want to change the status to inactive.

The changes to the assessment and its controls take effect after approximately one
minute.

AWS CLI

###### To change an assessment status to inactive in the AWS CLI

1. First, identify the assessment that you want to update. To do this, run the [list-assessments](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-assessments.html) command.

```

    aws auditmanager list-assessments
```

The response returns a list of assessments. Find the assessment that you want to
    deactivate, and take note of the assessment ID.

2. Next, run the [update-assessment-status](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/update-assessment-status.html) command and specify the following parameters:

- `--assessment-id` – Use this parameter to specify the assessment
that you want to deactivate.

- `--status` – Set this value to `INACTIVE`.

In the following example, replace the `placeholder text` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

aws auditmanager update-assessment-status --assessment-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 --status INACTIVE
```

The changes to the assessment and its controls take effect after approximately one
minute.

Audit Manager API

###### To change an assessment status to inactive using the API

1. Use the [ListAssessments](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-listassessments.md)
    operation to find the assessment that you want to deactivate, and take note of the
    assessment ID.

2. Use the [UpdateAssessmentStatus](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-updateassessmentstatus.md) operation and specify the following parameters:

- [assessmentId](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-updateassessmentstatus.md#auditmanager-UpdateAssessmentStatus-request-assessmentId) – Use this parameter to specify the assessment that you
want to deactivate.

- [status](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-updateassessmentstatus.md#auditmanager-UpdateAssessmentStatus-request-status) – Set this value to `INACTIVE`.

The changes to the assessment and its controls take effect after approximately one
minute.

For more information about these API operations, choose any of the links in the previous
procedure to read more in the _AWS Audit Manager API Reference_. This
includes information about how to use these operations and parameters in one of the
language-specific AWS SDKs.

## Next steps

When you're certain that you no longer need your inactive assessment, you can clean up your
Audit Manager environment by deleting the assessment. For instructions, see [Deleting an assessment in AWS Audit Manager](delete-assessment.md).
