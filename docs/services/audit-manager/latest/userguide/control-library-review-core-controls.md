title: "Reviewing a core control"

AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Reviewing a core control
<a name="control-library-review-core-controls"></a>

You can review the details of a core control by using the Audit Manager console, the Audit Manager API, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

## Prerequisites
<a name="control-library-review-core-controls-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view controls in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
<a name="control-library-review-core-controls-procedure"></a>

------
#### [ Audit Manager console ]

**To view core control details on the Audit Manager console**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Control library**.

1. Choose **Common** to see the common controls that are provided by AWS.

1. Look for the common control that meets your use case.

1. Choose the tree view icon next to the common control name. This displays the core controls that support the common control.

1. Choose the name of the core control that you want to review.

1. Review the core control details using the following information as reference.

**Overview section**
This section describes the core control and lists the [data source types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/concepts.html#control-data-source) where it collects evidence from.

**Evidence sources tab**
This tab includes the following information:
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/control-library-review-core-controls.html)

**Details tab**
This tab includes the following information:
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/control-library-review-core-controls.html)

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To view core control details in the AWS CLI**

1. Follow the steps to [find a control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/access-available-controls.html). Make sure to set the `--control-type` as `Core`, and apply any optional filters as needed.

   ```
   aws auditmanager list-controls --control-type Core
   ```

1. In the response, identify the control that you want to review and take note of the control ID and Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

1. Run the [get-control](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/get-control.html) command and specify the `--control-id`. In the following example, replace the {{placeholder text}} with your own information.

   ```
   aws auditmanager get-control --control-id {{a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}}
   ```
**Tip**
The control details are returned in JSON format. To help you understand this data, see [get-control Output](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/get-control.html#output) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*.

1. To see tag details, run the [list-tags-for-resource](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-tags-for-resource.html) command and specify the `--resource-arn`. In the following example, replace the {{placeholder text}} with your own information.

   ```
   aws auditmanager list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:auditmanager:{{us-east-1}}:111122223333:control/{{a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}}
   ```

------
#### [ Audit Manager API ]

**To view core control details using the API**

1. Follow the steps to [find a control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/access-available-controls.html). Make sure to set the [controlType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListControls.html#auditmanager-ListControls-request-controlType) as `Core`, and apply any optional filters as needed.

1. In the response, identify the control that you want to review and take note of the control ID and Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

1. Use the [GetControl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetControl.html) operation and specify the [controlId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetControl.html#auditmanager-GetControl-request-controlId) that you noted in step 2.
**Tip**
The control details are returned in JSON format. To help you understand this data, see [GetControl Response Elements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetControl.html#API_GetControl_ResponseElements) in the *AWS Audit Manager API Reference*.

1. To see tag details, use the [ListTagsForResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListTagsForResource.html) operation and specify the [resourceArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListTagsForResource.html#auditmanager-ListTagsForResource-request-resourceArn) that you noted in step 2.

For more information about these API operations, choose any of the links in this procedure to read more in the *AWS Audit Manager API Reference*. This includes information about how to use these operations and parameters in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs.

## Next steps
<a name="control-library-review-core-controls-next-steps"></a>

You can choose the core controls that represent your goals and use them as building blocks to create a custom control. Each automated core control maps to a predefined grouping of AWS data sources that Audit Manager handles for you. This means that you don’t have to be an AWS expert to know which data sources collect the relevant evidence for your goals. Moreover, you don't have to maintain these data source mappings yourself.

For instructions on how to create a custom control that uses core controls as an evidence source, see [Creating a custom control in AWS Audit Manager](create-controls.md).
