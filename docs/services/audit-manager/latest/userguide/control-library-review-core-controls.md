AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Reviewing a core control

You can review the details of a core control by using the Audit Manager console, the Audit Manager API, or
the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view controls in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

Audit Manager console

###### To view core control details on the Audit Manager console

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Control library**.

3. Choose **Common** to see the common controls that are
    provided by AWS.

4. Look for the common control that meets your use case.

5. Choose the tree view icon next to the common control name. This displays the
    core controls that support the common control.

6. Choose the name of the core control that you want to review.

7. Review the core control details using the following information as
    reference.

**Overview section**

This section describes the core control and lists the [data source types](concepts.md#control-data-source) where it collects evidence
from.

**Evidence sources tab**

This tab includes the following information:

NameDescription

**Data sources**

These are the AWS managed data sources that the core control
collects evidence from. These data sources are automatically updated
whenever regulations and standards change and new data sources are identified.

- **Mapping** – The specific keyword
that's used to collect evidence.

- If the type is _AWS Config_, the mapping is an AWS Config rule
(such as `SNS_ENCRYPTED_KMS`).

- If the type is _AWS Security Hub CSPM_, the mapping is a Security Hub CSPM control
(such as `EC2.1`).

- If the type is _AWS API_
_calls_, the mapping is an API call (such as
`kms_ListKeys`).

- If the type is _AWS CloudTrail_, the mapping is a CloudTrail event (such as
`CreateAccessKey`).

- **Type** – The type of data source
that the evidence comes from.

- If Audit Manager collects the evidence, the type can be _AWS Security Hub CSPM_, _AWS Config_, _AWS CloudTrail_, or _AWS API_
_calls_.

- If you upload your own evidence, the type is _Manual_. A description indicates
if the required manual evidence is a _File upload_ or a _Text_
_response_.

- **Frequency** – How often Audit Manager
collects evidence for an AWS API call data source.

**Details tab**

This tab includes the following information:

NameDescription

**Instructions**

The directions that describe how to test and remediate the
control.

**Testing information**

The recommended testing procedures.**Action plan**

The recommended actions to take if you need to remediate the
control.

AWS CLI

###### To view core control details in the AWS CLI

1. Follow the steps to [find a\
    control](access-available-controls.md). Make sure to set the `--control-type` as
    `Core`, and apply any optional filters as needed.

```nohighlight

aws auditmanager list-controls --control-type Core
```

2. In the response, identify the control that you want to review and take note of
    the control ID and Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

3. Run the [get-control](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/get-control.html) command and specify the `--control-id`. In the
    following example, replace the `placeholder text` with
    your own information.

```nohighlight

aws auditmanager get-control --control-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111
```

###### Tip

The control details are returned in JSON format. To help you understand this
data, see [get-control Output](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/get-control.html) in the _AWS CLI Command_
_Reference_.

4. To see tag details, run the [list-tags-for-resource](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-tags-for-resource.html) command and specify the
    `--resource-arn`. In the following example, replace the
    `placeholder text` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws auditmanager list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:auditmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:control/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111
```

Audit Manager API

###### To view core control details using the API

1. Follow the steps to [find a\
    control](access-available-controls.md). Make sure to set the [controlType](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-listcontrols.md#auditmanager-ListControls-request-controlType) as `Core`, and apply any optional filters as
    needed.

2. In the response, identify the control that you want to review and take note of
    the control ID and Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

3. Use the [GetControl](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-getcontrol.md)
    operation and specify the [controlId](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-getcontrol.md#auditmanager-GetControl-request-controlId) that you noted in step 2.

###### Tip

The control details are returned in JSON format. To help you understand this
data, see [GetControl Response Elements](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-getcontrol.md#API_GetControl_ResponseElements) in the _AWS Audit Manager_
_API Reference_.

4. To see tag details, use the [ListTagsForResource](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-listtagsforresource.md) operation and specify the
    [resourceArn](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-listtagsforresource.md#auditmanager-ListTagsForResource-request-resourceArn) that you noted in step 2.

For more information about these API operations, choose any of the links in this
procedure to read more in the _AWS Audit Manager API_
_Reference_. This includes information about how to use these operations
and parameters in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs.

## Next steps

You can choose the core controls that represent your goals and use them as building
blocks to create a custom control. Each automated core control maps to a predefined
grouping of AWS data sources that Audit Manager handles for you. This means that you don’t have
to be an AWS expert to know which data sources collect the relevant evidence for your
goals. Moreover, you don't have to maintain these data source mappings yourself.

For instructions on how to create a custom control that uses core controls as an
evidence source, see [Creating a custom control in AWS Audit Manager](create-controls.md).
