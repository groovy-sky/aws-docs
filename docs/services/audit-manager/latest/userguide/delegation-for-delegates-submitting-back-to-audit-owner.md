# Submitting a reviewed control set back to the audit owner

After reviewing the control set, adding comments or additional evidence, and updating the status of individual controls, you reach an important step – submitting the reviewed control set back to the audit owner. Submitting the reviewed control set marks the completion of your delegated tasks, and enables the audit owner to incorporate your insights and recommendations into the overall assessment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to submit the reviewed control set back to the audit owner in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).
