# Submitting a reviewed control set back to the audit owner

After reviewing the control set, adding comments or additional evidence, and updating
the status of individual controls, you reach an important step – submitting the reviewed
control set back to the audit owner. Submitting the reviewed control set marks the
completion of your delegated tasks, and enables the audit owner to incorporate your insights
and recommendations into the overall assessment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to submit the reviewed
control set back to the audit owner in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these
permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

Follow these steps to submit the control set to the audit owner.

###### To submit a reviewed control set back to the audit owner

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. Choose **Notifications** in the left navigation pane.

3. Review the list of control sets that were delegated to you. Find the control set
    that you want to submit back to the audit owner, and choose the name of the related
    assessment.

4. Scroll down to the **Control sets** table, select the control set
    that you want to submit to the audit owner, and then choose **Submit for**
**review**.

5. In the pop-up window that appears, you can add comments before choosing
    **Submit for review**.
