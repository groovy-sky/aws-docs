AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see

# Supported data source types for automated evidence

When you create a custom control in AWS Audit Manager, you can set up your control to collect
automated evidence from the following data source types:

- AWS CloudTrail

- AWS Security Hub CSPM

- AWS Config

- AWS API calls

Each data source type offers distinct capabilities for capturing user activity logs,
compliance findings, resource configurations, and more.

In this chapter you can learn about each of these automated data source types, and the
specific AWS Security Hub CSPM controls, AWS Config rules, and AWS API calls that are supported by
Audit Manager.

## Key points

The following table provides an overview of each automated data source type.

Data source typeDescriptionEvidence collection frequencyTo use this data source type...When this control is active in an assessment...Related troubleshooting tips

AWS CloudTrail

Tracks a specific user activity.

Continuous.

Select from the list of [supported event names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/control-data-sources-cloudtrail.html).

Audit Manager filters your CloudTrail logs based on the keyword that you choose. The results
are imported as **User activity** evidence.

AWS Config

Captures a snapshot of your resource security posture by reporting findings from
AWS Config.

Based on the triggers defined in the AWS Config rule.

Choose a rule type, then select a rule.

- For managed rules, select from the list of [supported managed rule keywords](control-data-sources-config.md#aws-config-managed-rules).

- For custom rules, select from the list of [your available rules](control-data-sources-config.md#aws-config-custom-rules).

Audit Manager gets the findings for this rule directly from AWS Config. The result is imported
as **Compliance check** evidence.

AWS Security Hub CSPM

Captures a snapshot of your resource security posture by reporting findings from
Security Hub CSPM.

Based on the schedule of the Security Hub CSPM check.

Select from the list of [supported Security Hub CSPM\
control IDs](control-data-sources-ash.md).

Audit Manager gets the result of the security check directly from Security Hub CSPM. The result is
imported as **Compliance check** evidence.

[My assessment isn’t collecting compliance check evidence from AWS Security Hub CSPM](evidence-collection-issues.md#no-evidence-from-security-hub)AWS API calls

Takes a snapshot of your resource configuration directly through an API call to
the specified AWS service.

Daily, weekly, or monthly.Select from the list of [supported API\
calls](control-data-sources-api.md), then select your preferred frequency.Audit Manager makes the API call based on the frequency that you specify. The response is
imported as **Configuration data** evidence. [My assessment isn’t collecting configuration data evidence for an AWS API call](evidence-collection-issues.md#no-evidence-from-aws-api-calls)

###### Tip

You can create custom controls that collect evidence using predefined groupings of the
above data sources. These data source groupings are known as [AWS managed\
sources](concepts.md#aws-managed-source). Each AWS managed source represents a common control or a core control
that aligns with a common compliance requirement. This gives you an efficient way to map
your compliance requirements to a relevant group of AWS data sources. To see the available
common controls, see [Finding the available controls in AWS Audit Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/access-available-controls.html).

Alternatively, you can use the four data source types above to define your own custom
data sources. This gives you the flexibility to upload manual evidence, or collect automated
evidence from a business-specific resource such as a custom AWS Config rule.
