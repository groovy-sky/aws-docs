title: "Responding to share requests in AWS Audit Manager"
---

AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Responding to share requests in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests"></a>

This tutorial describes the actions to take when you receive a share request for a custom framework. Audit Manager notifies you when you receive a share request. You also receive a notification to remind you when a share request is due to expire in the next 30 days.

## Prerequisites
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests-prerequisites"></a>

Before you get started, we recommend that you first learn more about Audit Manager [framework sharing concepts and terminology](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/share-custom-framework-concepts-and-terminology.html).

+ [Step 2: Take action on the request](#responding-to-shared-framework-requests-step-2)
+ [Step 3: View a history of your received requests](#responding-to-shared-framework-requests-step-3)

### Step 1: Check your received request notifications
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests-step-1"></a>

Start by checking your share request notifications. The **Received requests** tab displays a list of the share requests that you’ve received from other AWS accounts. Requests that are awaiting your response appear with a blue dot. You can also filter this view to display only requests that expire sometime within the next 30 days*.*

**To view received requests**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. If you have a share request notification, Audit Manager displays a red dot next to the navigation menu icon.

1. Expand the navigation pane and look next to **Share requests**. A notification badge indicates the number of share requests that need your attention.
![Screenshot of the expanded navigation menu, with share requests highlighted and a notification badge.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/framework_sharing-navigation_expanded_notification-console.png)

1. Choose **Share requests**. By default, this page opens on the **Received requests** tab.

1. Identify the share requests that need your action by looking for items with a blue dot.

1. (Optional) To view only requests that expire in the next 30 days, find the **All statuses** dropdown list and select **Expiring**.

### Step 2: Take action on the request
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests-step-2"></a>

To remove the blue notification dot, you need to take action by either accepting or declining the share request.

#### Accepting a shared framework
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests-accept"></a>

When you accept a share request, Audit Manager replicates a snapshot of the original framework into the custom frameworks tab of your framework library. Audit Manager replicates and encrypts the new custom framework using the KMS key that you specified in your [Audit Manager settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/settings-KMS.html).

**To accept a share request**

1. Open the **Share requests** page and make sure that you're viewing the **Received requests** tab.

1. (Optional) Select **Active** or **Expiring** from the filter dropdown list.

1. (Optional) Choose a framework name to view the details of the share request. This includes information such as the framework description, the number of controls that are in the framework, and the message from the sender.

1. Select the share request that you want to accept, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Accept**.

After you accept a share request, the status changes to *replicating* while the shared custom framework is added to your framework library. If the framework contains custom controls, these controls are added to your control library at this time.

When the framework replication is complete, the status changes to *shared*. A success banner notifies you that the custom framework is ready to use.

**Tip**
When you accept a custom framework, it's replicated only to your current AWS Region. You might want the new shared framework to be available across all Regions in your AWS account. If so, after you accept the share request you can [share the framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/framework-sharing.html) to other Regions under your account as needed.

#### Declining a shared framework
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests-reject"></a>

When you decline a share request, Audit Manager doesn’t add that custom framework to your framework library. However, a record of the declined share request remains in the **Received requests **tab, with a status of **Inactive**.

**To decline a share request**

1. Open the **Share requests** page and make sure that you're viewing the **Received requests** tab.

1. (Optional) Select **Active** or **Expiring** from the filter dropdown list.

1. (Optional) Choose a framework name to view the details of the share request. This includes information such as the framework description, the number of controls that are in the framework, and the message from the sender.

1. Select the share request that you want to decline, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Decline**.

1. In the dialog box that appears, choose **Decline** to confirm your choice.

**Tip**
If you change your mind and want access to a shared framework after you decline, ask the sender to send you a new share request.

**Note**
It can take up to 10 minutes to process share request actions when a framework is shared across AWS Regions. After taking action on a cross-Region share request, we recommend that you check back later to confirm that the share request was successfully accepted or declined.

### Step 3: View a history of your received requests
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests-step-3"></a>

After you accept or decline a shared framework, you can return to the **Share requests** page to see your share request history. You can filter this list as needed. For example, you can apply filters to display only requests that you accepted.

**To view a history of your share requests **

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Share requests**.

1. Choose the **Received requests** tab.

1. Find the **All statuses** dropdown list, and select one of the following filters:

## Next steps
<a name="responding-to-shared-framework-requests-what-now"></a>

After you accept a shared custom framework, you can find it in the custom frameworks tab of the framework library. You can now use that framework to create an assessment. To learn more, see [Creating an assessment in AWS Audit Manager](create-assessments.md).

For instructions on how to edit your new custom framework, see [Editing a custom framework in AWS Audit Manager](edit-custom-frameworks.md).
