## What is AWS Control Tower?
<a name="what-is-controltower"></a>

AWS Control Tower is a management and governance service that you can use to navigate through the setup process and governance requirements that are involved in creating a multi-account AWS environment.

With AWS Control Tower, you can provision new AWS accounts that conform to your company- or organization-wide policies in a few clicks. AWS Control Tower creates an *orchestration* layer on your behalf that combines and integrates the capabilities of several other [AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/integrated-services.html). These services include AWS Organizations, AWS IAM Identity Center, and AWS service Catalog. This helps streamline the process of setting up and governing a multi-account AWS environment that's both secure and compliant.

The AWS Control Tower Guardrails framework contains all of the AWS Config Rules that are based on guardrails from AWS Control Tower.

## Using this framework
<a name="framework-controltower"></a>

You can use the *AWS Control Tower Guardrails* framework to help you prepare for audits. This framework includes a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are grouped according to the AWS Config Rules that are based on guardrails from AWS Control Tower. You can also customize this framework and its controls to support internal audits with specific requirements.

Using the framework as a starting point, you can create an Audit Manager assessment and start collecting evidence that’s relevant for an AWS Control Tower audit. After you create an assessment, Audit Manager starts to assess your AWS resources. It does this based on the controls that are defined in the AWS Control Tower Guardrails framework. When it's time for an audit, you—or a delegate of your choice—can review the evidence that Audit Manager collected. Either, you can browse the evidence folders in your assessment and choose which evidence you want to include in your assessment report. Or, if you enabled evidence finder, you can search for specific evidence and export it in CSV format, or create an assessment report from your search results. Either way, you can use this assessment report to show that your controls are working as intended.

The AWS Control Tower Guardrails framework details are as follows:

| Framework name in AWS Audit Manager | Number of automated controls | Number of manual controls | Number of control sets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Control Tower Guardrails | 14 | 0 | 5 |

**Important**
To ensure that this framework collects the intended evidence from AWS Config, make sure that you enable the necessary AWS Config rules. To review the AWS Config rules that are used as data source mappings in this standard framework, download the [AuditManager\_ConfigDataSourceMappings\_AWS-Control-Tower-Guardrails.zip](samples/AuditManager_ConfigDataSourceMappings_AWS-Control-Tower-Guardrails.zip) file.

The controls in this AWS Audit Manager framework aren't intended to verify if your systems are compliant with AWS Control Tower Guardrails. Moreover, they can't guarantee that you'll pass an audit.
