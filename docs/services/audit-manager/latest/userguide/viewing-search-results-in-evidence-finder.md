AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Viewing results in evidence finder
<a name="viewing-search-results-in-evidence-finder"></a>

After your search is finished, you can view the results that matched your search criteria.

Keep in mind that multiple resources might be assessed during evidence collection. As a result, evidence can include one or more related resources. In evidence finder, results are shown at the resource level, with one row for each resource. You can preview a summary of each resource without leaving the page.

After you review the search results, you can generate an assessment report that includes that evidence. You can also export your search results into a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

**Important**
We recommend that you keep evidence finder open until you finished exploring your search results. Your search results are discarded when you navigate away from the **View Results** table. If needed, you can [view your recent results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-results.html) in the CloudTrail console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/). Here, the results of your search queries are preserved for seven days. However, keep in mind that you can't generate an assessment report from your search results in the CloudTrail console.

## Prerequisites
<a name="viewing-search-results-in-evidence-finder-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you already followed the steps to [perform a search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/search-for-evidence-in-evidence-finder.html) in evidence finder.

## Procedure
<a name="viewing-search-results-in-evidence-finder-procedure"></a>

Follow these steps to view your search results in evidence finder.

**Tasks**
+ [Step 1. Viewing the grouped results](#review-grouped-results)
+ [Step 2. Viewing the search results](#review-search-results)
  + [Managing your viewing preferences](#manage-preferences)
  + [Previewing resource summaries](#preview-evidence)

### Step 1. Viewing the grouped results
<a name="review-grouped-results"></a>

If you grouped your results, you can review the groupings before you dive deeper into the evidence.

**Note**
If you didn't group results, evidence finder doesn’t display the **Group by results** table. Instead, you're taken directly to the **View results** table.

Use the **Group by results** table to learn the breadth of the matching evidence and how it's distributed across a specific dimension. Results are grouped by the value that you selected. For example, if you grouped by **Resource type**, the table shows a list of AWS resource types. The **Total evidence** column shows the number of matching results for each resource type.

**To get the results for a group**

1. From the **Group by results** table, select the row for the results that you want to get.

1. Choose **Get results**. This starts a new search query, and redirects you to the **View results** table where you can see the results for that group.

### Step 2. Viewing the search results
<a name="review-search-results"></a>

The **View results** table displays your search results. From here, you can manage your viewing preferences and preview resource summaries.

#### Managing your viewing preferences
<a name="manage-preferences"></a>

Your viewing preferences control what you see on the results page.

**To manage your viewing preferences**

1. Choose the settings icon (⚙) at the top of the **View results** table.

1. Review and change the following settings as needed:
[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/viewing-search-results-in-evidence-finder.html)

1. Choose **Confirm** to save your preferences.

#### Previewing resource summaries
<a name="preview-evidence"></a>

You can preview the related resources for the evidence that matched your search query. This helps you determine if the search query returned the intended results, or if you need to adjust your filters and re-run the search query.

Keep in mind that evidence can have one or more related resources. Evidence finder shows results at the resource level (with one row for each resource).

**Note**
Evidence finder returns results for automated and manual evidence. However, you can only preview resource summaries for automated evidence. This is because Audit Manager doesn’t perform resource assessments for manual evidence, and as a result, no resource summary is available.
To see details about manual evidence, choose the evidence name to open the evidence details page. If you generate an assessment report from your evidence finder results, the manual evidence details are included in the assessment report.

**To preview resource summaries**

1. Select the radio button next to a result. This opens a resource summary panel on the current page.

1. (Optional) To see the full details of the related evidence, choose the evidence name.

1. (Optional) Use the horizontal lines (**=**) to drag and resize the resource summary pane.

1. Choose (**x**) to close the resource summary pane.
