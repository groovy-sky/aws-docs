# Viewing results in evidence finder

After your search is finished, you can view the results that matched your search criteria.

Keep in mind that multiple resources might be assessed during evidence collection. As a
result, evidence can include one or more related resources. In evidence finder, results are shown
at the resource level, with one row for each resource. You can preview a summary of each resource
without leaving the page.

After you review the search results, you can generate an assessment report that includes
that evidence. You can also export your search results into a comma-separated values (CSV)
file.

###### Important

We recommend that you keep evidence finder open until you finished exploring your search
results. Your search results are discarded when you navigate away from the **View**
**Results** table. If needed, you can [view your recent results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-results.html) in the
CloudTrail console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail). Here, the results of your search queries are preserved
for seven days. However, keep in mind that you can't generate an assessment report from your
search results in the CloudTrail console.

## Prerequisites

The following procedure assumes that you already followed the steps to [perform a\
search](search-for-evidence-in-evidence-finder.md) in evidence finder.

## Procedure

Follow these steps to view your search results in evidence finder.

###### Tasks

- [Step 1. Viewing the grouped results](#review-grouped-results)

- [Step 2. Viewing the search results](#review-search-results)

- [Managing your viewing preferences](#manage-preferences)

- [Previewing resource summaries](#preview-evidence)

### Step 1. Viewing the grouped results

If you grouped your results, you can review the groupings before you dive deeper into the
evidence.

###### Note

If you didn't group results, evidence finder doesn’t display the **Group by**
**results** table. Instead, you're taken directly to the **View**
**results** table.

Use the **Group by results** table to learn the breadth of the matching
evidence and how it's distributed across a specific dimension. Results are grouped by the value
that you selected. For example, if you grouped by **Resource type**, the table
shows a list of AWS resource types. The **Total evidence** column shows the
number of matching results for each resource type.

###### To get the results for a group

1. From the **Group by results** table, select the row for the results that
    you want to get.

2. Choose **Get results**. This starts a new search query, and redirects
    you to the **View results** table where you can see the results for that
    group.

### Step 2. Viewing the search results

The **View results** table displays your search results. From
here, you can manage your viewing preferences and preview resource summaries.

#### Managing your viewing preferences

Your viewing preferences control what you see on the results page.

###### To manage your viewing preferences

1. Choose the settings icon (⚙) at the top of the **View results**
    table.

2. Review and change the following settings as needed:

SettingDescription

**Select visible table columns**

Use the toggle option to change which columns are displayed.

**Page size**

Select a radio button to specify how many results are shown on each page.**Wrap text**

Select the check box to wrap long lines of text for better readability.

3. Choose **Confirm** to save your preferences.

#### Previewing resource summaries

You can preview the related resources for the
evidence that matched your search query. This helps you determine if the search query returned
the intended results, or if you need to adjust your filters and re-run the search query.

Keep in mind that evidence can have one or more related resources. Evidence finder shows
results at the resource level (with one row for each resource).

###### Note

Evidence finder returns results for automated and manual evidence. However, you can only
preview resource summaries for automated evidence. This is because Audit Manager doesn’t perform
resource assessments for manual evidence, and as a result, no resource summary is
available.

To see details about manual evidence, choose the evidence name to open the evidence
details page. If you generate an assessment report from your evidence finder results, the
manual evidence details are included in the assessment report.

###### To preview resource summaries

1. Select the radio button next to a result. This opens a resource summary panel on the
    current page.

2. (Optional) To see the full details of the related evidence, choose the evidence
    name.

3. (Optional) Use the horizontal lines ( **=**) to drag and resize the
    resource summary pane.

4. Choose ( **x**) to close the resource summary pane.

## Next steps

After you review your search results, you can generate an assessment report from them or
export them as a CSV file. For instructions, see [Exporting your search results from evidence finder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/exporting-search-results-from-evidence-finder.html).
