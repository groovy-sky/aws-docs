# EU GMP Annex 11, v1

AWS Audit Manager provides a prebuilt framework that supports the EudraLex - The Rules Governing
Medicinal Products in the European Union (EU) - Volume 4: Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use - Annex 11.

## What is the EU GMP Annex 11?

The EU GMP Annex 11 framework is the European equivalent to the Title 21 CFR part 11
framework in the United States. This annex applies to all forms of computerized systems
that are used as part of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regulated activities. A
computerized system is a set of software and hardware components that together fulfill
certain functionalities. The application should be validated and IT infrastructure should
be qualified. Where a computerized system replaces a manual operation, there should be no
resultant decrease in product quality, process control, or quality assurance. There should
be no increase in the overall risk of the process.

Annex 11 is part of the European GMP guidelines and defines the terms of reference for
computerized systems that are used by organizations in the pharmaceutical industry. Annex
11 functions as a checklist that enables the European regulatory agencies to establish the
requirements for computerized systems that relate to pharmaceutical products and medical
devices. The guidelines set by the Commission of the European Committees aren't that much
distant from the FDA (Title 21 CFR Part 11). Annex 11 defines the criteria for how
electronic records and electronic signatures are considered to be managed.

## Using this framework

You can use the EU GMP Annex 11 framework to help you prepare for audits. This
framework includes a prebuilt collection of controls with descriptions and testing
procedures. These controls are grouped into control sets according to EU GMP requirements.
You can also customize this framework and its controls to support internal audits with
specific requirements.

Using the framework as a starting point, you can create an Audit Manager assessment and start
collecting evidence that’s relevant for your audit. After you create an assessment, Audit Manager
starts to assess your AWS resources. It does this based on the controls that are defined
in the EU GMP Annex 11 framework. When it's time for an audit, you—or a
delegate of your choice—can review the evidence that Audit Manager collected. Either, you
can browse the evidence folders in your assessment and choose which evidence you want to
include in your assessment report. Or, if you enabled evidence finder, you can search for
specific evidence and export it in CSV format, or create an assessment report from your
search results. Either way, you can use this assessment report to show that your controls
are working as intended.

###### Important

To ensure that this framework collects the intended evidence from AWS Config, make sure
that you enable the necessary AWS Config rules. To review the AWS Config rules that are used
as data source mappings in this standard framework, download the [AuditManager\_ConfigDataSourceMappings\_EudraLex-GMP-Volume-4-Annex-11.zip](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/samples/AuditManager_ConfigDataSourceMappings_EudraLex-GMP-Volume-4-Annex-11.zip)
file.

The controls in this framework aren't intended to verify if your systems are compliant
with the EU GMP Annex 11 requirements. Moreover, they can't guarantee that you'll pass a
EU GMP audit. AWS Audit Manager doesn't automatically check procedural controls that require manual
evidence collection.
