AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Creating a custom control from scratch in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="customize-control-from-scratch"></a>

When your organization's compliance requirements don't align with the pre-built standard controls that are available in AWS Audit Manager, you can create your own custom control from scratch.

This page outlines the steps to create a custom control that's tailored to your specific needs.

## Prerequisites
<a name="from-scratch-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to create a custom control in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

To successfully collect evidence from AWS Config and Security Hub CSPM, make sure that you do the following:
+ [Enable AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html), then apply the [required settings for using AWS Config with Audit Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/setup-recommendations.html#setup-recommendations-services)
+ [Enable Security Hub CSPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-settingup.html), then apply the [required settings for using Security Hub CSPM with Audit Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/setup-recommendations.html#set-up-securityhub)

 Audit Manager can then collect evidence each time an evaluation occurs for a given AWS Config rule or Security Hub CSPM control.

## Procedure

**Topics**
+ [Step 1: Specify control details](#from-scratch-step-1)
+ [Step 2: Specify evidence sources](#from-scratch-step-2)
+ [Step 3 (Optional): Define action plan](#from-scratch-step-3)
+ [Step 4: Review and create the control](#from-scratch-step-4)

### Step 1: Specify control details
<a name="from-scratch-step-1"></a>

Start by specifying the details of your custom control.

**Important**
We strongly recommend that you never put sensitive identifying information into free-form fields such as **Control details** or **Testing information**. If you create custom controls that contain sensitive information, you can’t share any of your custom frameworks that contain these controls.

**To specify control details**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Control library**, and then choose **Create custom control**.

1. Under **Control details**, enter the following information about the control.
   + **Control** – Enter a friendly name, a title, or a risk assessment question. This value helps you to identify your control in the control library.
   + **Description (optional)** – Enter details to help others understand the control's objective. This description appears on the control details page.

1. Under **Testing information**, enter the recommended steps for testing the control.

1. Under **Tags**, choose **Add new tag** to associate a tag with the control. You can specify a key for each tag that best describes the compliance framework that this control supports. The tag key is mandatory and can be used as a search criteria when you search for this control in the control library.

1. Choose** Next**.

### Step 2: Specify evidence sources
<a name="from-scratch-step-2"></a>

Next, specify some evidence sources. An evidence source determines where your custom control collects evidence from. You can use AWS managed sources, customer managed sources, or both.

**Tip**
We recommend that you use AWS managed sources. Whenever an AWS managed source is updated, the same updates are automatically applied to all custom controls that use these sources. This means that your custom controls collect evidence against the latest definitions of that evidence source.

If you’re not sure which options to choose, see the following examples and our recommendations.

| Your role | Your goal | Recommended evidence source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GRC professional | I want to collect evidence for a particular domain or objective | AWS managed ([](concepts.md#common-control))<br />Use a predefined grouping of data sources that map to a specific common control. |
| Technical expert | I want to collect evidence about the AWS resources I'm responsible for | AWS managed ([](concepts.md#core-control))<br />Use a predefined grouping of data sources that map to an AWS requirement. |
| Technical expert | I want to use a custom AWS Config rule to collect evidence | Customer managed (Automated [](concepts.md#control-data-source)) <br />Use a custom data source to collect specific automated evidence. |
| GRC professional | I want to collect evidence, such as documents and text responses | Customer managed (Manual [](concepts.md#control-data-source))<br />Use a custom data source to upload your own manual evidence. |

#### To specify an AWS managed source (recommended)
<a name="create-using-aws-managed-evidence-sources"></a>

We recommend that you start by choosing one or more common controls. When you choose the common control that represents your goal, Audit Manager collects the relevant evidence for all of the supporting core controls. You can also choose individual core controls if you want to collect targeted evidence about your AWS environment.

**To specify an AWS managed source**

1. Go to the **AWS managed sources** section of the page.

1. To add a common control, follow these steps:

   1. Select **Use a common control that matches your compliance goal**.

   1. Choose a common control from the dropdown list.

   1. (Optional) Repeat step 2 as needed. You can add up to five common controls.

1. To remove a common control, choose the **X** next to the control name.

1. To add a core control, follow these steps:

   1. Select **Use a core control that matches a prescriptive AWS guideline**.

   1. Choose a common control from the dropdown list.

   1. (Optional) Repeat step 4 as needed. You can add up to 50 core controls.

1. To remove a core control, choose the **X** next to the control name.

1. To add customer managed data sources, use the following procedure. Otherwise, choose **Next**.

#### To specify a customer managed source
<a name="create-using-customer-managed-data-sources"></a>

To collect automated evidence from a data source, you must choose a data source type and a data source mapping. These details map to your AWS usage, and tell Audit Manager where to collect the evidence from. If you want to provide your own evidence, you’ll choose a manual data source instead.

**Note**
You're responsible for maintaining the data source mappings that you create in this step.

**To specify a customer managed source**

1. Go to the **Customer managed sources** section of the page.

1. Select **Use a data source to collect manual or automated evidence**.

1. Choose **Add**.

1. Choose one of the following options:
   + Choose **AWS API calls**, then choose an API call and an evidence collection frequency.
   + Choose **AWS CloudTrail event**, then choose an event name.
   + Choose **AWS Config managed rule**, then choose a rule identifier.
   + Choose **AWS Config custom rule**, then choose a rule identifier.
   + Choose **AWS Security Hub CSPM control**, then choose a Security Hub CSPM control.
   + Choose **Manual data source**, then choose an option:
     + **File upload** – Use this option if the control requires documentation as evidence.
     + **Text response** – Use this option if the control requires an answer to a risk assessment question.
**Tip**
For information about automated data source types and troubleshooting tips, see [Supported data source types for automated evidence](control-data-sources.md).
If you need to validate your data source setup with an expert, choose **Manual data source** for now. That way, you can create the control and add it to a framework now, and then [edit the control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/edit-controls.html) as needed later.

1. Under **Data source name**, provide a descriptive name.

1. (Optional) Under **Additional details**, enter a data source description and a troubleshooting description.

1. Choose **Add data source**.

1. (Optional) To add another data source, choose **Add** and repeat steps 1-7. You can add up to 100 data sources.

1. To remove a data source, select the data source from the table, then choose **Remove**.

1. When you're finished, choose **Next**.

### Step 3 (Optional): Define action plan
<a name="from-scratch-step-3"></a>

Next, specify the actions to take if this control needs to be remediated.

**Important**
We strongly recommend that you never put sensitive identifying information into free-form fields such as **Action plan**. If you create custom controls that contain sensitive information, you can’t share any of your custom frameworks that contain these controls.

**To define action plan**

1. Under **Title**, enter a descriptive title for the action plan.

1. Under **Instructions**, enter detailed instructions for the action plan.

1. Choose **Next**.

### Step 4: Review and create the control
<a name="from-scratch-step-4"></a>

Review the information for the control. To change the information for a step, choose **Edit**.

When you're finished, choose **Create custom control**.

## Next steps
<a name="from-scratch-whatnow"></a>

After you create a new custom control, you can add it to a custom framework. To learn more, see [Creating a custom framework in AWS Audit Manager](custom-frameworks.md) or [Editing a custom framework in AWS Audit Manager](edit-custom-frameworks.md).

After you add the custom control to a custom framework, you can create an assessment and start collecting evidence. To learn more, see [Creating an assessment in AWS Audit Manager](create-assessments.md).

To revisit your custom control at a later date, see [Finding the available controls in AWS Audit Manager](access-available-controls.md). You can follow these steps to locate your custom control so that you can view, edit, or delete it.
