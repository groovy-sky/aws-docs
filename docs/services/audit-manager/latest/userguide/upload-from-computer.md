title: "Uploading manual evidence files from your browser"
---

AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Uploading manual evidence files from your browser
<a name="upload-from-computer"></a>

You can manually upload evidence files from your browser into your Audit Manager assessment. This enables you to supplement the automatically collected evidence with additional supporting materials.

## Prerequisites
<a name="upload-from-computer-prerequisites"></a>
+ The maximum supported size for a single manual evidence file is 100 MB.
+ You must use one of the [Supported file formats for manual evidence](supported-manual-evidence-files.md).
+ Each AWS account can manually upload up to 100 evidence files to a control each day. Exceeding this daily quota causes any additional manual uploads to fail for that control. If you need to upload a large amount of manual evidence to a single control, upload your evidence in batches across several days.
+ When a control is *inactive*, you can't add manual evidence to that control. To add manual evidence, you must first [change the control status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/change-assessment-control-status.html) to either *under review* or *reviewed*.
+ Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to manage an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
<a name="upload-from-computer-procedure"></a>

You can upload a file using the Audit Manager console, the Audit Manager API, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

------
#### [ AWS console ]

**Important**
We strongly recommend that you never upload any sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) as manual evidence. This includes, but is not limited to, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, or any other information that could be used to identify an individual.

**To upload a file from your browser on the Audit Manager console**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Assessments** and then choose an assessment.

1. On the **Controls** tab, scroll down to **Control sets** and then choose a control.

1. From the **Evidence folders** tab, choose **Add manual evidence**.

1. Choose **Upload file from browser**.

1. Choose the file that you want to upload.

1. Choose **Upload**.

#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Important**
We strongly recommend that you never upload any sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) as manual evidence. This includes, but is not limited to, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, or any other information that could be used to identify an individual.

In the following procedure, replace the {{placeholder text}} with your own information.

**To upload a file from your browser in the AWS CLI**

1. Run the `[list-assessments](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-assessments.html)` command to see a list of your assessments.

   ```
   aws auditmanager list-assessments
   ```

   In the response, find the assessment that you want to upload evidence to and take note of the assessment ID.

1. Run the `[get-assessment](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/get-assessment.html)` command and specify the assessment ID from step one.

   ```
   aws auditmanager get-assessment --assessment-id {{1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-0k1l2m3n4o5p}}
   ```

   In the response, find the control set and the control that you want to upload evidence to, and take note of their IDs.

1. Run the `[get-evidence-file-upload-url](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/get-evidence-file-upload-url.html)` command and specify the file that you want to upload.

   ```
   aws auditmanager get-evidence-file-upload-url --file-name {{fileName.extension}}
   ```

   In the response, take note of the presigned URL and the `evidenceFileName`.

1. Use the presigned URL from step three to upload the file from your browser. This action uploads your file to Amazon S3, where it's saved as an object that can be attached to an assessment control. In the following step, you'll reference the newly-created object by using the `evidenceFileName` parameter.
**Note**
When you upload a file using a presigned URL, Audit Manager protects and stores your data by using server side encryption with AWS Key Management Service. To support this, you must use the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header in your request when you use the presigned URL to upload your file.
If you're using a customer managed AWS KMS key in your Audit Manager [Configuring your data encryption settings](settings-KMS.md) settings, make sure that you also include the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header in your request. If the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header isn't present in the request, Amazon S3 assumes that you want to use the AWS managed key.
For more information, see [Protecting data using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*.

1. Run the `[batch-import-evidence-to-assessment-control](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/batch-import-evidence-to-assessment-control.html)` command with the following parameters:
   + `--assessment-id` – Use the assessment ID from step one.
   + `--control-set-id` – Use the control set ID from step two.
   + `--control-id` – Use the control ID from step two.
   + `--manual-evidence` – Use `evidenceFileName` as the manual evidence type and specify the evidence file name from step three.

   ```
   aws auditmanager batch-import-evidence-to-assessment-control --assessment-id {{1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-0k1l2m3n4o5p}} --control-set-id {{ControlSet}} --control-id {{a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6}} --manual-evidence evidenceFileName={{fileName.extension}}
   ```
