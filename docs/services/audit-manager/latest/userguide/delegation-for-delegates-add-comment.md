# Adding comments about a control during a control set review

You can add comments for any controls that you review. These comments are visible to the
audit owner.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to add comments to an
assessment control in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are
[Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

###### To add a comment to a control

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. Choose **Notifications** in the left navigation pane.

3. On the **Notifications** page, review the list of control sets
    that were delegated to you.

4. Find the control set that contains the control that you want to leave a comment
    for, then choose the name of the related assessment to open the assessment.

5. Choose the **Controls** tab, scroll down to the **Control**
**sets** table, and then select the name of a control to open it.

6. Choose the **Comments** tab.

7. Under **Send comments**, enter your comment in the text box.

8. Choose **Submit comment** to add your comment. Your comment then
    appears under the **Previous comments** section of the page, along with
    any other comments regarding this control.

## Next steps

When you've finished reviewing the control, follow the steps in [Marking a control as reviewed in AWS Audit Manager](delegation-for-delegates-changing-control-status.md).
