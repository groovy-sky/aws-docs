# Adding comments about a control during a control set review

You can add comments for any controls that you review. These comments are visible to the audit owner.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to add comments to an assessment control in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
