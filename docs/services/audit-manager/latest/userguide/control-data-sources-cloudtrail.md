AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# AWS CloudTrail event names supported by AWS Audit Manager

You can use Audit Manager to capture AWS CloudTrail [management events](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.md#cloudtrail-concepts-management-events) and [global service events](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.md#cloudtrail-concepts-global-service-events) as evidence for audits. When you create or edit a custom
control, you can specify one or more CloudTrail event names as a data source mapping for evidence
collection. Audit Manager then filters your CloudTrail logs based on your chosen keywords, and imports the
results as user activity evidence.

###### Note

Audit Manager captures management events and global service events only. Data events and insights
events are not available as evidence. For more information about the different types of CloudTrail
events, see [CloudTrail concepts](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.md#cloudtrail-concepts-data-events) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

As an exception to the above, the following CloudTrail events aren't supported by Audit Manager:

- kms\_GenerateDataKey

- kms\_Decrypt

- sts\_AssumeRole

- kinesisvideo\_GetDataEndpoint

- kinesisvideo\_GetSignalingChannelEndpoint

- kinesisvideo\_DescribeSignalingChannel

- kinesisvideo\_DescribeStream

As of May 11, 2023, Audit Manager no longer supports read-only CloudTrail events as keywords for evidence
collection. We removed a total of 3,135 read-only keywords. Because customers and
AWS services both make read calls to APIs, read-only events are noisy. As a result,
read-only keywords collect a lot of evidence that isn't reliable or relevant for audits.
Read-only keywords include `List`, `Describe`, and `Get` API
calls (for example, [GetObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md) and [ListBuckets](../../../s3/latest/api/api-listbuckets.md) for Amazon S3). If you were
using one of these keywords for evidence collection, you don't need to do anything. The
keywords were automatically removed from the Audit Manager console and from your assessments, and
evidence is no longer collected for these keywords.
