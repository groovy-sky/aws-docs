# Delegating a control set for review in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="delegation-for-audit-owners-delegating-a-control-set"></a>

When you need assistance from a subject matter expert, you can choose the AWS account that you want to help you, and then delegate a control set to them for review.

## Delegate permissions

The below policy is attached to a delegate to whom the control set is delegated to.

Audit Manager replaces the {{placeholder text}} with your account and resource identifiers before attaching the policy.

## Prerequisites
<a name="delegation-for-audit-owners-delegating-a-control-set-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to create a delegation in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
<a name="delegation-for-audit-owners-delegating-a-control-set-procedure"></a>

You can use either of the following procedures to delegate a control set.

### Delegating a control set from an assessment page
<a name="from-assessment"></a>

**To delegate a control set from the assessment page**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Assessments**.

1. Select the name of the assessment that contains the control set that you want to delegate.

1. From the assessment page, choose the **Controls** tab. This displays the control status summary and the list of controls in the assessment.

1. Select a control set and choose **Delegate control set**.

1. Under **Delegate selection**, a list of users and roles is displayed. Choose a user or role, or use the search bar to look for one.

1. Under **Delegation details**, review the control set name and the assessment name.

1. (Optional) Under **Comments**, add a comment with instructions to help the delegate fulfill their review task. Don't include any sensitive information in your comment.

1. Choose **Delegate control set**.

1. A green success banner confirms the successful delegation of the control set. Choose **View delegation** to see the delegation request. You can also view your delegations at any time by choosing **Delegations** in the left navigation pane of the AWS Audit Manager console.

### Delegating a control set from the delegations page

**To delegate a control set from the delegations page**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Delegations**.

1. From the delegations page, choose **Create delegation**.

1. Under **Choose assessment and control set**, specify the assessment and the control set that you want to delegate.

1. Under **Delegate selection**, you will see a list of users and roles. Choose a user or role, or use the search bar to look for one.

1. (Optional) Under **Comments**, add a comment with instructions to help the delegate fulfill their review task. Don't include any sensitive information in your comment.

1.  Choose **Create delegation**.

1. A green success banner confirms the successful delegation of the control set. Choose **View delegation** to see the delegation request. You can also view your delegations at any time by choosing **Delegations** in the left navigation pane of the AWS Audit Manager console.

After you delegate a control set for review, the delegate receives a notification and can then begin to review the control set. This process that delegates follow is described in [Understanding the different delegation tasks for delegates](delegation-for-delegates.md).
