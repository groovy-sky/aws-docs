AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

## I followed the Audit Manager setup procedure, but I don't have enough IAM privileges
<a name="insufficient-iam-privileges"></a>

The user, role, or group that you use to access Audit Manager must have the required permissions. Moreover, your identity-based policy shouldn't be too restrictive. Otherwise, the console won't function as intended. This guide provides an example policy that you can use to [Allow the minimum permissions required to enable Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-console). Depending on your use case, you might need broader, less restrictive permissions. For example, we recommend that audit owners have [administrator access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html). This is so that they can modify Audit Manager settings and manage resources such as assessments, frameworks, controls, and assessment reports. Other users, such as delegates, might only need [management access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#management-access) or [read-only](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#read-only) access.

Make sure that you add the appropriate permissions for your user, role, or group. For audit owners, the recommended policy is [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html). For delegates, you can use [the management access example policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#management-access) that's provided on the [IAM policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html) page. You can use these example policies as a starting point, and make changes as necessary to fit your requirements.

We recommend that you take time to customize your permissions to meet your specific requirements. If you need help with IAM permissions, contact your administrator or [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## I specified someone as an audit owner, but they still don’t have full access to the assessment. Why is this?
<a name="audit-owner-missing-access"></a>

Specifying someone as an audit owner alone doesn't provide them with full access to an assessment. Audit owners must also have the necessary IAM permissions to access and manage Audit Manager resources. In other words, in addition to [specifying a user as an audit owner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/create-assessments.html#choose-audit-owners), you must also attach the [necessary IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-personas) to that user. The idea behind this is that, by requiring both, Audit Manager ensures that you have full control over all of the specifics of each assessment.

**Note**
For audit owners, we recommend that you use the [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) policy. For more information, see [Recommended policies for user personas in AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_service-with-iam.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-personas).

## I can't perform an action in Audit Manager
<a name="cannot-perform-action"></a>

If you don't have the necessary permissions to use the AWS Audit Manager console or Audit Manager API operations, you will likely encounter an `AccessDeniedException` error.

To resolve this issue, you must contact your administrator for assistance. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Audit Manager resources
<a name="want-to-allow-access-to-resources"></a>

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant people access to your resources.

To learn more, consult the following:
+ To learn whether Audit Manager supports these features, see [How AWS Audit Manager works with IAM](security_iam_service-with-iam.md).
+ To learn how to provide access to your resources across AWS accounts that you own, see [Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you own](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ To learn how to provide access to your resources to third-party AWS accounts, see [Providing access to AWS accounts owned by third parties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ To learn how to provide access through identity federation, see [Providing access to externally authenticated users (identity federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ To learn the difference between using roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## I see an Access Denied error, despite having the required Audit Manager permissions
<a name="access-denied-due-to-scp"></a>

If your account is a part of an organization, it’s possible that the `Access Denied` error is caused by a [service control policy (SCP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html). SCPs are policies that are used to manage permissions for an organization. When an SCP is in place, it can deny specific permissions to all member accounts, including the delegated administrator account that you use in Audit Manager.

For example, if your organization has an SCP in place that denies permissions for AWS Control Catalog APIs, you can't view the resources that are provided by Control Catalog. This is true even if you otherwise have the required permissions for Audit Manager, such as the [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) policy. The SCP overrides the managed policy permissions by explicitly denying access to the Control Catalog APIs.

Here’s an example of such an SCP. With this SCP in place, your delegated administrator account is denied access to the common controls, control objectives, and control domains that are needed to use the common controls feature in Audit Manager.

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

To resolve this issue, we recommend that you take the following steps:

1. Confirm if an SCP is attached to your organization. For instructions, see [Getting information about your organization's policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_info-operations.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.

1. Identify if the SCP is causing the `Access Denied` error.

1. Update the SCP to ensure that your delegated administrator account has the necessary access for Audit Manager. For instructions, see [Updating an SCP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_create.html#update_policy) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.
