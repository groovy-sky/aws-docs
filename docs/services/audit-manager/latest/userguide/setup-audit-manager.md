AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Enabling AWS Audit Manager

Now that you have completed the prerequisites for setting up Audit Manager, you can enable the
service in your AWS environment.

On this page you'll learn how to enable Audit Manager using the Audit Manager console, the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI), or the Audit Manager API. Choose the method that best suits your needs, and follow the
corresponding steps to get Audit Manager up and running.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you completed all of the tasks that are described in [Prerequisites for setting up AWS Audit Manager](setup-prerequisites.md).

## Procedure

You can enable Audit Manager using the AWS Management Console, the Audit Manager API, or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

Audit Manager console

###### To enable Audit Manager using the console

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. Use the credentials of your IAM identity to sign in.

3. Choose **Set up AWS Audit Manager**.

4. Under **Permissions**, no action is required. This is
    because Audit Manager uses a [service-linked role](security-iam-awsmanpol.md#security-iam-awsmanpol-AWSAuditManagerServiceRolePolicy) to connect to data sources on your
    behalf. You can review the service-linked role by choosing
    **View IAM service-linked role permission**.

5. Under **Data encryption**, the default option is for
    Audit Manager to create and manage an AWS KMS key for securely storing your
    data.

If you want to use your own customer managed key to encrypt data in Audit Manager, select
    the check box next to **Customize encryption settings**
**(advanced)**. You can then choose an existing KMS key or
    [create a new\
    one](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.md).

6. (Optional) Under **Delegated administrator -**
**optional**, you can specify a delegated administrator
    account if you want Audit Manager to run assessments for multiple accounts.
    For more information and recommendations, see [Enable and set up AWS Organizations](setup-recommendations.md#enabling-orgs).

7. (Optional) Under **AWS Config –**
**optional**, we recommend that you enable AWS Config for an
    optimal experience. This enables Audit Manager to generate evidence using
    AWS Config rules. For instructions and recommended settings, see [Enable and set up AWS Config](setup-recommendations.md#config-recommendations).

8. (Optional) Under **Security Hub CSPM – optional**, we recommend
    that you enable Security Hub CSPM for an optimal experience. This enables Audit Manager to
    generate evidence using Security Hub CSPM checks. For instructions and recommended
    settings, see [Enable and set up AWS Security Hub CSPM](setup-recommendations.md#securityhub-recommendations).

![Screenshot of the Security Hub CSPM section of the Audit Manager setup options.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/audit-manager/latest/userguide/images/setup-securityhub-console.png)

9. Choose **Complete setup** to finish the setup
    process.

AWS CLI

###### To enable Audit Manager using the AWS CLI

In the command line, run the [register-account](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/register-account.html) command using the following setup
parameters:

- `--kms-key` (optional) – Use this parameter
to encrypt your Audit Manager data using your own customer managed key. If you
don't specify an option here, Audit Manager creates and manages an
AWS KMS key on your behalf for the secure storage of your
data.

- `--delegated-admin-account` (optional) – Use
this parameter to designate your organization’s delegated
administrator account for Audit Manager. If you don't specify an option
here, no delegated administrator is registered.

Input example (replace the `placeholder text`
with your own information):

```json

aws auditmanager register-account \
--kms-key arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
--delegated-admin-account 111122224444
```

Output example:

```json

{
    "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

For more information about the AWS CLI and for instructions on installing the
AWS CLI tools, see the following in the _AWS Command Line Interface User_
_Guide_.

Command Line Interface User Guide](../../../cli/latest/userguide.md)

- [Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.md)

Audit Manager API

###### To enable Audit Manager using the Audit Manager API

Use the [RegisterAccount](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-registeraccount.md) operation with the following setup
parameters:

- [kmsKey](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-registeraccount.md#auditmanager-RegisterAccount-request-kmsKey) (optional) – Use this parameter to
encrypt your Audit Manager data using your own customer managed key. If you don't
specify an option here, Audit Manager creates and manages an AWS KMS key
on your behalf for the secure storage of your data.

- [delegatedAdminAccount](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-registeraccount.md#auditmanager-RegisterAccount-request-delegatedAdminAccount) (optional) – Use this
parameter to specify your organization’s delegated administrator
account for Audit Manager. If you don't specify one, no delegated
administrator is registered.

Input example (replace the `placeholder text`
with your own information):

```json

{
    "kmsKey":"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
    "delegatedAdminAccount":"111122224444"
}
```

Output example:

```json

{
  "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

After you enable Audit Manager, we recommend that you set up some recommended features and
integrations for an optimal experience. For more information, see
