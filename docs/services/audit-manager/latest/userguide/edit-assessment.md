# Editing an assessment in AWS Audit Manager

You might encounter situations where you need to edit your existing assessments in AWS Audit Manager.
Perhaps the scope of your audit has changed, requiring updates to the AWS accounts included in
the assessment. Or, you might need to revise the list of audit owners assigned to the assessment
due to personnel changes. In such cases, you can edit your active assessments and make necessary
adjustments without disrupting your evidence collection.

The following page outlines the steps to edit your assessment details, change the
AWS accounts in scope, update the audit owners, and review and save your changes.

## Prerequisites

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created at least one assessment,
and it is in an active state.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to edit an assessment in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Next steps

When you no longer need to collect evidence for a specific assessment control, you can
change the status of that control. For instructions, see [Changing the status of an assessment control in AWS Audit Manager](change-assessment-control-status.md).

When you no longer need to collect evidence for the entire assessment, you can change the
assessment status to inactive. For instructions, see [Changing the status of an assessment to inactive in AWS Audit Manager](change-assessment-status-to-inactive.md).
