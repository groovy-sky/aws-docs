# Editing an assessment in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="edit-assessment"></a>

You might encounter situations where you need to edit your existing assessments in AWS Audit Manager. Perhaps the scope of your audit has changed, requiring updates to the AWS accounts included in the assessment. Or, you might need to revise the list of audit owners assigned to the assessment due to personnel changes. In such cases, you can edit your active assessments and make necessary adjustments without disrupting your evidence collection.

The following page outlines the steps to edit your assessment details, change the AWS accounts in scope, update the audit owners, and review and save your changes.

## Prerequisites
<a name="edit-assessment-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created at least one assessment, and it is in an active state.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to edit an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).
