## Prerequisites
<a name="review-assessments-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created at least one assessment. If you haven’t created an assessment yet, you won’t see any results when you follow these steps.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

| 6. Date created | The date when the assessment was created. |
| 7. Last updated | The date when the assessment was last edited. |
| 8. Status | The status of the assessment. +  **Active** - The assessment is currently collecting evidence.  <br />+  **Inactive** - The assessment is no longer collecting evidence.   |

### Controls tab
<a name="review-assessment-controls"></a>

You can use this tab to see information about the controls in the assessment.

Under **Control status summary**, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Total controls** | The total number of controls in this assessment. |
| **Reviewed** | The number of controls that were reviewed by an audit owner or a delegate. |
| Under review | The number of controls that are currently under review.  |
| Inactive | The number of controls that are no longer actively collecting evidence |

In the **Control sets** table, you can review a list of controls grouped by control set. You can expand or collapse the controls in each control set. You can also search by name if you're looking for a specific control.

In this table, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Controls grouped by control sets** | The name of the control set. |
| **Control status** | The status of the control. +  **Under review** indicates that this control isn't already reviewed. Evidence is still being collected for this control, and you can add manual evidence. This is the default status. <br />+  **Reviewed** indicates that the evidence for this control was reviewed. Evidence is still being collected, and you can add manual evidence.  <br />+  **Inactive** indicates that automated evidence collection is stopped for this control. You can no longer add manual evidence.   |
| Delegated to | The reviewer of this control, if it was assigned to a delegate for review. |
| Total evidence | The number of evidence items that have been collected for this control. |

### Assessment report selection tab
<a name="review-assessment-evidence"></a>

You can use this tab to see the evidence that will be included in the assessment report. The evidence is grouped by evidence folders, which are organized based on the date when they were created.

You can browse these folders and select which evidence you want to include in your assessment report. For instructions on how to add evidence to an assessment report, see [Adding evidence to an assessment report](generate-assessment-report-include-evidence.md).

In this section, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Evidence folder** | The name of the evidence folder. The folder name is based on the date when the evidence was collected. |
| **Selected evidence** | The number of evidence items within the folder that are included in the assessment report. |
| Control name | The name of the control that's associated with this evidence folder.  |

### AWS accounts tab
<a name="review-assessment-accounts"></a>

You can use this tab to see the AWS accounts that are in the scope of the assessment.

In this section, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Account ID** | The ID of the AWS account. |
| **Account name** | The name of the AWS account. |
| Email | The email address that's associated with the AWS account.  |

### AWS services tab
<a name="review-assessment-services"></a>

You might or might not see this tab in your assessment.

#### If the AWS services tab isn't displayed (ideal state)
<a name="aws-services-are-not-visible"></a>

If you don't see this tab, Audit Manager is managing which AWS services are in scope for your assessment.

Audit Manager infers this scope by examining your assessment controls and their data sources, and then mapping this information to the corresponding AWS services. Whenever an underlying data source changes for your assessment, Audit Manager automatically updates the scope as needed to reflect the correct AWS services. This ensures that your assessment collects accurate and comprehensive evidence about all of the relevant services in your AWS environment.

#### If the AWS services tab is displayed
<a name="aws-services-are-visible"></a>

If this you do see this tab, Audit Manager is not managing which AWS services are in scope for your assessment.

In this case, you see the following information about the services in scope that you defined:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **AWS service** | The name of the AWS service. |
| **Category** | The service category, such as compute or database. |
| Description | The description of the AWS service. |

Audit Manager performs resource assessments for the services in this table. For example, if Amazon S3 is listed, Audit Manager can collect evidence about your S3 buckets. The exact evidence that's collected is determined by a control's [](concepts.md#control-data-source). For instance, if the data source type is AWS Config, and the data source mapping is an AWS Config rule (such as `s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited`), Audit Manager collects the result of that rule evaluation as evidence. For more information, see [What's the difference between a service in scope and a data source type?](evidence-collection-issues.md#data-source-vs-service-in-scope) in this guide.

If your assessment was created in the console from a standard framework, Audit Manager selected the services for you and mapped their data sources according to the framework's requirements. If the standard framework contains only manual controls, no AWS services are in scope.

**Note**
The next time that you edit your assessment or change one of the custom controls in your assessment, Audit Manager takes over the management of services in scope for you. When this happens, the **AWS services** tab is removed from your assessment.

### Audit owners tab
<a name="review-assessment-audit-owners"></a>

You can use this tab to see the audit owners for the assessment.

In this section, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Audit owner** | The name of the audit owner. |
| **AWS account** | The AWS account ID of the audit owner. |

### Tags tab
<a name="review-assessment-tags"></a>

You can use this tab to see the tags for your assessment. These tags are inherited from the framework that was used to create the assessment. For more information about tags in Audit Manager, see [Tagging AWS Audit Manager resources](tagging.md).

In this section, you can review the following information:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | The key of the tag, such as a compliance standard, regulation, or category. |
| **Value** | The value of the tag. |

### Changelog tab
<a name="review-assessment-changelog"></a>

You can use this tab to see the user activity for the assessment.

In this section, you can review the following information:
