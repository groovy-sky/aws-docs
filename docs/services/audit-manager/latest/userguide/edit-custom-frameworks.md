# Editing a custom framework in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="edit-custom-frameworks"></a>

You might need to modify your custom frameworks in AWS Audit Manager as your compliance requirements change.

This page outlines the steps to edit a custom framework's details and control sets.

## Prerequisites
<a name="edit-custom-frameworks-existing-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created a custom framework.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to edit a custom framework in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

+ [Step 2: Edit control sets](#edit-step2)
+ [Step 3. Review and save](#edit-step3)

### Step 1: Edit framework details
<a name="edit-step1"></a>

Start by reviewing and editing the existing framework details.

**To edit framework details**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Framework library** and then choose the **Custom frameworks** tab.

1. Select the framework that you want to edit, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Edit**.
   + Alternatively, open a custom framework and choose **Edit** at the top right of the framework details page.

1. Under **Framework details**, review the name, compliance type, and description for your framework, and make any necessary changes.

1. Choose **Next**.

**Tip**
To edit the tags for a framework, open the framework and choose the [framework tags tab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/review-frameworks.html). There you can view and edit the tags that are associated with the framework.

### Step 2: Edit control sets
<a name="edit-step2"></a>

Next, review and edit the controls and control sets in the framework.

**Note**
When you use the AWS Audit Manager console to edit a custom framework, you can add up to 10 control sets for each framework.
When you use the Audit Manager API to edit a custom framework, you can add more than 10 control sets. To add more control sets than the console currently allows, use the [UpdateAssessmentFramework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssessmentFramework.html) API that Audit Manager provides.

**To edit a control set**

1. Under **Control set name**, review and edit the name for your control set as needed.

1. Under **Add controls**, use the **Control type** dropdown list to select one of the two control types: **Standard controls** or **Custom controls**.

1. Based on the option you selected in the previous step, a table list of standard controls or custom controls is displayed. Select one or more controls and choose **Add to control set**.

1. In the pop-up window that appears, choose **Add**.

1. Review and edit the controls that appear in the **Selected controls** list.
   + To add more controls, repeat steps 2–4.
   + To remove unwanted controls, select one or more controls and choose **Remove from control set**.

1. To add a new control set to the framework, choose **Add control set**.

1. To remove an unwanted control set, choose **Remove control set**.

1. After you finish adding control sets and controls, choose **Next**.

### Step 3. Review and save
<a name="edit-step3"></a>

Review the information for your framework. To change the information for a step, choose **Edit**.

When you're finished, choose **Save changes**.

## Next steps

When you're certain that you no longer need a custom framework, you can clean up your Audit Manager environment by deleting the framework. For instructions, see [Deleting a custom framework in AWS Audit Manager](delete-custom-framework.md).
