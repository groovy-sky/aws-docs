# Tagging AWS Audit Manager resources
<a name="tagging"></a>

A *tag* is a metadata label that you assign or that AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a *key* and a *value*. For tags that you assign, you define the key and value. For example, you might define the key as `stage` and the value for one resource as `test`.

Tags help you do the following:
+ Easily locate your Audit Manager resources. You can use tags as search criteria when browsing the framework library and the control library.
+ Associate your resource with a compliance type. You can tag multiple resources with a compliance-specific tag to associate those resources with a specific framework.
+ Identify and organize your AWS resources. Many AWS services support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the resources are related.
+  Track your AWS costs. You activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard. AWS uses the tags to categorize your costs and deliver a monthly cost allocation report to you. For more information, see [Use cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*.
