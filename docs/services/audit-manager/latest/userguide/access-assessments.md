AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Finding your assessments in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="access-assessments"></a>

After you create assessments in AWS Audit Manager, you can find them on the assessments page of the Audit Manager console.

From this page, you can perform various actions on your assessments. For example, you can view assessment details, edit assessment configurations, or delete assessments that are no longer required. Additionally, the assessments page serves as a starting point for creating new assessments.

You can also view your assessments programmatically using the Audit Manager API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

## Prerequisites
<a name="access-assessments-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created at least one assessment. If you haven’t created an assessment yet, you won’t see any results when you follow these steps.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).
