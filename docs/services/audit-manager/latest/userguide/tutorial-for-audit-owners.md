AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Tutorial for Audit Owners: Creating an assessment
<a name="tutorial-for-audit-owners"></a>

This tutorial provides an introduction to AWS Audit Manager. In this tutorial, you create an assessment using the [AWS Audit Manager Sample Framework](Sample.md). By creating an assessment, you start the ongoing process of automated evidence collection for the controls in that framework.

**Note**
AWS Audit Manager assists in collecting evidence that's relevant for verifying compliance with specific compliance frameworks and regulations. However, it doesn't assess your compliance itself. The evidence that's collected through AWS Audit Manager therefore might not include all the information about your AWS usage that's needed for audits. AWS Audit Manager isn't a substitute for legal counsel or compliance experts.

## Prerequisites
<a name="tutorial-for-audit-owners-prerequisites"></a>

**Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you meet the following conditions:**
+ You completed all the prerequisites that are described in [Setting up AWS Audit Manager with the recommended settings](setting-up.md). You must use your AWS account and the AWS Audit Manager console to complete this tutorial.
+ Your IAM identity is granted with the appropriate permissions to create and manage an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).
+ You're familiar with Audit Manager terminology and functionality. For a general overview, see [What is AWS Audit Manager?](what-is.md) and [Understanding AWS Audit Manager concepts and terminology](concepts.md).

## Procedure

**Topics**
+ [Step 1: Specify assessment details](#select-framework)
+ [Step 2: Specify AWS accounts in scope](#specifyaccounts)
+ [Step 3: Specify audit owners](#chooseauditowners)
+ [Step 4: Review and create](#reviewcreate)

### Step 1: Specify assessment details
<a name="select-framework"></a>

For the first step, select a framework and provide basic information for your assessment.

**To specify assessment details**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. Choose **Launch AWS Audit Manager**.

1. In the green banner at the top of the screen, choose **Start with a framework**.

1. Choose the framework that you want, and then choose **Create assessment from framework**. For this tutorial, use the **AWS Audit Manager Sample Framework**.

1. Under **Assessment name**, enter a name for your assessment.

1. (Optional) Under **Assessment description**, enter a description for your assessment.

1. Under **Assessment reports destination**, choose the S3 bucket where you want to save your assessment reports.

1. Under **Frameworks**, confirm that **AWS Audit Manager Sample Framework** is selected.

1. (Optional) Under **Tags**, choose **Add new tag** to associate a tag with your assessment. You can specify a key and a value for each tag. The tag key is mandatory and can be used as a search criteria when you search for this assessment.

1. Choose **Next**.

### Step 2: Specify AWS accounts in scope
<a name="specifyaccounts"></a>

Next, specify the AWS accounts that you want to include in the scope of your assessment.

AWS Audit Manager integrates with AWS Organizations, so you can run an Audit Manager assessment across multiple accounts and consolidate evidence into a delegated administrator account. To enable Organizations in Audit Manager (if you didn't do so already), see [Enable and set up AWS Organizations](setup-recommendations.md#enabling-orgs) on the *Setting up* page of this guide.

**Note**
Audit Manager can support up to 200 accounts in the scope of an assessment. If you try to include over 200 accounts, the assessment creation will fail.
Additionally, if you try to add over 250 unique accounts across all of your assessments, the assessment creation will fail.

**To specify accounts in scope**

1.  Under **AWS accounts**, select the AWS accounts that you want to include in the scope of your assessment.
   + If you enabled Organizations in Audit Manager, multiple accounts are listed.
   + If you didn't enable Organizations in Audit Manager, only your current account is listed.

1. Choose **Next**.

### Step 3: Specify audit owners
<a name="chooseauditowners"></a>

In this step, you specify the audit owners for your assessment. Audit owners are the individuals in your workplace—usually from GRC, SecOps, or DevOps teams—who are responsible for managing the Audit Manager assessment. We recommend that they use the [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) policy.

**To specify audit owners**

1. Under **Audit owners**, choose the audit owners for your assessment. To find additional audit owners, use the search bar to search by name or AWS account.

1. Choose **Next**.

### Step 4: Review and create
<a name="reviewcreate"></a>

Review the information for your assessment. To change the information for a step, choose **Edit**. When you're finished, choose **Create assessment** to start the ongoing collection of evidence.

After you create an assessment, evidence collection continues until you [change the assessment status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/change-assessment-status-to-inactive.html) to *inactive*. Alternatively, you can stop evidence collection for a specific control by [changing the control status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/change-assessment-control-status.html) to *inactive*.

**Note**
Automated evidence is available 24 hours after you create the assessment. Audit Manager automatically collects evidence from multiple data sources, and the frequency of that evidence collection is based on the evidence type. For more information, see [Evidence collection frequency](how-evidence-is-collected.md#frequency) in this guide.
