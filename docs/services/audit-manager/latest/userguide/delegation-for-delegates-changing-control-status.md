AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Marking a control as reviewed in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="delegation-for-delegates-changing-control-status"></a>

You can indicate your review progress by updating the status of individual controls within a control set.

Changing the control status is optional. However, we recommend that you change the status of each control to **Reviewed** as you complete your review for that control. Regardless of the status of each individual control, you can still submit the controls back to the audit owner.

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to update an assessment control status in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [Allow users full administrator access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#example-2) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
