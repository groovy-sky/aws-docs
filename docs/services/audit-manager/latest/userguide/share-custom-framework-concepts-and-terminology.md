AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# Framework sharing concepts and terminology

If you learn about the following key concepts, you can get more out of the AWS Audit Manager
custom framework sharing feature.

## Key points

**Sender**

This is the creator of a share request and the AWS account where the custom
framework exists. Senders can share custom frameworks with any AWS account. Or, they
replicate a custom framework to any supported AWS Region under their own account.

**Recipient**

This is the consumer of the shared framework. Recipients can either accept or
decline a share request from a sender.

###### Note

A recipient can be a delegated administrator account. However, you can't share
custom frameworks with an AWS Organizations management account.

**Framework eligibility**

You can only share custom frameworks. By default, standard frameworks are already
present in all AWS accounts and AWS Regions where AWS Audit Manager is enabled. In
addition, the custom frameworks that you share must not contain sensitive data. This
includes data found within the framework itself, its control sets, and any of the
custom controls that are part of the custom framework.

###### Important

Some of the standard frameworks that are offered by AWS Audit Manager contain copyrighted
material that’s subject to license agreements. Custom frameworks might contain
content that’s derived from these frameworks. You may not share a custom framework
that's derived from a standard framework if the standard framework is designated as
not eligible for sharing by AWS, unless you have obtained permission to do so from
the owner of the standard framework.

To learn which standard frameworks are eligible for sharing, refer to the
following table.

**Share request**

To share a custom framework, you create a _share_
_request_. The share request specifies a recipient and notifies them that a
custom framework is available. Recipients have 120 days to respond to a share request
by accepting or declining. If no action is taken in 120 days, the share request
expires and the recipient loses the ability to add the custom framework to their
framework library. Senders and recipients can view and take action on share requests
from the share requests page of the framework library.

**Share request status**

Share requests can have any of the following statuses.

StatusDescription

**Active**

This indicates a share request that was successfully sent to the
recipient and is waiting for their response.

**Expiring**

This indicates a share request that expires within the next 30
days.

**Shared**

This indicates a share request that the recipient accepted.

**Inactive**

This indicates a share request that was revoked, declined, or expired
before the recipient took action.

**Replicating**

This indicates an accepted share request that's being replicated to the
recipient's framework library.

**Failed**

This indicates a share request that wasn't successfully sent to the
recipient.

**Share request notifications**

Audit Manager notifies recipients when they receive a share request. Both recipients and
senders receive a notification when a share request is due to expire sometime in the
next 30 days.

- For recipients, a blue notification dot appears next to received
requests with an **Active** or **Expiring**
status. The recipient can resolve the notification by accepting or declining the
share request.

- For senders, a blue notification dot appears next to sent requests with
an **Expiring** status. The notification is resolved when the
recipient accepts or declines the request. Otherwise, it's resolved when the
request expires. Additionally, the sender can resolve the notification by revoking
the share request.

**Sender ownership**

Senders maintain full access over the custom frameworks that they share. They can cancel
active share requests at any time by [revoking the share request](framework-sharing.md#framework-sharing-step-4) before it expires. However, after a recipient
accepts a share request, the sender can no longer revoke the recipient’s access to
that custom framework. This is because when the recipient accepts the request, Audit Manager
creates an independent copy of the custom framework in the recipient’s framework
library.

In addition to replicating the sender’s custom framework, Audit Manager also replicates any
custom control sets and custom controls that are part of that framework. However, Audit Manager
doesn’t replicate any tags that are attached to the custom framework.

**Recipient ownership**

Recipients have full access over the custom frameworks that they accept. When recipient
accepts the request, Audit Manager replicates the custom framework to the custom frameworks tab
of their framework library. Recipients can then manage the shared custom framework in
the same way as any other custom framework. Recipients can share the custom frameworks
that they receive from other senders. Recipients can’t block senders from sending
share requests.

**Shared framework expiration**

When a sender creates a share request, Audit Manager sets the request to expire after 120 days.
Recipients can accept and gain access to the shared framework before the request
expires. If a recipient doesn’t accept during this time, the share request expires.
After this point, a record of the expired share request remains in their history.
Snapshots of expired shared frameworks are archived to an S3 bucket with a one-year
TTL for audit purposes.

Senders can choose to [revoke a share request](framework-sharing.md#framework-sharing-step-4) at any time before it’s due to expire.

**Shared**
**framework data storage and backup**

When you create a share request, Audit Manager stores a snapshot of your custom framework
in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region. Audit Manager also stores a backup of the same snapshot
in the US West (Oregon) AWS Region.

Audit Manager deletes the snapshot and the backup snapshot when one of the following events
occurs:

- The sender revokes the share request.

- The recipient declines the share request.

- The recipient encounters an error and doesn't successfully accept the share
request.

- The share request expires before the recipient responds to the request.

When a sender [resends a share request](framework-sharing.md#framework-sharing-resend), the snapshot is replaced with an updated version
that corresponds with the latest version of the custom framework.

When a recipient accepts a share request, the snapshot is replicated into their
AWS account under the AWS Region that was specified in the share request.

**Shared framework versioning**

When you share a custom framework, Audit Manager creates an independent copy of that
framework in the specified AWS account and Region. This means that you should keep
in mind the following points:

- The shared framework that a recipient accepts is a snapshot of the framework
at the time of the share request creation. If you update the original custom
framework after sending a share request, the request isn't automatically updated.
To share the latest version of the updated framework, you can [resend the share request](framework-sharing.md#framework-sharing-resend). The expiration date of this new snapshot is
120 days from the re-share date.

- When you share a custom framework with another AWS account and then delete it from your
framework library, the shared custom framework remains in the recipient's
framework library.

- When you share a custom framework to another AWS Region under your account and then delete
that custom framework in the first AWS Region, the custom framework remains in
the second Region.

- When you delete a shared custom framework after accepting it, any custom controls that were
replicated as part of the custom framework remain in your control library.
