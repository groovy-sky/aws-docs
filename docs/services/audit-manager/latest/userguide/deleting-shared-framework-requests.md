AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Deleting share requests in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="deleting-shared-framework-requests"></a>

When you no longer need a share request, you can delete it from your Audit Manager environment. This enables you to clean up your workspace and focus on the requests that are relevant to your current tasks and priorities.

When you delete a share request, only the request itself is deleted. The shared framework itself remains in your framework library.

## Prerequisites

The following procedure assumes that you have previously sent or received a share request. You can't delete share requests that have a status of *active* or *replicating*.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to delete a share request in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
