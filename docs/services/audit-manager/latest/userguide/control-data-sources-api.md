AWS Audit Manager will no longer be open to new customers starting
April 30, 2026. If you would like to use Audit Manager, sign up prior to that date. Existing customers
can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see
[AWS Audit Manager availability change](audit-manager-availability-change.md).

# AWS API calls supported by AWS Audit Manager

You can use Audit Manager to capture snapshots of your AWS environment as evidence for audits.
When you create or edit a custom control, you can specify one or more AWS API calls as a
data source mapping for evidence collection. Audit Manager then makes API calls to the relevant
AWS services, and collects a snapshot of the configuration details for your AWS resources.

For every resource that's in the scope of an API call, Audit Manager captures a configuration
snapshot and converts it into evidence. This results in one piece of evidence per resource, as
opposed to one piece of evidence per API call.

For example, if the `ec2_DescribeRouteTables` API call captures configuration
snapshots from five route tables, then you'll get five pieces of evidence in total for the
single API call. Each piece of evidence is a snapshot of the configuration of an individual
route table.

## Key points

### Paginated API calls

Many AWS services collect and store a large amount of data. As a result, when a
`list`, `describe`, or `get` API call attempts to
return your data, there can be a lot of results. If the amount of data is too large to
return in a single response, the results can be broken into more manageable pieces through
the use of _pagination_. This divides the results into
"pages" of data, making the responses easier to handle.

Some of the [Supported API calls for custom control data sources](#apis-for-custom-control-data-sources) are paginated. This means that
they return partial results at first, and require subsequent requests to return the entire
result set. For example, the Amazon RDS [DescribeDBInstances](../../../../reference/amazonrds/latest/apireference/api-describedbinstances.md) operation returns up to 100 instances at a time, and
subsequent requests are needed to return the next page of results.

As of March 08, 2023, Audit Manager supports paginated API calls as a data source for evidence
collection. Previously, if a paginated API call was used as a data source, only a subset
of your resources was returned in the API response (up to 100 results). Now, Audit Manager calls
the paginated API operation multiple times, and gets each page of results until all
resources are returned. For each resource, Audit Manager then captures a configuration snapshot and
saves it as evidence. Because your complete set of resources is now captured in the API
response, it’s likely that you’ll notice an increase in the amount of evidence that’s
collected after March 08, 2023.

Audit Manager handles API call pagination for you automatically. If you create a custom control
that uses a paginated API call as a data source, you don’t need to specify any pagination
parameters.

## Supported API calls for custom control data sources

In your custom controls, you can use any of the following API calls as a data source.
Audit Manager can then use these API calls to collect evidence about your AWS usage.

## API calls used in the AWS License Manager standard framework

In the [AWS License Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/Licensemanager.html) standard
framework, Audit Manager uses a custom activity called `GetLicenseManagerSummary` to
collect evidence. This activity calls the following three License Manager APIs:

- [ListLicenseConfigurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListLicenseConfigurations.html)

- [ListAssociationsForLicenseConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListAssociationsForLicenseConfiguration.html)

- [ListUsageForLicenseConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsageForLicenseConfiguration.html)

The data that’s returned is then converted into evidence and attached to the relevant
controls in your assessment.

###### Example

Let's say that you use two licensed products ( _SQL Service_
_2017_ and _Oracle Database Enterprise_
_Edition_). First, the `GetLicenseManagerSummary` activity calls the
[ListLicenseConfigurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListLicenseConfigurations.html) API, which provides details of license configurations
in your account. Next, it adds additional contextual data for each license configuration
by calling [ListUsageForLicenseConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListUsageForLicenseConfiguration.html) and [ListAssociationsForLicenseConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListAssociationsForLicenseConfiguration.html). Finally, it converts the license
configuration data into evidence and attaches it to the respective controls in the
framework ( _4.5 - Customer managed license for SQL Server_
_2017_ and _3.0.4 - Customer managed license for Oracle_
_Database Enterprise Edition_).

If you’re using a licensed product that isn’t covered by any of the controls in the
framework, that license configuration data is attached as evidence to the following control:
_5.0 - Customer managed license for other_
_licenses_.
