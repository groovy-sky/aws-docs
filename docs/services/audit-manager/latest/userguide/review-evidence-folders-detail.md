# Reviewing an evidence folder in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="review-evidence-folders-detail"></a>

As your assessment collects evidence, Audit Manager organizes it into folders for your convenience. When you need to review an evidence folder, you'll find the information organized into several sections.

**Contents**

+ [Procedure](#review-evidence-folders-detail-procedure)
  + [Evidence folder summary](#review-evidence-folders-summary-summary)

+ [Next steps](#review-evidence-folders-detail-next-steps)
+ [Additional resources](#review-evidence-folders-detail-additional-resources)

## Prerequisites
<a name="review-evidence-folders-detail-prerequisites"></a>

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created at least one assessment. If you haven’t created an assessment yet, you won’t see any results when you follow these steps.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view an assessment in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

Keep in mind that it takes up to 24 hours for an assessment to start collecting automated evidence. If your assessment has no evidence yet, you won’t see any results when you follow these steps.

## Procedure
