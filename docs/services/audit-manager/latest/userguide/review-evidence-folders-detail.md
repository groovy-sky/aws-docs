# Reviewing an evidence folder in AWS Audit Manager

As your assessment collects evidence, Audit Manager organizes it into folders for your convenience.
When you need to review an evidence folder, you'll find the information organized into several
sections.

## Prerequisites

The following procedure assumes that you have previously created at least one assessment.
If you haven’t created an assessment yet, you won’t see any results when you follow these
steps.

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view an assessment in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

Keep in mind that it takes up to 24 hours for an assessment to start collecting automated
evidence. If your assessment has no evidence yet, you won’t see any results when you follow
these steps.

## Procedure

###### To open and review an evidence folder

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Assessments**, and then choose an
    assessment.
