AWS Audit Manager is no longer open to new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the service as normal. For more information, see [AWS Audit Manager availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/audit-manager-availability-change.html).

# Finding the available frameworks in AWS Audit Manager
<a name="access-frameworks"></a>

You can find all available frameworks on the **Framework library** page in the Audit Manager console.

You can also view all available frameworks using the Audit Manager API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

## Prerequisites
<a name="access-frameworks-prerequisites"></a>

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view frameworks in AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess.html) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure
<a name="access-frameworks-procedure"></a>

------
#### [ Audit Manager console ]

**To view available frameworks on the Audit Manager console**

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Framework library**.

1. Choose the **Standard frameworks** tab or the **Custom frameworks** tab to browse the available standard and custom frameworks.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To view available frameworks in the AWS CLI**
To view frameworks in Audit Manager, use the [list-assessment-frameworks](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-assessment-frameworks.html) command and specify a `--framework-type`. Either, you can retrieve a list of standard frameworks. Or, you can retrieve a list of custom frameworks.

```
aws auditmanager list-assessment-frameworks --framework-type Standard
```

```
aws auditmanager list-assessment-frameworks --framework-type Custom
```

------
#### [ Audit Manager API ]

**To view available frameworks using the API**
Use the [ListAssessmentFrameworks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListAssessmentFrameworks.html) operation and specify a [frameworkType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListAssessmentFrameworks.html#auditmanager-ListAssessmentFrameworks-request-frameworkType). Either, you can return a list of standard frameworks. Or, you can return a list of custom frameworks.

For more information, choose either of the previous links to read more in the *AWS Audit Manager API Reference*. This includes information about how to use the `ListAssessmentFrameworks` operation and parameters in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs.
