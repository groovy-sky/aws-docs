# Finding the available frameworks in AWS Audit Manager

You can find all available frameworks on the **Framework library** page
in the Audit Manager console.

You can also view all available frameworks using the Audit Manager API or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

## Prerequisites

Make sure your IAM identity has appropriate permissions to view frameworks in
AWS Audit Manager. Two suggested policies that grant these permissions are [AWSAuditManagerAdministratorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/awsauditmanageradministratoraccess.md) and [Allow users management access to AWS Audit Manager](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#management-access).

## Procedure

Audit Manager console

###### To view available frameworks on the Audit Manager console

1. Open the AWS Audit Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/auditmanager/home).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Framework library**.

3. Choose the **Standard frameworks** tab or the **Custom**
**frameworks** tab to browse the available standard and custom frameworks.

AWS CLI

###### To view available frameworks in the AWS CLI

To view frameworks in Audit Manager, use the [list-assessment-frameworks](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/auditmanager/list-assessment-frameworks.html) command and specify a
`--framework-type`. Either, you can retrieve a list of standard frameworks.
Or, you can retrieve a list of custom frameworks.

```

aws auditmanager list-assessment-frameworks --framework-type Standard
```

```

aws auditmanager list-assessment-frameworks --framework-type Custom
```

Audit Manager API

###### To view available frameworks using the API

Use the [ListAssessmentFrameworks](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-listassessmentframeworks.md) operation and specify a [frameworkType](../../../../reference/audit-manager/latest/apireference/api-listassessmentframeworks.md#auditmanager-ListAssessmentFrameworks-request-frameworkType). Either, you can return a list of standard frameworks. Or,
you can return a list of custom frameworks.

For more information, choose either of the previous links to read more in the
_AWS Audit Manager API Reference_. This includes
information about how to use the `ListAssessmentFrameworks` operation and
parameters in one of the language-specific AWS SDKs.

## Next steps

When you're ready to explore the details of a framework, follow the steps in [Reviewing a framework in AWS Audit Manager](review-frameworks.md). This page will guide you
through the framework details and explain the information that you see there.

From the framework library page, you can also [create](custom-frameworks.md), [edit](edit-custom-frameworks.md), [delete](delete-custom-framework.md), or
[share](share-custom-framework.md) a
custom framework.
