# Partitions and data distribution in DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB stores data in partitions. A _partition_ is an allocation
of storage for a table, backed by solid state drives (SSDs) and automatically replicated
across multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region. Partition management is
handled entirely by DynamoDB—you never have to manage partitions yourself.

When you create a table, the initial status of the table is `CREATING`.
During this phase, DynamoDB allocates sufficient partitions to the table so that it can
handle your provisioned throughput requirements. You can begin writing and reading table
data after the table status changes to `ACTIVE`.

DynamoDB allocates additional partitions to a table in the following situations:

- If you increase the table's provisioned throughput settings beyond what the
existing partitions can support.

- If an existing partition fills to capacity and more storage space is
required.

Partition management occurs automatically in the background and is transparent to your
applications. Your table remains available throughout and fully supports your
provisioned throughput requirements.

For more details, see [Partition key design](bp-partition-key-design.md).

Global secondary indexes in DynamoDB are also composed of partitions. The data in a
global secondary index is stored separately from the data in its base table, but index
partitions behave in much the same way as table partitions.

## Data distribution: Partition key

If your table has a simple primary key (partition key only), DynamoDB stores and
retrieves each item based on its partition key value.

To write an item to the table, DynamoDB uses the value of the partition key as input
to an internal hash function. The output value from the hash function determines the
partition in which the item will be stored.

To read an item from the table, you must specify the partition key value for the
item. DynamoDB uses this value as input to its hash function, yielding the partition in
which the item can be found.

The following diagram shows a table named _Pets_, which spans
multiple partitions. The table's primary key is _AnimalType_
(only this key attribute is shown). DynamoDB uses its hash function to determine where
to store a new item, in this case based on the hash value of the string
_Dog_. Note that the items are not stored in sorted order.
Each item's location is determined by the hash value of its partition key.

###### Note

DynamoDB is optimized for uniform distribution of items across a table's
partitions, no matter how many partitions there may be. We recommend that you
choose a partition key that can have a large number of distinct values relative
to the number of items in the table.

## Data distribution: Partition key and sort key

If the table has a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), DynamoDB calculates the hash value of the partition key in the same way as described in [Data distribution: Partition key](#HowItWorks.Partitions.SimpleKey). However, it tends to keep items which have the same value of partition key close together and in sorted order by
the sort key attribute's value. The set of items which have the same value of partition key is called an item collection. Item collections are optimized for efficient
retrieval of ranges of the items within the collection. If your table doesn't have local secondary indexes, DynamoDB will automatically split your item collection over as many
partitions as required to store the data and to serve read and write throughput.

To write an item to the table, DynamoDB calculates the hash value of the partition
key to determine which partition should contain the item. In that partition, several
items could have the same partition key value. So DynamoDB stores the item among the
others with the same partition key, in ascending order by sort key.

To read an item from the table, you must specify its partition key value and sort
key value. DynamoDB calculates the partition key's hash value, yielding the partition
in which the item can be found.

You can read multiple items from the table in a single operation
( `Query`) if the items you want have the same partition key value.
DynamoDB returns all of the items with that partition key value. Optionally, you can
apply a condition to the sort key so that it returns only the items within a certain
range of values.

Suppose that the _Pets_ table has a composite primary key
consisting of _AnimalType_ (partition key) and
_Name_ (sort key). The following diagram shows DynamoDB writing
an item with a partition key value of _Dog_ and a sort key value
of _Fido_.

![DynamoDB stores an item with a composite partition key and sorts the item using the sort key attribute's value.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/HowItWorksPartitionKeySortKey.png)

To read that same item from the _Pets_ table, DynamoDB calculates
the hash value of _Dog_, yielding the partition in which these
items are stored. DynamoDB then scans the sort key attribute values until it finds
_Fido_.

To read all of the items with an _AnimalType_ of
_Dog_, you can issue a `Query` operation without
specifying a sort key condition. By default, the items are returned in the order
that they are stored (that is, in ascending order by sort key). Optionally, you can
request descending order instead.

To query only some of the _Dog_ items, you can apply a
condition to the sort key (for example, only the _Dog_ items
where _Name_ begins with a letter that is within the range
`A` through `K`).

###### Note

In a DynamoDB table, there is no upper limit on the number of distinct sort key
values per partition key value. If you needed to store many billions of
_Dog_ items in the _Pets_ table, DynamoDB
would allocate enough storage to handle this requirement automatically.
