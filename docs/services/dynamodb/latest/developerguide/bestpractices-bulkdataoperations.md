# Best practices for using bulk data operations in DynamoDB
<a name="BestPractices_BulkDataOperations"></a>

DynamoDB supports batch operations such as `BatchWriteItem` using which you can perform up to 25 `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` requests together. However, `BatchWriteItem` doesn't support `UpdateItem` operations. When it comes to bulk updates, the distinction lies in the requirements and the nature of the update. You can use other DynamoDB APIs such as `TransactWriteItems` for batch size up to 100. When more items are involved, you can use services such as AWS Glue, Amazon EMR, AWS Step Functions or use custom scripts and tools like DynamoDB-shell for bulk updates.
