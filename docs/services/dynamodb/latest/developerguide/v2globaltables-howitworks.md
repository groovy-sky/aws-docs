# How DynamoDB global tables work

The following sections describe the concepts and behaviors of global tables in
Amazon DynamoDB.

## Concepts

_Global tables_ is a DynamoDB feature that replicates
table data across AWS Regions.

A _replica table_ (or replica) is a DynamoDB table that
functions as part of a global table. A global table consists of two or more replica
tables across different AWS Regions. Each global table can have only one replica per
AWS Region. All replicas in a global table share the same table name, primary key
schema, and item data.

When an application writes data to a replica in one Region, DynamoDB automatically
replicates the write to all other replicas in the global table. For more information
about how to get started with global tables, see [Tutorials: Creating global tables](v2globaltables-tutorial.md).

## Versions

There are two versions of DynamoDB global tables available: Version 2019.11.21 (Current)
and [Version 2017.11.29 (Legacy)](globaltables-v1.md). You should use
Version 2019.11.21 (Current) whenever possible. The information in this documentation
section is for Version 2019.11.21 (Current). For more information, see [Determining the version of a global table](v2globaltables-versions.md#globaltables.DetermineVersion).

## Availability

Global tables help improve your business continuity by making it easier to implement a
multi-Region high availability architecture. If a workload in a single AWS Region
becomes impaired, you can shift application traffic to a different Region and perform
reads and writes to a different replica table in the same global table.

Each replica table in a global table provides the same durability and availability as
a single-Region DynamoDB table. Global tables offer a 99.999% availability [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/sla),
compared to 99.99% for single-Region tables.

## Consistency modes

When you create a global table, you can configure its consistency mode. Global tables
support two consistency modes: multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC), and
multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC).

If you do not specify a consistency mode when creating a global table, the global
table defaults to multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC). A global table cannot
contain replicas configured with different consistency modes. You cannot change a global
table's consistency mode after creation.

### Multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC)

Multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC) is the default consistency mode for
global tables. Item changes in an MREC global table replica are asynchronously
replicated to all other replicas, typically within a second or less. In the unlikely
event a replica in a MREC global table becomes isolated or impaired, any data not
yet replicated to other Regions will be replicated when the replica becomes
healthy.

If the same item is modified in multiple Regions simultaneously, DynamoDB will
resolve the conflict by using the modification with the latest internal timestamp on
a per-item basis, referred to as a "last writer wins" conflict resolution method. An
item will eventually converge in all replicas to the version created by the last
write.

[Strongly consistent read operations](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-getitem.md#DDB-GetItem-request-ConsistentRead) return the latest version of an
item if that item was last updated in the Region where the read occurred, but may
return stale data if the item was last updated in a different Region. Conditional
writes evaluate the condition expression against the version of the item in the
Region.

You create a MREC global table by adding a replica to an existing DynamoDB table.
Adding a replica has no performance impact on existing single-Region DynamoDB tables or
global table replicas. You can add replicas to a MREC global table to expand the
number of Regions where data is replicated, or remove replicas from an MREC global
table if they are no longer needed. An MREC global table can have a replica in any
Region where DynamoDB is available, and can have as many replicas as there are Regions
in the [AWS\
partition.](../../../whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/partitions.md)

### Multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC)

You can configure multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) mode when you create a
global table. Item changes in an MRSC global table replica are synchronously
replicated to at least one other Region before the write operation returns a
successful response. Strongly consistent read operations on any MRSC replica always return the latest
version of an item. Conditional writes always evaluate the condition expression
against the latest version of an item.

A MRSC global table must be deployed in exactly three Regions. You can configure a MRSC global table with three replicas, or with two replicas
and one witness. A witness is a component of a MRSC global table that contains data
written to global table replicas and provides an optional alternative to a full
replica while supporting MRSC's availability architecture. You cannot perform read
or write operations on a witness. A witness is located in a different Region than
the two replicas. When creating a MRSC global table, you choose the Regions for both your replicas and the witness deployment
at MRSC table creation time. You
can determine whether and in which Region a MRSC global table has a witness
configured from the output of the [`DescribeTable`](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-describetable.md) API. The witness is owned and managed by
DynamoDB, and the witness will not appear in your AWS account in the Region where it
is configured.

MRSC global tables are available in the following Region sets: US Region set (US East N. Virginia, US East Ohio, US West Oregon), EU Region set (Europe Ireland, Europe London, Europe Paris, Europe Frankfurt), and AP Region set (Asia Pacific Tokyo, Asia Pacific Seoul, and Asia Pacific Osaka). MRSC global tables cannot span Region sets (e.g. a MRSC global table cannot contain replicas from both US and EU Region sets).

You create a MRSC
global table by adding one replica and a witness or two replicas to an existing
DynamoDB table that contains no data. When converting an existing single-Region table to a MRSC global table, you must
ensure that the table is empty. Converting a single-Region table to a MRSC
global table with existing items is not supported. Ensure that no data is
written into the table during the conversion process. You cannot add additional replicas to an existing
MRSC global table. You cannot delete a single replica or a witness from a MRSC
global table. You can delete two replicas or delete one replica and a witness from a
MRSC global table, converting the remaining replica to a single-Region DynamoDB
table.

A write operation fails with a `ReplicatedWriteConflictException` when
it attempts to modify an item that is already being modified in another Region.
Writes that fail with the `ReplicatedWriteConflictException` can be
retried and will succeed if the item is no longer being modified in another
Region.

The following considerations apply to MRSC global tables:

- Time to Live (TTL) is not supported for MRSC global tables.

- Local secondary indexes (LSIs) are not supported for MRSC global
tables.

- CloudWatch Contributor Insights information is only reported for the Region in
which an operation occurred.

## Choosing a consistency mode

The key criteria for choosing a multi-Region consistency mode is whether your
application prioritizes lower latency writes and strongly consistent reads, or
prioritizes global strong consistency.

MREC global tables will have lower write and strongly consistent read latencies
compared to MRSC global tables. MREC global tables have a Recovery Point
Objective (RPO) equal to the replication delay between replicas, usually a few seconds
depending on the replica Regions.

You should use the MREC mode when:

- Your application can tolerate stale data returned from strongly consistent
read operations if that data was updated in another Region.

- You prioritize lower write and strongly consistent read latencies over
multi-Region read consistency.

- Your multi-Region high availability strategy can tolerate an RPO greater than
zero.

MRSC global tables will have higher write and strongly consistent read latencies
compared to MREC global tables. MRSC global tables support a Recovery Point Objective
(RPO) of zero.

You should use the MRSC mode when:

- You need strongly consistent reads across multiple Regions.

- You prioritize global read consistency over lower write latency.

- Your multi-Region high availability strategy requires an RPO of zero.

## Monitoring global tables

Global tables configured for multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC) publish the
[ReplicationLatency](metrics-dimensions.md#ReplicationLatency) metric to
CloudWatch. This metric tracks the elapsed time between when an item is written to a replica
table, and when that item appears in another replica in the global table.
`ReplicationLatency` is expressed in milliseconds and is emitted for
every source and destination Region pair in a global table.

Typical `ReplicationLatency` values depends on the distance between your
chosen AWS Regions, as well as other variables like workload type and throughput. For
example, a source replica in the US West (N. California) (us-west-1) Region has lower
`ReplicationLatency` to the US West (Oregon) (us-west-2) Region
compared to the Africa (Cape Town) (af-south-1) Region.

An increasing value for `ReplicationLatency` could indicate that updates
from one replica are not propagating to other replica tables in a timely manner. In this
case, you can temporarily redirect your application's read and write activity to a
different AWS Region.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not publish a
`ReplicationLatency` metric.

## Fault injection testing

Both MREC and MRSC global tables integrate with [AWS Fault Injection\
Service](../../../resilience-hub/latest/userguide/testing.md) (AWS FIS), a fully managed service for running controlled fault injection
experiments to improve an application's resilience. Using AWS FIS, you can:

- Create experiment templates that define specific failure scenarios.

- Inject failures to validate application resilience by simulating Region isolation (that is,
pausing replication to and from a selected replica) to test error handling, recovery mechanisms,
and multi-Region traffic shift behavior when one AWS Region experiences disruption.

For example, in a global table with replicas in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and
US West (Oregon), you can run an experiment in US East (Ohio) to test region isolation there
while US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) continue normal operations. This controlled
testing helps you identify and resolve potential issues before they affect production workloads.

See [Action targets](../../../fis/latest/userguide/action-sequence.md#action-targets) in the _AWS FIS user guide_ for a complete list of
AWS FIS supported actions and [Cross-Region Connectivity](../../../fis/latest/userguide/cross-region-scenario.md) to pause DynamoDB replication between regions.

For information about Amazon DynamoDB global table actions available in AWS FIS,
see [DynamoDB\
global tables actions reference](../../../fis/latest/userguide/fis-actions-reference.md#dynamodb-actions-reference) in the _AWS FIS User Guide_.

To get started running fault injection experiments,
see [Planning\
your AWS FIS experiments](../../../fis/latest/userguide/getting-started-planning.md) in the AWS FIS user guide.

###### Note

During AWS FIS experiments in MRSC, eventually consistent
reads are permitted, but table setting updates - such as changing billing mode
or configuring table throughput - are not allowed, similar to MREC. Please check the
CloudWatch metric [FaultInjectionServiceInducedErrors](metrics-dimensions.md#FaultInjectionServiceInducedErrors)
for additional details regarding the error code.

## Time To Live (TTL)

Global tables configured for MREC support configuring [Time To\
Live](ttl.md) (TTL) deletion. TTL settings are automatically synchronized for all
replicas in a global table. When TTL deletes an item from a replica in a Region, the
delete is replicated to all other replicas in the global table. TTL does not consume
write capacity, so you are not charged for the TTL delete in the Region where the delete
occurred. However, you are charged for the replicated delete in each other region with a
replica in the global table.

TTL delete replication consumes write capacity on the replicas to which the delete is
being replicated. Replicas configured for provisioned capacity may throttle requests if
the combination of write throughput and TTL delete throughput is higher than the
provisioned write capacity.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not support
configuring Time To Live (TTL) deletion.

## Streams

Global tables configured for multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC) replicate
changes by reading those changes from a [DynamoDB Stream](streams.md) on a
replica table and applying that change to all other replica tables. Streams are
therefore enabled by default on all replicas in an MREC global table, and cannot be
disabled on those replicas. The MREC replication process may combine multiple changes in
a short period of time into a single replicated write, resulting in each replica's
Stream containing slightly different records. Streams records on MREC replicas are
always ordered on a per-item basis, but ordering between items may differ between
replicas.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not use DynamoDB
Streams for replication, so Streams are not enabled by default on MRSC replicas. You can
enable Streams on an MRSC replica. Streams records on MRSC replicas are identical for
every replica, including Stream record ordering.

If you want to write an application that processes Streams records for changes that
occurred in a particular Region but not other Regions in a global table, you can add an
attribute to each item that defines in which Region the change for that item occurred.
You can use this attribute to filter Streams records for changes that occurred in other
Regions, including the use of Lambda event filters to only invoke Lambda functions for
changes in a specific Region.

## Transactions

On a global table configured for MREC, DynamoDB transaction operations ( [`TransactWriteItems`](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-transactwriteitems.md) and [`TransactGetItems`](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-transactgetitems.md)) are only atomic within the Region where
the operation was invoked. Transactional writes are not replicated as a unit across
Regions, meaning only some of the writes in a transaction may be returned by read
operations in other replicas at a given point in time.

For example, if you have a global table with replicas in the US East (Ohio) and
US West (Oregon) Regions and perform a `TransactWriteItems` operation in
the US East (Ohio) Region, you may observe partially completed transactions in the
US West (Oregon) Region as changes are replicated. Changes will only be replicated to
other Regions once they've been committed in the source Region.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not support
transaction operations, and will return an error if those operations are invoked on an
MRSC replica.

## Read and write throughput

### Provisioned mode

Replication consumes write capacity. Replicas configured for provisioned capacity may throttle requests
if the combination of application write throughput and replication write throughput exceeds the provisioned
write capacity. For global tables using provisioned mode, auto scaling settings for both read and write capacities
are synchronized between replicas.

You can independently configure read capacity settings for each replica in a global table by
using the [`ProvisionedThroughputOverride`](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-provisionedthroughputoverride.md) parameter at the replica level. By default, changes to
provisioned read capacity are applied to all replicas in the global table. When adding a new
replica to a global table, the read capacity of the source table or replica is used as the
initial value unless a replica-level override is explicitly specified.

### On-demand mode

For global tables configured for on-demand mode, write capacity is automatically synchronized
across all replicas. DynamoDB automatically adjusts capacity based on traffic, and there are no
replica-specific read or write capacity settings to manage.

## Settings synchronization

Settings in DynamoDB global tables are configuration parameters that control various
aspects of table behavior and replication. These settings are managed through the DynamoDB
control plane APIs and can be configured when creating or modifying global tables.
Global tables automatically synchronize certain settings across all replicas to maintain
consistency, while allowing flexibility for region-specific optimizations. Understanding
which settings synchronize and how they behave helps you configure your global table
effectively. The settings fall into three main categories based on how they are
synchronized across replicas.

The following settings are always synchronized between replicas in a global
table:

- Capacity mode (provisioned capacity or on-demand)

- Table provisioned write capacity

- Table write auto scaling

- Attribute definition of key schema

- Global Secondary Index (GSI) definition

- GSI provisioned write capacity

- GSI write auto scaling

- Server-side Encryption (SSE) type

- Streams definition in MREC mode

- Time To Live (TTL)

- Warm Throughput

- On-demand maximum write throughput

The following settings are synchronized between replicas, but can be overridden on a
per-replica basis:

- Table provisioned read capacity

- Table read auto scaling

- GSI provisioned read capacity

- GSI read auto scaling

- Table Class

- On-demand maximum read throughput

###### Note

Overridable setting values are changed if the setting is modified on any other
replica. As an example, you have a MREC global table with replicas in US East (N.
Virginia) and US West (Oregon). The US East (N. Virginia) replica has provisioned
read throughput set to 200 RCUs. The replica in US West (Oregon) has a provisioned
read throughput override set to 100 RCUs. If you update the provisioned read
throughput setting on the US East (N. Virginia) replica from 200 RCUs to 300 RCUs,
the new provisioned read throughput value will also be applied to the replica in US
West (Oregon). This changes the provisioned read throughput setting for the US West
(Oregon) replica from the overridden value of 100 RCUs to the new value of 300
RCUs.

The following settings are never synchronized between replicas:

- Deletion protection

- Point-in-time Recovery

- Tags

- Table CloudWatch Contributor Insights enablement

- GSI CloudWatch Contributor Insights enablement

- Kinesis Data Streams definition

- Resource Policies

- Streams definition in MRSC mode

All other settings are not synchronized between replicas.

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

Writes to global table replicas bypass DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), updating DynamoDB directly. As
a result, DAX caches can become stale as writes are not updating the DAX cache.
DAX caches configured for global table replicas will only be refreshed when the cache
TTL expires.

## Considerations for managing global tables

You can't delete a table used to add a new global table replica until 24 hours have
elapsed since the new replica was created.

If you disable an AWS Region that contains global table replicas, those replicas are
permanently converted to single-Region tables 20 hours after the Region is
disabled.
