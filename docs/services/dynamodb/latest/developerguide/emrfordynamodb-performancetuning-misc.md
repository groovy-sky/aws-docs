# Additional topics

The following are some more ways to tune applications that use Hive to access
DynamoDB.

## Retry duration

By default, Hive will rerun a Hadoop job if it has not returned any results
from DynamoDB within two minutes. You can adjust this interval by modifying the
`dynamodb.retry.duration` parameter:

```nohighlight

SET dynamodb.retry.duration=2;
```

The value must be a nonzero integer, representing the number of minutes in the
retry interval. The default for `dynamodb.retry.duration` is 2
(minutes).

## Parallel data requests

Multiple data requests, either from more than one user or more than one
application to a single table can drain read provisioned throughput and slow
performance.

## Process duration

Data consistency in DynamoDB depends on the order of read and write operations on
each node. While a Hive query is in progress, another application might load new
data into the DynamoDB table or modify or delete existing data. In this case, the
results of the Hive query might not reflect changes made to the data while the
query was running.

## Request time

Scheduling Hive queries that access a DynamoDB table when there is lower demand
on the DynamoDB table improves performance. For example, if most of your
application's users live in San Francisco, you might choose to export daily data
at 4:00 A.M. PST when the majority of users are asleep and not updating records
in your DynamoDB database.
