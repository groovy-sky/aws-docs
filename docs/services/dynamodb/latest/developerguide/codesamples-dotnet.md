code examples in the following sections:

You can get started quickly by using the AWS SDK for .NET with the Toolkit for Visual Studio.

###### To run the .NET code examples (using Visual Studio)

1. Download and install [Microsoft\
    Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

2. (Optional) Download and install the [Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio).

3. Set up your AWS credentials. Configure a credentials profile in your
    shared AWS credentials file ( `~/.aws/credentials`). For more
    information, see [Configure AWS\
    credentials](../../../../reference/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config-creds.md) in the _AWS SDK for .NET Developer Guide_.

4. Start Visual Studio. Choose **File**,
    **New**, **Project**.

5. Search for **Console App**, select the C# template
    that targets .NET, and then choose **Next**. Configure
    your project name and location, and then choose
    **Create**.

6. Add the AWS SDK for DynamoDB NuGet package to your project:
1. In Solution Explorer, open the context (right-click) menu for your
       project, and then choose **Manage NuGet**
      **Packages**.

2. In NuGet Package Manager, choose **Browse**.

3. In the search box, enter `AWSSDK.DynamoDBv2`, and
       wait for the search to complete.

4. Choose **AWSSDK.DynamoDBv2**, and then choose
       **Install**.
7. In your Visual Studio project, open `Program.cs`. Replace
    the contents with the code example from the documentation page that you
    want to run.

8. To run the code, choose **Start** in the Visual Studio
    toolbar.

The SDK for .NET provides thread-safe clients for working with DynamoDB. As a best practice,
your applications should create one client and reuse the client between threads.

For more information, see [AWS SDK for\
.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net).

###### Note

The code examples in this guide are intended for use with the latest version of
the AWS SDK for .NET.

## .NET: Setting your AWS credentials

The SDK for .NET requires that you provide AWS credentials to your application at
runtime. The code examples in this guide assume that you are using the SDK Store to
manage your AWS credentials file, as described in [Using the SDK\
store](../../../../reference/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config-creds.md#sdk-store) in the _AWS SDK for .NET Developer Guide_.

The Toolkit for Visual Studio supports multiple sets of credentials from any number of accounts. Each
set is referred to as a _profile_. Visual Studio adds entries to
the project's `App.config` file so that your application can find
the AWS credentials at runtime.

The following example shows the default `App.config` file that
is generated when you create a new project using Toolkit for Visual Studio.

```xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
    <appSettings>
    <add key="AWSProfileName" value="default"/>
    <add key="AWSRegion" value="us-west-2" />
 </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

At runtime, the program uses the `default` set of AWS credentials, as
specified by the `AWSProfileName` entry. The AWS credentials themselves
are kept in the SDK Store in encrypted form. The Toolkit for Visual Studio provides a graphical user
interface for managing your credentials, all from within Visual Studio. For more
information, see [Specifying\
credentials](../../../awstoolkitvs/latest/userguide/tkv-setup.md#creds) in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio User Guide_.

###### Note

By default, the code examples access DynamoDB in the US West (Oregon) Region.
You can change the Region by modifying the `AWSRegion` entry in the
App.config file. You can set `AWSRegion` to any Region where DynamoDB is
available. For a complete list, see [AWS regions and endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#ddb_region) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

## .NET: Setting the AWS Region and endpoint

By default, the code examples access DynamoDB in the US West (Oregon) Region. You
can change the Region by modifying the `AWSRegion` entry in the
`App.config` file. Or, you can change the Region by modifying
the `AmazonDynamoDBClient` properties.

The following code example instantiates a new `AmazonDynamoDBClient`.
The client is modified so that the code runs against DynamoDB in a different
Region.

```csharp

AmazonDynamoDBConfig clientConfig = new AmazonDynamoDBConfig();
// This client will access the US East 1 region.
clientConfig.RegionEndpoint = RegionEndpoint.USEast1;
AmazonDynamoDBClient client = new AmazonDynamoDBClient(clientConfig);
```

For a complete list of Regions, see [AWS regions and endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#ddb_region) in the
_Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

If you want to run the code examples using DynamoDB locally on your computer, set the
endpoint as follows.

```csharp

AmazonDynamoDBConfig clientConfig = new AmazonDynamoDBConfig();
// Set the endpoint URL
clientConfig.ServiceURL = "http://localhost:8000";
AmazonDynamoDBClient client = new AmazonDynamoDBClient(clientConfig);
```
