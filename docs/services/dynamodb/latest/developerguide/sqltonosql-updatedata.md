# Differences between a relational (SQL) database and DynamoDB when modifying data in a table

The SQL language provides the `UPDATE` statement for modifying data.
Amazon DynamoDB uses the `UpdateItem` operation to accomplish similar tasks.

## Modifying data in a table with SQL

In SQL, you would use the `UPDATE` statement to modify one or more
rows. The `SET` clause specifies new values for one or more columns, and
the `WHERE` clause determines which rows are modified. The following is
an example.

```sql

UPDATE Music
SET RecordLabel = 'Global Records'
WHERE Artist = 'No One You Know' AND SongTitle = 'Call Me Today';
```

If no rows match the `WHERE` clause, the `UPDATE` statement
has no effect.

## Modifying data in a table in DynamoDB

In DynamoDB, you can use either the DynamoDB API or [PartiQL](ql-reference.md) (a SQL-compatible query
language) to modify a single item. If you want to modify multiple items, you must
use multiple operations.

DynamoDB API

With the DynamoDB API, you use the `UpdateItem` operation to
modify a single item.

```nohighlight

{
    TableName: "Music",
    Key: {
        "Artist":"No One You Know",
        "SongTitle":"Call Me Today"
    },
    UpdateExpression: "SET RecordLabel = :label",
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
        ":label": "Global Records"
    }
}
```

You must specify the `Key` attributes of the item to be
modified and an `UpdateExpression` to specify attribute
values. `UpdateItem` behaves like an "upsert" operation. The
item is updated if it exists in the table, but if not, a new item is
added (inserted).

`UpdateItem` supports _conditional_
_writes_, where the operation succeeds only if a specific
`ConditionExpression` evaluates to true. For example, the
following `UpdateItem` operation does not perform the update
unless the price of the song is greater than or equal to 2.00.

```nohighlight

{
    TableName: "Music",
    Key: {
        "Artist":"No One You Know",
        "SongTitle":"Call Me Today"
    },
    UpdateExpression: "SET RecordLabel = :label",
    ConditionExpression: "Price >= :p",
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
        ":label": "Global Records",
        ":p": 2.00
    }
}
```

`UpdateItem` also supports _atomic_
_counters_, or attributes of type `Number` that
can be incremented or decremented. Atomic counters are similar in many
ways to sequence generators, identity columns, or autoincrement fields
in SQL databases.

The following is an example of an `UpdateItem` operation to
initialize a new attribute ( _Plays_) to keep track of
the number of times a song has been played.

```nohighlight

{
    TableName: "Music",
    Key: {
        "Artist":"No One You Know",
        "SongTitle":"Call Me Today"
    },
    UpdateExpression: "SET Plays = :val",
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
        ":val": 0
    },
    ReturnValues: "UPDATED_NEW"
}
```

The `ReturnValues` parameter is set to
`UPDATED_NEW`, which returns the new values of any
attributes that were updated. In this case, it returns 0 (zero).

Whenever someone plays this song, we can use the following
`UpdateItem` operation to increment
_Plays_ by one.

```nohighlight

{
    TableName: "Music",
    Key: {
        "Artist":"No One You Know",
        "SongTitle":"Call Me Today"
    },
    UpdateExpression: "SET Plays = Plays + :incr",
    ExpressionAttributeValues: {
        ":incr": 1
    },
    ReturnValues: "UPDATED_NEW"
}
```

PartiQL for DynamoDB

With PartiQL, you use the `ExecuteStatement` operation to
modify an item in a table, using the PartiQL `Update`
statement.

The primary key for this table consists of _Artist_
and _SongTitle_. You must specify values for these
attributes.

```sql

UPDATE Music
SET RecordLabel ='Global Records'
WHERE Artist='No One You Know' AND SongTitle='Call Me Today'
```

You can also modify multiple fields at once, such as in the following
example.

```sql

UPDATE Music
SET RecordLabel = 'Global Records'
SET AwardsWon = 10
WHERE Artist ='No One You Know' AND SongTitle='Call Me Today'
```

`Update` also supports _atomic_
_counters_, or attributes of type `Number` that can
be incremented or decremented. Atomic counters are similar in many ways
to sequence generators, identity columns, or autoincrement fields in SQL
databases.

The following is an example of an `Update` statement to
initialize a new attribute ( _Plays_) to keep track of
the number of times a song has been played.

```sql

UPDATE Music
SET Plays = 0
WHERE Artist='No One You Know' AND SongTitle='Call Me Today'
```

Whenever someone plays this song, we can use the following
`Update` statement to increment
_Plays_ by one.

```sql

UPDATE Music
SET Plays = Plays + 1
WHERE Artist='No One You Know' AND SongTitle='Call Me Today'
```
