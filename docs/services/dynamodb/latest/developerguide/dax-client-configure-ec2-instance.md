# Step 3: Configure an Amazon EC2 instance

When your Amazon EC2 instance is available, you can log in to the instance and prepare it
for use.

###### Note

The following steps assume that you are connecting to your Amazon EC2 instance from a
computer running Linux. For other ways to connect, see [Connect to Your Linux\
Instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/accessinginstances.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

###### To configure the EC2 instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Use the `ssh` command to log in to your Amazon EC2 instance, as shown in
    the following example.

```nohighlight

ssh -i my-keypair.pem ec2-user@public-dns-name
```

You need to specify your private key file ( `.pem` file) and
    the public DNS name of your instance. (See [Step 1: Launch an Amazon EC2 instance](dax-client-launch-ec2-instance.md).)

The login ID is `ec2-user`. No password is required.

3. After you log in to your EC2 instance, configure your AWS credentials as
    shown following. Enter your AWS access key ID and secret key (from [Step 2: Create a user and policy](dax-client-create-user-policy.md)), and set the default Region
    name to your current Region. (In the following example, the default Region name
    is `us-west-2`.)

```nohighlight

aws configure

AWS Access Key ID [None]: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]:
```

After launching and configuring your Amazon EC2 instance, you can test the functionality of
DAX using one of the available sample applications. For more information, see [Step 4: Run a sample application](dax-client-run-application.md).
