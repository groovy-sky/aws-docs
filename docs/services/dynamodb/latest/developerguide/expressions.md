# Using expressions in DynamoDB
<a name="Expressions"></a>

In Amazon DynamoDB, you can use *expressions* to specify which attributes to read from an item, write data when a condition is met, specify how to update an item, define queries and filter the results of a query.

This table describes the basic expression grammar and the available kinds of expressions.

| Expression type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Projection expression | A projection expression identifies the attributes that you want to retrieve from an item when you use operations such as GetItem, Query, or Scan. |
| Condition expression | A condition expression determines which items should be modified when you use the PutItem, UpdateItem, and DeleteItem operations. |
| Update expression | An update expression specifies how UpdateItem will modify the attributes of an item— for example, setting a scalar value or removing elements from a list or a map. |
| Key condition expression | A key condition expression determines which items a query will read from a table or index. |
| Filter expression | A filter expression determines which items among the Query results should be returned to you. All the other results are discarded. |

For information about expression syntax and more detailed information about each type of expression, see the following sections.

**Note**
For backward compatibility, DynamoDB also supports conditional parameters that do not use expressions. For more information, see [Legacy DynamoDB conditional parameters](LegacyConditionalParameters.md).
New applications should use expressions rather than the legacy parameters.
