# DynamoDB API operations supported by resource-based policies
<a name="rbac-iam-actions"></a>

This topic lists the API operations that are supported by resource-based policies. However, for cross-account access, you can only use a certain set of DynamoDB APIs through resource-based policies. You can't attach resource-based policies to resource types, such as backups and imports. The IAM actions, which correspond with the APIs operating on these resource types, are excluded from the supported IAM actions in resource-based policies. Because table administrators configure internal table settings within the same account, APIs, such as [UpdateTimeToLive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTimeToLive.html) and [DisableKinesisStreamingDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_DisableKinesisStreamingDestination.html), don't support cross-account access through resource-based policies.

The DynamoDB data plane and control plane APIs that support cross-account access also support table name overloading, which lets you specify the table ARN instead of the table name. You can specify table ARN in the `TableName` parameter of these APIs. However, not all of these APIs support cross-account access.
