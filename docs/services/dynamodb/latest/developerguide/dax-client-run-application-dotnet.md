# .NET and DAX

Follow these steps to run the .NET sample on your Amazon EC2 instance.

###### Note

This tutorial uses the .NET 9 SDK.
It shows how you can run a program in your default Amazon VPC to access your Amazon
DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. It works with the [AWS SDK v4 for .NET](../../../../reference/sdk-for-net/v4/developer-guide/welcome.md).
For details about changes in V4 and information about migrating,
see [Migrating to version 4 of the AWS SDK for .NET](../../../../reference/sdk-for-net/v4/developer-guide/net-dg-v4.md).
If you prefer, you can use the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio to write a
.NET application and deploy it into your VPC.

For more information, see [Creating and Deploying Elastic Beanstalk Applications in .NET Using AWS\
Toolkit for Visual Studio](../../../elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-net.md) in the
_AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide_.

###### To run the .NET sample for DAX

1. Go to the [Microsoft\
    Downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download?initial-os=linux) and download the latest .NET 9 SDK
    for Linux. The downloaded file is
    `dotnet-sdk-N.N.N-linux-x64.tar.gz`.

2. Extract the SDK files.

```nohighlight

mkdir dotnet
tar zxvf dotnet-sdk-N.N.N-linux-x64.tar.gz -C dotnet
```

Replace `N.N.N` with the actual
    version number of the .NET SDK (for example: `9.0.305`).

3. Verify the installation.

```nohighlight

alias dotnet=$HOME/dotnet/dotnet
dotnet --version
```

This should print the version number of the .NET SDK.

###### Note

Instead of the version number, you might receive the following
error:

**`error: libunwind.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No**
**such file or directory`**

To resolve the error, install the `libunwind`
package.

```nohighlight

sudo yum install -y libunwind
```

After you do this, you should be able to run the `dotnet
                                   --version` command without any errors.

4. Create a new .NET project.

```nohighlight

dotnet new console -o myApp
```

This requires a few minutes to perform a one-time-only setup. When it is
    complete, run the sample project.

```nohighlight

dotnet run --project myApp
```

You should receive the following message: `Hello World!`

5. The `myApp/myApp.csproj` file contains metadata about your
    project. To use the DAX client in your application, modify the file so
    that it looks like the following.

```xml

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
       <PropertyGroup>
           <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
           <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
       </PropertyGroup>
       <ItemGroup>
           <PackageReference Include="AWSSDK.DAX.Client" Version="*" />
       </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

6. Download the sample program source code ( `.zip` file).

```nohighlight

wget http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/samples/TryDax.zip
```

When the download is complete, extract the source files.

```nohighlight

unzip TryDax.zip
```

7. Now run the sample programs of _dotNet_,
    one at a time. For each program, copy its contents into the
    `myApp/Program.cs`, and then run the `MyApp`
    project.

Run the following .NET programs. The first program creates a DynamoDB table
    named `TryDaxTable`. The second program writes data to the
    table.

```nohighlight

cp TryDax/dotNet/01-CreateTable.cs myApp/Program.cs
dotnet run --project myApp

cp TryDax/dotNet/02-Write-Data.cs myApp/Program.cs
dotnet run --project myApp
```

8. Next, run some programs to perform `GetItem`,
    `Query`, and `Scan` operations on your DAX
    cluster. To determine the endpoint for your DAX cluster, choose one of the
    following:

- Using the DynamoDB console —
Choose your DAX cluster. The cluster endpoint is shown on the
console, as in the following example.

```nohighlight

dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

- Using the AWS CLI — Enter the
following command.

```nohighlight

aws dax describe-clusters --query "Clusters[*].ClusterDiscoveryEndpoint"
```

The cluster endpoint is shown in the output, as in the following
example.

```json

{
      "Address": "my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
      "Port": 8111,
      "URL": "dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
}
```

Now run the following programs, specifying your cluster endpoint as a
command line parameter. (Replace the sample endpoint with your actual DAX
cluster endpoint.)

```nohighlight

cp TryDax/dotNet/03-GetItem-Test.cs myApp/Program.cs
dotnet run --project myApp dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

cp TryDax/dotNet/04-Query-Test.cs myApp/Program.cs
dotnet run --project myApp dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

cp TryDax/dotNet/05-Scan-Test.cs myApp/Program.cs
dotnet run --project myApp dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

Take note of the timing information—the number of milliseconds
required for the `GetItem`, `Query`, and
`Scan` tests.

9. Run the following .NET program to delete `TryDaxTable`.

```nohighlight

cp TryDax/dotNet/06-DeleteTable.cs myApp/Program.cs
dotnet run --project myApp
```
