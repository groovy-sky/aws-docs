# Security and access control
<a name="VectorSearch.Security"></a>

IAM policies control access to vector index operations. The following permissions apply:
+ **Creating and deleting vector indexes** – Requires `dynamodb:CreateTable` or `dynamodb:UpdateTable` permissions on the table resource. No additional permissions are needed for vector index management.
+ **Searching a vector index** – Requires `dynamodb:SearchVectors` permission on the index resource. The resource ARN format is `arn:aws:dynamodb:{{region}}:{{account-id}}:table/{{table-name}}/index/{{index-name}}`.
+ **Writing items with vectors** – Uses the same permissions as standard write operations (`dynamodb:PutItem`, `dynamodb:UpdateItem`). No additional permissions are required for the vector data itself.

**FGAC condition keys don't apply to SearchVectors**
You can't use Amazon DynamoDB fine-grained access control (FGAC) with the `SearchVectors` API. The `dynamodb:` IAM condition context keys that enforce FGAC — such as `dynamodb:LeadingKeys`, `dynamodb:Attributes`, and `dynamodb:Select` — have no effect on `SearchVectors`. This means you can't use them to restrict which items or attributes you can search. Instead, control access at the index level by granting the `dynamodb:SearchVectors` action on the index resource ARN.

Because these condition keys are not present in the `SearchVectors` request context, a policy statement whose condition references one of them does not match a `SearchVectors` request, and DynamoDB denies access rather than granting it. Do not add `dynamodb:SearchVectors` to a statement that carries an FGAC condition. Grant `dynamodb:SearchVectors` in its own statement, scoped by the index resource ARN and with no `dynamodb:` FGAC conditions attached.

If your existing policies scope Amazon DynamoDB access with `dynamodb:LeadingKeys`, `dynamodb:Attributes`, or `dynamodb:Select`, adding vector search means adding a separate statement rather than extending an existing one.

DynamoDB encrypts vector data at rest using the same encryption as the base table. The vector index inherits the table's encryption configuration, whether that is an AWS owned key, an AWS managed key, or a customer managed key in AWS KMS. You do not configure encryption separately for a vector index.

For example IAM policies, including least-privilege policies for search-only access, see [IAM policy to grant access to search a vector index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/iam-policy-example-search-vectors.html).
