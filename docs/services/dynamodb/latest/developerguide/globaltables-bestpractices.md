# Best practices for global tables
<a name="globaltables-bestpractices"></a>

The following sections describe best practices for deploying and using global tables.

## Version
<a name="globaltables-bestpractices-version"></a>

There are two versions of DynamoDB global tables available: version 2019.11.21 (Current) and [version 2017.11.29 (Legacy)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/globaltables.V1.html). You should use version 2019.11.21 (Current) whenever possible.

## Deletion protection

You should enable deletion protection on global table replicas you want protected against accidental deletion. You must enable deletion protection on each replica.

## Using AWS CloudFormation
<a name="globaltables-bestpractices-cloudformation"></a>

CloudFormation does not currently support the coordination of multi-Region resources like global tables across stacks. If you define each replica of a global table in a separate Regional stack, you will encounter errors due to detected drift across stacks when performing replica updates. To avoid this issue, you should choose one Region as the reference Region for deploying your global tables and define all of your global table's replicas in that Region's stack.

**Important**
You cannot convert a resource of type `AWS::DynamoDB::Table` into a resource of type `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` by changing its type in your template. Attempting to convert a single-Region table to a global table by changing its CloudFormation resource type may result in the deletion of your DynamoDB table.

You can use the `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` resource to create a table in a single Region. This table will be deployed like any other single-Region table. If you later update the stack to add other Regions to a resource, replicas will be added to the table and it will safely be converted to a global table.

If you have an existing `AWS::DynamoDB::Table` resource you want to convert to a `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` resource, the recommended steps to convert the resource type are:

1. Set the `AWS::DynamoDB::Table` deletion policy to retain.

1. Remove the table from the stack definition.

1. Add replicas to the single-Region table in the AWS console, converting it to a global table.

1. Import the new global table as a new `AWS::DynamoDB::GlobalTable` resource to the stack.

**Note**
When you add a replica in a new Region to a global table, the provisioned capacity settings of the source Region – including auto scaling maximum capacity – are applied to the new replica when it is created, regardless of the capacity values specified in your CloudFormation template. If the source Region's maximum capacity exceeds the table-level throughput quota in the destination Region, replica creation fails with an error similar to `insufficient TableMaxReadCapacityUnits limits`. After the replica is created, you can adjust its read capacity settings independently; those adjustments aren't transferred to the other Regions. For more information about table-level throughput quotas for global tables, see [Global tables](ServiceQuotas.md#gt-limits-throughput).

## Backups and Point-in-Time Recovery
<a name="globaltables-bestpractices-backups"></a>

Enabling automated backups and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for one replica in a global table may be sufficient to meet your disaster recovery objectives. Replica backups created with AWS-Backup can be automatically replicated across Regions for greater resilience. Consider your disaster recovery plan goals in the context of multi-Region high availability when choosing your backup and PITR enablement strategy.
