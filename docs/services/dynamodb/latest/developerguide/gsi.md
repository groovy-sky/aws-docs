# Using Global Secondary Indexes in DynamoDB

Some applications might need to perform many kinds of queries, using a variety of
different attributes as query criteria. To support these requirements, you can create one or
more _global secondary indexes_ and issue `Query` requests
against these indexes in Amazon DynamoDB.

## Scenario: Using a Global Secondary Index

To illustrate, consider a table named `GameScores` that tracks users and
scores for a mobile gaming application. Each item in `GameScores` is
identified by a partition key ( `UserId`) and a sort key
( `GameTitle`). The following diagram shows how the items in the table
would be organized. (Not all of the attributes are shown.)

![GameScores table containing a list of user id, title, score, date, and wins/losses.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/GSI_01.png)

Now suppose that you wanted to write a leaderboard application to display top scores
for each game. A query that specified the key attributes ( `UserId` and
`GameTitle`) would be very efficient. However, if the application needed
to retrieve data from `GameScores` based on `GameTitle` only, it
would need to use a `Scan` operation. As more items are added to the table,
scans of all the data would become slow and inefficient. This makes it difficult to
answer questions such as the following:

- What is the top score ever recorded for the game Meteor Blasters?

- Which user had the highest score for Galaxy Invaders?

- What was the highest ratio of wins vs. losses?

To speed up queries on non-key attributes, you can create a global secondary index. A global secondary index contains a
selection of attributes from the base table, but they are organized by a primary key
that is different from that of the table. The index key does not need to have any of the
key attributes from the table. It doesn't even need to have the same key schema as a
table.

For example, you could create a global secondary index named `GameTitleIndex`, with a
partition key of `GameTitle` and a sort key of `TopScore`. The
base table's primary key attributes are always projected into an index, so the
`UserId` attribute is also present. The following diagram shows what
`GameTitleIndex` index would look like.

![GameTitleIndex table containing a list of titles, scores, and user ids.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/GSI_02.png)

Now you can query `GameTitleIndex` and easily obtain the scores for Meteor
Blasters. The results are ordered by the sort key values, `TopScore`. If you
set the `ScanIndexForward` parameter to false, the results are returned in
descending order, so the highest score is returned first.

Every global secondary index must have a partition key, and can have an optional sort key. The index
key schema can be different from the base table schema. You could have a table with a
simple primary key (partition key), and create a global secondary index with a composite primary key
(partition key and sort key)—or vice versa. The index key attributes can consist
of any top-level `String`, `Number`, or `Binary`
attributes from the base table. Other scalar types, document types, and set types are
not allowed.

You can project other base table attributes into the index if you want. When you query
the index, DynamoDB can retrieve these projected attributes efficiently. However, global secondary index
queries cannot fetch attributes from the base table. For example, if you query
`GameTitleIndex` as shown in the previous diagram, the query could not
access any non-key attributes other than `TopScore` (although the key
attributes `GameTitle` and `UserId` would automatically be
projected).

In a DynamoDB table, each key value must be unique. However, the key values in a global secondary index do
not need to be unique. To illustrate, suppose that a game named Comet Quest is
especially difficult, with many new users trying but failing to get a score above zero.
The following is some data that could represent this.

UserIdGameTitleTopScore123Comet Quest0201Comet Quest0301Comet Quest0

When this data is added to the `GameScores` table, DynamoDB propagates it to
`GameTitleIndex`. If we then query the index using Comet Quest for
`GameTitle` and 0 for `TopScore`, the following data is
returned.

![Table containing a list of titles, top scores, and user ids.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/GSI_05.png)

Only the items with the specified key values appear in the response. Within that set
of data, the items are in no particular order.

A global secondary index only tracks data items where its key attributes actually exist. For example,
suppose that you added another new item to the `GameScores` table, but only
provided the required primary key attributes.

UserIdGameTitle400Comet Quest

Because you didn't specify the `TopScore` attribute, DynamoDB would not
propagate this item to `GameTitleIndex`. Thus, if you queried
`GameScores` for all the Comet Quest items, you would get the following
four items.

![Table containing a list of 4 titles, top scores, and user ids.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/GSI_04.png)

A similar query on `GameTitleIndex` would still return three items, rather
than four. This is because the item with the nonexistent `TopScore` is not
propagated to the index.

![Table containing a list of 3 titles, top scores, and user ids.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/GSI_05.png)

## Attribute projections

A _projection_ is the set of attributes that is copied from a table into a secondary index. The partition key and sort key of the table are always projected into the index; you can project other attributes to support your application's query requirements. When you query an index, Amazon DynamoDB can access any attribute in the projection as if those attributes were in a table of their own.

When you create a secondary index, you need to specify the attributes that will be projected into the index. DynamoDB provides three different options for this:

- _KEYS\_ONLY_ – Each item in the index consists only
of the table partition key and sort key values, plus the index key values. The
`KEYS_ONLY` option results in the smallest possible secondary index.

- _INCLUDE_ – In addition to the attributes
described in `KEYS_ONLY`, the secondary index will include other non-key attributes that you
specify.

- _ALL_ – The secondary index includes all of the attributes from the source table. Because all of the table data is duplicated in the index, an `ALL` projection results in the largest possible secondary index.

In the previous diagram, `GameTitleIndex` has
only one projected attribute: `UserId`. So while an application can
efficiently determine the `UserId` of the top scorers for each game using
`GameTitle` and `TopScore` in queries, it can't efficiently
determine the highest ratio of wins vs. losses for the top scorers. To do so, the application would
have to perform an additional query on the base table to fetch the wins and losses for
each of the top scorers. A more efficient way to support queries on this data would be
to project these attributes from the base table into the global secondary index, as shown in this
diagram.

![Depiction of projecting non-key attributes into a GSI to support efficient querying.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/GSI_06.png)

Because the non-key attributes `Wins` and `Losses` are projected
into the index, an application can determine the wins vs. losses ratio for any game, or
for any combination of game and user ID.

When you choose the attributes to project into a global secondary index, you must consider the tradeoff
between provisioned throughput costs and storage costs:

- If you need to access just a few attributes with the lowest possible latency,
consider projecting only those attributes into a global secondary index. The smaller the index,
the less that it costs to store it, and the less your write costs are.

- If your application frequently accesses some non-key attributes, you should
consider projecting those attributes into a global secondary index. The additional storage costs
for the global secondary index offset the cost of performing frequent table scans.

- If you need to access most of the non-key attributes on a frequent basis, you
can project these attributes—or even the entire base table— into a
global secondary index. This gives you maximum flexibility. However, your storage cost would
increase, or even double.

- If your application needs to query a table infrequently, but must perform many
writes or updates against the data in the table, consider projecting
`KEYS_ONLY`. The global secondary index would be of minimal size, but would still
be available when needed for query activity.

## Multi-attribute key schema

Global Secondary Indexes support multi-attribute keys, allowing you to compose partition keys and sort
keys from multiple attributes. With multi-attribute keys, you can create a partition key
from up to four attributes and a sort key from up to four attributes, for a total of up
to eight attributes per key schema.

Multi-attribute keys simplify your data model by eliminating the need to manually
concatenate attributes into synthetic keys. Instead of creating composite strings like
`TOURNAMENT#WINTER2024#REGION#NA-EAST`, you can use the natural
attributes from your domain model directly. DynamoDB handles the composite key logic
automatically, hashing multiple partition key attributes together for data distribution
and maintaining hierarchical sort order across multiple sort key attributes.

For example, consider a gaming tournament system where you want to organize matches by
tournament and region. With multi-attribute keys, you can define your partition key as
two separate attributes: `tournamentId` and `region`. Similarly,
you can define your sort key using multiple attributes like `round`,
`bracket`, and `matchId` to create a natural hierarchy. This
approach keeps your data typed and your code clean, without string manipulation or
parsing.

When you query a global secondary index with multi-attribute keys, you must specify all partition key
attributes using equality conditions. For sort key attributes, you can query them
left-to-right in the order they're defined in the key schema. This means you can query
the first sort key attribute alone, the first two attributes together, or all attributes
together, but you cannot skip attributes in the middle. Inequality conditions such as
`>`, `<`, `BETWEEN`, or
`begins_with()` must be the last condition in your query.

Multi-attribute keys work particularly well when creating global secondary indexes on existing tables.
You can use attributes that already exist in your table without backfilling synthetic
keys across your data. This makes it straightforward to add new query patterns to your
application by creating indexes that reorganize your data using different attribute
combinations.

Each attribute in a multi-attribute key can have its own data type: `String`
(S), `Number` (N), or `Binary` (B). When choosing data types,
consider that `Number` attributes sort numerically without requiring
zero-padding, while `String` attributes sort lexicographically. For example,
if you use a `Number` type for a score attribute, the values 5, 50, 500, and
1000 sort in natural numeric order. The same values as `String` type would
sort as "1000", "5", "50", "500" unless you pad them with leading zeros.

When designing multi-attribute keys, order your attributes from most general to most
specific. For partition keys, combine attributes that are always queried together and
that provide good data distribution. For sort keys, place frequently queried attributes
first in the hierarchy to maximize query flexibility. This ordering allows you to query
at any level of granularity that matches your access patterns.

See the [Multi-attribute keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.DesignPattern.MultiAttributeKeys.html) for implementation examples.

## Reading data from a Global Secondary Index

You can retrieve items from a global secondary index using the `Query` and `Scan`
operations. The `GetItem` and `BatchGetItem` operations can't be
used on a global secondary index.

### Querying a Global Secondary Index

You can use the `Query` operation to access one or more items in a
global secondary index. The query must specify the name of the base table and the name of the index
that you want to use, the attributes to be returned in the query results, and any
query conditions that you want to apply. DynamoDB can return the results in ascending
or descending order.

Consider the following data returned from a `Query` that requests
gaming data for a leaderboard application.

```json

{
    "TableName": "GameScores",
    "IndexName": "GameTitleIndex",
    "KeyConditionExpression": "GameTitle = :v_title",
    "ExpressionAttributeValues": {
        ":v_title": {"S": "Meteor Blasters"}
    },
    "ProjectionExpression": "UserId, TopScore",
    "ScanIndexForward": false
}
```

In this query:

- DynamoDB accesses _GameTitleIndex_, using the
_GameTitle_ partition key to locate the index items
for Meteor Blasters. All of the index items with this key are stored
adjacent to each other for rapid retrieval.

- Within this game, DynamoDB uses the index to access all of the user IDs and
top scores for this game.

- The results are returned, sorted in descending order because the
`ScanIndexForward` parameter is set to false.

### Scanning a Global Secondary Index

You can use the `Scan` operation to retrieve all of the data from a
global secondary index. You must provide the base table name and the index name in the request. With
a `Scan`, DynamoDB reads all of the data in the index and returns it to the
application. You can also request that only some of the data be returned, and that
the remaining data should be discarded. To do this, use the
`FilterExpression` parameter of the `Scan` operation. For
more information, see [Filter expressions for scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.FilterExpression).

## Data synchronization between tables and Global Secondary Indexes

DynamoDB automatically synchronizes each global secondary index with its base table. When
an application writes or deletes items in a table, any global secondary indexes on that table are updated
asynchronously, using an eventually consistent model. Applications never write directly
to an index. However, it is important that you understand the implications of how DynamoDB
maintains these indexes.

Global secondary indexes inherit the read/write capacity mode from the base table.
For more information, see [Considerations when switching capacity modes in DynamoDB](bp-switching-capacity-modes.md).

When you create a global secondary index, you specify one or more index key attributes and their data
types. This means that whenever you write an item to the base table, the data types for
those attributes must match the index key schema's data types. In the case of
`GameTitleIndex`, the `GameTitle` partition key in the index
is defined as a `String` data type. The `TopScore` sort key in the
index is of type `Number`. If you try to add an item to the
`GameScores` table and specify a different data type for either
`GameTitle` or `TopScore`, DynamoDB returns a
`ValidationException` because of the data type mismatch.

When you put or delete items in a table, the global secondary indexes on that table
are updated in an eventually consistent fashion. Changes to the table data are
propagated to the global secondary indexes within a fraction of a second, under normal
conditions. However, in some unlikely failure scenarios, longer propagation delays might
occur. Because of this, your applications need to anticipate and handle situations where
a query on a global secondary index returns results that are not up to date.

If you write an item to a table, you don't have to specify the attributes for any
global secondary index sort key. Using `GameTitleIndex` as an example, you would not need to
specify a value for the `TopScore` attribute to write a new item to the
`GameScores` table. In this case, DynamoDB does not write any data to the
index for this particular item.

A table with many global secondary indexes incurs higher costs for write activity than
tables with fewer indexes. For more information, see [Provisioned throughput considerations for Global Secondary Indexes](#GSI.ThroughputConsiderations).

## Table classes with Global Secondary Index

A global secondary index will always use the same table class as its base table. Any
time a new global secondary index is added for a table, the new index will use the same
table class as its base table. When a table's table class is updated, all associated
global secondary indexes are updated as well.

## Provisioned throughput considerations for Global Secondary Indexes

When you create a global secondary index on a provisioned mode table, you must specify read and write
capacity units for the expected workload on that index. The provisioned throughput
settings of a global secondary index are separate from those of its base table. A `Query`
operation on a global secondary index consumes read capacity units from the index, not the base table.
When you put, update or delete items in a table, the global secondary indexes on that
table are also updated. These index updates consume write capacity units from the index,
not from the base table.

For example, if you `Query` a global secondary index and exceed its provisioned read
capacity, your request will be throttled. If you perform heavy write activity on the
table, but a global secondary index on that table has insufficient write capacity, the write activity on
the table will be throttled.

###### Important

To avoid potential throttling, the provisioned write capacity for a global
secondary index should be equal or greater than the write capacity of the base table
because new updates write to both the base table and global secondary index.

To view the provisioned throughput settings for a global secondary index, use the
`DescribeTable` operation. Detailed information about all of the table's
global secondary indexes is returned.

### Read capacity units

Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads, each of which
consume one half of a read capacity unit. This means that a single global secondary index query can
retrieve up to 2 × 4 KB = 8 KB per read capacity unit.

For global secondary index queries, DynamoDB calculates the provisioned read activity in the same way
as it does for queries against tables. The only difference is that the calculation
is based on the sizes of the index entries, rather than the size of the item in the
base table. The number of read capacity units is the sum of all projected attribute
sizes across all of the items returned. The result is then rounded up to the next
4 KB boundary. For more information about how DynamoDB calculates provisioned
throughput usage, see [DynamoDB provisioned capacity mode](provisioned-capacity-mode.md).

The maximum size of the results returned by a `Query` operation is
1 MB. This includes the sizes of all the attribute names and values
across all of the items returned.

For example, consider a global secondary index where each item contains 2,000 bytes of data. Now
suppose that you `Query` this index and that the query's
`KeyConditionExpression` matches eight items. The total size of the
matching items is 2,000 bytes × 8 items = 16,000 bytes. This result is then
rounded up to the nearest 4 KB boundary. Because global secondary index queries are eventually
consistent, the total cost is 0.5 × (16 KB / 4 KB), or 2 read capacity
units.

### Write capacity units

When an item in a table is added, updated, or deleted, and a global secondary index is affected by
this, the global secondary index consumes provisioned write capacity units for the operation. The
total provisioned throughput cost for a write consists of the sum of write capacity
units consumed by writing to the base table and those consumed by updating the
global secondary indexes. If a write to a table does not require a global secondary index update, no
write capacity is consumed from the index.

For a table write to succeed, the provisioned throughput settings for the table
and all of its global secondary indexes must have enough write capacity to
accommodate the write. Otherwise, the write to the table is throttled.

###### Important

When creating a Global Secondary Index (GSI), write operations to the base
table can be throttled if the GSI activity resulting from writes to the base
table exceeds the GSI's provisioned write capacity. This throttling affects all
write operations, from indexing process to potentially disrupting your
production workloads. For more information, see [Troubleshooting throttling in Amazon DynamoDB](troubleshootingthrottling.md).

The cost of writing an item to a global secondary index depends on several factors:

- If you write a new item to the table that defines an indexed attribute, or
you update an existing item to define a previously undefined indexed
attribute, one write operation is required to put the item into the
index.

- If an update to the table changes the value of an indexed key attribute
(from A to B), two writes are required, one to delete the previous item from
the index and another write to put the new item into the index.

- If an item was present in the index, but a write to the table caused the
indexed attribute to be deleted, one write is required to delete the old
item projection from the index.

- If an item is not present in the index before or after the item is
updated, there is no additional write cost for the index.

- If an update to the table only changes the value of projected attributes
in the index key schema, but does not change the value of any indexed key
attribute, one write is required to update the values of the projected
attributes into the index.

All of these factors assume that the size of each item in the index is less than
or equal to the 1 KB item size for calculating write capacity units. Larger
index entries require additional write capacity units. You can minimize your write
costs by considering which attributes your queries will need to return and
projecting only those attributes into the index.

## Storage considerations for Global Secondary Indexes

When an application writes an item to a table, DynamoDB automatically copies the correct
subset of attributes to any global secondary indexes in which those attributes should
appear. Your AWS account is charged for storage of the item in the base table and also
for storage of attributes in any global secondary indexes on that table.

The amount of space used by an index item is the sum of the following:

- The size in bytes of the base table primary key (partition key and sort
key)

- The size in bytes of the index key attribute

- The size in bytes of the projected attributes (if any)

- 100 bytes of overhead per index item

To estimate the storage requirements for a global secondary index, you can estimate the average size of
an item in the index and then multiply by the number of items in the base table that
have the global secondary index key attributes.

If a table contains an item where a particular attribute(s) is not defined, but that
attribute is defined as an index partition key or sort key, DynamoDB doesn't write any data
for that item to the index.
