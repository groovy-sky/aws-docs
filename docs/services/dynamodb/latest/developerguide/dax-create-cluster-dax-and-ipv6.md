# DAX and IPv6

DynamoDB DAX now supports IPv6 addressing, that allows you to create clusters that
operate in IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual-stack networking modes. This helps in enhancing
networking capabilities to meet evolving infrastructure requirements.

**Network Types:**

You can create clusters with the following network types:

- IPv4-only

- IPv6-only

- Dual-stack (supports both IPv4 and IPv6)

**Key Features:**

With IPv6 support, you can do the following:

- **Network configuration options:**

- IPv4-only and dual-stack clusters on `dual_stack
                              subnets`.

- IPv6-only clusters on IPv6-only subnets.

- **Subnet group management:**

- Create subnet groups with IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual-stack
support

- Modify existing subnet groups with additional VPC subnets

- Add IPv6-only subnets to IPv6-configured subnet groups

- Add IPv4 or dual-stack subnets to IPv4 and dual-stack configured
groups

- **Client configuration:**

- When making data plane calls, you can set preferred IP protocol for
dual\_stack clusters using:

- `ip_discovery` parameter in Python SDK

- `ipDiscovery` parameter in other SDKs

- Default: IPv4 when protocol preference not specified

Before implementing IPv6 in your DAX clusters, you must consider the following:

- Network type cannot be changed after cluster creation

- For dual-stack clusters, the `ip_discovery/ipDiscovery` parameter
in the client configuration determines which IP protocol to use (IPv4 or
IPv6)

- Different applications can connect to the same dual-stack cluster using
different IP protocols based on their configuration

###### Example client configuration

```

DynamoDbAsyncClient client = ClusterDaxAsyncClient.builder()
        .overrideConfiguration(Configuration.builder()
            .url(endpoint)             // DAX cluster endpoint
            .ipDiscovery(ipDiscovery)       // IP discovery type (IPv4 or IPv6)
            .build())
        .build();
```

###### Important

When you use resource-based IAM policies to restrict IP addresses for DynamoDB tables
in IPv6-only environments with DAX, you must create an exception for your DAX
cluster's IAM role if you block the IPv4 address space
( `0.0.0.0/0`). Add an `ArnNotEquals` condition to your policy
that specifically allows access for the DAX cluster's IAM role while
maintaining IP-based restrictions for other access paths. Without this exception,
DAX cannot access your DynamoDB table.

For example:

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "dynamodb:PutItem",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnNotEquals": {
          "aws:PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DAXServiceRoleForDynamoDBAccess"
        },
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "0.0.0.0/0"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
