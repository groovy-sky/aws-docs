# In-memory acceleration with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

Amazon DynamoDB is designed for scale and performance. In most cases, the DynamoDB response times
can be measured in single-digit milliseconds. However, there are certain use cases that
require response times in microseconds. For these use cases, DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) delivers fast
response times for accessing eventually consistent data.

DAX is a DynamoDB-compatible caching service that enables you to benefit from fast
in-memory performance for demanding applications. DAX addresses three core
scenarios:

1. As an in-memory cache, DAX reduces the response times of eventually consistent
    read workloads by an order of magnitude from single-digit milliseconds to
    microseconds.

2. DAX reduces operational and application complexity by providing a managed
    service that is API-compatible with DynamoDB. Therefore, it requires only minimal
    functional changes to use with an existing application.

3. For read-heavy or bursty workloads, DAX provides increased throughput and
    potential operational cost savings by reducing the need to overprovision read
    capacity units. This is especially beneficial for applications that require repeated
    reads for individual keys.

DAX supports server-side encryption. With encryption at rest, the data persisted by
DAX on disk will be encrypted. DAX writes data to disk as part of propagating changes
from the primary node to read replicas. For more information, see [DAX encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAXEncryptionAtRest.html).

DAX also supports encryption in transit, ensuring that all requests and responses
between your application and the cluster are encrypted by transport level security (TLS),
and connections to the cluster can be authenticated by verification of a cluster x509
certificate. For more information, see [DAX encryption in transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAXEncryptionInTransit.html).

## Use cases for DAX

DAX provides access to eventually consistent data from DynamoDB tables, with
microsecond latency. A Multi-AZ DAX cluster can serve millions of requests per
second.

DAX is ideal for the following types of applications:

- Applications that require the fastest possible response time for reads. Some
examples include real-time bidding, social gaming, and trading applications.
DAX delivers fast, in-memory read performance for these use cases.

- Applications that read a small number of items more frequently than others.
For example, consider an ecommerce system that has a one-day sale on a popular
product. During the sale, demand for that product (and its data in DynamoDB) would
sharply increase, compared to all of the other products. To mitigate the impacts
of a "hot" key and a non-uniform traffic distribution, you could offload the
read activity to a DAX cache until the one-day sale is over.

- Applications that are read-intensive, but are also cost-sensitive. With DynamoDB,
you provision the number of reads per second that your application requires. If
read activity increases, you can increase your tables' provisioned read
throughput (at an additional cost). Or, you can offload the activity from your
application to a DAX cluster, and reduce the number of read capacity units
that you need to purchase otherwise.

- Applications that require repeated reads against a large set of data. Such an
application could potentially divert database resources from other applications.
For example, a long-running analysis of regional weather data could temporarily
consume all the read capacity in a DynamoDB table. This situation would negatively
impact other applications that need to access the same data. With DAX, the
weather analysis could be performed against cached data instead.

DAX is _not_ ideal for the following types of
applications:

- Applications that require strongly consistent reads (or that cannot tolerate
eventually consistent reads).

- Applications that do not require microsecond response times for reads, or that
do not need to offload repeated read activity from underlying tables.

- Applications that are write-intensive. High volume of writes lead to increased replication across DAX nodes in a cluster. This causes an increased consumption of resources and risk of availability issues.

- Applications without many repeated reads. DAX performs best when cache hit rates exceed 90%. Lower cache hit rates increase cache misses, which consumes more resources across the DAX cluster.

## DAX usage notes

- For a list of AWS Regions where DAX is available, see [Amazon DynamoDB pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing).

- DAX supports applications written in Go, Java, Node.js, Python, and .NET,
using AWS-provided clients for those programming languages.

- DAX is only available for the EC2-VPC platform.

- The DAX cluster service role policy must allow the
`dynamodb:DescribeTable` action in order to maintain metadata
about the DynamoDB table.

- DAX clusters maintain metadata about the attribute names of items they
store. That metadata is maintained indefinitely (even after the item has expired
or been evicted from the cache). Applications that use an unbounded number of
attribute names can, over time, cause memory exhaustion in the DAX cluster.
This limitation applies only to top-level attribute names, not nested attribute
names. Examples of problematic top-level attribute names include timestamps,
UUIDs, and session IDs.

This limitation applies only to attribute names, not their values. Items like
the following are not a problem.

```json

{
      "Id": 123,
      "Title": "Bicycle 123",
      "CreationDate": "2017-10-24T01:02:03+00:00"
}
```

But items like the following are a problem if there are enough of them and
they each have a different timestamp.

```json

{
      "Id": 123,
      "Title": "Bicycle 123",
      "2017-10-24T01:02:03+00:00": "created"
}
```
