# Best practices using DynamoDB Streams with Lambda

An AWS Lambda function runs within a _container_—an execution
environment that is isolated from other functions. When you run a function for the first
time, AWS Lambda creates a new container and begins executing the function's code.

A Lambda function has a _handler_ that is run once per invocation.
The handler contains the main business logic for the function. For example, the Lambda
function shown in [Step 4: Create and test a Lambda function](streams-lambda-tutorial.md#Streams.Lambda.Tutorial.LambdaFunction) has a handler that can
process records in a DynamoDB stream.

You can also provide initialization code that runs one time only—after the
container is created, but before AWS Lambda runs the handler for the first time. The
Lambda function shown in [Step 4: Create and test a Lambda function](streams-lambda-tutorial.md#Streams.Lambda.Tutorial.LambdaFunction) has initialization code
that imports the SDK for JavaScript in Node.js, and creates a client for Amazon SNS. These objects should only be
defined once, outside of the handler.

After the function runs, AWS Lambda might opt to reuse the container for subsequent
invocations of the function. In this case, your function handler might be able to reuse
the resources that you defined in your initialization code. (You cannot control how long
AWS Lambda will retain the container, or whether the container will be reused at
all.)

For DynamoDB triggers using AWS Lambda, we recommend the following:

- AWS service clients should be instantiated in the initialization code, not
in the handler. This allows AWS Lambda to reuse existing connections, for the
duration of the container's lifetime.

- In general, you do not need to explicitly manage connections or implement
connection pooling because AWS Lambda manages this for you.

A Lambda consumer for a DynamoDB stream doesn't guarantee exactly once delivery and may lead to occasional duplicates. Make sure your Lambda function code is idempotent to prevent unexpected issues from arising because of duplicate processing.
