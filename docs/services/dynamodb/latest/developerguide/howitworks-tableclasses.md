# DynamoDB table classes

DynamoDB offers two table classes designed to help you optimize for cost. The DynamoDB
Standard table class is the default, and is recommended for the vast majority of
workloads. The DynamoDB Standard-Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA) table class is
optimized for tables where storage is the dominant cost. For example, tables that store
infrequently accessed data, such as application logs, old social media posts, e-commerce
order history, and past gaming achievements, are good candidates for the Standard-IA
table class. See [Amazon DynamoDB Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand) for pricing details.

Every DynamoDB table is associated with a table class (DynamoDB Standard by default). All
secondary indexes associated with the table use the same table class. Each table class
offers different pricing for data storage as well as for read and write requests. You
can select the most cost-effective table class for your table based on its storage and
throughput usage patterns.

The choice of a table class is not permanent—you can change this setting using
the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. DynamoDB also supports managing your table class
using AWS CloudFormation for single-Region tables and global
tables. To learn more about selecting your table class, see [Considerations when choosing a table class in DynamoDB](workingwithtables-tableclasses.md).
