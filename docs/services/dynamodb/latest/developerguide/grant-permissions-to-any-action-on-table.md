# IAM policy to grant permissions to all DynamoDB actions on a table

The following policy grants permissions for _all_ DynamoDB actions
on a table called `Books`. The resource ARN specified in the
`Resource` identifies a table in a specific AWS Region. If you
replace the table name `Books` in the `Resource`
ARN with a wildcard character (\*), _all_ DynamoDB actions are
allowed on _all_ tables in the account. Carefully consider the
possible security implications before using a wildcard character on this or any
IAM policy.

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllAPIActionsOnBooks",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "dynamodb:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Note

This is an example of using a wildcard character (\*) to allow
_all_ actions, including administration, data operations,
monitoring, and purchase of DynamoDB reserved capacity. Instead, it is a best
practice to explicitly specify each action to be granted and only what that
user, role, or group needs.
