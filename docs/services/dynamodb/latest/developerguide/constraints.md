# Constraints in Amazon DynamoDB

This section describes current constraints, formerly referred to as limits, within Amazon DynamoDB.

###### Note

All size measurements in DynamoDB use binary-based units. DynamoDB denotes 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1024 KB, 1 GB = 1024 MB, 1 TB = 1024 GB.

## Read/write capacity mode

You can switch tables from provisioned capacity mode to on-demand mode up to four times in a 24-hour rolling window.
You can switch tables from on-demand mode to provisioned capacity mode at any time.

For more information about switching between read and write capacity modes, see [Considerations when switching capacity modes in DynamoDB](bp-switching-capacity-modes.md).

### Capacity unit sizes (for provisioned tables)

One read capacity unit = one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually
consistent reads per second, for items up to 4 KB in size.

One write capacity unit = one write per second, for items up to 1 KB in
size.

Transactional read requests require two read capacity units to perform one read per second
for items up to 4 KB.

Transactional write requests require two write capacity units to perform one write per
second for items up to 1 KB.

### Request unit sizes (for on-demand tables)

One read request unit = one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually
consistent reads per second, for items up to 4 KB in size.

One write request unit = one write per second, for items up to 1 KB in size.

Transactional read requests require two read request units to perform one read per second
for items up to 4 KB.

Transactional write requests require two write request units to perform one write per
second for items up to 1 KB.

## Secondary indexes

### Projected Secondary Index attributes per table

You can project a total of up to 100 attributes into all of a table's local and global
secondary indexes. This only applies to user-specified projected attributes.

In a `CreateTable` operation, if you specify a `ProjectionType` of
`INCLUDE`, the total count of attributes specified in `NonKeyAttributes`,
summed across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
you project the same attribute name into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct
attributes when determining the total.

This limit does not apply for secondary indexes with a `ProjectionType` of
`KEYS_ONLY` or `ALL`.

## Partition keys and sort keys

### Partition key length

The minimum length of a partition key value is 1 byte. The maximum length is
2048 bytes.

### Partition key values

There is no practical limit on the number of distinct partition key values, for
tables or for secondary indexes.

### Sort key length

The minimum length of a sort key value is 1 byte. The maximum length is
1024 bytes.

### Sort key values

In general, there is no practical limit on the number of distinct sort key values
per partition key value.

The exception is for tables with secondary indexes. An item collection is the set
of items which have the same value of partition key attribute. In a global secondary index the item
collection is independent of the base table (and can have a different partition key
attribute), but in a local secondary index the indexed view is colocated in the same partition as
the item in the table and shares the same partition key attribute. As a result of
this locality, when a table has one or more LSIs, the item collection cannot be
distributed to multiple partitions.

For a table with one or more LSIs, item collections cannot exceed 10GB in size.
This includes all base table items and all projected LSI views which have the same
value of the partition key attribute. 10GB is the maximum size of a partition. For
more detailed information, see [Item collection size limit](lsi.md#LSI.ItemCollections.SizeLimit).

## Naming rules

### Table names and Secondary Index names

Names for tables and secondary indexes must be at least 3 characters long, but no
greater than 255 characters long. The following are the allowed characters:

- `A-Z`

- `a-z`

- `0-9`

- `_` (underscore)

- `-` (hyphen)

- `.` (dot)

### Attribute names

In general, an attribute name must be at least one character long, but no greater
than 64 KB long.

The following are the exceptions. These attribute names must be no greater than
255 characters long:

- Secondary index partition key names.

- Secondary index sort key names.

- The names of any user-specified projected attributes (applicable only to
local secondary indexes). In a `CreateTable` operation, if you specify a
`ProjectionType` of `INCLUDE`, the names of the
attributes in the `NonKeyAttributes` parameter are
length-restricted. The `KEYS_ONLY` and `ALL`
projection types are not affected.

These attribute names must be encoded using UTF-8, and the total size of each name
(after encoding) cannot exceed 255 bytes.

## Data types

### String

The length of a String is constrained by the maximum item size of
400 KB.

Strings are Unicode with UTF-8 binary encoding. Because UTF-8 is a variable width
encoding, DynamoDB determines the length of a String using its UTF-8 bytes.

### Number

A Number can have up to 38 digits of precision, and can be positive, negative, or
zero.

- Positive range: `1E-130` to
`9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999E+125`

- Negative range: `-9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999E+125`
to `-1E-130`

DynamoDB uses JSON strings to represent Number data in requests and replies. For more
information, see [DynamoDB low-level API](programming-lowlevelapi.md).

If number precision is important, you should pass numbers to DynamoDB using strings
that you convert from a number type.

### Binary

The length of a Binary is constrained by the maximum item size of
400 KB.

Applications that work with Binary attributes must encode the data in base64
format before sending it to DynamoDB. Upon receipt of the data, DynamoDB decodes it into
an unsigned byte array and uses that as the length of the attribute.

## Items

### Item size

The maximum item size in DynamoDB is 400 KB, which includes both attribute
name binary length (UTF-8 length) and attribute value lengths (again binary length).
The attribute name counts towards the size limit.

For example, consider an item with two attributes: one attribute named
"shirt-color" with value "R" and another attribute named "shirt-size" with value
"M". The total size of that item is 23 bytes.

### Item size for tables with Local Secondary Indexes

For each local secondary index on a table, there is a 400 KB limit on the total of the
following:

- The size of an item's data in the table.

- The size of corresponding entries (including key values and projected
attributes) in all local secondary indexes.

## Attributes

### Attribute name-value pairs per item

The cumulative size of attributes per item must fit within the maximum DynamoDB item
size (400 KB).

### Number of values in list, map, or set

There is no limit on the number of values in a List, a Map, or a Set, as long as
the item containing the values fits within the 400 KB item size
limit.

### Attribute values

Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed, if the attribute is not used
as a key attribute for a table or index. Empty String and Binary values are allowed
inside Set, List, and Map types. An attribute value cannot be an an empty Set
(String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set). However, empty Lists and Maps are
allowed.

### Nested attribute depth

DynamoDB supports nested attributes up to 32 levels
deep.

## Expression parameters

Expression parameters include `ProjectionExpression`,
`ConditionExpression`, `UpdateExpression`, and
`FilterExpression`.

### Lengths

The maximum length of any expression string is 4 KB. For example, the size of the
`ConditionExpression` `a=b` is 3 bytes.

The maximum length of any single expression attribute name or expression attribute
value is 255 bytes. For example, `#name` is 5 bytes; `:val` is
4 bytes.

The maximum length of all substitution variables in an expression is 2 MB. This is
the sum of the lengths of all `ExpressionAttributeNames` and
`ExpressionAttributeValues`.

### Operators and operands

The maximum number of operators or functions allowed in an
`UpdateExpression` is 300. For example, the
_UpdateExpression_ `SET a = :val1 + :val2 + :val3` contains two " `+`"
operators.

The maximum number of operands for the `IN` comparator is 100.

### Reserved words

DynamoDB does not prevent you from using names that conflict with reserved words.
(For a complete list, see [Reserved words in DynamoDB](reservedwords.md).)

However, if you use a reserved word in an expression parameter, you must also
specify `ExpressionAttributeNames`. For more information, see [Expression attribute names (aliases) in DynamoDB](expressions-expressionattributenames.md).

## DynamoDB transactions

DynamoDB transactional API operations have the following constraints:

- A transaction cannot contain more than 100 unique items.

- A transaction cannot contain more than 4 MB of data.

- No two actions in a transaction can work against the same item in the same
table. For example, you cannot both `ConditionCheck` and
`Update` the same item in one transaction.

- A transaction cannot operate on tables in more than one AWS account or
Region.

- Transactional operations provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and
durability (ACID) guarantees only within the AWS Region where the write is
made originally. Transactions are not supported across Regions in global tables.
For example, suppose that you have a global table with replicas in the US East
(Ohio) and US West (Oregon) Regions and you perform a
`TransactWriteItems` operation in the US East (N. Virginia)
Region. In this case, you might observe partially completed transactions in the
US West (Oregon) Region as changes are replicated. Changes are replicated to
other Regions only after they have been committed in the source Region.

## DynamoDB Streams

### Simultaneous readers of a shard in DynamoDB Streams

For single-Region tables that are not global tables, you can design for up
to two processes to read from the same DynamoDB Streams shard at the same time. Exceeding this limit can
result in request throttling. For global tables, we recommend you limit the number of
simultaneous readers to one to avoid request throttling.

## DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

### AWS Region availability

For a list of AWS Regions in which DAX is available, see [DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#ddb_dax_region) in the
_AWS General Reference_.

### Nodes

A DAX cluster consists of exactly one primary node, and between zero and ten
read replica nodes.

The total number of nodes (per AWS account) cannot exceed 50 in a single AWS
Region.

### Parameter groups

You can create up to 20 DAX parameter groups per Region.

### Subnet groups

You can create up to 50 DAX subnet groups per Region.

Within a subnet group, you can define up to 20 subnets.

###### Important

A DAX cluster supports a maximum of 500 DynamoDB tables. Once you go beyond 500 DynamoDB tables, your cluster
may experience degradation in availability and performance.

## API-specific constraints

**`CreateTable`/ `UpdateTable`/ `DeleteTable`/ `PutResourcePolicy`/ `DeleteResourcePolicy`**

In general, you can have up to
500 [CreateTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-createtable.md), [UpdateTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updatetable.md), [DeleteTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-deletetable.md), [PutResourcePolicy](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-putresourcepolicy.md), and [DeleteResourcePolicy](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-deleteresourcepolicy.md) requests running simultaneously in any
combination. As a result, the total number of tables in the
`CREATING`, `UPDATING`, or `DELETING`
state cannot exceed 500.

You can submit up to 2,500 requests per second of mutable
( `CreateTable`, `DeleteTable`,
`UpdateTable`, `PutResourcePolicy`, and
`DeleteResourcePolicy`) control plane API requests across a
group of tables. However, the `PutResourcePolicy` and
`DeleteResourcePolicy` requests have lower individual limits.
For more information, see the following quotas details for
`PutResourcePolicy` and
`DeleteResourcePolicy`.

`CreateTable` and `PutResourcePolicy` requests which
include a resource-based policy will count as two additional requests for
each KB of the policy. For example, a `CreateTable` or
`PutResourcePolicy` request with a policy of size 5 KB will
count as 11 requests. 1 for the `CreateTable` request and 10 for
the resource-based policy (2 x 5 KB). Similarly, a policy of size 20 KB will
count as 41 requests. 1 for the `CreateTable` request and and 40
for the resource-based policy (2 x 20 KB).

`PutResourcePolicy`

You can submit up to 25 `PutResourcePolicy` API
requests per second across a group of tables. After a successful
request for an individual table, no new
`PutResourcePolicy` requests are supported for
the following 15 seconds.

The maximum size supported for a resource-based policy document is 20 KB. DynamoDB counts whitespaces when calculating the size of a policy against this limit.

`DeleteResourcePolicy`

You can submit up to 50 `DeleteResourcePolicy` API
requests per second across a group of tables. After a successful
`PutResourcePolicy` request for an individual
table, no `DeleteResourcePolicy` requests are
supported for the following 15 seconds.

**`BatchGetItem`**

A single `BatchGetItem` operation can retrieve a maximum of
100 items. The total size of all the items
retrieved cannot exceed 16 MB.

**`BatchWriteItem`**

A single `BatchWriteItem` operation can contain up to
25 `PutItem` or
`DeleteItem` requests. The total size of all the items
written cannot exceed 16 MB.

**`DescribeStream`**

You can call `DescribeStream` at a maximum rate of 10 times per
second.

**`DescribeTableReplicaAutoScaling`**

`DescribeTableReplicaAutoScaling` method supports only 10
requests per second.

**`DescribeLimits`**

`DescribeLimits` should be called only periodically. You can
expect throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.

**`DescribeContributorInsights`/ `ListContributorInsights`/ `UpdateContributorInsights`**

`DescribeContributorInsights`,
`ListContributorInsights` and
`UpdateContributorInsights` should be called only
periodically. DynamoDB supports up to five requests per second for each of
these APIs.

**`DescribeTable`/ `ListTables`/ `GetResourcePolicy`**

You can submit up to 2,500 requests per second of a combination of
read-only ( `DescribeTable`, `ListTables`, and
`GetResourcePolicy`) control plane API requests. The
`GetResourcePolicy` API has a lower individual limit of 100
requests per second.

**`DescribeTimeToLive`**

The `DescribeTimeToLive` operation is throttled at 10 read
request units per second. If you exceed this limit, DynamoDB returns a
`ThrottlingException` error.

**`Query`**

The result set from a `Query` is limited to 1 MB
per call. You can use the `LastEvaluatedKey` from the query
response to retrieve more results.

**`Scan`**

The result set from a `Scan` is limited to 1 MB
per call. You can use the `LastEvaluatedKey` from the scan
response to retrieve more results.

**`UpdateKinesisStreamingDestination`**

When performing `UpdateKinesisStreamingDestination` operations,
you can set `ApproximateCreationDateTimePrecision` to a new value
a maximum of 3 times in a 24 hour period.

**`UpdateTableReplicaAutoScaling`**

`UpdateTableReplicaAutoScaling` method supports only ten
requests per second.

**`UpdateTableTimeToLive`**

The `UpdateTableTimeToLive` method supports only one request to
enable or disable `Time to Live (TTL)` per specified table per
hour. This change can take up to one hour to fully process. Any additional
`UpdateTimeToLive` calls for the same table during this one
hour duration result in a ValidationException.

## DynamoDB encryption at rest

You can switch between an AWS owned key, an AWS managed key, and a customer managed key up
to four times, anytime per 24-hour window, on a per table basis, starting from when the
table was created. If there was no change in the past six hours, an additional change is
allowed. This effectively brings the maximum number of changes in a day to eight (four
changes in the first six hours, and one change for each of the subsequent six hour
windows in a day).

You can switch encryption keys to use an AWS owned key as often as necessary, even
if the above quota has been exhausted.

These are the quotas unless you request a higher amount. To request a service quota
increase, see [https://aws.amazon.com/support](https://aws.amazon.com/support).
