# Global tables - multi-active, multi-Region replication

_Amazon DynamoDB global tables_ is a fully managed,
multi-Region, and multi-active database feature that provides easy to use data replication
and fast local read and write performance for globally scaled applications.

Global tables automatically replicate your DynamoDB table data across AWS Regions and optionally across AWS accounts without
requiring you to build and maintain your own replication solution. Global tables are ideal for applications
requiring business continuity and high availability through multi-Region deployment. Any global table replica
can serve reads and writes. Applications can achieve high resilience with a low or zero Recovery Point Objective
(RPO) by shifting traffic to a different Region if application processing is interrupted in
a Region. Global tables are available in all Regions where DynamoDB is available.

## Consistency modes

When you create a global table, you can configure its consistency mode. Global tables
support two consistency modes: multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC) and multi-Region
strong consistency (MRSC).

If you do not specify a consistency mode when creating a global table, the global
table defaults to multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC). A global table cannot
contain replicas configured with different consistency modes. You cannot change a global
table's consistency mode after creation.

## Account configurations

DynamoDB now supports two global tables models, each designed for different architectural patterns:

- **Same-account global tables** – All replicas are created and managed
within a single AWS account.

- **Multi-account global tables** – Replicas are deployed across multiple AWS accounts
while participating in a shared replication group.

Both same-account and multi-account models support multi-Region writes, asynchronous replication, last-writer-wins conflict resolution, and the same billing model. However, they differ in how accounts, permissions, encryption, and table governance are managed.

Global tables configured for MRSC only support same-account configurations.

You can configure a global table using the AWS Management Console. Global tables use
existing DynamoDB APIs to read and write data to your tables, so no application changes are
required. You pay only for the resources you provision or use, with no upfront costs or
commitments.
