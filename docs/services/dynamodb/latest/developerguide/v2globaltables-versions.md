# DynamoDB global tables versions

There are two versions of DynamoDB global tables available: Global Tables version 2019.11.21
(Current) and Global tables version 2017.11.29 (Legacy). We recommend using Global Tables
version 2019.11.21 (Current), as it is easier to use, supported in more Regions, and lower
cost for most workloads compared to version 2017.11.29 (Legacy).

## Determining the version of a global table

### Determining the version using the AWS CLI

#### Identifying a version 2019.11.21 (Current) global table replica

To determine if a table is a global tables version 2019.11.21 (Current)
replica, invoke the `describe-table` command for the table. If the
output contains the `GlobalTableVersion` attribute with a value of
"2019.11.21", the table is a version 2019.11.21 (Current) global table
replica.

An example CLI command for `describe-table`:

```

aws dynamodb describe-table \
--table-name users \
--region us-east-2
```

The (abridged) output contains the `GlobalTableVersion` attribute
with a value of "2019.11.21", so this table is a version 2019.11.21 (Current)
global table replica.

```json

{
    "Table": {
        "AttributeDefinitions": [
            {
                "AttributeName": "id",
                "AttributeType": "S"
            },
            {
                "AttributeName": "name",
                "AttributeType": "S"
            }
        ],
        "TableName": "users",
        ...
        "GlobalTableVersion": "2019.11.21",
        "Replicas": [
            {
                "RegionName": "us-west-2",
                "ReplicaStatus": "ACTIVE",
            }
        ],
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Identifying a version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) global table replica

Global tables version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) uses a dedicated set of commands for
global table management. To determine if a table is a global tables version
2017.11.29 (Legacy) replica, invoke the `describe-global-table`
command for the table. If you receive a successful response, the table is a
version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) global table replica. If the
`describe-global-table` command returns a
`GlobalTableNotFoundException` error, the table is not a version
2017.11.29 (Legacy) replica.

An example CLI command for `describe-global-table`:

```

aws dynamodb describe-global-table \
--table-name users \
--region us-east-2
```

The command returns a successful response, so this table is a version
2017.11.29 (Legacy) global table replica.

```json

{
    "GlobalTableDescription": {
        "ReplicationGroup": [
            {
                "RegionName": "us-west-2"
            },
            {
                "RegionName": "us-east-2"
            }
        ],
        "GlobalTableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb::123456789012:global-table/users",
        "CreationDateTime": "2025-06-10T13:55:53.630000-04:00",
        "GlobalTableStatus": "ACTIVE",
        "GlobalTableName": "users"
    }
}
```

### Determining the version using the DynamoDB Console

To identify the version of a global table replica, perform the following:

1. Open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home).

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose
    **Tables**.

3. Choose the table you want to identify the global tables version
    for.

4. Choose the **Global Tables** tab.

The _Summary_ section displays the
    version of global tables in use.

## Differences in behavior between Legacy and Current versions

The following list describes the differences in behavior between the Legacy and
Current versions of global tables.

- version 2019.11.21 (Current) consumes less write capacity for several DynamoDB
operations compared to version 2017.11.29 (Legacy), and therefore, is more
cost-effective for most customers. The differences for these DynamoDB operations
are as follows:

- Invoking [PutItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-putitem.md) for a 1KB item in a Region and replicating to other
Regions requires 2 rWRUs per region for 2017.11.29 (Legacy), but only 1
rWRU for 2019.11.21 (Current).

- Invoking [UpdateItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updateitem.md) for a 1KB item requires 2 rWRUs in the source
Region and 1 rWRU per destination Region for 2017.11.29 (Legacy), but
only 1 rWRU for both source and destination Regions for 2019.11.21
(Current).

- Invoking [DeleteItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-deleteitem.md) for a 1KB item requires 1 rWRU in the source
Region and 2 rWRUs per destination Region for 2017.11.29 (Legacy), but
only 1 rWRU for both source or destination Region for 2019.11.21
(Current).

The following table shows the rWRU consumption of 2017.11.29 (Legacy) and
2019.11.21 (Current) tables for a 1KB item in two Regions.

Operation2017.11.29 (Legacy)2019.11.21 (Current)Savings[PutItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-putitem.md)4 rWRUs2 rWRUs50%[UpdateItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updateitem.md)3 rWRUs2 rWRUs33%[DeleteItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-deleteitem.md)3 rWRUs2 rWRUs33%

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) is available in only 11 AWS Regions. However,
version 2019.11.21 (Current) is available in all the AWS Regions.

- You create version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) global tables by first creating a set
of empty Regional tables, then invoking the [CreateGlobalTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-createglobaltable.md) API to form the global table. You create version
2019.11.21 (Current) global tables by invoking the [UpdateTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updatetable.md) API to add a replica to an existing Regional
table.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) requires you to empty all replicas in the table
before adding a replica in a new Region (including during creation). version
2019.11.21 (Current) supports you to add and remove replicas to Regions on a
table that already contains data.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) uses the following dedicated set of control plane
APIs for managing replicas:

- [CreateGlobalTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-createglobaltable.md)

- [DescribeGlobalTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-describeglobaltable.md)

- [DescribeGlobalTableSettings](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-describeglobaltablesettings.md)

- [ListGlobalTables](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-listglobaltables.md)

- [UpdateGlobalTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updateglobaltable.md)

- [UpdateGlobalTableSettings](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updateglobaltablesettings.md)

version 2019.11.21 (Current) uses the [DescribeTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-describetable.md) and [UpdateTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updatetable.md) APIs to manage replicas.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) publishes two DynamoDB Streams records for each write. version
2019.11.21 (Current) only publishes one DynamoDB Streams record for each write.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) populates and updates the
`aws:rep:deleting`, `aws:rep:updateregion`, and
`aws:rep:updatetime` attributes. version 2019.11.21 (Current)
does not populate or update these attributes.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) does not synchronize [Using time to live (TTL) in DynamoDB](ttl.md) settings across replicas. version 2019.11.21 (Current)
synchronizes TTL settings across replicas.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) does not replicate TTL deletes to other replicas.
version 2019.11.21 (Current) replicates TTL deletes to all replicas.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) does not synchronize [auto scaling](autoscaling.md) settings across replicas. version 2019.11.21 (Current)
synchronizes auto scaling settings across replicas.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) does not synchronize [global\
secondary index (GSI)](gsi.md) settings across replicas. version 2019.11.21
(Current) synchronizes GSI settings across replicas.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) does not synchronize [encryption at rest](encryption-usagenotes.md) settings across
replicas. version 2019.11.21 (Current) synchronizes encryption at rest settings
across replicas.

- version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) publishes the `PendingReplicationCount`
metric. version 2019.11.21 (Current) does not publish this metric.

## Upgrading to the current version

### Required permissions for global tables upgrade

To upgrade to version 2019.11.21 (Current), you must have
`dynamodb:UpdateGlobalTableversion` permissions in all Regions with
replicas. These permissions are required in addition to the permissions needed for
accessing the DynamoDB console and viewing tables.

The following IAM policy grants permissions to upgrade any global table to
version 2019.11.21 (Current).

```json

{
    "version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "dynamodb:UpdateGlobalTableversion",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The following IAM policy grants permissions to upgrade only the
`Music` global table with replicas in two Regions to version
2019.11.21 (Current).

```json

{
    "version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "dynamodb:UpdateGlobalTableversion",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb::123456789012:global-table/Music",
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:ap-southeast-1:123456789012:table/Music",
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:123456789012:table/Music"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### What to expect during the upgrade

- All global table replicas will continue to process read and write traffic
while upgrading.

- The upgrade process requires between a few minutes to several hours
depending on the table size and number of replicas.

- During the upgrade process, the value of [TableStatus](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-tabledescription.md#DDB-Type-TableDescription-TableStatus) will change from `ACTIVE` to
`UPDATING`. You can view the status of the table by invoking
the [DescribeTable](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-describetable.md) API, or with the **Tables** view
in the DynamoDB console.

- Auto scaling will not adjust the provisioned capacity settings for a
global table while the table is being upgraded. We strongly recommend that
you set the table to [on-demand](capacity-mode.md#capacity-mode-on-demand) capacity mode during the upgrade.

- If you choose to use [provisioned](provisioned-capacity-mode.md) capacity mode with auto scaling during the upgrade,
you must increase the minimum read and write throughput on your policies to
accommodate any expected increases in traffic to avoid throttling during the
upgrade.

- The `ReplicationLatency` metric can temporarily report latency
spikes or stop reporting metric data during the upgrade process. See, [ReplicationLatency](metrics-dimensions.md#ReplicationLatency), for more information.

- When the upgrade process is complete, your table status will change to
`ACTIVE`.
