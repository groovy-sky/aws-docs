# Tutorial: Your first vector search
<a name="VectorSearchTutorial"></a>

Imagine a product catalog where shoppers describe what they want in their own words instead of matching exact keywords. You can store a vector embedding of each product description in DynamoDB and then query a vector index to find the closest matches.

This tutorial creates a table with a vector index, generates 1024-dimension embeddings with Amazon Bedrock Titan Text Embeddings V2, loads 50 products, and runs a similarity search that returns the 5 closest matches. Every command can be pasted directly into a terminal. For background on how embeddings work with DynamoDB, see [Generating vector embeddings](VectorSearchWorkingWith.md#VectorSearchWorkingWith.Embeddings).

**About scale and recall**
A production vector index holds millions to billions of vectors. Vector indexes use approximate nearest neighbor search, and the recall characteristics of that approach become observable only at much larger scale. Treat the 50-item catalog here as a demonstration of the mechanics. For guidance on sizing and tuning, see [Best practices for vector indexes](VectorSearchBestPractices.md).

## Prerequisites
<a name="VectorSearchTutorial.Prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
+ AWS CLI version 2.36.16 or later. Vector index support was added to the AWS CLI and the AWS SDKs in the service model update released on August 4, 2026. Earlier versions do not recognize the `--vector-indexes` parameter or the `search-vectors` command. Check your version with `aws --version` and upgrade if needed. If you use an AWS SDK instead of the AWS CLI, you need `botocore` 1.43.64 or later, or the equivalent release of your language SDK.
+ Credentials with permissions for the DynamoDB actions `CreateTable`, `DescribeTable`, `PutItem`, `BatchWriteItem`, `Scan`, `SearchVectors`, `UpdateTable`, and `DeleteTable`, and for the Amazon Bedrock action `InvokeModel`. `dynamodb:SearchVectors` is a new action, so existing policies that grant DynamoDB read access do not include it.
+ Access to the Titan Text Embeddings V2 model enabled in Amazon Bedrock for your account and Region. Amazon Bedrock model access is granted per account and per Region, so you must enable the model before you can call it.
+ `jq` installed for reshaping the model output into DynamoDB format.
+ A Region where Amazon Bedrock Titan Text Embeddings V2 is available. Vector indexes are available in all commercial AWS Regions, so Amazon Bedrock model availability is the constraint on your Region choice. For Amazon Bedrock model availability, see [Model support by AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-regions.html) in the *Amazon Bedrock User Guide*.

**Charges**
This tutorial incurs charges for Amazon Bedrock model invocations and DynamoDB storage. It makes 51 embedding calls, each billed as a Amazon Bedrock inference request, on short single-sentence inputs. DynamoDB storage charges apply for as long as the table and vector index exist.

**Confirm which Region you are using**
Every command in this tutorial must run in the same Region. Confirm the Region that the AWS CLI will actually use before you start, because `AWS_REGION` takes precedence over `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and both take precedence over the `region` setting in your AWS CLI configuration file. A stray `AWS_REGION` value in your shell creates the table somewhere other than the Region you intended, and the Amazon Bedrock model might not be enabled there. To remove all doubt, pass `--region {{region}}` explicitly on each command.

**`SearchVectors` uses a separate endpoint**
`SearchVectors` resolves to a dedicated search endpoint rather than the standard DynamoDB endpoint. In a commercial Region, requests go to `search-dynamodb.{{region}}.amazonaws.com`, while every other operation in this tutorial goes to `dynamodb.{{region}}.amazonaws.com`. FIPS and dual-stack variants follow the same pattern. This has two consequences:
If your network restricts outbound traffic through a VPC endpoint, proxy, or egress allowlist, you must permit the search hostname as well. Otherwise `CreateTable` and the write operations succeed and only `SearchVectors` fails, typically with a connection error that does not indicate the cause.
Do not use `--endpoint-url` to override the DynamoDB endpoint for these commands. A single override cannot serve both hostnames and will break search routing.

1. **Create a table with a vector index.** This creates a `Products` table with a vector index named `DescriptionIndex` on the `DescriptionVector` attribute. The index uses the `COSINE` distance function with 1024 dimensions to match the Titan Text Embeddings V2 output. Because no vector index partition key is defined, you do not need a `SearchConditionExpression` to search.

   ```
   aws dynamodb create-table \
       --table-name Products \
       --attribute-definitions AttributeName=ProductId,AttributeType=S \
       --key-schema AttributeName=ProductId,KeyType=HASH \
       --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
       --vector-indexes \
           "[
               {
                   \"IndexName\": \"DescriptionIndex\",
                   \"VectorAttribute\": {\"AttributeName\": \"DescriptionVector\"},
                   \"Projection\": {\"ProjectionType\": \"ALL\"},
                   \"Dimensions\": 1024,
                   \"DistanceFunction\": \"COSINE\"
               }
           ]"
   ```

   This example uses `ProjectionType` of `ALL` so that every attribute is available to the search results. If you use `INCLUDE` instead, note that the projected non-key attribute budget is shared: the vector attribute counts as one attribute, and each `INLINE_FILTER` search schema element counts as one. `HASH` search schema elements do not count toward the limit.

1. **Wait for the index to become active.** Run this until `IndexStatus` is `ACTIVE`.

   ```
   aws dynamodb describe-table \
       --table-name Products \
       --query 'Table.VectorIndexes[0].[IndexName,IndexStatus,Backfilling]'
   ```

   For an index created as part of `CreateTable`, as in this tutorial, `Backfilling` is not reported and the command returns `null` for it. Use `IndexStatus` alone as your signal in that case.

   `Backfilling` is reported for a vector index that you add to an existing table with `UpdateTable`. In that case, wait until `IndexStatus` is `ACTIVE` and `Backfilling` is not `true` before you search. Note that `Backfilling` is reported only while the index is `CREATING`, and is absent once the index is `ACTIVE`.
**Wait for the index, not just the table**
Do not use `aws dynamodb wait table-exists` to gate the search. That waiter matches on `Table.TableStatus`, which becomes `ACTIVE` while the vector index can still be `CREATING`. There is no waiter for vector index readiness, so you must poll `DescribeTable` as shown. Searching an index that is not yet `ACTIVE` fails with a `ValidationException`. Searching during backfill also returns a `ValidationException`. It does not return partial results.
For the same reason, you cannot delete the table until every vector index has finished creating. `DeleteTable` returns `ResourceInUseException` with the message "Cannot delete table while indexes are being created, updated, or deleted."

   After `IndexStatus` becomes `ACTIVE`, the search endpoint can require additional time before it begins serving the index. Retry `SearchVectors` on `ValidationException` during that interval.

1. **Create the product catalog.** Save the following 50 products to a tab-separated file named `products.tsv`. Each line holds a product ID, a name, and a one-sentence description. The catalog contains ten groups of five related products, which makes the search results in the last step easy to interpret.

   ```

   The separator between the three fields must be a literal tab character. If you copy the catalog from a browser, verify that the tabs survived before you continue.

1. **Generate an embedding for one product.** Run a single embedding call first to confirm your Amazon Bedrock model access works. The `inputText` field contains the text to embed, `dimensions` sets the output size (valid values are 256, 512, or 1024), and `normalize` produces unit-length vectors, which is recommended for cosine similarity search.

   ```
   mkdir -p emb

   aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \
       --model-id amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0 \
       --body '{"inputText":"A vacuum insulated stainless steel mug that keeps hot drinks warm for up to twelve hours.","dimensions":1024,"normalize":true}' \
       --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
       --content-type application/json \
       --accept application/json \
       emb/p01.json
   ```

   The `--cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out` flag is required. AWS CLI v2 defaults to base64 encoding for binary parameters, so without this flag the raw JSON body fails to send correctly. The response is written to `emb/p01.json` and contains an `embedding` array of 1024 floating-point numbers. Confirm the dimension count.

   ```
   jq '.embedding | length' emb/p01.json
   ```

   The output is `1024`.

1. **Write the first product.** Transform the embedding into the DynamoDB item format and write it. The stored vector attribute uses the DynamoDB `L` (list) type wrapping each number in an `N` type.

   ```
   jq '{"ProductId":{"S":"p01"},"Title":{"S":"Insulated Travel Mug"},"DescriptionVector":{"L":[.embedding[]|{"N":(.|tostring)}]}}' emb/p01.json > item-p01.json

   aws dynamodb put-item --table-name Products --item file://item-p01.json
   ```
**Vector size and item limits**
A 1024-dimension vector is well within the 400 KB DynamoDB item size limit. Two factors drive how much space an embedding occupies in the base table: the number of dimensions, and the number of significant digits each value carries. DynamoDB stores a number in proportion to its significant digits rather than at a fixed width. Embedding models commonly return values with many significant digits, so a stored embedding can be considerably larger than the same vector held at 32-bit floating point precision in the vector index. If item size matters to your design, measure a representative item rather than estimating from dimension count.

1. **Embed the remaining products.** This loop generates an embedding for each remaining product. It skips any file that already exists, so you can rerun it safely if a call fails.

   ```
   while IFS=$'\t' read -r id title description; do
       [ -s "emb/$id.json" ] && continue
       body=$(jq -n --arg t "$description" '{inputText:$t,dimensions:1024,normalize:true}')
       aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \
           --model-id amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0 \
           --body "$body" \
           --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
           --content-type application/json \
           --accept application/json \
           "emb/$id.json" >/dev/null || echo "FAILED $id"
   done < products.tsv

   ls emb/*.json | wc -l
   ```

   The count must be 50 before you continue. If any call printed `FAILED`, run the loop again; it retries only the missing files.
**InvokeModel rate quotas**
Amazon Bedrock applies request rate quotas to `InvokeModel`. If you modify this loop to issue calls in parallel, expect throttling exceptions on some calls, and always verify the final file count rather than assuming every call succeeded. A partially embedded catalog loads without error and produces search results that silently omit the missing products.

1. **Load the remaining products.** Build request payloads of 25 items each, which is the maximum that `BatchWriteItem` accepts.

   ```
   batch=0
   count=0
   echo -n '{"Products":[' > batch-0.json
   while IFS=$'\t' read -r id title description; do
       if [ "$count" -eq 25 ]; then
           echo ']}' >> "batch-$batch.json"
           batch=$((batch+1)); count=0
           echo -n '{"Products":[' > "batch-$batch.json"
       fi
       [ "$count" -gt 0 ] && echo -n ',' >> "batch-$batch.json"
       jq -c --arg id "$id" --arg title "$title" \
           '{PutRequest:{Item:{ProductId:{S:$id},Title:{S:$title},
             DescriptionVector:{L:[.embedding[]|{"N":(.|tostring)}]}}}}' \
           "emb/$id.json" >> "batch-$batch.json"
       count=$((count+1))
   done < <(tail -n +2 products.tsv)
   echo ']}' >> "batch-$batch.json"
   ```

   The loop reads from a redirect rather than a pipe because a piped `while` loop runs in a subshell in some shells, which discards the `batch` and `count` values and produces malformed batch files.

   Submit each batch. `BatchWriteItem` can partially succeed, so resubmit anything it returns in `UnprocessedItems`.

   ```
   for f in batch-*.json; do
       cp "$f" pending.json
       for attempt in 1 2 3 4 5; do
           aws dynamodb batch-write-item \
               --request-items file://pending.json \
               --output json > resp.json
           left=$(jq '(.UnprocessedItems.Products // []) | length' resp.json)
           echo "$f attempt $attempt: unprocessed=$left"
           [ "$left" -eq 0 ] && break
           jq '.UnprocessedItems' resp.json > pending.json
           sleep 2
       done
   done
   ```

   Confirm that all 50 items are present.

   ```
   aws dynamodb scan --table-name Products --select COUNT --query 'Count'
   ```
**ItemCount updates are delayed**
The `ItemCount` and `IndexSizeBytes` values that `DescribeTable` reports for a vector index are updated approximately every six hours, so immediately after a load they can still read `0` even though every item was written. Use `Scan` with `--select COUNT`, as shown, to verify a load. Do not treat a zero `ItemCount` as a failed load.

1. **Generate a query embedding and search.** Embed the search phrase with the same model and dimension count that you used for the stored items.

   ```
   aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \
       --model-id amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0 \
       --body '{"inputText":"How can I make my desk more comfortable to work at","dimensions":1024,"normalize":true}' \
       --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
       --content-type application/json \
       --accept application/json \
       embedding-query.json
   ```
**SearchVector format differs from stored vector format**
When you store a vector in an item attribute, you wrap it in an `L` (list) type: `{"L":[{"N":"0.123"},...]}`. When you pass a query vector to `SearchVectors`, you use a plain array of `N` values without the `L` wrapper: `[{"N":"0.123"},...]`. The following `jq` transform differs from the one you used for the stored items for this reason. For more information, see [Basic search](VectorSearchWorkingWith.md#VectorSearchWorkingWith.Search.Basic).

   ```
   jq '[.embedding[]|{"N":(.|tostring)}]' embedding-query.json > query-vector.json

   aws dynamodb search-vectors \
       --table-name Products \
       --index-name DescriptionIndex \
       --search-vector file://query-vector.json \
       --top-k 5 \
       --projection-expression "ProductId, Title" \
       --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL
   ```

   The query vector and stored vectors must come from the same embedding model and must have the same number of dimensions. Using a different model or dimension count produces meaningless results or a validation error.

1. **Read the results.** DynamoDB returns results sorted by similarity, with the most similar item first. Each result contains the projected `Item` attributes and a `Score`.

   ```
   {
       "SearchResults": [
           {
               "Item": {
                   "ProductId": { "S": "p11" },
                   "Title": { "S": "Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair" }
               },
               "Score": 0.6130197048187256
           },
           {
               "Item": {
                   "ProductId": { "S": "p12" },
                   "Title": { "S": "Sit Stand Desk Converter" }
               },
               "Score": 0.781868577003479
           },
           {
               "Item": {
                   "ProductId": { "S": "p14" },
                   "Title": { "S": "Under Desk Footrest" }
               },
               "Score": 0.816369354724884
           },
           {
               "Item": {
                   "ProductId": { "S": "p13" },
                   "Title": { "S": "Monitor Arm Mount" }
               },
               "Score": 0.8283305168151855
           },
           {
               "Item": {
                   "ProductId": { "S": "p15" },
                   "Title": { "S": "Wireless Split Keyboard" }
               },
               "Score": 0.8469693064689636
           }
       ],
       "ConsumedCapacity": {
           "VectorSearchRequestBytes": 31449.0
       }
   }
   ```

   Scores depend on the embedding model and the exact input text, so your values will differ slightly. What matters is which items were selected and in what order. The query did not contain the words chair, monitor, or keyboard, yet the search returned all five desk and office products ahead of the other 45 items in the catalog. Nothing from the coffee, camping, or pet groups appears.

   Try other queries to see the same behavior with different groups. Repeat the previous step with `"Something to brew fresh coffee at home"` and the top results are the espresso maker, the pour over dripper, and the milk frother. Repeat it with `"Keeping my dog safe on walks"` and the leash and harness come first, followed by items that are only loosely related, because the catalog contains just two products that closely match. That last case is worth noting: the search always returns the number of items you ask for, even when the catalog does not contain that many good matches. Use the `Score` values, not the result count, to judge match quality.

   How to read a score depends on the distance function that the index uses:
   + `COSINE` and `EUCLIDEAN` return the items with the smallest scores, so lower is more similar. Cosine scores range from 0 for identical direction to 2 for opposite direction.
   + `DOT_PRODUCT` returns the items with the highest scores, so higher is more similar.

   This index uses `COSINE`, so the first result has the lowest score. Searching with text identical to a stored description returns that item first with a score at or near zero.

## Clean up
<a name="VectorSearchTutorial.Cleanup"></a>

To avoid ongoing charges, delete the resources that you created in this tutorial. Vector index storage is billed for as long as the index exists, whether or not you run searches against it.

To delete the vector index but keep the `Products` table and its items, use `UpdateTable`. The items remain in the table and only the index is removed.

```
aws dynamodb update-table \
    --table-name Products \
    --vector-index-updates \
        "[
            {\"Delete\": {\"IndexName\": \"DescriptionIndex\"}}
        ]"
```

To delete the table and its vector index together, delete the table.

```
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name Products
```

Confirm that the table is gone. The following command returns a `ResourceNotFoundException` once deletion completes.

```
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name Products
```

For more information about removing a vector index from a table you want to keep, see [Deleting a vector index](VectorSearchWorkingWith.md#VectorSearchWorkingWith.Delete).
