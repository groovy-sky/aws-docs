# PartiQL arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators for DynamoDB
<a name="ql-operators"></a>

PartiQL in Amazon DynamoDB supports the following [SQL standard operators](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_operators.asp).

**Note**
Any SQL operators that are not included in this list are not currently supported in DynamoDB.

## Arithmetic operators
<a name="ql-operators.arithmetic"></a>

****

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \+ | Add |
| - | Subtract |

## Comparison operators
<a name="ql-operators.comparison"></a>

****

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| = | Equal to |
| <> | Not Equal to |
| \!= | Not Equal to |
| > | Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| <= | Less than or equal to |

## Logical operators
<a name="ql-operators.logical"></a>

****

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AND | TRUE if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE |
| BETWEEN | `TRUE` if the operand is within the range of comparisons.<br />This operator is inclusive of the lower and upper bound of the operands on which you apply it. |
| IN | `TRUE` if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions (at max 50 hash attribute values or at max 100 non-key attribute values).<br />Results are returned in pages of up to 10 items. If the `IN` list contains more values, you must use the `NextToken` returned in the response to retrieve subsequent pages. |
| IS | TRUE if the operand is a given, PartiQL data type, including NULL or MISSING |
| NOT | Reverses the value of a given Boolean expression |
| OR | TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR are TRUE |
