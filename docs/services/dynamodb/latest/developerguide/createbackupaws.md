## Turning on AWS Backup features

You must turn on AWS Backup to use it with DynamoDB.

To turn on AWS Backup, go through the following steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Backups**.

3. In the Backup Settings window, choose **Turn on**.

4. A confirmation screen will appear. Choose **Turn on features**.

AWS Backup features are now available for your DynamoDB tables.

If you choose to turn off AWS Backup features after they’ve been turned on, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Backups**.

3. In the Backup Settings window, choose **Turn off**.

4. A confirmation screen will appear. Choose **Turn off features**.

If you can’t turn the AWS Backup features on or off, your AWS admin may need to perform those actions.

## On-demand backups

To create an on-demand backup of a DynamoDB table, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Backups**.

3. Choose **Create backup**.

4. From the dropdown menu that appears, choose **Create an on-demand backup**.

5. To create a backup managed by AWS Backup with warm storage and other basic features,
    choose **Default Settings.** To create a backup that can be transitioned to cold storage,
    or to create a backup with DynamoDB features instead of AWS Backup, choose
    **Customize settings**.

If you want to create this backup with previous DynamoDB features instead, choose
    **Customize settings** and then choose **Backup with DynamoDB**.

6. When you have completed the settings, choose **Create backup.**

## Scheduled backups

To schedule a backup, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Backups**.

3. From the dropdown menu that appears, choose **Schedule backups with AWS Backup**.

4. You will be taken to AWS Backup to create a backup plan.
