# DynamoDB read and write operations

DynamoDB read operations allow you to retrieve one or more items from a table by
specifying the partition key value and, optionally, the sort key value. Using DynamoDB
write operations, you can insert, update, or delete items in a table. This topic
explains capacity unit consumption for these two operations.

## Capacity unit consumption for read operations

DynamoDB read requests can be either strongly consistent, eventually consistent, or
transactional.

- A _strongly consistent_ read request of an item up to 4
KB requires one read unit.

- An _eventually consistent_ read request of an item up
to 4 KB requires one-half read unit.

- A _transactional_ read request of an item up to 4 KB
requires two read units.

To learn more about DynamoDB read consistency models, see [DynamoDB read consistency](howitworks-readconsistency.md).

Item sizes for reads are rounded up to the next 4 KB multiple. For example,
reading a 3,500-byte item consumes the same throughput as reading a 4 KB
item.

If you need to read an item that is larger than 4 KB, DynamoDB needs additional read
units. The total number of read units required depends on the item size, and whether
you want an eventually consistent or strongly consistent read. For example, if your
item size is 8 KB, you require 2 read units to sustain one strongly consistent read.
You'll require 1 read unit if you choose eventually consistent reads or 4 read units
for a transactional read request.

The following list describes how DynamoDB read operations consume read units:

- [GetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-getitem.md): Reads a single item from a table. To determine the
number of read units that `GetItem` will consume, take the item
size and round it up to the next 4 KB boundary. This is the number of read
units required if you specified a strongly consistent read. For an
eventually consistent read, which is the default, divide this number by
two.

For example, if you read an item that is 3.5 KB, DynamoDB rounds the item
size to 4 KB. If you read an item of 10 KB, DynamoDB rounds the item size to 12
KB.

- [BatchGetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-batchgetitem.md): Reads up to 100 items from one or more tables.
DynamoDB processes each item in the batch as an individual `GetItem`
request. DynamoDB first rounds up the size of each item to the next 4 KB
boundary and then calculates the total size. The result isn't necessarily
the same as the total size of all the items. For example, if
`BatchGetItem` reads two items of sizes 1.5 KB and 6.5 KB,
DynamoDB calculates the size as 12 KB (4 KB + 8 KB). DynamoDB doesn’t calculate
the size as 8 KB (1.5 KB + 6.5 KB).

- [Query](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-query.md):
Reads multiple items that have the same partition key value. All items
returned are treated as a single read operation, where DynamoDB computes the
total size of all items. DynamoDB then rounds up the size to the next 4 KB
boundary. For example, suppose your query returns 10 items whose combined
size is 40.8 KB. DynamoDB rounds the item size for the operation to 44 KB. If a
query returns 1500 items of 64 bytes each, the cumulative size is 96
KB.

- [Scan](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-scan.md):
Reads all items in a table. DynamoDB considers the size of the items that are
evaluated, not the size of the items returned by the scan. For more
information about Scan operations, see [Scanning tables in DynamoDB](scan.md).

###### Important

If you perform a read operation on an _item that doesn't_
_exist_, DynamoDB will still consume read throughput as outlined
above. For `Query`/ `Scan` operations, you'll still be
charged additional read throughput based on read consistency and the number of
partitions searched to serve the request, even if no data exists.

For any operation that returns items, you can request a subset of attributes to
retrieve. However, doing so has no impact on the item size calculations. In
addition, `Query` and `Scan` can return item counts instead of
attribute values. Getting the count of items uses the same quantity of read units
and is subject to the same item size calculations. This is because DynamoDB has to read
each item in order to increment the count.

## Capacity unit consumption for write operations

One write unit represents one write for an item up to 1 KB in size. If you need to
write an item that is larger than 1 KB, DynamoDB needs to consume additional write
units. Transactional write requests require 2 write units to perform one write for
items up to 1 KB. The total number of write request units required depends on the
item size. For example, if your item size is 2 KB, you require 2 write units to
sustain one write request or 4 write units for a transactional write request.

Item sizes for writes are rounded up to the next 1 KB multiple. For example,
writing a 500-byte item consumes the same throughput as writing a 1 KB item.

The following list describes how DynamoDB write operations consume write
units:

- [PutItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-putitem.md): Writes a single item to a table. If an item with the
same primary key exists in the table, the operation replaces the item. For
calculating provisioned throughput consumption, the item size that matters
is the larger of the two.

- [UpdateItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-updateitem.md): Modifies a single item in the table. DynamoDB
considers the size of the item as it appears before and after the update.
The provisioned throughput consumed reflects the larger of these item sizes.
Even if you update a subset of the item's attributes,
`UpdateItem` will still consume the full amount of
provisioned throughput (the larger of the "before" and "after" item
sizes).

- [DeleteItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-deleteitem.md): Removes a single item from a table. The provisioned
throughput consumption is based on the size of the deleted item.

- [BatchWriteItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-batchwriteitem.md): Writes up to 25 items to one or more tables.
DynamoDB processes each item in the batch as an individual `PutItem`
or `DeleteItem` request (updates are not supported). DynamoDB first
rounds up the size of each item to the next 1 KB boundary, and then
calculates the total size. The result isn't necessarily the same as the
total size of all the items. For example, if `BatchWriteItem`
writes two items of sizes 500-byte and 3.5 KB, DynamoDB calculates the size as
5 KB (1 KB + 4 KB). DynamoDB doesn’t calculate the size as 4 KB (500 bytes +
3.5 KB).

For `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, and `DeleteItem`
operations, DynamoDB rounds the item size up to the next 1 KB. For example, if you put
or delete an item of 1.6 KB, DynamoDB rounds the item size up to 2 KB.

`PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, and `DeleteItem`
operations allow _conditional writes_, where you specify an
expression that must evaluate to true for the operation to succeed. If the
expression evaluates to false, DynamoDB still consumes write capacity units from the
table. The amount of consumed write capacity units depends on the size of the item.
This item can be an existing item in the table or a new one you're attempting to
create or update. For example, say that an existing item is 300 KB. The new item
you’re trying to create or update is 310 KB. The write capacity units consumed will
be 310 KB for the new item.
