# Evaluate your provisioned capacity for right-sized provisioning in your DynamoDB table

This section provides an overview of how to evaluate if you have right-sized provisioning on
your DynamoDB tables. As your workload evolves, you should modify your operational procedures
appropriately, especially when your DynamoDB table is configured in provisioned mode and you
have the risk to over-provision or under-provision your tables.

The procedures described below require statistical information that should be captured from
the DynamoDB tables that are supporting your production application. To understand your application
behavior, you should define a period of time that is significant enough to capture the data
seasonality from your application. For example, if your application shows weekly patterns, using
a three week period should give you enough room for analysing application throughput
needs.

If you don’t know where to start, use at least one month’s worth of data usage for the
calculations below.

While evaluating capacity, DynamoDB tables can configure **Read Capacity**
**Units (RCUs)** and **Write Capacity Units (WCU)**
independently. If your tables have any Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) configured, you will need
to specify the throughput that it will consume, which will be also independent from the RCUs and
WCUs from the base table.

###### Note

Local Secondary Indexes (LSI) consume capacity from the base table.

## How to retrieve consumption metrics on your DynamoDB tables

To evaluate the table and GSI capacity, monitor the following CloudWatch metrics and select the
appropriate dimension to retrieve either table or GSI information:

Read Capacity UnitsWrite Capacity Units

`ConsumedReadCapacityUnits`

`ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits`

`ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits`

`ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits`

`ReadThrottleEvents`

`WriteThrottleEvents`

You can do this either through the AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console.

AWS CLI

Before we retrieve the table consumption metrics, we'll need to start by capturing
some historical data points using the CloudWatch API.

Start by creating two files: `write-calc.json` and
`read-calc.json`. These files will represent the calculations for a table
or GSI. You'll need to update some of the fields, as indicated in the table below, to
match your environment.

Field NameDefinitionExample`<table-name>`The name of the table that you will be analysingSampleTable`<period>`The period of time that you will be using to evaluate the utilization
target, based in secondsFor a 1-hour period you should specify: 3600`<start-time>`The beginning of your evaluation interval, specified in ISO8601
format2022-02-21T23:00:00`<end-time>`The end of your evaluation interval, specified in ISO8601 format2022-02-22T06:00:00

The write calculations file will retrieve the number of WCU provisioned and consumed
in the time period for the date range specified. It will also generate a utilization
percentage that will be used for analysis. The full content of the
`write-calc.json` file should look like this:

```json

{
  "MetricDataQueries": [
    {
      "Id": "provisionedWCU",
      "MetricStat": {
        "Metric": {
          "Namespace": "AWS/DynamoDB",
          "MetricName": "ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits",
          "Dimensions": [
            {
              "Name": "TableName",
              "Value": "<table-name>"
            }
          ]
        },
        "Period": <period>,
        "Stat": "Average"
      },
      "Label": "Provisioned",
      "ReturnData": false
    },
    {
      "Id": "consumedWCU",
      "MetricStat": {
        "Metric": {
          "Namespace": "AWS/DynamoDB",
          "MetricName": "ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits",
          "Dimensions": [
            {
              "Name": "TableName",
              "Value": "<table-name>""
            }
          ]
        },
        "Period": <period>,
        "Stat": "Sum"
      },
      "Label": "",
      "ReturnData": false
    },
    {
      "Id": "m1",
      "Expression": "consumedWCU/PERIOD(consumedWCU)",
      "Label": "Consumed WCUs",
      "ReturnData": false
    },
    {
      "Id": "utilizationPercentage",
      "Expression": "100*(m1/provisionedWCU)",
      "Label": "Utilization Percentage",
      "ReturnData": true
    }
  ],
  "StartTime": "<start-time>",
  "EndTime": "<ent-time>",
  "ScanBy": "TimestampDescending",
  "MaxDatapoints": 24
}
```

The read calculations file uses a similar file. This file will retrieve how many
RCUs were provisioned and consumed during the time period for the date range specified.
The contents of the `read-calc.json` file should look like this:

```json

{
  "MetricDataQueries": [
    {
      "Id": "provisionedRCU",
      "MetricStat": {
        "Metric": {
          "Namespace": "AWS/DynamoDB",
          "MetricName": "ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits",
          "Dimensions": [
            {
              "Name": "TableName",
              "Value": "<table-name>"
            }
          ]
        },
        "Period": <period>,
        "Stat": "Average"
      },
      "Label": "Provisioned",
      "ReturnData": false
    },
    {
      "Id": "consumedRCU",
      "MetricStat": {
        "Metric": {
          "Namespace": "AWS/DynamoDB",
          "MetricName": "ConsumedReadCapacityUnits",
          "Dimensions": [
            {
              "Name": "TableName",
              "Value": "<table-name>"
            }
          ]
        },
        "Period": <period>,
        "Stat": "Sum"
      },
      "Label": "",
      "ReturnData": false
    },
    {
      "Id": "m1",
      "Expression": "consumedRCU/PERIOD(consumedRCU)",
      "Label": "Consumed RCUs",
      "ReturnData": false
    },
    {
      "Id": "utilizationPercentage",
      "Expression": "100*(m1/provisionedRCU)",
      "Label": "Utilization Percentage",
      "ReturnData": true
    }
  ],
  "StartTime": "<start-time>",
  "EndTime": "<end-time>",
  "ScanBy": "TimestampDescending",
  "MaxDatapoints": 24
}
```

One you've created the files, you can start retrieving utilization data.

1. To retreive the write utilization data, issue the following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --cli-input-json file://write-calc.json
```

2. To retreive the read utilization data, issue the following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --cli-input-json file://read-calc.json
```

The result for both queries will be a series of data points in JSON format that will
be used for analysis. Your result will depend on the number of data points you
specified, the period, and your own specific workload data. It could look something like
this:

```json

{
    "MetricDataResults": [
        {
            "Id": "utilizationPercentage",
            "Label": "Utilization Percentage",
            "Timestamps": [
                "2022-02-22T05:00:00+00:00",
                "2022-02-22T04:00:00+00:00",
                "2022-02-22T03:00:00+00:00",

                "2022-02-22T01:00:00+00:00",
                "2022-02-22T00:00:00+00:00",
                "2022-02-21T23:00:00+00:00"
            ],
            "Values": [
                91.55364583333333,

                25.61819444444444,
                0.0
            ],
            "StatusCode": "Complete"
        }
    ],
    "Messages": []
}
```

###### Note

If you specify a short period and a long time range, you might need to modify the
`MaxDatapoints` which is by default set to 24 in the script. This
represents one data point per hour and 24 per day.

AWS Management Console

01. Log into the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch service page.
     Select an appropriate AWS Region if necessary.

02. Locate the **Metrics** section on the left navigation bar and select **All metrics**.

03. This will open a dashboard with two panels. The top panel will show you the
     graphic, and the bottom panel will show the metrics you want to graph. Choose **DynamoDB**.

04. Choose **Table Metrics**. This will show you the tables in your current Region.

05. Use the Search box to search for your table name and choose the write
     operation metrics: `ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits` and
     `ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits`

    ###### Note

    This example talks about write operation metrics, but you can also use these
    steps to graph the read operation metrics.

06. Choose the **Graphed metrics (2)** tab to modify
     the formulas. By default, CloudWatch selects the statistical function **Average** for the graphs.

    ![The selected graphed metrics and Average as the default statistical function.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning1.png)

07. While having both graphed metrics selected (the checkbox on the left) select the
     menu **Add math**, followed by **Common**, and then select the **Percentage** function. Repeat the procedure twice.

    First time selecting the **Percentage**
     function:

    ![CloudWatch console. The Percentage function is selected for the graphed metrics.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning2.png)

    Second time selecting the **Percentage**
     function:

    ![CloudWatch console. The Percentage function is selected a second time for the graphed metrics.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning3.png)

08. At this point you should have four metrics in the bottom menu. Let’s work on the
     `ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits` calculation. To be consistent, we need to
     match the names for the ones we used in the AWS CLI section. Click on the **m1 ID** and change this value to **consumedWCU**.

    ![CloudWatch console. The graphed metric with m1 ID is renamed to consumedWCU.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning4.png)

    Rename the **ConsumedWriteCapacityUnit** label as `consumedWCU`.

    ![The graphed metric with ConsumedWriteCapacityUnit label is renamed to consumedWCU.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning5.png)

09. Change the statistic from **Average** to **Sum**. This action will automatically create another metric
     called **ANOMALY\_DETECTION\_BAND**. For the scope of
     this procedure, let's ignore it by removing the checkbox on the newly generated
     **ad1 metric**.

    ![CloudWatch console. The statistic SUM is selected in the dropdown list for the graphed metrics.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning6.png)

    ![CloudWatch console. The ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND metric is removed from the list of graphed metrics.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning7.png)

10. Repeat step 8 to rename the **m2 ID** to **provisionedWCU**. Leave the statistic set to **Average**.

    ![CloudWatch console. The graphed metric with m2 ID is renamed to provisionedWCU.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning8.png)

11. Select the **Expression1** label and update the
     value to **m1** and the label to **Consumed WCUs**.

    ###### Note

    Make sure you have only selected **m1** (checkbox
    on the left) and **provisionedWCU** to properly
    visualize the data. Update the formula by clicking in **Details** and changing the formula to **consumedWCU/PERIOD(consumedWCU)**. This step might also generate
    another **ANOMALY\_DETECTION\_BAND** metric, but for
    the scope of this procedure we can ignore it.

    ![m1 and provisionedWCU are selected. Details for m1 is updated as consumedWCU/PERIOD(consumedWCU).](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning10.png)

12. You should have now have two graphics: one that indicates your provisioned WCUs
     on the table and another that indicates the consumed WCUs. The shape of the graphic
     might be different from the one below, but you can use it as reference:

    ![Graph with the provisioned WCUs and consumed WCUs for the table plotted.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning11.png)

13. Update the percentage formula by selecting the Expression2 graphic ( **e2**). Rename the labels and IDs to **utilizationPercentage**. Rename the formula to match **100\*(m1/provisionedWCU)**.

    ![CloudWatch console. Labels and IDs for Expression2 are renamed to utilizationPercentage.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning12.png)

    ![CloudWatch console. Percentage formula for Expression2 is updated to 100*(m1/provisionedWCU).](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning13.png)

14. Remove the checkbox from all the metrics but **utilizationPercentage** to visualize your utilization patterns. The
     default interval is set to 1 minute, but feel free to modify it as you need.

    ![Graph of the utilizationPercentage metric for the selected time interval.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning14.png)

Here is view of a longer period of time as well as a bigger period of 1 hour. You
can see there are some intervals where the utilization was higher than 100%, but this
particular workload has longer intervals with zero utilization.

![Utilization pattern for an extended period. It highlights periods of utilization over 100% and zero.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/CostOptimization/RightSizedProvisioning15.png)

At this point, you might have different results from the pictures in this example.
It all depends on the data from your workload. Intervals with more than 100% utilization
are prone to throttling events. DynamoDB offers [burst capacity](burst-adaptive-capacity.md#burst-capacity), but as soon as
the burst capacity is done anything above 100% will be throttled.

## How to identify under-provisioned DynamoDB tables

For most workloads, a table is considered under-provisioned when it constantly consumes
more than 80% of their provisioned capacity.

[Burst capacity](burst-adaptive-capacity.md#burst-capacity) is a DynamoDB
feature that allow customers to temporarily consume more RCUs/WCUs than originally provisioned
(more than the per-second provisioned throughput that was defined in the table). The burst
capacity was created to absorb sudden increases in traffic due to special events or usage
spikes. This burst capacity doesn’t last forever. As soon as the unused RCUs and WCUs are
depleted, you will get throttled if you try to consume more capacity than provisioned. When
your application traffic is getting close to the 80% utilization rate, your risk of throttling
is significantly higher.

The 80% utilization rate rule varies from the seasonality of your data and your traffic
growth. Consider the following scenarios:

- If your traffic has been **stable** at ~90% utilization
rate for the last 12 months, your table has just the right capacity

- If your application traffic is **growing** at a rate of
8% monthly in less than 3 months, you will arrive at 100%

- If your application traffic is **growing** at a rate of
5% in a little more than 4 months, you will still arrive at 100%

The results from the queries above provide a picture of your utilization rate. Use them as
a guide to further evaluate other metrics that can help you choose to increase your table
capacity as required (for example: a monthly or weekly growth rate). Work with your operations
team to define what is a good percentage for your workload and your tables.

There are special scenarios where the data is skewed when we analyse it on a daily or
weekly basis. For example, with seasonal applications that have spikes in usage during working
hours (but then drops to almost zero outside of working hours), you could benefit by [scheduling auto scaling](../../../autoscaling/application/userguide/examples-scheduled-actions.md) where you specify the hours of the day (and the days of the
week) to increase the provisioned capacity and when to reduce it. Instead of aiming for higher
capacity so you can cover the busy hours, you can also benefit from [DynamoDB table auto scaling](autoscaling.md) configurations if your seasonality is
less pronounced.

###### Note

When you create a DynamoDB auto scaling configuration for your base table, remember to
include another configuration for any GSI that is associated with the table.

## How to identify over-provisioned DynamoDB tables

The query results obtained from the scripts above provide the data points required to
perform some initial analysis. If your data set presents values lower than 20% utilization for
several intervals, your table might be over-provisioned. To further define if you need to
reduce the number of WCUs and RCUS, you should revisit the other readings in the
intervals.

When your tables contain several low usage intervals, you can really benefit from using
auto scaling policies, either by scheduling auto scaling or just configuring the default
auto scaling policies for the table that are based on utilization.

If you have a workload with low utilization to high throttle ratio ( **Max(ThrottleEvents)/Min(ThrottleEvents)** in the interval), this could happen when
you have a very spiky workload where traffic increases a lot during some days (or hours), but
in general the traffic is consistently low. In these scenarios it might be beneficial to use
[scheduled\
auto scaling](../../../autoscaling/application/userguide/examples-scheduled-actions.md).
