# Differences between a relational (SQL) database and DynamoDB when removing a table

In SQL, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement to remove a table. In Amazon DynamoDB, you use the `DeleteTable` operation.

## Removing a table with SQL
<a name="SQLtoNoSQL.RemoveTable.SQL"></a>

When you no longer need a table and want to discard it permanently, you would use the `DROP TABLE` statement in SQL.

```
DROP TABLE Music;
```

After a table is dropped, it cannot be recovered. (Some relational databases do allow you to undo a `DROP TABLE` operation, but this is vendor-specific functionality and it is not widely implemented.)

## Removing a table in DynamoDB
<a name="SQLtoNoSQL.RemoveTable.DynamoDB"></a>

In DynamoDB, `DeleteTable` is a similar operation. In the following example, the table is permanently deleted.

```
{
    TableName: "Music"
}
```
