# PartiQL select statements for DynamoDB

Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from a table in
Amazon DynamoDB.

Using the `SELECT` statement can result in a full table scan if an
equality or IN condition with a partition key is not provided in the WHERE clause. A scan
operation examines every item for the requested values and can use up the
provisioned throughput for a large table or index in a single operation.

If you want to avoid full table scan in PartiQL, you can:

- Author your `SELECT` statements to not result in full table
scans by making sure your [WHERE clause condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.select.html#ql-reference.select.parameters) is configured accordingly.

- Disable full table scans using the IAM policy specified at [Example: Allow select statements and deny full table scan statements in PartiQL for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-iam.html#access-policy-ql-iam-example6), in the DynamoDB developer
guide.

For more information see [Best practices for\
querying and scanning data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-query-scan.html), in the DynamoDB developer guide.

## Syntax

```nohighlight

SELECT expression  [, ...]
FROM table[.index]
[ WHERE condition ] [ [ORDER BY key [DESC|ASC] , ...]
```

## Parameters

**`expression`**

(Required) A projection formed from the `*` wildcard or
a projection list of one or more attribute names or document paths
from the result set. An expression can consist of calls to [Use PartiQL functions with DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-functions.html) or fields
that are modified by [PartiQL arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-operators.html).

**`table`**

(Required) The table name to query.

**`index`**

(Optional) The name of the index to query.

###### Note

You must add double quotation marks to the table name and
index name when querying an index.

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "TableName"."IndexName"

```

**`condition`**

(Optional) The selection criteria for the query.

###### Important

To ensure that a `SELECT` statement does not result
in a full table scan, the `WHERE` clause condition
must specify a partition key. Use the equality or IN
operator.

For example, if you have an `Orders` table with an
`OrderID` partition key and other non-key
attributes, including an `Address`, the following
statements would not result in a full table scan:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID = 100

SELECT *
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID = 100 and Address='some address'

SELECT *
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID = 100 or OrderID = 200

SELECT *
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID IN [100, 300, 234]
```

The following `SELECT` statements, however, will
result in a full table scan:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID > 1

SELECT *
FROM "Orders"
WHERE Address='some address'

SELECT *
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID = 100 OR Address='some address'
```

**`key`**

(Optional) A hash key or a sort key to use to order returned
results. The default order is ascending ( `ASC`) specify
`DESC` if you want the results retuned in descending
order.

###### Note

If you omit the `WHERE` clause, then all of the items in the
table are retrieved.

## Examples

The following query returns one item, if one exists, from the
`Orders` table by specifying the partition key,
`OrderID`, and using the equality operator.

```sql

SELECT OrderID, Total
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID = 1
```

The following query returns all items in the `Orders` table that
have a specific partition key, `OrderID`, values using the OR
operator.

```sql

SELECT OrderID, Total
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID = 1 OR OrderID = 2
```

The following query returns all items in the `Orders` table that
have a specific partition key, `OrderID`, values using the IN
operator. The returned results are in descending order, based on the
`OrderID` key attribute value.

```sql

SELECT OrderID, Total
FROM "Orders"
WHERE OrderID IN [1, 2, 3] ORDER BY OrderID DESC
```

The following query shows a full table scan that returns all items from the
`Orders` table that have a `Total` greater than 500,
where `Total` is a non-key attribute.

```sql

SELECT OrderID, Total
FROM "Orders"
WHERE Total > 500
```

The following query shows a full table scan that returns all items from the
`Orders` table within a specific `Total` order range,
using the IN operator and a non-key attribute `Total`.

```sql

SELECT OrderID, Total
FROM "Orders"
WHERE Total IN [500, 600]
```

The following query shows a full table scan that returns all items from the
`Orders` table within a specific `Total` order range,
using the BETWEEN operator and a non-key attribute `Total`.

```sql

SELECT OrderID, Total
FROM "Orders"
WHERE Total BETWEEN 500 AND 600
```

The following query returns the first date a firestick device was used to
watch by specifying the partition key `CustomerID` and sort key
`MovieID` in the WHERE clause condition and using document paths
in the SELECT clause.

```sql

SELECT Devices.FireStick.DateWatched[0]
FROM WatchList
WHERE CustomerID= 'C1' AND MovieID= 'M1'
```

The following query shows a full table scan that returns the list of items
where a firestick device was first used after 12/24/19 using document paths in
the WHERE clause condition.

```sql

SELECT Devices
FROM WatchList
WHERE Devices.FireStick.DateWatched[0] >= '12/24/19'
```
