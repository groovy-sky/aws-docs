# Understanding DynamoDB warm throughput

_Warm throughput_ refers to the number of read and write operations
your DynamoDB table can instantaneously support. These values are available by default for
all tables and global secondary indexes (GSI) and represent how much they have scaled
based on historical usage. If you are using on-demand mode, or if you update your
provisioned throughput to these values, your application will be able to issue requests
up to those values instantly.

DynamoDB will automatically adjust warm throughput values as your usage increases.
You can also increase these values proactively when needed, which is especially
useful for upcoming peak events like product launches or sales. For planned peak events,
where request rates to your DynamoDB table might increase by 10x, 100x, or more, you can
now assess whether the current warm throughput is sufficient to handle the expected
traffic. If it’s not, you can increase the warm throughput value without changing your
throughput settings or [billing mode](capacity-mode.md). This process
is referred to as _pre-warming_ a table, allowing you
to set a baseline that your tables can instantly support. This ensures your applications
can handle higher request rates from the moment they occur. Once increased, warm throughput
values can't be decreased.

You can increase the warm throughput value for read operations, write operations, or
both. You can increase this value for new and existing single-Region tables, global
tables, and GSIs. For global tables, this feature is available for [version 2019.11.21 (Current)](globaltables.md), and the warm throughput
settings you set will automatically apply to all replica tables in the global table.
There is no limit to the number of DynamoDB tables you can pre-warm at any time. The time
to complete pre-warming depends on the values you set and the size of the table or
index. You can submit simultaneous pre-warm requests and these requests will not
interfere with any table operations. You can pre-warm your table up to the table or
index quota limit for your account in that Region. Use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas) to
check your current limits and increase them if needed.

Warm throughput values are available by default for all tables and secondary indexes
at no cost. However, if you proactively increase these default warm throughput values to
pre-warm the tables, you will be charged for those requests. For more information, see
