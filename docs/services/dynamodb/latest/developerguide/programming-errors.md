# Error handling with DynamoDB

This section describes runtime errors and how to handle them. It also describes error
messages and codes that are specific to Amazon DynamoDB. For a list of common errors that apply to
all AWS services, see [Access\
Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html)

## Error components

When your program sends a request, DynamoDB attempts to process it. If the request is
successful, DynamoDB returns an HTTP success status code ( `200 OK`), along with
the results from the requested operation.

If the request is unsuccessful, DynamoDB returns an error. Each error has three
components:

- An HTTP status code (such as `400`).

- An exception name (such as `ResourceNotFoundException`).

- An error message (such as `Requested resource not found: Table:
                              tablename not found`).

The AWS SDKs take care of propagating errors to your application so that you can
take appropriate action. For example, in a Java program, you can write
`try-catch` logic to handle a
`ResourceNotFoundException`.

If you are not using an AWS SDK, you need to parse the content of the low-level
response from DynamoDB. The following is an example of such a response.

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
x-amzn-RequestId: LDM6CJP8RMQ1FHKSC1RBVJFPNVV4KQNSO5AEMF66Q9ASUAAJG
Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.0
Content-Length: 240
Date: Thu, 15 Mar 2012 23:56:23 GMT

{"__type":"com.amazonaws.dynamodb.v20120810#ResourceNotFoundException",
"message":"Requested resource not found: Table: tablename not found"}
```

## Transactional errors

For information on transactional errors, please see [Transaction conflict handling in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/transaction-apis.html#transaction-conflict-handling)

## Error messages and codes

The following is a list of exceptions returned by DynamoDB, grouped by HTTP status code.
If _OK to retry?_ is _Yes_, you can submit the
same request again. If _OK to retry?_ is _No_, you
need to fix the problem on the client side before you submit a new request.

### HTTP status code 400

An HTTP `400` status code indicates a problem with your request, such
as authentication failure, missing required parameters, or exceeding a table's
provisioned throughput. You have to fix the issue in your application before
submitting the request again.

**AccessDeniedException**

Message: _Access denied._

The client did not correctly sign the request. If you are using an
AWS SDK, requests are signed for you automatically; otherwise, go to
the [Signature version\
4 signing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the
_AWS General Reference_.

OK to retry? No

**ConditionalCheckFailedException**

Message: _The conditional request failed._

You specified a condition that evaluated to false. For example, you
might have tried to perform a conditional update on an item, but the
actual value of the attribute did not match the expected value in the
condition.

OK to retry? No

**IncompleteSignatureException**

Message: _The request signature does not conform to AWS_
_standards._

The request signature did not include all of the required components.
If you are using an AWS SDK, requests are signed for you
automatically; otherwise, go to the [Signature Version 4\
signing process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the
_AWS General Reference_.

OK to retry? No

**ItemCollectionSizeLimitExceededException**

Message: _Collection size exceeded._

For a table with a local secondary index, a group of items with the same partition key
value has exceeded the maximum size limit of 10 GB. For more
information on item collections, see [Item collections in Local Secondary Indexes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LSI.html#LSI.ItemCollections).

OK to retry? Yes

**LimitExceededException**

Message: _Too many operations for a given_
_subscriber._

There are too many concurrent control plane operations. The cumulative
number of tables and indexes in the `CREATING`,
`DELETING`, or `UPDATING` state cannot exceed
500.

OK to retry? Yes

**MissingAuthenticationTokenException**

Message: _Request must contain a valid (registered) AWS_
_Access Key ID._

The request did not include the required authorization header, or it
was malformed. See [DynamoDB low-level API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.LowLevelAPI.html).

OK to retry? No

**ProvisionedThroughputExceededException**

Message: _You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned_
_throughput for a table or for one or more global secondary indexes._
_To view performance metrics for provisioned throughput vs. consumed_
_throughput, open the [Amazon CloudWatch\_
_console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home)._

The error includes a list of `ThrottlingReason` fields that
provides specific context about why throttling occurred, following the
format `ResourceType+OperationType+LimitType` (e.g.,
`TableReadProvisionedThroughputExceeded`) and the ARN of
the affected resource. This helps you identify which resource is being
throttled (table or index), what operation type triggered the throttling
(read or write), and the specific limit that was exceeded (in this case: provisioned
capacity). For
more information about diagnosing and resolving throttling issues, see
[Diagnosing throttling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/throttling-diagnosing-workflow.html).

Example: Your request rate is too high. The AWS SDKs for DynamoDB
automatically retry requests that receive this exception. Your request
is eventually successful, unless your retry queue is too large to
finish. Reduce the frequency of requests using [Error retries and exponential backoff](#Programming.Errors.RetryAndBackoff).

OK to retry? Yes

**ReplicatedWriteConflictException**

Message: _One or more items in this request are being_
_modified by a request in another Region._

Example: A write operation was requested for an item in a multi-Region
strongly consistent (MRSC) global table that is currently being modified
by a request in another Region.

OK to retry? Yes

**RequestLimitExceeded**

Message: _Throughput exceeds the current throughput limit for_
_your account. To request a limit increase, contact AWS Support at_
_[https://aws.amazon.com/support](https://aws.amazon.com/support)_.

The error includes a list of `ThrottlingReason` fields that
provides specific context about why throttling occurred, following the
format `ResourceType+OperationType+LimitType` (e.g.,
`TableWriteAccountLimitExceeded` or
`IndexReadAccountLimitExceeded`) and the ARN of the
affected resource. This helps you identify which resource is being
throttled (table or index), what operation type triggered the throttling
(read or write), and that you've exceeded account-level service quotas.
For more information about diagnosing and resolving throttling issues,
see [Diagnosing throttling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/throttling-diagnosing-workflow.html).

Example: Rate of on-demand requests exceeds the allowed account
throughput and the table cannot be scaled further.

OK to retry? Yes

**ResourceInUseException**

Message: _The resource which you are attempting to change is_
_in use._

Example: You tried to re-create an existing table, or delete a table
currently in the `CREATING` state.

OK to retry? No

**ResourceNotFoundException**

Message: _Requested resource not found._

Example: The table that is being requested does not exist, or is too
early in the `CREATING` state.

OK to retry? No

**ThrottlingException**

Message: _Rate of requests exceeds the allowed_
_throughput._

This exception is returned as an AmazonServiceException response with
a THROTTLING\_EXCEPTION status code. This exception might be returned if
you perform [control plane](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.API.html#HowItWorks.API.ControlPlane) API operations too rapidly.

For tables using on-demand mode, this exception might be returned for
any [data plane](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.API.html#HowItWorks.API.DataPlane) API operation if your request rate is too high.
To learn more about on-demand scaling, see [Initial throughput and scaling properties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/on-demand-capacity-mode.html#on-demand-capacity-mode-initial).

The error includes a list of `ThrottlingReason` fields that
provides specific context about why throttling occurred, following the
format `ResourceType+OperationType+LimitType` (e.g.,
`TableReadKeyRangeThroughputExceeded` or
`IndexWriteMaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded`) and the ARN of
the affected resource. This information helps you identify which
resource is being throttled (table or index), what operation type
triggered the throttling (read or write), and the specific limit that
was exceeded (partition limits or on-demand maximum throughput). For
more information about diagnosing and resolving throttling issues, see
[Diagnosing throttling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/throttling-diagnosing-workflow.html).

OK to retry? Yes

**UnrecognizedClientException**

Message: _The Access Key ID or security token is_
_invalid._

The request signature is incorrect. The most likely cause is an
invalid AWS access key ID or secret key.

OK to retry? Yes

**ValidationException**

Message: Varies, depending upon the specific error(s)
encountered

This error can occur for several reasons, such as a required parameter
that is missing, a value that is out of range, or mismatched data types.
The error message contains details about the specific part of the
request that caused the error.

OK to retry? No

### HTTP status code 5xx

An HTTP `5xx` status code indicates a problem that must be resolved by
AWS. This might be a transient error, in which case you can retry your request
until it succeeds. Otherwise, go to the [AWS\
Service Health Dashboard](http://status.aws.amazon.com/) to see if there are any operational issues with
the service.

For more information, see [How do I resolve\
HTTP 5xx errors in Amazon DynamoDB?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/dynamodb-http-5xx-errors)

**InternalServerError (HTTP 500)**

DynamoDB could not process your request.

OK to retry? Yes

###### Note

You might encounter internal server errors while working with
items. These are expected during the lifetime of a table. Any failed
requests can be retried immediately.

When you receive a status code 500 on a write operation, the
operation may have succeeded or failed. If the write operation is a
`TransactWriteItem` request, then it is OK to retry
the operation. If the write operation is a single-item write request
such as `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, or
`DeleteItem`, then your application should read the
state of the item before retrying the operation, and/or use [DynamoDB condition expression CLI example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html) to ensure
that the item remains in a correct state after retrying regardless
of whether the prior operation succeeded or failed. If idempotency
is a requirement for the write operation, please use [TransactWriteItem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/transaction-apis.html#transaction-apis-txwriteitems), which supports
idempotent requests by automatically specifying a
`ClientRequestToken` to disambiguate multiple
attempts to perform the same action.

**ServiceUnavailable (HTTP 503)**

DynamoDB is currently unavailable. (This should be a temporary
state.)

OK to retry? Yes

## Error handling in your application

For your application to run smoothly, you need to add logic to catch and respond to
errors. Typical approaches include using `try-catch` blocks or
`if-then` statements.

The AWS SDKs perform their own retries and error checking. If you encounter an error
while using one of the AWS SDKs, the error code and description can help you
troubleshoot it.

You should also see a `Request ID` in the response. The `Request
                ID` can be helpful if you need to work with AWS Support to diagnose an
issue.

## Error retries and exponential backoff

Numerous components on a network, such as DNS servers, switches, load balancers, and
others, can generate errors anywhere in the life of a given request. The usual technique
for dealing with these error responses in a networked environment is to implement
retries in the client application. This technique increases the reliability of the
application.

Each AWS SDK implements retry logic automatically. You can modify the retry
parameters to your needs. For example, consider a Java application that requires a
fail-fast strategy, with no retries allowed in case of an error. With the AWS SDK for Java,
you could use the `ClientConfiguration` class and provide a
`maxErrorRetry` value of `0` to turn off the retries. For more
information, see the AWS SDK documentation for your programming language.

If you're not using an AWS SDK, you should retry original requests that receive
server errors (5xx). However, client errors (4xx, other than a
`ThrottlingException` or a
`ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`) indicate that you need to
revise the request itself to correct the problem before trying again. For detailed
recommendations to address specific throttling scenarios, refer to the [DynamoDB throttling troubleshooting](troubleshootingthrottling.md)
section.

In addition to simple retries, each AWS SDK implements an exponential backoff
algorithm for better flow control. The concept behind exponential backoff is to use
progressively longer waits between retries for consecutive error responses. For example,
up to 50 milliseconds before the first retry, up to 100 milliseconds before the second,
up to 200 milliseconds before third, and so on. However, after a minute, if the request
has not succeeded, the problem might be the request size exceeding your provisioned
throughput, and not the request rate. Set the maximum number of retries to stop around
one minute. If the request is not successful, investigate your provisioned throughput
options.

###### Note

The AWS SDKs implement automatic retry logic and exponential backoff.

Most exponential backoff algorithms use jitter (randomized delay) to prevent
successive collisions. Because you aren't trying to avoid such collisions in these
cases, you do not need to use this random number. However, if you use concurrent
clients, jitter can help your requests succeed faster. For more information, see the
blog post about [Exponential backoff and jitter](http://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html).

## Batch operations and error handling

The DynamoDB low-level API supports batch operations for reads and writes.
`BatchGetItem` reads items from one or more tables, and
`BatchWriteItem` puts or deletes items in one or more tables. These batch
operations are implemented as wrappers around other non-batch DynamoDB operations. In other
words, `BatchGetItem` invokes `GetItem` once for each item in the
batch. Similarly, `BatchWriteItem` invokes `DeleteItem` or
`PutItem`, as appropriate, for each item in the batch.

A batch operation can tolerate the failure of individual requests in the batch. For
example, consider a `BatchGetItem` request to read five items. Even if some
of the underlying `GetItem` requests fail, this does not cause the entire
`BatchGetItem` operation to fail. However, if all five read operations
fail, then the entire `BatchGetItem` fails.

The batch operations return information about individual requests that fail so that
you can diagnose the problem and retry the operation. For `BatchGetItem`, the
tables and primary keys in question are returned in the `UnprocessedKeys`
value of the response. For `BatchWriteItem`, similar information is returned
in `UnprocessedItems`.

The most likely cause of a failed read or a failed write is
_throttling_. For `BatchGetItem`, one or more of the
tables in the batch request does not have enough provisioned read capacity to support
the operation. For `BatchWriteItem`, one or more of the tables does not have
enough provisioned write capacity.

If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those
items. However, _we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff_
_algorithm_. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying
read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you
delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the
batch are much more likely to succeed.

###### Note

Some AWS SDKs provide higher-level clients that handle unprocessed item retries
automatically, so you don't need to implement this retry logic yourself. For
example:

- **Java** – The [DynamoDB Enhanced Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBEnhanced.html) in the AWS SDK for Java v2
and the [DynamoDBMapper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBMapper.html) in v1 both
automatically retry unprocessed items when performing batch
operations.

- **Python** – The boto3
Table resource `batch_writer` handles unprocessed item retries
implicitly for batch write operations. For more information, see
[Using the table resource batch\_writer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/programming-with-python.html#programming-with-python-batch-writer).

If you are using a low-level client or an SDK that does not provide this
behavior, you must implement the retry logic yourself as described
above.
