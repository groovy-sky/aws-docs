# Quotas in Amazon DynamoDB

This section describes current quotas, formerly referred to as limits, within Amazon DynamoDB.
Each quota applies on a per-Region basis unless otherwise specified.

###### Note

All size measurements in DynamoDB use binary-based units. DynamoDB denotes 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1024 KB, 1 GB = 1024 MB, 1 TB = 1024 GB.

## Read/write throughput

### Throughput default quotas

AWS places some default quotas on the throughput that your
account can provision and consume within a Region.

The account-level read throughput and account-level write
throughput quotas apply at the account level. These account-level quotas apply to
the sum of the provisioned throughput capacity for all your account’s tables and
global secondary indexes in a given Region. All the account's available throughput
can be provisioned for a single table or across multiple tables. These quotas only
apply to tables using the provisioned capacity mode.

The table-level read throughput and table-level write throughput
quotas apply differently to tables that use the provisioned capacity mode, and
tables that use the on-demand capacity mode.

For provisioned capacity mode tables and GSIs, the quota is the
maximum amount of read and write capacity units that can be provisioned for any
table or any of its GSIs in the Region. The total of any individual table and all
its GSIs must also remain below the account-level read and write throughput quota.
This is in addition to the requirement that the total of all provisioned tables and
their GSIs must remain below the account-level read and write throughput quota.

For on-demand capacity mode tables and GSIs, the table-level
quota is the maximum read and write capacity units that are available for any table,
or any individual GSI within that table. No account-level read and write throughput
quotas are applied to tables in on-demand mode.

Following are the throughput quotas that apply on your account,
by default.

###### Note

All capacity unit and request unit quotas are measured per second. For
example, a quota of 40,000 read capacity units means 40,000 reads per
second.

###### Note

You can request any number of read capacity units (RCU) or write capacity
units (WCU) for your DynamoDB tables through a service quota increase. The values
listed in the following table represent the initial default quotas. These are
not maximum limits for your tables.

### Increasing or decreasing throughput (for provisioned tables)

#### Increasing provisioned throughput

You can increase `ReadCapacityUnits` or
`WriteCapacityUnits` as often as necessary, using the AWS Management Console
or the `UpdateTable` operation. In a single call, you can increase
the provisioned throughput for a table, for any global secondary indexes on that
table, or for any combination of these. The new settings do not take effect
until the `UpdateTable` operation is complete.

You can't exceed your per-account quotas when you add provisioned capacity,
and DynamoDB doesn't allow you to increase provisioned capacity very rapidly. Aside
from these restrictions, you can increase the provisioned capacity for your
tables as high as you need. For more information about per-account quotas, see
the preceding section, [Throughput default quotas](#default-limits-throughput).

#### Decreasing provisioned throughput

For every table and global secondary index in an
`UpdateTable` operation, you can decrease
`ReadCapacityUnits` or `WriteCapacityUnits` (or both).
The new settings don't take effect until the `UpdateTable` operation
is complete.

There is a default quota on the number of provisioned
capacity decreases you can perform on your DynamoDB table per day. A day is defined
according to Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). You start each day with 4
available decreases. Each hour, 1 additional decrease becomes available, up to
the maximum of 4 available at any time. Over a full 24-hour day, this allows
you to decrease up to 27 times (4 in the first hour, plus 1 for
each of the remaining 23 hours).

###### Important

Table and global secondary index decrease limits are
decoupled, so any global secondary indexes for a particular table have their
own decrease limits. However, if a single request decreases the throughput
for a table and a global secondary index, it is rejected if either exceeds
the current limits. Requests are not partially processed.

###### Example

In the first 4 hours of a day, a table with a global secondary index can
be modified as follows:

- Decrease the table's `WriteCapacityUnits` or
`ReadCapacityUnits` (or both) four times.

- Decrease the `WriteCapacityUnits` or
`ReadCapacityUnits` (or both) of the global secondary
index four times.

At the end of that same day, the table and the global secondary index
throughput can potentially be decreased a total of 27 times each.

## Reserved Capacity

AWS places a default quota on the amount of active reserved capacity that your
account can purchase. The quota limit is a combination of reserved capacity for write
capacity units (WCUs) and read capacity units (RCUs).

Reserved capacity quotaActive reserved capacityAdjustable

Per account

1,000,000 provisioned capacity units (WCUs \_ RCUs)

Yes

If you attempt to purchase more than 1,000,000 provisioned capacity units in a single
purchase, you will receive an error for this service quota limit. If you have active
reserved capacity and attempt to purchase additional reserved capacity that would result
in more than 1,000,000 active provisioned capacity units, you will receive an error for
this service quota limit.

## Tables

### Table size

There is no practical limit on a table's size. Tables are unconstrained in terms
of the number of items or the number of bytes.

### Maximum number of tables per account per region

For any AWS account, there is an initial quota of 2,500 tables per AWS
Region.

If you need more than 2,500 tables for a single account, please reach out to your
AWS account team to explore an increase up to a maximum of 10,000 tables. For more
than 10,000, the recommended best practice is to setup multiple accounts, each of
which can serve up to 10,000 tables.

## Global tables

The following default quotas apply when using global tables.

###### Note

There may be instances where you will need to request a quota limit increase
through AWS Support. If any of the following apply to you, please see [https://aws.amazon.com/support](https://aws.amazon.com/support):

- Global table throughput quotas must be equal to or greater than per table
throughput quotas for replica creation to succeed. There are separate global
table throughput quotas for MREC and MRSC global tables.

- If you are adding a replica or replicas to one destination Region within a
24-hour period with a combined total greater than 10TB, you must request a
service quota increase for your add replica data backfill quota.

- If you encounter an error similar to the following:

- Cannot create a replica of table 'example\_table' in region
'example\_region\_A' because its exceeds your current account limit in
region 'example\_region\_B'.

## Secondary indexes

You can define up to 5 local secondary indexes per table.

There is a default quota of 20 global secondary indexes per table.

## Projected secondary index attributes

You can project up to 100 attributes combined for all of a table's local and global
secondary indexes. This quota only applies to user-specified projected
attributes.

For the `CreateTable` operation, if you specify a
`ProjectionType` of `INCLUDE`, the total count of attributes
specified in `NonKeyAttributes` summed across all secondary indexes must not
exceed 100. Projecting the same attribute name into two different indexes counts as two
distinct attributes toward the quota.

This quota doesn't apply to secondary indexes with a `ProjectionType` of
`KEYS_ONLY` or `ALL`.

## DynamoDB Streams

### Simultaneous readers of a shard in DynamoDB Streams

For single-Region tables that are not global tables, you can design for up to two
simultaneous processes to read from the same DynamoDB Streams shard at the same time. Exceeding
this limit can result in request throttling. For global tables, we recommend you
limit the number of simultaneous readers to one to avoid request throttling.

### Maximum write capacity for a table with DynamoDB Streams enabled

AWS places some default quotas on the write capacity for DynamoDB tables with DynamoDB
Streams enabled. These default quotas are applicable only for tables in provisioned
read/write capacity mode.

- Per table – 40,000 write capacity units

## Import from Amazon S3

DynamoDB Import from Amazon S3 can support up to 50 concurrent import jobs with a total import
source object size of 15TB at a time in us-east-1, us-west-2, and eu-west-1 regions. In
all other regions, up to 50 concurrent import tasks with a total size of 1TB is
supported. Each import job can take up to 50,000 Amazon S3 objects in all regions. For more
information on import and validation, see [import format quotas and validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/S3DataImport.Validation.html#S3DataImport.Validation.limits).

## Table export to Amazon S3

Full export: up to 300 concurrent export tasks, or up to a total of 100TB from all
in-flight table exports, can be exported. Both of these limits are checked before an
export is queued.

Incremental export: DynamoDB Incremental Export to Amazon S3 can support up to 300 concurrent
export jobs or up to a total of 100TB from all in-flight table exports. The export
period window limits are 15 minutes minimum and 24 hours maximum.

## Backup and restore

DynamoDB supports up to 50 concurrent restores totaling 50 TB via DynamoDB on-demand or
continuous backups. AWS Backup supports up to 50 concurrent restores totaling 25
TB.

## Contributor Insights

When you enable Customer Insights on your DynamoDB table, you're still subject to
Contributor Insights rules limits. For more information, see [CloudWatch service quotas](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-limits.md).
