# CloudWatch throttling metrics

This page provides a comprehensive guide to CloudWatch metrics specifically designed to help you
identify, diagnose, and resolve throttling issues in your DynamoDB tables and indexes.

**General throttling metrics**

- `ThrottledRequests`

- Incremented by one when any event within a request is
throttled, regardless of how many individual events within that
request are throttled. For example, when updating an item in a
table with Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs), multiple events
occur: a write operation to the base table and a write operation
to each index. If any of these individual events are throttled,
the `ThrottledRequests` metric is only incremented
once.

This behavior is important to understand when monitoring and
troubleshooting DynamoDB performance, as it may mask the true
extent of throttling. For more comprehensive insights, compare
the `ThrottledRequests` metric with the specific
event-level metrics like `ReadThrottleEvents`,
`WriteThrottleEvents`, and targeted metrics such
as `ReadKeyRangeThroughputThrottleEvents` for
example. The complete list of these cause-specific metrics is
available in this page. Each metric corresponds to particular
throttling reasons that are captured within the throttling
exception. For guidance on retrieving and interpreting these
reasons during throttling events, see the [Diagnosing throttling](throttling-diagnosing-workflow.md) section which
provides instructions for identifying and resolving the root
causes of throttling issues.

- `ReadThrottleEvents`

- Watch for requests that exceed the provisioned RCU for a table
or GSI.

- `WriteThrottleEvents`

- Watch for requests that exceed the provisioned WCU for a table
or GSI.

**Detailed throttling metrics by cause**

**On-Demand throughput throttling**

- `ReadMaxOnDemandThroughputThrottleEvents`

- Number of read requests throttled due to on-demand maximum
throughput.

- `WriteMaxOnDemandThroughputThrottleEvents`

- Number of write requests throttled due to on-demand maximum
throughput.

**Account-Level throttling**

- `ReadAccountLimitThrottleEvents`

- Number of read requests throttled due to account
limits.

- `WriteAccountLimitThrottleEvents`

- Number of write requests throttled due to account
limits.

**Partition-Level throttling**

- `ReadKeyRangeThroughputThrottleEvents`

- Number of read requests throttled due to partition
limits.

- `WriteKeyRangeThroughputThrottleEvents`

- Number of write requests throttled due to partition
limits.

**Capacity analysis metrics**

- `OnlineIndexConsumedWriteCapacity`

- When you add a new GSI to an existing table, DynamoDB performs a
backfill operation that copies data from the base table to the
new index. This process consumes write capacity units. The
`OnlineIndexConsumedWriteCapacity` metric tracks
this specific consumption.

This consumption is separate from and additional to the
regular write operations tracked by
`ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits`. The regular
`ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits` metric for a GSI
does not include the write capacity consumed during the initial
index creation process.

- `ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits` and
`ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits`

- View how many provisioned read or write capacity units were
consumed over the specified time period, for a table or a
specified global secondary index.

- Note that the `TableName` dimension returns
`ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits` for the table only
by default. To view the number of provisioned read or write
capacity units for a global secondary index, you must specify
both `TableName` and
`GlobalSecondaryIndexName`.

- `ConsumedReadCapacityUnits` and
`ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits`

- View how many read or write capacity units were consumed over
the specified time period.
`ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits` does not include the
write capacity consumed during the initial index creation
process.
