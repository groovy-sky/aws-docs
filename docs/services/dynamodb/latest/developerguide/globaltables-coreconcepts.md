# Global tables core concepts

The following sections describe the concepts and behaviors of global tables in Amazon DynamoDB

## Concepts

_Global tables_ is a DynamoDB feature that replicates table data across AWS Regions.

A _replica table_ (or replica) is a DynamoDB table that functions as part of a global table.
A global table consists of two or more replica tables across different AWS Regions. Each global table can have only one replica per
AWS Region. All replicas in a global table share the same table name, primary key schema, and item data.

When an application writes data to a replica in one Region, DynamoDB automatically replicates the write to
all other replicas in the global table. For more information about how to get started with global tables,
see [Tutorials: Creating global tables](v2globaltables-tutorial.md) or [Tutorials: Creating multi-account global tables](v2globaltables-ma-tutorial.md).

## Versions

There are two versions of DynamoDB global tables available: [Global Tables version 2019.11.21 (Current)](globaltables.md) and [Global tables version 2017.11.29 (Legacy)](globaltables-v1.md). You should use Global Tables version 2019.11.21 (Current)
whenever possible. The information in this documentation section is for Version 2019.11.21 (Current). For more information, see Determining the version of a global table [Determining the version of a global table](v2globaltables-versions.md#globaltables.DetermineVersion).

## Availability

Global tables help improve your business continuity by making it easier to implement a
multi-Region high availability architecture. If a workload in a single AWS Region
becomes impaired, you can shift application traffic to a different Region and perform
reads and writes to a different replica table in the same global table.

Each replica table in a global table provides the same durability and availability as
a single-Region DynamoDB table. Global tables offer a 99.999% availability [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/sla),
compared to 99.99% for single-Region tables.

## Fault injection testing

Both MREC and MRSC global tables integrate with [AWS Fault Injection\
Service](../../../resilience-hub/latest/userguide/testing.md) (AWS FIS), a fully managed service for running controlled fault injection
experiments to improve an application's resilience. Using AWS FIS, you can:

- Create experiment templates that define specific failure scenarios.

- Inject failures to validate application resilience by simulating Region isolation (that is,
pausing replication to and from a selected replica) to test error handling, recovery mechanisms,
and multi-Region traffic shift behavior when one AWS Region experiences disruption.

For example, in a global table with replicas in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and
US West (Oregon), you can run an experiment in US East (Ohio) to test region isolation there
while US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) continue normal operations. This controlled
testing helps you identify and resolve potential issues before they affect production workloads.

See [Action targets](../../../fis/latest/userguide/action-sequence.md#action-targets) in the _AWS FIS user guide_ for a complete list of
AWS FIS supported actions and [Cross-Region Connectivity](../../../fis/latest/userguide/cross-region-scenario.md) to pause DynamoDB replication between regions.

For information about Amazon DynamoDB global table actions available in AWS FIS,
see [DynamoDB\
global tables actions reference](../../../fis/latest/userguide/fis-actions-reference.md#dynamodb-actions-reference) in the _AWS FIS User Guide_.

your AWS FIS experiments](../../../fis/latest/userguide/getting-started-planning.md) in the AWS FIS user guide.

###### Note

During AWS FIS experiments in MRSC, eventually consistent
reads are permitted, but table setting updates - such as changing billing mode
or configuring table throughput - are not allowed, similar to MREC. Please check the
CloudWatch metric [FaultInjectionServiceInducedErrors](metrics-dimensions.md#FaultInjectionServiceInducedErrors)
for additional details regarding the error code.

## Time To Live (TTL)

Global tables configured for MREC support configuring [Time To\
Live](ttl.md) (TTL) deletion. TTL settings are automatically synchronized for all
replicas in a global table. When TTL deletes an item from a replica in a Region, the
delete is replicated to all other replicas in the global table. TTL does not consume
write capacity, so you are not charged for the TTL delete in the Region where the delete
occurred. However, you are charged for the replicated delete in each other region with a
replica in the global table.

TTL delete replication consumes write capacity on the replicas to which the delete is
being replicated. Replicas configured for provisioned capacity may throttle requests if
the combination of write throughput and TTL delete throughput is higher than the
provisioned write capacity.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not support
configuring Time To Live (TTL) deletion.

## Streams

Global tables configured for multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC) replicate
changes by reading those changes from a [DynamoDB Stream](streams.md) on a
replica table and applying that change to all other replica tables. Streams are
therefore enabled by default on all replicas in an MREC global table, and cannot be
disabled on those replicas. The MREC replication process may combine multiple changes in
a short period of time into a single replicated write, resulting in each replica's
Stream containing slightly different records. Streams records on MREC replicas
maintain ordering for all changes to the same item, but the relative ordering of
changes to different items may vary across replicas.

If you want to write an application that processes Streams records for changes that
occurred in a particular Region but not other Regions in a global table, you can add an
attribute to each item that defines in which Region the change for that item occurred.
You can use this attribute to filter Streams records for changes that occurred in other
Regions, including the use of Lambda event filters to only invoke Lambda functions for
changes in a specific Region.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not use DynamoDB
Streams for replication, so Streams are not enabled by default on MRSC replicas. You can
enable Streams on an MRSC replica. Streams records on MRSC replicas are identical for
every replica, including Stream record ordering.

## Transactions

On a global table configured for MREC, DynamoDB transaction operations ( [`TransactWriteItems`](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-transactwriteitems.md) and [`TransactGetItems`](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-transactgetitems.md)) are only atomic within the Region where
the operation was invoked. Transactional writes are not replicated as a unit across
Regions, meaning only some of the writes in a transaction may be returned by read
operations in other replicas at a given point in time.

For example, if you have a global table with replicas in the US East (Ohio) and
US West (Oregon) Regions and perform a `TransactWriteItems` operation in
the US East (Ohio) Region, you may observe partially completed transactions in the
US West (Oregon) Region as changes are replicated. Changes will only be replicated to
other Regions once they've been committed in the source Region.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not support
transaction operations, and will return an error if those operations are invoked on an
MRSC replica.

## Read and write throughput

### Provisioned mode

Replication consumes write capacity. Replicas configured for provisioned capacity may throttle requests
if the combination of application write throughput and replication write throughput exceeds the provisioned
write capacity. For global tables using provisioned mode, auto scaling settings for both read and write capacities
are synchronized between replicas.

You can independently configure read capacity settings for each replica in a global table by
using the [`ProvisionedThroughputOverride`](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-provisionedthroughputoverride.md) parameter at the replica level. By default, changes to
provisioned read capacity are applied to all replicas in the global table. When adding a new
replica to a global table, the read capacity of the source table or replica is used as the
initial value unless a replica-level override is explicitly specified.

### On-demand mode

For global tables configured for on-demand mode, write capacity is automatically synchronized
across all replicas. DynamoDB automatically adjusts capacity based on traffic, and there are no
replica-specific read or write capacity settings to manage.

## Monitoring global tables

Global tables configured for multi-Region eventual consistency (MREC) publish the
[ReplicationLatency](metrics-dimensions.md#ReplicationLatency) metric to
CloudWatch. This metric tracks the elapsed time between when an item is written to a replica
table, and when that item appears in another replica in the global table.
`ReplicationLatency` is expressed in milliseconds and is emitted for
every source and destination Region pair in a global table.

Typical `ReplicationLatency` values depends on the distance between your
chosen AWS Regions, as well as other variables like workload type and throughput. For
example, a source replica in the US West (N. California) (us-west-1) Region has lower
`ReplicationLatency` to the US West (Oregon) (us-west-2) Region
compared to the Africa (Cape Town) (af-south-1) Region.

An increasing value for `ReplicationLatency` could indicate that updates
from one replica are not propagating to other replica tables in a timely manner. In this
case, you can temporarily redirect your application's read and write activity to a
different AWS Region.

Global tables configured for multi-Region strong consistency (MRSC) do not publish a
`ReplicationLatency` metric.

## Considerations for managing global tables

You can't delete a table used to add a new global table replica until 24 hours have
elapsed since the new replica was created.

If you disable an AWS Region that contains global table replicas, those replicas are
permanently converted to single-Region tables 20 hours after the Region is
disabled.
