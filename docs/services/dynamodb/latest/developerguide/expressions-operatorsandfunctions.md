# Condition and filter expressions, operators, and functions in DynamoDB
<a name="Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions"></a>

To manipulate data in an DynamoDB table, you use the `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, and `DeleteItem` operations. For these data manipulation operations, you can specify a condition expression to determine which items should be modified. If the condition expression evaluates to true, the operation succeeds. Otherwise, the operation fails.

This section covers the built-in functions and keywords for writing filter expressions and condition expressions in Amazon DynamoDB. For more detailed information on functions and programming with DynamoDB, see [Programming with DynamoDB and the AWS SDKs](Programming.md) and the [DynamoDB API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/).

## Syntax for filter and condition expressions
<a name="Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.Syntax"></a>

In the following syntax summary, an {{operand}} can be the following:
+ A top-level attribute name, such as `Id`, `Title`, `Description`, or `ProductCategory`
+ A document path that references a nested attribute

```
condition-expression ::=
      {{operand}} comparator {{operand}}
    | {{operand}} BETWEEN {{operand}} AND {{operand}}
    | {{operand}} IN ( {{operand}} (',' {{operand}} (, ...) ))
    | function
    | {{condition}} AND {{condition}}
    | {{condition}} OR {{condition}}
    | NOT {{condition}}
    | ( {{condition}} )

comparator ::=
    =
    | <>
    | <
    | <=
    | >
    | >=

function ::=
    attribute_exists ({{path}})
    | attribute_not_exists ({{path}})
    | attribute_type ({{path}}, {{type}})
    | begins_with ({{path}}, {{substr}})
    | contains ({{path}}, {{operand}})
    | size ({{path}})
```

## Making comparisons
<a name="Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.Comparators"></a>

Use these comparators to compare an operand against a single value:
+ `{{a}} = {{b}}` – True if {{a}} is equal to {{b}}.
+ `{{a}} <> {{b}}` – True if {{a}} is not equal to {{b}}.
+ `{{a}} < {{b}}` – True if {{a}} is less than {{b}}.
+ `{{a}} <= {{b}}` – True if {{a}} is less than or equal to {{b}}.
+ `{{a}} > {{b}}` – True if {{a}} is greater than {{b}}.
+ `{{a}} >= {{b}}` – True if {{a}} is greater than or equal to {{b}}.

Use the `BETWEEN` and `IN` keywords to compare an operand against a range of values or an enumerated list of values:
+ `{{a}} BETWEEN {{b}} AND {{c}}` – True if {{a}} is greater than or equal to {{b}}, and less than or equal to {{c}}.
+ `{{a}} IN ({{b}}, {{c}}, {{d}}) ` – True if {{a}} is equal to any value in the list—for example, any of {{b}}, {{c}}, or {{d}}. The list can contain up to 100 values, separated by commas.

To filter on a Boolean attribute, compare it to a Boolean value by using the `=` or `<>` operator—you can't reference the attribute on its own as a condition. Supply the Boolean value in the expression attribute values. For example, the following filter expression returns only items whose `isVisible` attribute is `true`:

```
--filter-expression "isVisible = :visible" \
--expression-attribute-values '{":visible": {"BOOL": true}}'
```

## Functions
<a name="Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.Functions"></a>

Use the following functions to determine whether an attribute exists in an item, or to evaluate the value of an attribute. These function names are case sensitive. For a nested attribute, you must provide its full document path.

****

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `attribute_exists ({{path}})` | True if the item contains the attribute specified by `path`.<br />An attribute whose stored value is the null type (`NULL`) is still considered to exist, so `attribute_exists` returns true for it. This is different from an attribute that is absent from the item. Some SDKs and object mappers omit attributes that have a null value in your application instead of storing the `NULL` type, in which case the attribute is not present and `attribute_exists` returns false.<br />Example: Check whether an item in the `Product` table has a side view picture.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html) |
| `attribute_not_exists ({{path}})` | True if the attribute specified by `path` does not exist in the item.<br />Example: Check whether an item has a `Manufacturer` attribute.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html) |
| `attribute_type ({{path}}, {{type}})` | True if the attribute at the specified path is of a particular data type. The `type` parameter must be one of the following:[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br />You must use an expression attribute value for the `type` parameter.<br />Example: Check whether the `QuantityOnHand` attribute is of type List. In this example, `:v_sub` is a placeholder for the string `L`.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br />You must use an expression attribute value for the `type` parameter.  |
| `begins_with ({{path}}, {{substr}})` | True if the attribute specified by `path` begins with a particular substring.<br />Example: Check whether the first few characters of the front view picture URL are `http://`.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br />The expression attribute value `:v_sub` is a placeholder for `http://`. |
| `contains ({{path}}, {{operand}})` | True if the attribute specified by `path` is one of the following:[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br />If the attribute specified by `path` is a `String`, the `operand` must be a `String`. If the attribute specified by `path` is a `Set`, the `operand` must be the set's element type.<br />The path and the operand must be distinct. That is, `contains (a, a)` returns an error.<br />Example: Check whether the `Brand` attribute contains the substring `Company`.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br />The expression attribute value `:v_sub` is a placeholder for `Company`.<br />Example: Check whether the product is available in red.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br />The expression attribute value `:v_sub` is a placeholder for `Red`. |
| `size ({{path}})` | Returns a number that represents an attribute's size. The following are valid data types for use with `size`.<br /><br />If the attribute is of type `String`, `size` returns the length of the string.<br />Example: Check whether the string `Brand` is less than or equal to 20 characters. The expression attribute value `:v_sub` is a placeholder for `20`.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br /><br />If the attribute is of type `Binary`, `size` returns the number of bytes in the attribute value.<br />Example: Suppose that the `ProductCatalog` item has a binary attribute named `VideoClip` that contains a short video of the product in use. The following expression checks whether `VideoClip` exceeds 64,000 bytes. The expression attribute value `:v_sub` is a placeholder for `64000`. [See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br /><br />If the attribute is a `Set` data type, `size` returns the number of elements in the set. <br />Example: Check whether the product is available in more than one color. The expression attribute value `:v_sub` is a placeholder for `1`.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html)<br /><br />If the attribute is of type `List` or `Map`, `size` returns the number of child elements.<br />Example: Check whether the number of `OneStar` reviews has exceeded a certain threshold. The expression attribute value `:v_sub` is a placeholder for `3`.[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.html) |

## Logical evaluations
<a name="Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.LogicalEvaluations"></a>

Use the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` keywords to perform logical evaluations. In the following list, {{a}} and {{b}} represent conditions to be evaluated.
+ `{{a}} AND {{b}}` – True if {{a}} and {{b}} are both true.
+ `{{a}} OR {{b}}` – True if either {{a}} or {{b}} (or both) are true.
+ `NOT {{a}}` – True if {{a}} is false. False if {{a}} is true.

The following is a code example of AND in an operation.

`dynamodb-local (*)> select * from exprtest where a > 3 and a < 5;`

## Parentheses
<a name="Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.Parentheses"></a>

Use parentheses to change the precedence of a logical evaluation. For example, suppose that conditions {{a}} and {{b}} are true, and that condition {{c}} is false. The following expression evaluates to true:
+ `{{a}} OR {{b}} AND {{c}}`

However, if you enclose a condition in parentheses, it is evaluated first. For example, the following evaluates to false:
+  `({{a}} OR {{b}}) AND {{c}}`

**Note**
You can nest parentheses in an expression. The innermost ones are evaluated first.

The following is a code example with parentheses in a logical evaluation.

`dynamodb-local (*)> select * from exprtest where attribute_type(b, string) or ( a = 5 and c = “coffee”);`

## Precedence in conditions
<a name="Expressions.OperatorsAndFunctions.Precedence"></a>

 DynamoDB evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:
+ `= <> < <= > >=`
+ `IN`
+ `BETWEEN`
+ `attribute_exists attribute_not_exists begins_with contains`
+ Parentheses
+ `NOT`
+ `AND`
+ `OR`
