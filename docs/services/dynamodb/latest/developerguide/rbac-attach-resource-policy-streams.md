# Attach a resource-based policy to a DynamoDB stream
<a name="rbac-attach-resource-policy-streams"></a>

You can attach a resource-based policy to an existing table's stream or modify an existing policy by using the DynamoDB console, [PutResourcePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_PutResourcePolicy.html) API, the AWS CLI, AWS SDK, or an [CloudFormation template](rbac-create-table.md#rbac-create-table-cfn).

**Note**
You can't attach a policy to a stream while creating it using the [CreateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html) or [UpdateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTable.html) APIs. However, you can modify or delete a policy after a table is deleted. You can also modify or delete the policy of a disabled stream.

## AWS CLI
<a name="rbac-attach-policy-stream-CLI"></a>

The following IAM policy example uses the `put-resource-policy` AWS CLI command to attach a resource-based policy to the stream of a table named {{MusicCollection}}. This example allows the user {{John}} to perform the [GetRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_GetRecords.html), [GetShardIterator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_GetShardIterator.html), and [DescribeStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_DescribeStream.html) API actions on the stream.

Remember to replace the {{italicized}} text with your resource-specific information.

```
aws dynamodb put-resource-policy \
    --resource-arn arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:{{123456789012}}:table/{{MusicCollection}}/stream/{{2024-02-12T18:57:26.492}} \
    --policy \
        "{
            \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",
            \"Statement\": [
              {
                    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",
                    \"Principal\": {
                        \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::{{111122223333}}:user/{{John}}\"
                    },
                    \"Action\": [
                        \"dynamodb:GetRecords\",
                        \"dynamodb:GetShardIterator\",
                        \"dynamodb:DescribeStream\"
                    ],
                    \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:{{123456789012}}:table/{{MusicCollection}}/stream/{{2024-02-12T18:57:26.492}}\"
                }
            ]
        }"
```

## AWS Management Console
<a name="rbac-attach-policy-stream-console"></a>

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

1. On the DynamoDB console dashboard, choose **Tables** and then select an existing table.

   Make sure the table you select has streams turned on. For information about turning on streams for a table, see [Enabling a stream](Streams.md#Streams.Enabling).

1. Choose the **Permissions** tab.

1. In **Resource-based policy for active stream**, choose **Create stream policy**.

1. In the **Resource-based policy** editor, add a policy to define the access permissions for the stream. In this policy, you specify who has access to the stream and the actions they are allowed to perform on the stream. To add a policy, do one of the following:
   + Type or paste a JSON policy document. For details about the IAM policy language, see [Creating policies using the JSON editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-json-editor) in the *IAM User Guide*.
**Tip**
To see examples of resource-based policies in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide, choose **Policy examples**.
   + Choose **Add new statement** to add a new statement and enter the information in the provided fields. Repeat this step for as many statements as you would like to add.
**Important**
Make sure that you resolve any security warnings, errors, or suggestions before you save your policy.

1. (Optional) Choose **Preview external access** in the lower-right corner to preview how your new policy affects public and cross-account access to your resource. Before you save your policy, you can check whether it introduces new IAM Access Analyzer findings or resolves existing findings. If you don’t see an active analyzer, choose **Go to Access Analyzer** to [create an account analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-getting-started.html#access-analyzer-enabling) in IAM Access Analyzer. For more information, see [Preview access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-access-preview.html).

1. Choose **Create policy**.

The following IAM policy example attaches a resource-based policy to the stream of a table named {{MusicCollection}}. This example allows the user {{John}} to perform the [GetRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_GetRecords.html), [GetShardIterator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_GetShardIterator.html), and [DescribeStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_DescribeStream.html) API actions on the stream.

Remember to replace the {{italicized}} text with your resource-specific information.
