# DynamoDB resource-based policy examples

When you specify an ARN in the `Resource` field of a resource-based policy, the
policy takes effect only if the specified ARN matches the ARN of the DynamoDB resource to which
it is attached.

###### Note

Remember to replace the `italicized` text with your resource-specific information.

## Resource-based policy for a table

The following resource-based policy attached to a DynamoDB table named
`MusicCollection`, gives the IAM users
`John` and `Jane` permission to
perform [GetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-getitem.md) and [BatchGetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-batchgetitem.md) actions on the `MusicCollection`
resource.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "1111",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": [
            "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/username",
            "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Jane"
          ]
        },
        "Action": [
          "dynamodb:GetItem",
          "dynamodb:BatchGetItem"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection"
        ]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Resource-based policy for a stream

The following resource-based policy attached to a DynamoDB stream named
`2024-02-12T18:57:26.492` gives the IAM users
`John` and `Jane` permission to
perform [GetRecords](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-streams-getrecords.md),
[GetShardIterator](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-streams-getsharditerator.md), and [DescribeStream](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-streams-describestream.md) API actions on the `2024-02-12T18:57:26.492`
resource.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "1111",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/username",
          "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Jane"
        ]
      },
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:DescribeStream",
        "dynamodb:GetRecords",
        "dynamodb:GetShardIterator"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/stream/2024-02-12T18:57:26.492"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Resource-based policy for access to perform all actions on specified resources

To allow a user to perform all actions on a table and all associated indexes with a
table, you can use a wildcard (\*) to represent the actions and the resources associated with
the table. Using a wild card character for the resources, will allow the user access to the
DynamoDB table and all its associated indexes, including the ones that haven’t yet been
created. For example, the following policy will give the user
`John` permission to perform any actions on the
`MusicCollection` table and all of its indexes, including any
indexes that will be created in the future.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "1111",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/role-name"
      },
      "Action": "dynamodb:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/index/index-name"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

## Resource-based policy for cross-account access

You can specify permissions for a cross-account IAM identity to access DynamoDB
resources. For example, you might need a user from a trusted account to get access to read
the contents of your table, with the condition that they access only specific items and
specific attributes in those items. The following policy allows access to user
`John` from a trusted AWS account ID
`111111111111` to access data from a table in account
`123456789012` by using the [GetItem](../../../../reference/amazondynamodb/latest/apireference/api-getitem.md) API. The policy
ensures that the user can access only items with a primary key
`Jane` and that the user can only retrieve the attributes
`Artist` and `SongTitle`, but no other attributes.

###### Important

If you do not specify the `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` condition, you'll see all
attributes for the items returned.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CrossAccountTablePolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/John"
            },
            "Action": "dynamodb:GetItem",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
                    "dynamodb:LeadingKeys": "Jane",
                    "dynamodb:Attributes": [
                        "Artist",
                        "SongTitle"
                    ]
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "dynamodb:Select": "SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

In addition to the preceding resource-based policy, the identity-based policy attached
to the user `John` also needs to allow the
`GetItem` API action for the cross-account access to work. The following is an
example of an identity-based policy that you must attach to the user
`John`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CrossAccountIdentityBasedPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
                    "dynamodb:LeadingKeys": "Jane",
                    "dynamodb:Attributes": [
                        "Artist",
                        "SongTitle"
                    ]
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "dynamodb:Select": "SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The user John can make a `GetItem` request by specifying the table ARN
in the `table-name` parameter for accessing the table
`MusicCollection` in the account
`123456789012`.

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb get-item \
    --table-name arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection \
    --key '{"Artist": {"S": "Jane"}' \
    --projection-expression 'Artist, SongTitle' \
    --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL
```

## Resource-based policy with IP address conditions

You can apply a condition to restrict source IP addresses, virtual private clouds
(VPCs), and VPC endpoint (VPCE). You can specify permissions based on the source addresses
of the originating request. For example, you might want to allow a user to access DynamoDB
resources only if they are being accessed from a specific IP source, such as a corporate VPN
endpoint. Specify these IP addresses in the `Condition` statement.

The following example allows the user `John` access to
any DynamoDB resource when the source IPs are `54.240.143.0/24` and
`2001:DB8:1234:5678::/64`.

JSON

```json

{
  "Id":"PolicyId2",
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Sid":"AllowIPmix",
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/username"
      },
      "Action":"dynamodb:*",
      "Resource":"*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": [
            "54.240.143.0/24",
            "2001:DB8:1234:5678::/64"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

You can also deny all access to DynamoDB resources except when the source is a specific VPC
endpoint, for example `vpce-1a2b3c4d`.

###### Important

When you use DAX with DynamoDB tables that have IP-based resource policies in IPv6-only
environments, you must configure additional access rules. If your resource policy
restricts access to the IPv4 address space `0.0.0.0/0` on tables, you must
allow access for the IAM role associated with your DAX cluster. Add an
`ArnNotEquals` condition to your policy to ensure DAX maintains access to
your DynamoDB tables. For more information see, [DAX and IPv6](dax-create-cluster-dax-and-ipv6.md).

JSON

```json

{
  "Id":"PolicyId",
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AccessToSpecificVPCEOnly",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "dynamodb:*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals":{
          "aws:sourceVpce":"vpce-1a2b3c4d"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

## Resource-based policy using an IAM role

You can also specify an IAM service role in the resource-based policy. IAM entities
that assume this role are bounded by the permissible actions specified for the role and to
the specific set of resources within the resource-based policy.

The following example allows an IAM entity to perform all DynamoDB actions on the
`MusicCollection` and `MusicCollection`
DynamoDB resources.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "1111",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/role-name" },
      "Action": "dynamodb:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
