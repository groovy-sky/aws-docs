# Supported data types and naming rules in Amazon DynamoDB

This section describes the Amazon DynamoDB naming rules and the various data types that
DynamoDB supports. There are limits that apply to data types. For more information, see
[Data types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Constraints.html#limits-data-types).

## Naming rules

Tables, attributes, and other objects in DynamoDB must have names. Names should be
meaningful and concise—for example, names such as
_Products_, _Books_, and
_Authors_ are self-explanatory.

The following are the naming rules for DynamoDB:

- All names must be encoded using UTF-8, and are case-sensitive.

- Table names and index names must be between 3 and 255 characters long, and
can contain only the following characters:

- `a-z`

- `A-Z `

- ` 0-9 `

- `_` (underscore)

- `-` (dash)

- `.` (dot)

- Attribute names must be at least one character long and less than 64 KB in
size. It is considered best practice to keep your attribute names as short
as possible. This helps reduce read request units consumed, as attribute
names are included in metering of storage and throughput usage.

The following are the exceptions. These attribute names must be no greater
than 255 characters long:

- Secondary index partition key names

- Secondary index sort key names

- The names of any user-specified projected attributes (applicable
only to local secondary indexes)

### Reserved words and special characters

DynamoDB has a list of reserved words and special characters. For a complete
list, see [Reserved words in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html). Also,
the following characters have special meaning in DynamoDB: **#** (hash) and **:** (colon).

Although DynamoDB allows you to use these reserved words and special characters
for names, we recommend that you avoid doing so because you have to define
placeholder variables whenever you use these names in an expression. For more
information, see [Expression attribute names (aliases) in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ExpressionAttributeNames.html).

## Data types

DynamoDB supports many different data types for attributes within a table. They can
be categorized as follows:

- **Scalar Types** – A scalar type can
represent exactly one value. The scalar types are number, string, binary,
Boolean, and null.

- **Document Types** – A document type
can represent a complex structure with nested attributes, such as what you
would find in a JSON document. The document types are list and map.

- **Set Types** – A set type can
represent multiple scalar values. The set types are string set, number set,
and binary set.

When you create a table or a secondary index, you must specify the names and data types of
each primary key attribute (partition key and sort key). Furthermore, each primary
key attribute must be defined as type string, number, or binary.

DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and is _schemaless_. This means that
other than the primary key attributes, you don't have to define any attributes or
data types when you create tables. By comparison, relational databases require you
to define the names and data types of each column when you create a table.

The following are descriptions of each data type, along with examples in JSON
format.

### Scalar types

The scalar types are number, string, binary, Boolean, and null.

#### Number

Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero. Numbers can have up to 38
digits of precision. Exceeding this results in an exception. If you need
greater precision than 38 digits, you can use strings.

- Positive range: 1E-130 to
9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999E+125

- Negative range: -9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999E+125 to
   -1E-130

In DynamoDB, numbers are represented as variable length. Leading and trailing
zeroes are trimmed.

All numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings to maximize
compatibility across languages and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as
number type attributes for mathematical operations.

You can use the number data type to represent a date or a timestamp. One
way to do this is by using epoch time—the number of seconds since
00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970. For example, the epoch time
`1437136300` represents 12:31:40 PM UTC on 17 July
2015.

For more information, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix\_time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

#### String

Strings are Unicode with UTF-8 binary encoding. The minimum length of a
string can be zero, if the attribute is not used as a key for an index or
table, and is constrained by the maximum DynamoDB item size limit of
400 KB.

The following additional constraints apply to primary key attributes that
are defined as type string:

- For a simple primary key, the maximum length of the first
attribute value (the partition key) is
2048 bytes.

- For a composite primary key, the maximum length of the second
attribute value (the sort key) is 1024 bytes.

DynamoDB collates and compares strings using the bytes of the underlying
UTF-8 string encoding. For example, " `a`" (0x61) is greater than
" `A`" (0x41), and " `¿`" (0xC2BF) is greater than
" `z`" (0x7A).

You can use the string data type to represent a date or a timestamp. One
way to do this is by using ISO 8601 strings, as shown in these
examples:

- `2016-02-15`

- `2015-12-21T17:42:34Z`

- `20150311T122706Z`

For more information, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

###### Note

Unlike conventional relational databases, DynamoDB does not natively
support a date and time data type. It can be useful instead to store
date and time data as a number data type, using Unix epoch time.

#### Binary

Binary type attributes can store any binary data, such as compressed text,
encrypted data, or images. Whenever DynamoDB compares binary values, it treats
each byte of the binary data as unsigned.

The length of a binary attribute can be zero, if the attribute is not used
as a key for an index or table, and is constrained by the maximum DynamoDB item
size limit of 400 KB.

If you define a primary key attribute as a binary type attribute, the
following additional constraints apply:

- For a simple primary key, the maximum length of the first
attribute value (the partition key) is
2048 bytes.

- For a composite primary key, the maximum length of the second
attribute value (the sort key) is 1024 bytes.

Your applications must encode binary values in base64-encoded format
before sending them to DynamoDB. Upon receipt of these values, DynamoDB decodes
the data into an unsigned byte array and uses that as the length of the
binary attribute.

The following example is a binary attribute, using base64-encoded
text.

```nohighlight

dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk
```

#### Boolean

A Boolean type attribute can store either `true` or
`false`.

#### Null

Null represents an attribute with an unknown or undefined state.

### Document types

The document types are list and map. These data types can be nested within
each other, to represent complex data structures up to 32
levels deep.

There is no limit on the number of values in a list or a map, as long as the
item containing the values fits within the DynamoDB item size limit
(400 KB).

An attribute value can be an empty string or empty binary value if the
attribute is not used for a table or index key. An attribute value cannot be an
empty set (string set, number set, or binary set), however, empty lists and maps
are allowed. Empty string and binary values are allowed within lists and maps.
For more information, see [Attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Constraints.html#limits-attributes).

#### List

A list type attribute can store an ordered collection of values. Lists are
enclosed in square brackets: `[ ... ]`

A list is similar to a JSON array. There are no restrictions on the data
types that can be stored in a list element, and the elements in a list
element do not have to be of the same type.

The following example shows a list that contains two strings and a
number.

```json

FavoriteThings: ["Cookies", "Coffee", 3.14159]
```

###### Note

DynamoDB lets you work with individual elements within lists, even if
those elements are deeply nested. For more information, see [Using expressions in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.html).

#### Map

A map type attribute can store an unordered collection of name-value
pairs. Maps are enclosed in curly braces: `{ ... }`

A map is similar to a JSON object. There are no restrictions on the data
types that can be stored in a map element, and the elements in a map do not
have to be of the same type.

Maps are ideal for storing JSON documents in DynamoDB. The following example
shows a map that contains a string, a number, and a nested list that
contains another map.

```json

{
    Day: "Monday",
    UnreadEmails: 42,
    ItemsOnMyDesk: [
        "Coffee Cup",
        "Telephone",
        {
            Pens: { Quantity : 3},
            Pencils: { Quantity : 2},
            Erasers: { Quantity : 1}
        }
    ]
}
```

###### Note

DynamoDB lets you work with individual elements within maps, even if
those elements are deeply nested. For more information, see [Using expressions in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.html).

### Sets

DynamoDB supports types that represent sets of number, string, or binary values.
All the elements within a set must be of the same type. For example, a Number
Set can only contain numbers and a String Set can only contain strings.

There is no limit on the number of values in a set, as long as the item
containing the values fits within the DynamoDB item size limit
(400 KB).

Each value within a set must be unique. The order of the values within a set
is not preserved. Therefore, your applications must not rely on any particular
order of elements within the set. DynamoDB does not support empty sets, however,
empty string and binary values are allowed within a set.

The following example shows a string set, a number set, and a binary
set:

```json

["Black", "Green", "Red"]

[42.2, -19, 7.5, 3.14]

["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]
```

## Data type descriptors

The low-level DynamoDB API protocol uses _Data type descriptors_ as
tokens that tell DynamoDB how to interpret each attribute.

The following is a complete list of DynamoDB data type descriptors:

- `S` – String

- `N` – Number

- `B` – Binary

- `BOOL` – Boolean

- `NULL` – Null

- `M` – Map

- `L` – List

- `SS` – String Set

- `NS` – Number Set

- `BS` – Binary Set
