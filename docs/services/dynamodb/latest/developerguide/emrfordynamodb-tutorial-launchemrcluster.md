# Step 2: Launch an Amazon EMR cluster

In this step, you will configure and launch an Amazon EMR cluster. Hive and a storage
handler for DynamoDB will already be installed on the cluster.

1. Open the Amazon EMR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/emr](https://console.aws.amazon.com/emr).

2. Choose **Create Cluster**.

3. On the **Create Cluster - Quick Options** page, do the
    following:

1. In **Cluster name**, type a name for your cluster
       (for example: `My EMR cluster`).

2. In **EC2 key pair**, choose the key pair you
       created earlier.

Leave the other settings at their defaults.

4. Choose **Create cluster**.

It will take several minutes to launch your cluster. You can use the
**Cluster Details** page in the Amazon EMR console to monitor its
progress.

When the status changes to `Waiting`, the cluster is ready for
use.

## Cluster log files and Amazon S3

An Amazon EMR cluster generates log files that contain information about the
cluster status and debugging information. The default settings for
**Create Cluster - Quick Options** include setting up Amazon EMR
logging.

If one does not already exist, the AWS Management Console creates an Amazon S3 bucket. The
bucket name is
`aws-logs-account-id-region`,
where `
                        account-id` is your AWS account number
and `region` is the region in which you
launched the cluster (for example,
`aws-logs-123456789012-us-west-2`).

###### Note

You can use the Amazon S3 console to view the log files. For more information,
see [View Log Files](../../../elasticmapreduce/latest/managementguide/emr-manage-view-web-log-files.md) in the _Amazon EMR Management_
_Guide_.

You can use this bucket for purposes in addition to logging. For example, you
can use the bucket as a location for storing a Hive script or as a destination
when exporting data from Amazon DynamoDB to Amazon S3.
