# Point-in-time backups for DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides automatic continuous backups of your DynamoDB
table data. Point-in-time recovery (PITR) backups are fully managed by DynamoDB and provide up to 35
days of recovery points at a per second granularity. With point-in-time recovery, you don't have
to worry about creating, maintaining, or scheduling on-demand backups. This section provides an
overview of how the process works in DynamoDB.

## Before you begin

Before you enable point-in-time recovery (PITR) on an Amazon DynamoDB table, consider the
following:

- Setting the `RecoveryPeriodinDays` allows you to shorten the time period for which continuous backups are taken. By default, your `RecoveryPeriodinDays` is 35. However, you can set it to be any value between 1 and 35. Shortening the `RecoveryPeriodinDays` has no impact on PITR pricing because the price is based on the size of table and local secondary indexes.

- If you disable point-in-time recovery and later re-enable it on a table, you reset the
start time for which you can recover that table. As a result, you can only immediately
restore that table using the `LatestRestorableDateTime`.

- You can enable point-in-time recovery on each local replica of a global table. When you
restore the table, the backup restores to an independent table that is not part of the
global table. If you are using [Global Tables version 2019.11.21 (Current)](globaltables.md) of global tables, you can create a new global table from
the restored table. For more information, see [How DynamoDB global tables work](v2globaltables-howitworks.md).

- You can also restore your DynamoDB table data across AWS Regions such that the restored
table is created in a different Region from where the source table resides. You can do
cross-Region restores between AWS commercial Regions, AWS China Regions, and AWS GovCloud
(US) Regions. You pay only for the data you transfer out of the source Region and for
restoring to a new table in the destination Region.

- AWS CloudTrail logs all console and API actions for point-in-time recovery to enable logging,
continuous monitoring, and auditing. For more information, see [Logging DynamoDB operations by using AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md).
