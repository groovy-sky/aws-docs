# Change data capture for DynamoDB Streams

DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table
and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. Applications can access this
log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in
near-real time.

Encryption at rest encrypts the data in DynamoDB streams. For more information, see
[DynamoDB encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/EncryptionAtRest.html).

A _DynamoDB stream_ is an ordered flow of information about changes to
items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information
about every modification to data items in the table.

Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a
stream record with the primary key attributes of the items that were modified. A
_stream record_ contains information about a data modification to
a single item in a DynamoDB table. You can configure the stream so that the stream records
capture additional information, such as the "before" and "after" images of modified
items.

DynamoDB Streams helps ensure the following:

- Each stream record appears exactly once in the stream.

- For each item that is modified in a DynamoDB table, the stream records appear in
the same sequence as the actual modifications to the item.

DynamoDB Streams writes stream records in near-real time so that you can build applications that
consume these streams and take action based on the contents.

## Endpoints for DynamoDB Streams

AWS maintains separate endpoints for DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams. To work with database
tables and indexes, your application must access a DynamoDB endpoint. To read and
process DynamoDB Streams records, your application must access a DynamoDB Streams endpoint in the same
Region.

DynamoDB Streams offers two sets of endpoints. They are:

- **IPv4-only endpoints**: Endpoints with the
`streams.dynamodb.<region>.amazonaws.com`
naming convention.

- **Dual-stack endpoints**: New endpoints that
are compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6 and follows the
`streams-dynamodb.<region>.api.aws`
naming convention.

###### Note

For a complete list of DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the
_AWS General Reference_.

The AWS SDKs provide separate clients for DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams. Depending on your
requirements, your application can access a DynamoDB endpoint, a DynamoDB Streams endpoint, or both
at the same time. To connect to both endpoints, your application must instantiate
two clients—one for DynamoDB and one for DynamoDB Streams.

## Enabling a stream

You can enable a stream on a new table when you create it using the AWS CLI or one
of the AWS SDKs. You can also enable or disable a stream on an existing table, or
change the settings of a stream. DynamoDB Streams operates asynchronously, so there is no
performance impact on a table if you enable a stream.

The easiest way to manage DynamoDB Streams is by using the AWS Management Console.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the DynamoDB console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb).

2. On the DynamoDB console dashboard, choose **Tables** and
    select an existing table.

3. Choose the **Exports and streams** tab.

4. In the **DynamoDB stream details** section, choose **Turn on**.

5. On the **Turn on DynamoDB stream** page, choose the
    information that will be written to the stream whenever the data in the
    table is modified:

- **Key attributes only** — Only the key
attributes of the modified item.

- **New image** — The entire item, as it
appears after it was modified.

- **Old image** — The entire item, as it
appeared before it was modified.

- **New and old images** — Both the new and
the old images of the item.

When the settings are as you want them, choose **Turn on**
**stream**.

6. (Optional) To disable an existing stream, choose
    **Turn off** under **DynamoDB stream**
**details**.

You can also use the `CreateTable` or `UpdateTable` API
operations to enable or modify a stream. The `StreamSpecification`
parameter determines how the stream is configured:

- `StreamEnabled` — Specifies whether a stream is enabled
( `true`) or disabled ( `false`) for the
table.

- `StreamViewType` — Specifies the information that will be
written to the stream whenever data in the table is modified:

- `KEYS_ONLY` — Only the key attributes of the
modified item.

- `NEW_IMAGE` — The entire item, as it appears
after it was modified.

- `OLD_IMAGE` — The entire item, as it appeared
before it was modified.

- `NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES` — Both the new and the old
images of the item.

You can enable or disable a stream at any time. However, you receive a `ValidationException` if you try to enable a stream on a table that already has a stream. You also receive a `ValidationException` if you try to disable a stream on a table that doesn't have a stream.

When you set `StreamEnabled` to `true`, DynamoDB creates a new
stream with a unique stream descriptor assigned to it. If you disable and then
re-enable a stream on the table, a new stream is created with a different stream
descriptor.

Every stream is uniquely identified by an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). The
following is an example ARN for a stream on a DynamoDB table named
`TestTable`.

```nohighlight

arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:111122223333:table/TestTable/stream/2015-05-11T21:21:33.291
```

To determine the latest stream descriptor for a table, issue a DynamoDB
`DescribeTable` request and look for the `LatestStreamArn`
element in the response.

###### Note

It is not possible to edit a `StreamViewType` once a stream has
been setup. If you need to make changes to a stream after it has been setup, you
must disable the current stream and create a new one.

## Reading and processing a stream

To read and process a stream, your application must connect to a DynamoDB Streams endpoint and
issue API requests.

A stream consists of _stream records_. Each stream record
represents a single data modification in the DynamoDB table to which the stream
belongs. Each stream record is assigned a sequence number, reflecting the order in
which the record was published to the stream.

Stream records are organized into groups, or _shards_. Each
shard acts as a container for multiple stream records, and contains information
required for accessing and iterating through these records. The stream records
within a shard are removed automatically after 24 hours.

Shards are ephemeral: They are created and deleted automatically, as needed. Any
shard can also split into multiple new shards; this also occurs automatically. (It's
also possible for a parent shard to have just one child shard.) A shard might split
in response to high levels of write activity on its parent table, so that
applications can process records from multiple shards in parallel.

If you disable a stream, any shards that are open will be closed. The data in the
stream will continue to be readable for 24 hours.

Because shards have a lineage (parent and children), an application must always
process a parent shard before it processes a child shard. This helps ensure that the
stream records are also processed in the correct order. (If you use the DynamoDB Streams Kinesis
Adapter, this is handled for you. Your application processes the shards and stream
records in the correct order. It automatically handles new or expired shards, in
addition to shards that split while the application is running. For more
information, see [Using the DynamoDB Streams Kinesis adapter to process stream records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.KCLAdapter.html).)

The following diagram shows the relationship between a stream, shards in the
stream, and stream records in the shards.

![DynamoDB Streams structure. Stream records that represent data modifications are organized into shards.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/streams-terminology.png)

###### Note

If you perform a `PutItem` or `UpdateItem` operation
that does not change any data in an item, DynamoDB Streams does _not_
write a stream record for that operation.

To access a stream and process the stream records within, you must do the
following:

- Determine the unique ARN of the stream that you want to access.

- Determine which shards in the stream contain the stream records that you
are interested in.

- Access the shards and retrieve the stream records that you want.

###### Note

No more than two processes at most should be reading from the same stream's
shard at the same time. Having more than two readers per shard can result in
throttling.

The DynamoDB Streams API provides the following actions for use by application
programs:

- `ListStreams` — Returns a list of stream descriptors
for the current account and endpoint. You can optionally request just the
stream descriptors for a particular table name.

- `DescribeStream` — Returns information about a
stream, including the current status of the stream, its Amazon Resource Name
(ARN), the composition of its shards, and its corresponding DynamoDB table. You
can optionally use the `ShardFilter` field to retrieve the
existing child shard associated with the parent shard.

- `GetShardIterator` — Returns a _shard_
_iterator_, which describes a location within a shard. You can
request that the iterator provide access to the oldest point, the newest
point, or a particular point in the stream.

- `GetRecords` — Returns the stream records from
within a given shard. You must provide the shard iterator returned from a
`GetShardIterator` request.

For complete descriptions of these API operations, including example requests and
responses, see the [Amazon DynamoDB Streams API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_DynamoDB_Streams.html).

### Shard discovery

Discover new shards in your DynamoDB stream with two powerful methods.
As a Amazon DynamoDB Streams user, you have two effective ways to track and identify new shards:

**Polling the entire stream topology**

Use the `DescribeStream` API to regularly poll the stream. This returns all shards
in the stream, including any new shards that have been created. By
comparing results over time, you can detect newly added
shards.

**Discovering child shards**

Use the `DescribeStream` API with the `ShardFilter` parameter to find a
subset of shards. By specifying a parent shard in the request,
DynamoDB Streams will return its immediate child shards. This
approach is useful when you only need to track shard lineage without
scanning the entire stream.

Applications consuming data from DynamoDB Streams can efficiently
transition from reading a closed shard to its child shard using this
`ShardFilter` parameter, avoiding repeated calls to
the `DescribeStream` API to retrieve and traverse the
shard map for all closed and open shards. This helps to quickly
discover child shards after a parent shard has been closed, making
your stream processing applications more responsive and
cost-effective.

Both methods empower you to stay on top of your DynamoDB Streams' evolving structure, ensuring you never
miss critical data updates or shard modifications.

### Data retention limit for DynamoDB Streams

All data in DynamoDB Streams is subject to a 24-hour lifetime. You can retrieve and
analyze the last 24 hours of activity for any given table. However, data that is
older than 24 hours is susceptible to trimming (removal) at any moment.

If you disable a stream on a table, the data in the stream continues to be
readable for 24 hours. After this time, the data expires and the stream records
are automatically deleted. There is no mechanism for manually deleting an
existing stream. You must wait until the retention limit expires (24 hours), and
all the stream records will be deleted.
