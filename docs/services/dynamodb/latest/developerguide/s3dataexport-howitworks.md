# DynamoDB data export to Amazon S3: how it works

DynamoDB export to S3 is a fully managed solution for exporting your DynamoDB data to an Amazon S3
bucket at scale. Using DynamoDB export to S3, you can export data from an Amazon DynamoDB table from
any time within your [point-in-time recovery\
(PITR)](point-in-time-recovery.md) window to an Amazon S3 bucket. You need to enable PITR on your table to use
the export functionality. This feature enables you to perform analytics and complex queries
on your data using other AWS services such as Athena, AWS Glue, Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon EMR, and
AWS Lake Formation.

DynamoDB export to S3 allows you to export both full and incremental data from your DynamoDB
table. Exports are asynchronous, they don't consume [read capacity units (RCUs)](provisioned-capacity-mode.md) and have no impact on table performance and
availability. The export file formats supported are DynamoDB JSON and Amazon Ion formats. You
can also export data to an S3 bucket owned by another AWS account and to a different AWS
region. Your data is always encrypted end-to-end.

DynamoDB full exports are charged based on the size of the DynamoDB table (table data and local
secondary indexes) at the point in time for which the export is done. DynamoDB incremental
exports are charged based on the size of data processed from your continuous backups for the
time period being exported. Incremental export has a minimum charge of 10MB. Additional charges apply for storing exported data in Amazon S3 and
for `PUT` requests made against your Amazon S3 bucket. For more information about
these charges, see [Amazon DynamoDB pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing)
and [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).
