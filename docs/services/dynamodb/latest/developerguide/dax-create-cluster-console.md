# Creating a DAX cluster using the AWS Management Console
<a name="DAX.create-cluster.console"></a>

This section describes how to create an Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster using the AWS Management Console.

## Step 1: Create a subnet group using the AWS Management Console
<a name="DAX.create-cluster.console.create-subnet-group"></a>

Follow this procedure to create a subnet group for your Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster using the AWS Management Console.

**Note**
If you already created a subnet group for your default VPC, you can skip this step.

DAX is designed to run within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment. If you created your AWS account after December 4, 2013, you already have a default VPC in each AWS Region. For more information, see [Default VPC and default subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*.

As part of the creation process for a DAX cluster, you must specify a *subnet group*. A subnet group is a collection of one or more subnets within your VPC. When you create your DAX cluster, the nodes are deployed to the subnets within the subnet group.

**Note**
The VPC having this DAX cluster can contain other resources and even VPC endpoints for the other services except VPC endpoint for ElastiCache and can result in error for the DAX cluster operations.

**To create a subnet group**

1. Open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

1. In the navigation pane, under **DAX**, choose **Subnet groups**.

1. Choose **Create subnet group**.

1. In the **Create subnet group** window, do the following:

   1. **Name**—Enter a short name for the subnet group.

   1. **Description**—Enter a description for the subnet group.

   1. **VPC ID**—Choose the identifier for your Amazon VPC environment.

   1. **Subnets**—Choose one or more subnets from the list.
**Note**
The subnets are distributed among multiple Availability Zones. If you plan to create a multi-node DAX cluster (a primary node and one or more read replicas), we recommend that you choose multiple subnet IDs. Then DAX can deploy the cluster nodes into multiple Availability Zones. If an Availability Zone becomes unavailable, DAX automatically fails over to a surviving Availability Zone. Your DAX cluster will continue to function without interruption.

   When the settings are as you want them, choose **Create subnet group**.

To create the cluster, see [Step 2: Create a DAX cluster using the AWS Management Console](#DAX.create-cluster.console.create-cluster).

## Step 2: Create a DAX cluster using the AWS Management Console
<a name="DAX.create-cluster.console.create-cluster"></a>

Follow this procedure to create an Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster in your default Amazon VPC.

**To create a DAX cluster**

1. Open the DynamoDB console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

1. In the navigation pane, under **DAX**, choose **Clusters**.

1. Choose **Create cluster**.

1. In the **Create cluster** window, do the following:

   1. **Cluster name**—Enter a short name for your DAX cluster.

   1. **Cluster description**—Enter a description for the cluster.

   1. **Node types**—Choose the node type for all of the nodes in the cluster.

   1. **Cluster size**—Choose the number of nodes in the cluster. A cluster consists of one primary node and up to nine read replicas.
**Note**
If you want to create a single-node cluster, choose **1**. Your cluster will consist of one primary node.
If you want to create a multi-node cluster, choose a number between **3** (one primary and two read replicas) and **10** (one primary and nine read replicas).
For production usage, we strongly recommend using DAX with at least three nodes, where each node is placed in a different Availability Zone. Three nodes are required for a DAX cluster to be fault-tolerant.
A DAX cluster can be deployed with one or two nodes for development or test workloads. One- and two-node clusters are not fault-tolerant, and we don't recommend using fewer than three nodes for production use. If a one- or two-node cluster encounters software or hardware errors, the cluster can become unavailable or lose cached data.

   1. Choose **Next**.

   1. **Subnet group**—Select **Choose existing** and choose the subnet group that you created in [Step 1: Create a subnet group using the AWS Management Console](#DAX.create-cluster.console.create-subnet-group).

   1. **Access control**—Choose the **default** security group.

   1. **Availability Zones (AZ)**—Choose **Automatic**.

   1. Choose next.

   1. **IAM service role for DynamoDB access**—Choose **Create new**, and enter the following information:
      + **IAM role name**—Enter a name for an IAM role, for example, `DAXServiceRole`. The console creates a new IAM role, and your DAX cluster assumes this role at runtime.
      + Select the box next to **Create policy**.
      + **IAM role policy**—Choose **Read/Write**. This allows the DAX cluster to perform read and write operations in DynamoDB.
      + **New IAM policy name**—This field will populate as you enter the IAM role name. You can also enter a name for an IAM policy, for example, `DAXServicePolicy`. The console creates a new IAM policy and attaches the policy to the IAM role.
      + **Access to DynamoDB tables**—Choose **All tables**.

   1. **Encryption**—Choose **Turn on encryption at rest** and **Turn on encryption in transit** For more information, see [DAX encryption at rest](DAXEncryptionAtRest.md) and [DAX encryption in transit](DAXEncryptionInTransit.md).

   A separate service role for DAX to access Amazon EC2 is also required. DAX automatically creates this service role for you. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for DAX](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html).

1. When the settings are as you want them, choose **Next**.

1.  **Parameter group**—Choose **Choose existing**.

1.  **Maintenance window**—Choose **No preference** if you don't have a preference when software upgrades are applied, or choose **Specify time window** and provide the **Weekday**, **Time(UTC)** and **Start within (hours)** options to schedule your maintenance window.

1.  **Tags**—Choose **Add new tag** to enter a key/value pair for tagging purposes.

1.  Choose **Next**.

 On the **Review and create** screen, you can review all of the settings. If you are ready to create the cluster, choose **Create cluster**.

On the **Clusters** screen, your DAX cluster will be listed with a status of **Creating**.

**Note**
Creating the cluster takes several minutes. When the cluster is ready, its status changes to **Available**.
 In the meantime, proceed to [Step 3: Configure security group inbound rules using the AWS Management Console](#DAX.create-cluster.console.configure-inbound-rules) and follow the instructions there.

## Step 3: Configure security group inbound rules using the AWS Management Console
<a name="DAX.create-cluster.console.configure-inbound-rules"></a>

Your Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster communicates via TCP port 8111 (for unencrypted clusters) or 9111 (for encrypted clusters), so you must authorize inbound traffic on that port. This allows Amazon EC2 instances in your Amazon VPC to access your DAX cluster.

**Note**
If you launched your DAX cluster with a different security group (other than `default`), you must perform this procedure for that group instead.

**To configure security group inbound rules**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**.

1. Choose the **default** security group. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Edit inbound rules**.

1. Choose **Add Rule**, and enter the following information:
   + **Port Range**—Enter **8111** (if your cluster is unencrypted) or **9111** (if your cluster is encrypted).
   + **Source**—Leave this as **Custom**, and choose the search field to the right. A drop-down menu will be displayed. Choose the identifier for your default security group.

1.  Choose **Save rules** to save your changes.

1. To update the name in the console, go to the **Name** property and choose the **Edit** option that is displayed.
