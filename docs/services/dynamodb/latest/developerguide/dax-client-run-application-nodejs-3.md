# Node.js and DAX

The DAX SDK for Node.js v3.x is compatible with [AWS\
SDK for Node.js v3.x](../../../../reference/awsjavascriptsdk/v3/latest/introduction.md). The DAX SDK for Node.js v3.x supports the use of
[aggregated](../../../../reference/awsjavascriptsdk/v3/latest/introduction.md#high-level-concepts) clients. Please note that DAX doesn't support the creation
of bare-bones clients. For more details on unsupported features, see [Features not in parity with AWS SDK V3](#DAX.client.run-application-nodejs-3-not-in-parity).

Follow these steps to run the Node.js sample application on your Amazon EC2
instance.

###### To run the Node.js sample for DAX

1. Set up Node.js on your Amazon EC2 instance, as follows:
1. Install node version manager ( `nvm`).

      ```nohighlight

      curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
      ```

2. Use nvm to install Node.js.

      ```nohighlight

      nvm install 18
      ```

3. Use nvm to use Node 18

      ```nohighlight

      nvm use 18
      ```

4. Test that Node.js is installed and running correctly.

      ```nohighlight

      node -e "console.log('Running Node.js ' + process.version)"
      ```

      This should display the following message.

      `Running Node.js v18.x.x`
2. Install the DaxDocument Node.js client using the node package manager
    ( `npm`).

```nohighlight

npm install @amazon-dax-sdk/lib-dax
```

## TryDax sample code

To evaluate the performance benefits of DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), follow these steps
to run a sample test that compares read operation times between standard DynamoDB
and a DAX cluster.

1. After you've set up your workspace and installed the
    `lib-dax` as a dependency, copy [TryDax.js](dax-client-tutorial-trydax.md) into your project.

2. Run the program against your DAX cluster. To determine the endpoint
    for your DAX cluster, choose one of the following:

- Using the DynamoDB console —
Choose your DAX cluster. The cluster endpoint is shown on the
console, as in the following example.

```nohighlight

dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

- Using the AWS CLI — Enter
the following command.

```nohighlight

aws dax describe-clusters --query "Clusters[*].ClusterDiscoveryEndpoint"
```

The cluster endpoint is shown in the output, as in the
following example.

```json

{
      "Address": "my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
      "Port": 8111,
      "URL": "dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
}
```

3. Now run the program by specifying the cluster endpoint as a command
    line parameter.

```nohighlight

node TryDax.js dax://my-cluster.l6fzcv.dax-clusters.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

```

You should see output similar to the following:

```nohighlight

Take note of the timing information. The number of microseconds
    required for the
    `GetItem`, `Query`, `Scan`
    tests.

4. In this case, you ran the programs against the DAX cluster. Now,
    you'll run the program again, this time against DynamoDB.

5. Now run the program again, but this time, without the cluster endpoint
    URL as a command line parameter.

```

node TryDax.js
```

Look at the output and take note of the timing information. The
    elapsed times for `GetItem`, `Query`, and
    `Scan` should be significantly lower with DAX as
    compared to DynamoDB.

## Features not in parity with AWS SDK V3

- [Bare-bones](../../../../reference/awsjavascriptsdk/v3/latest/introduction.md#high-level-concepts) clients – Dax Node.js V3 doesn’t support
bare-bones clients.

```javascript

const dynamoDBClient = new DynamoDBClient({ region: 'us-west-2' });
const regularParams = {
      TableName: 'TryDaxTable',
      Key: {
          pk: 1,
          sk: 1
      }
};
// The DynamoDB client supports the send operation.
const dynamoResult = await dynamoDBClient.send(new GetCommand(regularParams));

// However, the DaxDocument client does not support the send operation.
const daxClient = new DaxDocument({
      endpoints: ['your-dax-endpoint'],
      region: 'us-west-2',
});

const params = {
      TableName: 'TryDaxTable',
      Key: {
          pk: 1,
          sk: 1
      }
};

// This will throw an error - send operation is not supported for DAX. Please refer to documentation.
const result = await daxClient.send(new GetCommand(params));
console.log(result);

```

- [Middleware Stack](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/middleware-stack-modular-aws-sdk-js) – Dax Node.js V3 doesn’t support
using Middleware functions.

```javascript

const dynamoDBClient = new DynamoDBClient({ region: 'us-west-2' });
// The DynamoDB client supports the middlewareStack.
dynamoDBClient.middlewareStack.add(
    (next, context) =>> async (args) => {
      console.log("Before operation:", args);
      const result = await next(args);
      console.log("After operation:", result);
      return result;
    },
    {
      step: "initialize", // or "build", "finalizeRequest", "deserialize"
      name: "loggingMiddleware",
    }
);

// However, the DaxDocument client does not support the middlewareStack.
const daxClient = new DaxDocument({
      endpoints: ['your-dax-endpoint'],
      region: 'us-west-2',
});

// This will throw an error - custom middleware and middlewareStacks are not supported for DAX. Please refer to documentation.
daxClient.middlewareStack.add(
    (next, context) => async (args) => {
      console.log("Before operation:", args);
      const result = await next(args);
      console.log("After operation:", result);
      return result;
    },
    {
      step: "initialize", // or "build", "finalizeRequest", "deserialize"
      name: "loggingMiddleware",
    }
);

```
