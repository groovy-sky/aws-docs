# DynamoDB maximum throughput for on-demand tables

For on-demand tables, you can optionally specify maximum read or write (or both)
throughput per second on individual tables and associated global secondary indexes
(GSIs). Specifying a maximum on-demand throughput helps keep table-level usage and
costs bounded. By default, maximum throughput settings don’t apply and your
on-demand throughput rate is bounded by 40,000 table-level read and write throughput
[AWS service quota](servicequotas.md#default-limits-throughput) for all
tables in the account. If needed, you can request an increase to your service
quota.

When you configure maximum throughput for an on-demand table, throughput requests
that exceed the maximum amount specified will be throttled. You can modify the
table-level throughput settings any time based on your application
requirements.

The following are some common use cases that can benefit from using maximum
throughput for on-demand tables:

- **Throughput cost optimization** –
Using maximum throughput for on-demand tables provides an additional layer
of cost predictability and manageability. Additionally, it offers greater
flexibility to use on-demand mode to support workloads with differing
traffic patterns and budget.

- **Protection against excessive usage**
– By setting maximum throughput, you can prevent an accidental surge
in read or write consumption, which might arise from non-optimized code or
rogue processes, against an on-demand table. This table-level setting can
protect organizations from consuming excessive resources within a certain
time frame.

- **Safeguarding downstream services** –
A customer application can include serverless and non-serverless
technologies. The serverless piece of the architecture can scale rapidly to
match demand. But downstream components with fixed capacities could be
overwhelmed. Implementing maximum throughput settings for on-demand tables
can prevent large volume of events from propagating to multiple downstream
components with unexpected side effects.

You can configure maximum throughput for on-demand mode for new and existing
single-Region tables and global tables and GSIs. You can also configure maximum
throughput during table restore and data import from Amazon S3 workflows.

You can specify maximum throughput settings for an on-demand tables using the
[DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AccessingDynamoDB.html#Tools.CLI), [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html), or [DynamoDB API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

###### Note

The maximum throughput for an on-demand table is applied on a best-effort
basis and should be thought of as targets instead of guaranteed request
ceilings. Your workload might temporarily exceed the maximum throughput
specified because of [burst\
capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/burst-adaptive-capacity.html#burst-capacity). In some cases, DynamoDB uses _burst_
_capacity_ to accommodate reads or writes in excess of your table's
maximum throughput settings. With burst capacity, unexpected read or write
requests can succeed where they otherwise would be throttled.

## Considerations when using maximum throughput for on-demand mode

When you use maximum throughput for tables in on-demand mode, the following
considerations apply:

- You can independently set maximum throughput for reads and writes for
any on-demand table, or individual global secondary index within that table to fine-tune
your approach based on specific requirements.

- You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and understand DynamoDB table-level
usage metrics and to determine appropriate maximum throughput settings
for on-demand mode. For more information, see [DynamoDB Metrics and dimensions](metrics-dimensions.md).

- When you specify the maximum read or write (or both) throughput
settings on one global table replica, the same maximum throughput
settings are automatically applied to all replica tables. It's important
that the replica tables and secondary indexes in a global table have
identical write throughput settings to ensure proper replication of
data. For more information, see [Best practices for global tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/globaltables-bestpractices.html).

- The smallest maximum read or write throughput that you can specify is
one request unit per second.

- The maximum throughput you specify must be lower than the default
throughput quota that is available for any on-demand table, or
individual global secondary index within that table.

## Request throttling and CloudWatch metrics

If your application exceeds the maximum read or write throughput you've set on
your on-demand table, DynamoDB begins to throttle those requests. When DynamoDB
throttles a read or write, it returns a `ThrottlingException` to the
caller. You can then take appropriate action, if required. For example, you can
increase or disable the maximum table throughput setting, or wait for a short
interval before retrying the request.

To simplify monitoring the maximum throughput configured for a table or global secondary index,
CloudWatch provides the following metrics: [OnDemandMaxReadRequestUnits](metrics-dimensions.md#OnDemandMaxReadRequestUnits) and [OnDemandMaxWriteRequestUnits](metrics-dimensions.md#OnDemandMaxWriteRequestUnits).
