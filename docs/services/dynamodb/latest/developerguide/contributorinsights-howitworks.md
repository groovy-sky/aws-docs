# CloudWatch contributor insights for DynamoDB: How it works

Amazon DynamoDB integrates with [CloudWatch Contributor\
Insights](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights.md) to provide information about the most accessed and throttled items in a
table or global secondary index. DynamoDB delivers this information to you via CloudWatch Contributor
Insights [rules](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights-rulesyntax.md), [reports](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights-viewreports.md), and [graphs of report data](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights-graphreportdata.md).

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB is designed to have no performance impact on your
DynamoDB table.

For more information about CloudWatch Contributor Insights, see [Using Contributor\
Insights to analyze high-cardinality data](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

The following sections describe the core concepts and behavior of CloudWatch Contributor
Insights for DynamoDB.

## CloudWatch contributor insights modes for DynamoDB

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB offers two distinct modes to meet different
monitoring needs.

### Throttled keys mode

This mode focuses exclusively on throttled requests by only processing events when
throttling occurs. It delivers insights about performance issues without the
overhead of tracking all access patterns. In this mode, DynamoDB tracks only
the:

- **Most throttled items** — Items that
experience the most throttling events

This mode is ideal when:

- Your primary concern is identifying and resolving throttling
problems

- You want to keep Contributor Insights enabled continuously for real-time
throttling detection

- You want a cost-optimized approach to monitor throttling issues

###### Note

_Throttled keys mode_ processes events only
when throttling occurs, making it cost-effective for continuous monitoring. This
targeted approach allows you to leave the feature enabled permanently with
minimal cost impact, while still providing immediate visibility into throttling
issues as they happen.

If your table experiences no throttling, you won't see any data in the Contributor
Insights graphs, which indicates healthy performance. When throttling is detected,
the generated graphs help you identify specific access patterns causing performance
issues. This information can help you implement strategies to address non-uniform
access patterns.

For comprehensive monitoring strategies, you can integrate these throttling
insights with other CloudWatch metrics to create unified dashboards that correlate
throttling events with overall table performance.

### Accessed and throttled keys mode

This mode provides comprehensive monitoring of both accessed and throttled items.
In this mode, DynamoDB tracks the:

- **Most accessed items** — Items that
consume the most read and write capacity

- **Most throttled items** — Items that
experience the most throttling events

This mode is ideal when you need complete visibility into your table's access
patterns and want to understand both high-traffic items and throttling
issues.

### Switching between modes

You can switch between modes at any time using the DynamoDB console, AWS CLI, or APIs.
When you switch modes:

- Existing CloudWatch rules are updated to match the new mode

- Throttled keys CloudWatch rules remain intact, maintaining your continuous
historical data for throttling metrics:

- When you switch from _throttled keys_ mode to
_accessed and throttled keys_ mode, the
existing throttled key rules are preserved, and new accessed key
rules are created

- When you switch from _accessed and throttled_
_keys_ mode to _throttled keys_
mode, only the throttled key rules are preserved, and the accessed
key rules are removed

- Billing adjusts immediately to reflect the new mode's event
processing

## CloudWatch contributor insights for DynamoDB rules

When you enable CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB on a table or global secondary
index, DynamoDB creates [rules](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights-rulesyntax.md) on your behalf based on the selected mode.

###### Note

When you enable Contributor Insights on your DynamoDB table, you're subject to
Contributor Insights rules limits. For more information, see [CloudWatch service quotas](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-limits.md).

### Rules for accessed and throttled keys mode

In _accessed and throttled keys_ mode, DynamoDB
creates the following rules:

- **Most accessed items (partition keys)**
— Identifies the partition keys of the most accessed items in your
table or global secondary index.

CloudWatch rule name format:
`DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKC-[resource_name]-[creationtimestamp]`

- **Most throttled keys (partition keys)**
— Identifies the partition keys of the most throttled items in your
table or global secondary index.

CloudWatch rule name format:
`DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKT-[resource_name]-[creationtimestamp]`

If your table or global secondary index has sort keys, DynamoDB also creates the
following rules specific to sort keys:

- **Most accessed keys (partition and sort**
**keys)** — Identifies the partition and sort keys of the
most accessed items in your table or global secondary index.

CloudWatch rule name format:
`DynamoDBContributorInsights-SKC-[resource_name]-[creationtimestamp]`

- **Most throttled keys (partition and sort**
**keys)** — Identifies the partition and sort keys of the
most throttled items in your table or global secondary index.

CloudWatch rule name format:
`DynamoDBContributorInsights-SKT-[resource_name]-[creationtimestamp]`

### Rules for throttled keys mode

In _throttled keys_ mode, DynamoDB creates only the
throttling-related rules:

- **Most throttled keys (partition key)**
— Identifies the partition keys of the most throttled items in your
table or global secondary index.

CloudWatch rule name format:
`DynamoDBContributorInsights-PKT-[resource_name]-[creationtimestamp]`

If your table or global secondary index has sort keys, DynamoDB also creates:

- **Most throttled keys (partition and sort**
**keys)** — Identifies the partition and sort keys of the
most throttled items in your table or global secondary index.

CloudWatch rule name format:
`DynamoDBContributorInsights-SKT-[resource_name]-[creationtimestamp]`

This focused approach reduces the number of active rules and decreases the volume
of events processed to better diagnose your throttling events.

###### Note

- When you use the CloudWatch console or APIs to view CloudWatch Contributor Insights
for DynamoDB, you only see rules corresponding to your selected mode.

- You can't use the CloudWatch console or APIs to directly modify or delete the
rules created by CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB. Disabling CloudWatch
Contributor Insights for DynamoDB on a table or global secondary index
automatically deletes the rules created for that table or global secondary
index.

- When you use the [GetInsightRuleReport](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-getinsightrulereport.md) operation with CloudWatch
Contributor Insights rules that are created by DynamoDB, only
`MaxContributorValue` and `Maximum` return useful
statistics. The other statistics in this list don't return meaningful
values.

- CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB has a limit of 25 contributors.
Requesting more than 25 contributors will return an error.

You can create CloudWatch Alarms using the CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB [rules](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights-rulesyntax.md). This allows you to be notified when any item exceed or meets a
specific threshold for `ConsumedThroughputUnits` or
`ThrottleCount`. For more information, see [Setting an alarm on Contributor Insights metric\
data](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/contributorinsights-graphreportdata.md#ContributorInsights-GraphReportData-Alarm).

## Understanding CloudWatch contributor insights for DynamoDB graphs

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB displays different types of graphs on both the
DynamoDB and CloudWatch consoles depending on the selected mode.

### Graph availability by mode

The graphs displayed depend on your selected Contributor Insights mode.

- **Accessed and throttled keys mode** displays
both _Most Accessed Items_ and _Most Throttled_
_Items_ graphs

- **Throttled keys mode** displays only
_Most Throttled Items_ graphs

### Most accessed items

This graph is available only in accessed and throttled keys mode. Use this graph
to identify the most accessed items in the table or global secondary index. The
graph displays `ConsumedThroughputUnits` on the y-axis and time on the
x-axis. Each of the top N keys is displayed in its own color, with a legend
displayed below the x-axis.

DynamoDB measures key access frequency by using `ConsumedThroughputUnits`,
which measures combined read and write traffic. `ConsumedThroughputUnits`
is defined as the following:

- Provisioned — _(3 x consumed write capacity units) +_
_consumed read capacity units_

- On-demand — _(3 x write request units) + read request_
_units_

On the DynamoDB console, each data point in the graph represents the maximum of
`ConsumedThroughputUnits` over a 1-minute period. For example, a
graph value of 180,000 `ConsumedThroughputUnits` indicates that the item
was accessed continuously at the per-item maximum throughput of 1,000 write request
units or 3,000 read request units for a 60-second span within that 1-minute period
(3,000 x 60 seconds). In other words, the graphed values represent the
highest-traffic minute within each 1-minute period. You can change the time
granularity of the `ConsumedThroughputUnits` metric (for example, to view
5-minute metrics instead of 1-minute) on the CloudWatch console.

If you see several closely clustered lines without any obvious outliers, it
indicates that your workload is relatively balanced across items over the given time
window. If you see isolated points in the graph instead of connected lines, it
indicates an item that was frequently accessed only for a brief period.

If your table or global secondary index has sort keys, DynamoDB creates two graphs:
one for the most accessed partition keys and one for the most accessed partition +
sort keys pairs. You can see traffic at the partition keys level in the partition
key–only graph. You can see traffic at the item level in the partition + sort keys
graphs.

### Most throttled items

This graph is available in both modes. Use this graph to identify the most
throttled items in the table or global secondary index. The graph displays
`ThrottleCount` on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. Each of the top
_N_ keys is displayed in its own color, with a legend
displayed below the x-axis.

DynamoDB measures throttle frequency using `ThrottleCount`, which is the
count of `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`,
`ThrottlingException`, and `RequestLimitExceeded`
errors.

Write throttling caused by insufficient write capacity for a global secondary
index is not measured. You can use the _Most Accessed Items_
graph of the global secondary index to identify imbalanced access patterns that may
cause write throttling. For more information, see [Provisioned throughput Considerations for Global Secondary\
Indexes](gsi.md#GSI.ThroughputConsiderations).

On the DynamoDB console, each data point in the graph represents the count of
throttle events over a 1-minute period.

If you see no data in this graph, it indicates that your requests are not being
throttled. If you see isolated points in the graph instead of connected lines, it
indicates that an item was frequently throttled for a brief period.

If your table or global secondary index has sort keys, DynamoDB creates two graphs:
one for most throttled partition keys and one for most throttled partition + sort
keys pairs. You can see throttle count at the partition keys level in the partition
keys-only graph, and throttle count at the item-level in the partition + sort keys
graphs.

###### Note

In _throttled keys_ mode, this is the only type of graph
you'll see. The absence of data in these graphs indicates healthy table
performance with no throttling occurring.

### Report examples

The following example shows the reports generated for a table with both a
partition keys and sort keys in _accessed and throttled_
_keys_ modes. In _throttled keys_
mode, you see only the throttling-related portion of this report.

## Interactions with other DynamoDB features

The following sections describe how CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB behaves and
interacts with several other features in DynamoDB. These behaviors apply to both modes
unless otherwise specified.

### Global tables

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB monitors global table replicas as distinct
tables. The Contributor Insights graphs for a replica in one AWS Region might not
show the same patterns as another Region. This is because write data is replicated
across all replicas in a global table, but each replica can serve Region-bound read
traffic.

Each replica can be configured with a different Contributor Insights mode
independently. For example, you might use _accessed and throttled_
_keys_ mode in your primary region for comprehensive monitoring, while
using _throttled keys_ mode in secondary regions to maintain
visibility into performance issues.

### DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB doesn't show DAX cache responses. It only
shows responses to accessing a table or a global secondary index.

###### Note

DynamoDB CloudWatch Contributor Insights does not support PartiQL requests.

### Encryption at rest

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB doesn't affect how encryption works in DynamoDB.
The primary key data that is published in CloudWatch is encrypted with the
AWS owned key. However, DynamoDB also supports the AWS managed key and a
customer managed key.

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB displays partition keys and sort keys (if
applicable) of frequently accessed and throttled items. While CloudWatch Contributor
Insights works with encrypted DynamoDB tables, it's important to note that it uses its
own Amazon-owned encryption context, which is separate from the table's configured
encryption.

If your DynamoDB table's primary key contains sensitive information and your
organization's security policies require full control over encryption processes,
enabling CloudWatch Contributor Insights may not be suitable.

### Fine-grained access control

CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB doesn't function differently for tables with
fine-grained access control (FGAC). In other words, any user who has the appropriate
CloudWatch permissions can view FGAC-protected primary keys in CloudWatch Contributor Insights
graphs.

If the table's primary key contains FGAC-protected data that you don't want
published to CloudWatch, you should not enable CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB for
that table.

### Access control

You control access to CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
by limiting DynamoDB control plane permissions and CloudWatch data plane permissions. For
more information see, [Using\
IAM with CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB](contributor-insights-iam.md).

## CloudWatch contributor insights for DynamoDB billing

Charges for CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB appear in the [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing) section of your
monthly bill. These charges are calculated based on the number of DynamoDB events that are
processed, and the selected mode.

### Billing by mode

The two Contributor Insights modes have different billing characteristics.

- **Accessed and throttled keys mode billing**
\- In this mode, each item that is written or read via a [data plane](howitworks-api.md#HowItWorks.API.DataPlane) operation represents one event,
regardless of whether the request succeeds or is throttled. If a table or
global secondary index includes sort keys, each item that is read or
written represents two events. This is because DynamoDB is identifying top
contributors from separate time series: one for partitions keys only, and
one for partition and sort keys pairs.

- **Throttled keys mode billing** \- In this
mode, only throttled requests generate billable events. Events are only
generated when requests result in
`ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`,
`ThrottlingException`, or `RequestLimitExceeded`
errors. If a table or global secondary index includes sort keys, each
throttled item represents two events (partition keys tracking and partition +
sort keys tracking).

### Billing examples

For example, assume that your application performs the following DynamoDB operations:
a `GetItem`, a `PutItem`, and a `BatchWriteItem`
that puts five items. Also assume that the `PutItem` operation gets
throttled, but all other operations succeed.

- **Accessed and throttled keys mode**

- If your table or global secondary index has only a partition keys,
it results in 7 events (1 for the `GetItem`, 1 for the
`PutItem`, and 5 for the
`BatchWriteItem`).

- If your table or global secondary index has a partition keys and
sort keys, it results in 14 events (2 for the `GetItem`, 2
for the `PutItem`, and 10 for the
`BatchWriteItem`).

- **Throttled keys mode**

- If your table or global secondary index has only a partition keys,
it results in 1 event (only for the throttled
`PutItem`).

- If your table or global secondary index has a partition keys and
sort keys, it results in 2 events (2 for the throttled
`PutItem`).

The successful `GetItem` and `BatchWriteItem`
operations generate no events in throttled keys mode.

### Common billing factors

A `Query` operation always results in 1 event, regardless of the mode or
number of items returned.

Unlike other DynamoDB features, CloudWatch Contributor Insights for DynamoDB billing
_does not_ vary based on the following:

- The [capacity mode](capacity-mode.md) (provisioned vs.
on-demand)

- Whether you perform read or write requests

- The size (KB) of the items read or written
