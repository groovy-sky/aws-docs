# DAX access control

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is designed to work together with DynamoDB, to seamlessly add a caching
layer to your applications. However, DAX and DynamoDB have separate access control
mechanisms. Both services use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to implement their respective security
policies, but the security models for DAX and DynamoDB are different.

_We highly recommend that you understand both security models_, so that
you can implement proper security measures for your applications that use DAX.

This section describes the access control mechanisms provided by DAX and provides sample
IAM policies that you can tailor to your needs.

With DynamoDB, you can create IAM policies that limit the actions a user can perform on
individual DynamoDB resources. For example, you can create a user role that only allows the
user to perform read-only actions on a particular DynamoDB table. (For more information, see
[Identity and Access Management for Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/security-iam.html).) By comparison, the DAX
security model focuses on cluster security, and the ability of the cluster to perform DynamoDB
API actions on your behalf.

###### Warning

If you are currently using IAM roles and policies to restrict access to DynamoDB tables
data, then the use of DAX can **subvert** those policies.
For example, a user could have access to a DynamoDB table via DAX but not have explicit
access to the same table accessing DynamoDB directly. For more information, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/security-iam.html).

DAX does not enforce user-level separation on data in DynamoDB. Instead, users inherit
the permissions of the DAX cluster's IAM policy when they access that cluster. Thus,
when accessing DynamoDB tables via DAX, the only access controls that are in effect are
the permissions in the DAX cluster's IAM policy. No other permissions are
recognized.

If you require isolation, we recommend that you create additional DAX clusters and
scope the IAM policy for each cluster accordingly. For example, you could create
multiple DAX clusters and allow each cluster to access only a single table.

## IAM service role for DAX

When you create a DAX cluster, you must associate the cluster with an IAM role.
This is known as the _service role_ for the cluster.

Suppose that you wanted to create a new DAX cluster
named _DAXCluster01_. You could create a service role named
_DAXServiceRole_, and associate the role
with _DAXCluster01_. The policy
for _DAXServiceRole_ would define the DynamoDB actions
that _DAXCluster01_ could perform, on behalf of the users who
interact with _DAXCluster01_.

When you create a service role, you must specify a trust relationship
between _DAXServiceRole_ and the DAX service itself. A trust
relationship determines which entities can assume a role and make use of its
permissions. The following is an example trust relationship document
for _DAXServiceRole_:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "dax.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

```

This trust relationship allows a DAX cluster to
assume _DAXServiceRole_ and perform DynamoDB API calls on your
behalf.

The DynamoDB API actions that are allowed are described in an IAM policy document,
which you attach to _DAXServiceRole_. The following is an example
policy document.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DaxAccessPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem",
                "dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

This policy allows DAX to perform necessary DynamoDB API actions on a DynamoDB table. The
`dynamodb:DescribeTable` action is required for DAX to maintain
metadata about the table, and the others are read and write actions performed on items
in the table. The table, named `Books`, is in the us-west-2 Region and is
owned by AWS account ID `123456789012`.

###### Note

DAX supports mechanisms to prevent the confused deputy problem during
cross-Service access. For more information, see [The confused deputy\
problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## IAM policy to allow DAX cluster access

After you create a DAX cluster, you need to grant permissions to a user so that the
user can access the DAX cluster.

For example, suppose that you want to grant access to
_DAXCluster01_ to a user named Alice. You would first create an
IAM policy ( _AliceAccessPolicy_) that defines the DAX clusters
and DAX API actions that the recipient can access. You would then confer access by
attaching this policy to user Alice.

The following policy document gives the recipient full access on
_DAXCluster01_.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "dax:*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dax:us-west-2:123456789012:cache/DAXCluster01"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

The policy document allows access to the DAX cluster, but it does not grant any
DynamoDB permissions. (The DynamoDB permissions are conferred by the DAX service
role.)

For user Alice, you would first create `AliceAccessPolicy` with the policy
document shown previously. You would then attach the policy to Alice.

###### Note

Instead of attaching the policy to a user, you could attach it to an IAM role.
That way, all of the users who assume that role would have the permissions that you
defined in the policy.

The user policy, together with the DAX service role, determine the DynamoDB resources
and API actions that the recipient can access via DAX.

## Case study: Accessing DynamoDB and DAX

The following scenario can help further your understanding of IAM policies for use
with DAX. (This scenario is referred to throughout the rest of this section.) The
following diagram shows a high-level overview of the scenario.

![A high-level overview of an IAM policy scenario for using DAX.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/dax-access-control-scenario.png)

In this scenario, there are the following entities:

- A user (Bob).

- An IAM role ( `BobUserRole`). Bob assumes this role at
runtime.

- An IAM policy ( `BobAccessPolicy`). This policy is attached to
`BobUserRole`. `BobAccessPolicy` defines the DynamoDB and
DAX resources that `BobUserRole` is allowed to access.

- A DAX cluster ( `DAXCluster01`).

- An IAM service role ( `DAXServiceRole`). This role
allows `DAXCluster01` to access DynamoDB.

- An IAM policy ( `DAXAccessPolicy`). This policy is attached to
`DAXServiceRole`. `DAXAccessPolicy` defines the DynamoDB
APIs and resources that `DAXCluster01` is allowed to access.

- A DynamoDB table ( `Books`).

The combination of policy statements in `BobAccessPolicy` and
`DAXAccessPolicy` determine what Bob can do with the `Books`
table. For example, Bob might be able to access `Books` directly (using the
DynamoDB endpoint), indirectly (using the DAX cluster), or both. Bob might also be able
to read data from `Books`, write data to `Books`, or both.

## Access to DynamoDB, but no access with DAX

![Overview of an IAM policy that enables direct access to a table, but blocks indirect access using a DAX cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/dax-access-control-ddb-only.png)

It is possible to allow direct access to a DynamoDB table, while preventing indirect
access using a DAX cluster. For direct access to DynamoDB, the permissions for
`BobUserRole` are determined by `BobAccessPolicy` (which is
attached to the role).

### Read-only access to DynamoDB (only)

_Bob_ can access DynamoDB with
`BobUserRole`. The IAM policy attached to this role
( `BobAccessPolicy`) determines the DynamoDB tables that
`BobUserRole` can access, and what APIs that `BobUserRole`
can invoke.

Consider the following policy document for `BobAccessPolicy`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

When this document is attached to `BobAccessPolicy`, it allows
`BobUserRole` to access the DynamoDB endpoint and perform read-only
operations on the `Books` table.

DAX does not appear in this policy, so access via DAX is denied.

### Read/write access to DynamoDB (only)

If `BobUserRole` requires read/write access to DynamoDB, the following
policy would work.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem",
                "dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

Again, DAX does not appear in this policy, so access via DAX is denied.

## Access to DynamoDB and to DAX

![An IAM policy that grants access to both a DynamoDB table and a DAX cluster.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/dax-access-control-ddb-and-dax.png)

To allow access to a DAX cluster, you must include DAX-specific actions in an
IAM policy.

The following DAX-specific actions correspond to their similarly named counterparts
in the DynamoDB API:

- `dax:GetItem`

- `dax:BatchGetItem`

- `dax:Query`

- `dax:Scan`

- `dax:PutItem`

- `dax:UpdateItem`

- `dax:DeleteItem`

- `dax:BatchWriteItem`

- `dax:ConditionCheckItem`

The same is true for the `dax:EnclosingOperation` condition key.

### Read-only access to DynamoDB and read-only access to DAX

Suppose that Bob requires read-only access to the `Books` table, from
DynamoDB and from DAX. The following policy (attached to `BobUserRole`)
confers this access.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DAXAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dax:GetItem",
                "dax:BatchGetItem",
                "dax:Query",
                "dax:Scan"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dax:us-west-2:123456789012:cache/DAXCluster01"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

The policy has a statement for DAX access ( `DAXAccessStmt`) and
another statement for DynamoDBaccess ( `DynamoDBAccessStmt`). These
statements allow Bob to
send `GetItem`, `BatchGetItem`, `Query`,
and `Scan` requests to `DAXCluster01`.

However, the service role for `DAXCluster01` would also require
read-only access to the `Books` table in DynamoDB. The following IAM
policy, attached to `DAXServiceRole`, would fulfill this
requirement.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

### Read/write access to DynamoDB and read-only with DAX

For a given user role, you can provide read/write access to a DynamoDB table, while
also allowing read-only access via DAX.

For Bob, the IAM policy for `BobUserRole` would need to allow DynamoDB
read and write actions on the `Books` table, while also supporting
read-only actions via `DAXCluster01`.

The following example policy document for `BobUserRole` confers this
access.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DAXAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dax:GetItem",
                "dax:BatchGetItem",
                "dax:Query",
                "dax:Scan"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dax:us-west-2:123456789012:cache/DAXCluster01"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem",
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

In addition, `DAXServiceRole` would require an IAM policy that allows
`DAXCluster01` to perform read-only actions on the `Books`
table.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable"
           ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

### Read/write access to DynamoDB and read/write access to DAX

Now suppose that Bob required read/write access to the `Books` table,
directly from DynamoDB or indirectly from `DAXCluster01`. The following
policy document, attached to `BobAccessPolicy`, confers this
access.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DAXAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dax:GetItem",
                "dax:BatchGetItem",
                "dax:Query",
                "dax:Scan",
                "dax:PutItem",
                "dax:UpdateItem",
                "dax:DeleteItem",
                "dax:BatchWriteItem",
                "dax:ConditionCheckItem"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dax:us-west-2:123456789012:cache/DAXCluster01"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem",
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

In addition, `DAXServiceRole` would require an IAM policy that allows
`DAXCluster01` to perform read/write actions on the
`Books` table.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
                "dynamodb:Query",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem",
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/Books"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Access to DynamoDB via DAX, but no direct access to DynamoDB

In this scenario, Bob can access the `Books` table via DAX, but he does
not have direct access to the `Books` table in DynamoDB. Thus, when Bob gains
access to DAX, he also gains access to a DynamoDB table that he otherwise might not be
able to access. When you configure an IAM policy for the DAX service role, remember
that any user that is given access to the DAX cluster via the user access policy gains
access to the tables specified in that policy. In this case,
`BobAccessPolicy` gains access to the tables specified in
`DAXAccessPolicy`.

![A scenario where a user can access a table through a DAX cluster without direct DynamoDB access.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/images/dax-access-control-dax-only.png)

If you are currently using IAM roles and policies to restrict access to DynamoDB tables
and data, using DAX can subvert those policies. In the following policy, Bob has
access to a DynamoDB table via DAX but does not have explicit direct access to the same
table in DynamoDB.

The following policy document ( `BobAccessPolicy`), attached
to `BobUserRole`, would confer this access.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DAXAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dax:GetItem",
                "dax:BatchGetItem",
                "dax:Query",
                "dax:Scan",
                "dax:PutItem",
                "dax:UpdateItem",
                "dax:DeleteItem",
                "dax:BatchWriteItem",
                "dax:ConditionCheckItem"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dax:us-west-2:123456789012:cache/DAXCluster01"
        }
    ]
}

```

In this access policy, there are no permissions to access DynamoDB directly.

Together with `BobAccessPolicy`, the following `DAXAccessPolicy`
gives `BobUserRole` access to the DynamoDB table `Books` even though
`BobUserRole` cannot directly access the `Books` table.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DynamoDBAccessStmt",
            "Effect": "Allow",

As this example shows, when you configure access control for the user access policy
and the DAX cluster access policy, you must fully understand the end-to-end access to
ensure that the principle of least privilege is observed. Also ensure that giving a user
access to a DAX cluster does not subvert previously established access control
policies.
