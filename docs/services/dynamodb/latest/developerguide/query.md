# Querying tables in DynamoDB
<a name="Query"></a>

You can use the `Query` API operation in Amazon DynamoDB to find items based on primary key values.

You must provide the name of the partition key attribute and a single value for that attribute. `Query` returns all items with that partition key value. Optionally, you can provide a sort key attribute and use a comparison operator to refine the search results.

For more information on how to use `Query`, such as the request syntax, response parameters, and additional examples, see [Query](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html) in the *Amazon DynamoDB API Reference*.
