# Referring to item attributes when using expressions in DynamoDB

This section describes how to refer to item attributes in an expression in Amazon DynamoDB.
You can work with any attribute, even if it is deeply nested within multiple lists and
maps.

###### A Sample Item: ProductCatalog

The examples on this page use the following sample item in the
`ProductCatalog` table. (This table is described in [Example tables and data for use in DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AppendixSampleTables.html).)

```json

{
    "Id": 123,
    "Title": "Bicycle 123",
    "Description": "123 description",
    "BicycleType": "Hybrid",
    "Brand": "Brand-Company C",
    "Price": 500,
    "Color": ["Red", "Black"],
    "ProductCategory": "Bicycle",
    "InStock": true,
    "QuantityOnHand": null,
    "RelatedItems": [
        341,
        472,
        649
    ],
    "Pictures": {
        "FrontView": "http://example.com/products/123_front.jpg",
        "RearView": "http://example.com/products/123_rear.jpg",
        "SideView": "http://example.com/products/123_left_side.jpg"
    },
    "ProductReviews": {
	    "FiveStar": [
	    		"Excellent! Can't recommend it highly enough! Buy it!",
	    		"Do yourself a favor and buy this."
	    ],
	    "OneStar": [
	    		"Terrible product! Do not buy this."
	    ]
    },
    "Comment": "This product sells out quickly during the summer",
    "Safety.Warning": "Always wear a helmet"
 }
```

Note the following:

- The partition key value ( `Id`) is `123`. There is no
sort key.

- Most of the attributes have scalar data types, such as `String`,
`Number`, `Boolean`, and `Null`.

- One attribute ( `Color`) is a `String Set`.

- The following attributes are document data types:

- A list of `RelatedItems`. Each element is an
`Id` for a related product.

- A map of `Pictures`. Each element is a short description of
a picture, along with a URL for the corresponding image file.

- A map of `ProductReviews`. Each element represents a rating
and a list of reviews corresponding to that rating. Initially, this map
is populated with five-star and one-star reviews.

## Top-level attributes

An attribute is said to be _top level_ if it is not embedded
within another attribute. For the `ProductCatalog` item, the top-level
attributes are as follows:

- `Id`

- `Title`

- `Description`

- `BicycleType`

- `Brand`

- `Price`

- `Color`

- `ProductCategory`

- `InStock`

- `QuantityOnHand`

- `RelatedItems`

- `Pictures`

- `ProductReviews`

- `Comment`

- `Safety.Warning`

All of these top-level attributes are scalars, except for `Color`
(list), `RelatedItems` (list), `Pictures` (map), and
`ProductReviews` (map).

## Nested attributes

An attribute is said to be _nested_ if it is embedded within
another attribute. To access a nested attribute, you use _dereference_
_operators_:

- `[n]` — for list elements

- `.` (dot) — for map elements

### Accessing list elements

The dereference operator for a list element is \[ _N_\], where _n_ is the
element number. List elements are zero-based, so \[0\] represents the first
element in the list, \[1\] represents the second, and so on. Here are some
examples:

- `MyList[0]`

- `AnotherList[12]`

- `ThisList[5][11]`

The element `ThisList[5]` is itself a nested list. Therefore,
`ThisList[5][11]` refers to the 12th element in that list.

The number within the square brackets must be a non-negative integer.
Therefore, the following expressions are not valid:

- `MyList[-1]`

- `MyList[0.4]`

### Accessing map elements

The dereference operator for a map element is .
(a dot). Use a dot as a separator between elements in a map:

- `MyMap.nestedField`

- `MyMap.nestedField.deeplyNestedField`

## Document paths

In an expression, you use a _document path_ to tell DynamoDB where
to find an attribute. For a top-level attribute, the document path is simply the
attribute name. For a nested attribute, you construct the document path using
dereference operators.

The following are some examples of document paths. (Refer to the item shown in
[Referring to item attributes when using expressions in DynamoDB](expressions-attributes.md).)

- A top-level scalar attribute.

`Description`

- A top-level list attribute. (This returns the entire list, not just some
of the elements.)

`RelatedItems`

- The third element from the `RelatedItems` list. (Remember that
list elements are zero-based.)

`RelatedItems[2]`

- The front-view picture of the product.

`Pictures.FrontView`

- All of the five-star reviews.

`ProductReviews.FiveStar`

- The first of the five-star reviews.

`ProductReviews.FiveStar[0]`

###### Note

The maximum depth for a document path is 32. Therefore,
the number of dereferences operators in a path cannot exceed this limit.

You can use any attribute name in a document path as long as they meet these
requirements:

- The first character is `a-z` or `A-Z` and or
`0-9`

- The second character (if present) is `a-z`,
`A-Z`

###### Note

If an attribute name does not meet this requirement, you must define an
expression attribute name as a placeholder.
