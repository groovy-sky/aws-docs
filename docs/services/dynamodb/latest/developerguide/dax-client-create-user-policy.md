# Step 2: Create a user and policy

In this step, you create a user with a policy that grants access to your Amazon
DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster and to DynamoDB using AWS Identity and Access Management. You can then run applications
that interact with your DAX cluster.

## Sign up for an AWS account

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.

###### To sign up for an AWS account

1. Open [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

2. Follow the online instructions.

Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call or text message and entering
    a verification code on the phone keypad.

When you sign up for an AWS account, an _AWS account root user_ is created. The root user has access to all AWS services
    and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-root-user.md#root-user-tasks).

AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is
complete. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by
going to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My**
**Account**.

## Create a user with administrative access

After you sign up for an AWS account, secure your AWS account root user, enable AWS IAM Identity Center, and create an administrative user so that you
don't use the root user for everyday tasks.

###### Secure your AWS account root user

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.

For help signing in by using root user, see [Signing in as the root user](../../../signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.md#introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial) in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

2. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your root user.

For instructions, see [Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user (console)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/enable-virt-mfa-for-root.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Create a user with administrative access

1. Enable IAM Identity Center.

For instructions, see [Enabling\
    AWS IAM Identity Center](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-set-up-for-idc.md) in the
    _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

2. In IAM Identity Center, grant administrative access to a user.

For a tutorial about using the IAM Identity Center directory as your identity source, see [Configure user access with the default IAM Identity Center directory](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/quick-start-default-idc.md) in the
    _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

###### Sign in as the user with administrative access

- To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user.

For help signing in using an IAM Identity Center user, see [Signing in to the AWS access portal](../../../signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.md) in the _AWS Sign-In User Guide_.

###### Assign access to additional users

1. In IAM Identity Center, create a permission set that follows the best practice of applying least-privilege permissions.

For instructions, see [Create a permission set](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-create-a-permission-set.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

2. Assign users to a group, and then assign single sign-on access to the group.

For instructions, see [Add groups](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/addgroups.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:

- Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:

Create a permission set. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

- Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

Create a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for a third-party identity provider (federation)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-idp.md)
in the _IAM User Guide_.

- IAM users:

- Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user (console)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-users-change-permissions.md#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### To use the JSON policy editor to create a policy

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

02. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Policies**.

    If this is your first time choosing **Policies**, the
     **Welcome to Managed Policies** page appears. Choose **Get**
    **Started**.

03. At the top of the page, choose **Create policy**.

04. In the **Policy editor** section, choose the
     **JSON** option.

05. Enter or paste a JSON policy document. For details about the IAM policy language, see
     [IAM JSON policy reference](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies.md).

06. Resolve any security warnings, errors, or general warnings generated during [policy validation](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-policy-validator.md), and then choose **Next**.

    ###### Note

    You can switch between the **Visual** and **JSON**
    editor options anytime. However, if you make changes or choose **Next**
    in the **Visual** editor, IAM might restructure your policy to
    optimize it for the visual editor. For more information, see [Policy restructuring](../../../iam/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-policies.md#troubleshoot_viseditor-restructure)
    in the _IAM User Guide_.

07. (Optional) When you create or edit a policy in the AWS Management Console, you can generate a JSON
     or YAML policy template that you can use in CloudFormation templates.

    To do this, in the **Policy editor** choose
     **Actions**, and then choose **Generate CloudFormation**
    **template**. To learn more about CloudFormation, see [AWS Identity and Access Management resource type reference](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-iam.md) in the
     _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

08. When you are finished adding permissions to the policy, choose
     **Next**.

09. On the **Review and create** page, enter a **Policy**
    **name** and a **Description** (optional) for the policy that
     you are creating. Review **Permissions defined in this policy** to see
     the permissions that are granted by your policy.

10. (Optional) Add metadata to the policy by attaching tags as key-value pairs. For more
     information about using tags in IAM, see [Tags for AWS Identity and Access Management resources](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-tags.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

11. Choose **Create policy** to save your new policy.

**Policy document** – Copy and paste the following document to
create the JSON policy.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "dax:*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```
