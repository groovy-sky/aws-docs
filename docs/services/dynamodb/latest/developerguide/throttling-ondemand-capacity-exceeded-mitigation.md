# 4- On-demand maximum throughput exceeded
<a name="throttling-ondemand-capacity-exceeded-mitigation"></a>

When you configure an [on-demand](on-demand-capacity-mode.md) table or GSI, you can optionally set a maximum throughput limit ([`MaxReadRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_OnDemandThroughput.html#DDB-Type-OnDemandThroughput-MaxReadRequestUnits) and [`MaxWriteRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_OnDemandThroughput.html#DDB-Type-OnDemandThroughput-MaxWriteRequestUnits)) at the table or index level to prevent runaway costs or protect downstream systems from being overwhelmed. For more information about maximum throughput, see [DynamoDB maximum throughput for on-demand tables](on-demand-capacity-mode-max-throughput.md).

 When your read or write consumption exceeds these self-imposed limits, additional requests that would exceed the limit receive quick throttle responses. DynamoDB returns exceptions with a `MaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded` throttling reason type, indicating which resource has reached its throughput boundary.

## On-demand maximum throughput exceeded throttling

This section provides resolution guidance for on-demand maximum throughput exceeded throttling scenarios. Before using this guide, make sure you have identified the specific throttling reasons from your application's exception handling, and determined the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the affected resource. For information on retrieving throttling reasons and identifying throttled resources, see [DynamoDB throttling diagnosis framework](throttling-diagnosing-workflow.md#throttling-diagnosing).

Before diving into specific throttling scenarios, first consider whether action is actually needed:
+ **Evaluate your maximum throughput settings:** These limits were intentionally configured to control costs or protect downstream systems. If you're receiving `MaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded` throttling events, your limits are working as designed. Consider whether increasing these limits aligns with your original cost control or system protection goals.
+ **Assess application impact:** Determine if the throttling is actually causing problems for your applications or users. If your applications handle retries effectively and meets their performance requirements despite occasional throttling, maintaining your current limits might be the appropriate choice.
+ **Review traffic patterns:** Analyze whether the throttling represents an expected traffic pattern or an unusual spike. For predictable, recurring traffic patterns that consistently exceed your limits, adjusting the maximum throughput settings might be warranted. For temporary spikes, implementing better request distribution strategies might be more appropriate than raising limits.

If after consideration you determine that your maximum throughput settings need adjustment, refer to the specific throttling scenarios below for targeted remediation options:

### TableReadMaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded
<a name="throttling-diagnostic-table-read-max-ondemand"></a>

**When this occurs**
Your on-demand table has exceeded its configured maximum read throughput capacity. You can monitor the CloudWatch metrics in [Common diagnosis and monitoring](#ondemand-capacity-exceeded-diagnosis-monitoring) to analyze your throttling event.

**Remediation options**
Consider these steps to address your throttling events:
+ **Increase maximum throughput limit:** Use the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), [AWS CLI](/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AccessingDynamoDB.html#Tools.CLI), or the DynamoDB `[UpdateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTable.html)` API to increase the [`MaxReadRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_OnDemandThroughput.html#DDB-Type-OnDemandThroughput-MaxReadRequestUnits) value for the affected table, then monitor and adjust. This allows your table to handle higher read throughput before throttling occurs.
+ **Remove the maximum limit:** Set `MaxReadRequestUnits` to `-1` to remove the ceiling, allowing scaling based on demand up to your account-level throughput quotas. This removes your custom limit but still maintains AWS's account-level safeguards. However, it's important to monitor spending closely after removing this limit, as your table can now consume significantly more capacity before hitting the account-level quotas.

### TableWriteMaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded
<a name="throttling-diagnostic-table-write-max-ondemand"></a>

**When this occurs**
Your on-demand table has exceeded its configured maximum write throughput capacity. You can monitor the CloudWatch metrics in [Common diagnosis and monitoring](#ondemand-capacity-exceeded-diagnosis-monitoring) to analyze your throttling event.

**Remediation options**
Consider these steps to address your throttling events:
+ **Increase maximum throughput limit:** Use the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), [AWS CLI](/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AccessingDynamoDB.html#Tools.CLI), or the DynamoDB `[UpdateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTable.html)` API to increase the [`MaxWriteRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_OnDemandThroughput.html#DDB-Type-OnDemandThroughput-MaxWriteRequestUnits) value for the affected table, then monitor and adjust.
+ **Remove the maximum limit:** Set `MaxWriteRequestUnits` to `-1` to remove the ceiling, allowing scaling based on demand up to your account-level throughput quotas. This removes your custom limit but still maintains AWS's account-level safeguards. However, it's important to monitor spending closely after removing this limit, as your table can now consume significantly more capacity before hitting the account-level quotas.

### IndexReadMaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded
<a name="throttling-diagnostic-index-read-max-ondemand"></a>

**When this occurs**
Read requests to a GSI in on-demand mode have exceeded the GSI's configured maximum read throughput capacity. You can monitor the CloudWatch metrics in [Common diagnosis and monitoring](#ondemand-capacity-exceeded-diagnosis-monitoring) to analyze your throttling event.

**Remediation options**
Consider these steps to address your throttling events:
+ **Increase GSI maximum throughput limit:** Use the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), [AWS CLI](/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AccessingDynamoDB.html#Tools.CLI), or the DynamoDB `[UpdateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTable.html)` API to increase the [`MaxReadRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_OnDemandThroughput.html#DDB-Type-OnDemandThroughput-MaxReadRequestUnits) value for the affected GSI, then monitor and adjust.
+ **Remove the GSI maximum limit:** Set `MaxReadRequestUnits` to `-1` for the GSI to remove the ceiling, allowing scaling based on demand up to your account-level throughput quotas. This removes your custom limit but still maintains AWS's account-level safeguards. However, it's important to monitor spending closely after removing this limit.

### IndexWriteMaxOnDemandThroughputExceeded
<a name="throttling-diagnostic-index-write-max-ondemand"></a>

**When this occurs**
Updates to items in the base table trigger writes to a GSI in on-demand mode that exceed the GSI's configured maximum write throughput capacity, causing [back-pressure throttling](gsi-throttling.md). You can monitor the CloudWatch metrics in [Common diagnosis and monitoring](#ondemand-capacity-exceeded-diagnosis-monitoring) to analyze your throttling event.

**Remediation options**
Consider these steps to address your throttling events:
+ **Increase GSI maximum throughput limit:** Use the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb), [AWS CLI](/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AccessingDynamoDB.html#Tools.CLI), or the DynamoDB `[UpdateTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTable.html)` API to increase the [`MaxWriteRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_OnDemandThroughput.html#DDB-Type-OnDemandThroughput-MaxWriteRequestUnits) value for the affected GSI, then monitor and adjust.
+ **Remove the GSI maximum limit:** Set `MaxWriteRequestUnits` to `-1` for the GSI to remove the ceiling, allowing scaling based on demand up to your account-level throughput quotas. This removes your custom limit but still maintains AWS's account-level safeguards. However, it's important to monitor spending closely after removing this limit.

## Common diagnosis and monitoring
<a name="ondemand-capacity-exceeded-diagnosis-monitoring"></a>

When troubleshooting on-demand maximum throughput exceeded throttling events, several CloudWatch metrics can help identify the root cause and scaling patterns.

**Essential CloudWatch metrics**
Monitor these key metrics to diagnose on-demand maximum throughput exceeded throttling:
+ **Maximum throughput throttling events:** [`ReadMaxOnDemandThroughputThrottleEvents`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#ReadMaxOnDemandThroughputThrottleEvents) and [`WriteMaxOnDemandThroughputThrottleEvents`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#WriteMaxOnDemandThroughputThrottleEvents) track when requests are throttled due to exceeding maximum limits. [`ReadThrottleEvents`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#ReadThrottleEvents) and [`WriteThrottleEvents`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#WriteThrottleEvents) track when any read or write requests exceed the provisioned capacity.
+ **Current maximum throughput configured for a table or global secondary index:** [`OnDemandMaxReadRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#OnDemandMaxReadRequestUnits) and [`OnDemandMaxWriteRequestUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#OnDemandMaxWriteRequestUnits) show the current maximum capacity limits.
+ **Actual capacity consumption:** [`ConsumedReadCapacityUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#ConsumedReadCapacityUnits) and [`ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/metrics-dimensions.html#ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits) show actual usage patterns.

**Analysis approach**
Follow these steps to confirm on-demand maximum throughput exceeded diagnosis:

1. Compare consumed capacity to maximum capacity limits - check if consumption consistently approaches or exceeds maximum limits.

1. Review throttling event frequency and timing to identify patterns. Look for sudden increases in consumed capacity that coincides with your throttling event.

1. Use [CloudWatch Contributor Insights](contributorinsights_HowItWorks.md) to identify which items or partition keys consume the most capacity.
