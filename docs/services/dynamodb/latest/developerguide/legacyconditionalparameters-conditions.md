# Writing conditions with legacy parameters

###### Note

We recommend that you use the new expression parameters instead of these legacy parameters whenever possible.
For more information, see [Using expressions in DynamoDB](expressions.md).

The following section describes how to write conditions for use with legacy
parameters, such as `Expected`, `QueryFilter`, and
`ScanFilter`.

###### Note

New applications should use expression parameters instead. For more
information, see [Using expressions in DynamoDB](expressions.md).

## Simple conditions

With attribute values, you can write conditions for comparisons against table
attributes. A condition always evaluates to true or false, and consists
of:

- `ComparisonOperator` — greater than, less than, equal
to, and so on.

- `AttributeValueList` (optional) — attribute value(s)
to compare against. Depending on the `ComparisonOperator`
being used, the `AttributeValueList` might contain one, two,
or more values; or it might not be present at all.

The following sections describe the various comparison operators, along with
examples of how to use them in conditions.

### Comparison operators with no attribute values

- `NOT_NULL` \- true if an attribute exists.

- `NULL` \- true if an attribute does not
exist.

Use these operators to check whether an attribute exists, or doesn't
exist. Because there is no value to compare against, do not specify
`AttributeValueList`.

**Example**

The following expression evaluates to true if the
_Dimensions_ attribute exists.

```nohighlight

...
    "Dimensions": {
         ComparisonOperator: "NOT_NULL"
    }
...
```

### Comparison operators with one attribute value

- `EQ` \- true if an attribute is equal to a
value.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary
Set. If an item contains a value of a different type than the
one specified in the request, the value does not match. For
example, the string `"3"` is not equal to the number
`3`. Also, the number `3` is not equal
to the number set `[3, 2, 1]`.

- `NE` \- true if an attribute is not equal to a
value.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary
Set. If an item contains a value of a different type than the
one specified in the request, the value does not match.

- `LE` \- true if an attribute is less than or equal
to a value.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If an item contains
an `AttributeValue` of a different type than the one
specified in the request, the value does not match.

- `LT` \- true if an attribute is less than a
value.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If an item contains
a value of a different type than the one specified in the
request, the value does not match.

- `GE` \- true if an attribute is greater than or
equal to a value.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If an item contains
a value of a different type than the one specified in the
request, the value does not match.

- `GT` \- true if an attribute is greater than a
value.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If an item contains
a value of a different type than the one specified in the
request, the value does not match.

- `CONTAINS` \- true if a value is present within a
set, or if one value contains another.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If the target
attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator
checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the
comparison is Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence
of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of
the comparison is a set, then the operator evaluates to true if
it finds an exact match with any member of the set.

- `NOT_CONTAINS` \- true if a value is
_not_ present within a set, or if one
value does not contain another value.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). If the target
attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator
checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target
attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks
for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the
input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set, then
the operator evaluates to true if it _does_
_not_ find an exact match with any member of the
set.

- `BEGINS_WITH` \- true if the first few characters of
an attribute match the provided value. Do not use this operator
for comparing numbers.

`AttributeValueList` can contain only one value of
type String or Binary (not a Number or a set). The target
attribute of the comparison must be a String or Binary (not a
Number or a set).

Use these operators to compare an attribute with a value. You must specify
an `AttributeValueList` consisting of a single value. For most of
the operators, this value must be a scalar; however, the `EQ` and
`NE` operators also support sets.

**Examples**

The following expressions evaluate to true if:

- A product's price is greater than 100.

```nohighlight

...
      "Price": {
          ComparisonOperator: "GT",
          AttributeValueList: [ {"N":"100"} ]
      }
...
```

- A product category begins with "Bo".

```nohighlight

...
      "ProductCategory": {
          ComparisonOperator: "BEGINS_WITH",
          AttributeValueList: [ {"S":"Bo"} ]
      }
...
```

- A product is available in either red, green, or
black:

```nohighlight

...
      "Color": {
          ComparisonOperator: "EQ",
          AttributeValueList: [
              [ {"S":"Black"}, {"S":"Red"}, {"S":"Green"} ]
          ]
      }
...
```

###### Note

When comparing set data types, the order of the
elements does not matter. DynamoDB will return only the
items with the same set of values, regardless of the
order in which you specify them in your request.

### Comparison operators with two attribute values

- `BETWEEN` \- true if a value is between a lower
bound and an upper bound, endpoints inclusive.

`AttributeValueList` must contain two elements of
the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set). A
target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or
equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the
second element. If an item contains a value of a different type
than the one specified in the request, the value does not
match.

Use this operator to determine if an attribute value is within a range.
The `AttributeValueList` must contain two scalar elements of the
same type - String, Number, or Binary.

**Example**

The following expression evaluates to true if a product's price is
between 100 and 200.

```nohighlight

...
    "Price": {
        ComparisonOperator: "BETWEEN",
        AttributeValueList: [ {"N":"100"}, {"N":"200"} ]
    }
...
```

### Comparison operators with _n_ attribute values

- `IN` \- true if a value is equal to any of the
values in an enumerated list. Only scalar values are supported
in the list, not sets. The target attribute must be of the same
type and exact value in order to match.

`AttributeValueList` can contain one or more
elements of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). These
attributes are compared against an existing non-set type
attribute of an item. If _any_ elements of
the input set are present in the item attribute, the expression
evaluates to true.

`AttributeValueList` can contain one or more values
of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set). The target
attribute of the comparison must be of the same type and exact
value to match. A String never matches a String set.

Use this operator to determine whether the supplied value is within an
enumerated list. You can specify any number of scalar values in
`AttributeValueList`, but they all must be of the same data
type.

**Example**

The following expression evaluates to true if the value for
_Id_ is 201, 203, or 205.

```nohighlight

...
    "Id": {
        ComparisonOperator: "IN",
        AttributeValueList: [ {"N":"201"}, {"N":"203"}, {"N":"205"} ]
    }
...
```

## Using multiple conditions

DynamoDB lets you combine multiple conditions to form complex expressions. You do
this by providing at least two expressions, with an optional
[ConditionalOperator (legacy)](legacyconditionalparameters-conditionaloperator.md).

By default, when you specify more than one condition, _all_
of the conditions must evaluate to true in order for the entire expression to
evaluate to true. In other words, an implicit _AND_ operation
takes place.

**Example**

The following expression evaluates to true if a product is a book that has
at least 600 pages. Both of the conditions must evaluate to true, since they are
implicitly _AND_ ed together.

```nohighlight

...
    "ProductCategory": {
        ComparisonOperator: "EQ",
        AttributeValueList: [ {"S":"Book"} ]
    },
    "PageCount": {
        ComparisonOperator: "GE",
        AttributeValueList: [ {"N":600"} ]
    }
...
```

You can use
[ConditionalOperator (legacy)](legacyconditionalparameters-conditionaloperator.md) to clarify that an
_AND_ operation will take place. The following example
behaves in the same manner as the previous one.

```nohighlight

...
    "ConditionalOperator" : "AND",
    "ProductCategory": {
        "ComparisonOperator": "EQ",
        "AttributeValueList": [ {"N":"Book"} ]
    },
    "PageCount": {
        "ComparisonOperator": "GE",
        "AttributeValueList": [ {"N":600"} ]
    }
...
```

You can also set `ConditionalOperator` to _OR_,
which means that _at least one_ of the conditions must
evaluate to true.

**Example**

The following expression evaluates to true if a product is a mountain
bike, if it is a particular brand name, or if its price is greater than 100.

```nohighlight

...
    ConditionalOperator : "OR",
    "BicycleType": {
        "ComparisonOperator": "EQ",
        "AttributeValueList": [ {"S":"Mountain" ]
    },
    "Brand": {
        "ComparisonOperator": "EQ",
        "AttributeValueList": [ {"S":"Brand-Company A" ]
    },
    "Price": {
        "ComparisonOperator": "GT",
        "AttributeValueList": [ {"N":"100"} ]
    }
...
```

###### Note

In a complex expression, the conditions are processed in order, from the
first condition to the last.

You cannot use both AND and OR in a single expression.

## Other conditional operators

In previous releases of DynamoDB, the `Expected` parameter behaved
differently for conditional writes. Each item in the `Expected` map
represented an attribute name for DynamoDB to check, along with the
following:

- `Value` — a value to compare against the
attribute.

- `Exists` — determine whether the value exists prior
to attempting the operation.

The `Value` and `Exists` options continue to be
supported in DynamoDB; however, they only let you test for an equality condition,
or whether an attribute exists. We recommend that you use
`ComparisonOperator` and `AttributeValueList` instead,
because these options let you construct a much wider range of conditions.

###### Example

A `DeleteItem` can check to see whether a book is no longer in
publication, and only delete it if this condition is true. Here is an AWS CLI
example using a legacy condition:

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb delete-item \
    --table-name ProductCatalog \
    --key '{
        "Id": {"N":"600"}
    }' \
    --expected '{
        "InPublication": {
            "Exists": true,
            "Value": {"BOOL":false}
        }
    }'

```

The following example does the same thing, but does not use a legacy
condition:

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb delete-item \
    --table-name ProductCatalog \
    --key '{
        "Id": {"N":"600"}
    }' \
    --expected '{
        "InPublication": {
            "ComparisonOperator": "EQ",
            "AttributeValueList": [ {"BOOL":false} ]
        }
    }'

```

###### Example

A `PutItem` operation can protect against overwriting an
existing item with the same primary key attributes. Here is an example using
a legacy condition:

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name ProductCatalog \
    --item '{
      "Id": {"N":"500"},
        "Title": {"S":"Book 500 Title"}
    }' \
    --expected '{
        "Id": { "Exists": false }
    }'
```

The following example does the same thing, but does not use a legacy
condition:

```nohighlight

aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name ProductCatalog \
    --item '{
      "Id": {"N":"500"},
        "Title": {"S":"Book 500 Title"}
    }' \
    --expected '{
        "Id": { "ComparisonOperator": "NULL" }
    }'
```

###### Note

For conditions in the `Expected` map, do not use the legacy
`Value` and `Exists` options together with
`ComparisonOperator` and `AttributeValueList`. If
you do this, your conditional write will fail.
