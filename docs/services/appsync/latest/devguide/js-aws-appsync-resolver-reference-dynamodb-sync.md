# Sync

The `Sync` request object lets you retrieve all the results from a DynamoDB
table and then receive only the data altered since your last query (the delta updates).
`Sync` requests can only be made to versioned DynamoDB data sources. You can
specify the following:

- A filter to exclude results

- How many items to return

- Pagination Token

- When your last `Sync` operation was started

The `Sync` request object has the following structure:

```TypeScript

type DynamoDBSyncRequest = {
  operation: 'Sync';
  basePartitionKey?: string;
  deltaIndexName?: string;
  limit?: number;
  nextToken?: string;
  lastSync?: number;
  filter?: {
    expression: string;
    expressionNames?: { [key: string]: string };
    expressionValues?: { [key: string]: any };
  };
};
```

The fields are defined as follows:

## Sync fields

**`operation`**

The DynamoDB operation to perform. To perform the `Sync`
operation, this must be set to `Sync`. This value is
required.

**`filter`**

A filter that can be used to filter the results from DynamoDB before they
are returned. For more information about filters, see [Filters](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md#js-aws-appsync-resolver-reference-dynamodb-filter). This field is optional.

**`limit`**

The maximum number of items to evaluate at a single time. This field
is optional. If omitted, the default limit will be set to
`100` items. The maximum value for this field is
`1000` items.

**`nextToken`**

The pagination token to continue a previous query. This would have
been obtained from a previous query. This field is optional.

**`lastSync`**

The moment, in epoch milliseconds, when the last successful
`Sync` operation started. If specified, only items that
have changed after `lastSync` are returned. This field is
optional, and should only be populated after retrieving all pages from an
initial `Sync` operation. If omitted, results from the
_Base_ table will be
returned, otherwise, results from the _Delta_ table will be returned.

**`basePartitionKey`**

The partition key of the _Base_ table used when
performing a `Sync` operation. This field allows a
`Sync` operation to be performed when the table utilizes a
custom partition key. This is an optional field.

**`deltaIndexName`**

The index used for the `Sync` operation. This index is
required to enable a `Sync` operation on the whole delta store
table when the table uses a custom partition key. The `Sync`
operation will be performed on the GSI (created on `gsi_ds_pk`
and `gsi_ds_sk`). This field is optional.

The results returned by the DynamoDB sync are automatically converted into GraphQL and JSON
primitive types and are available in the context result
( `context.result`).

For more information about DynamoDB type conversion, see [Type system (response mapping)](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md#js-aws-appsync-resolver-reference-dynamodb-typed-values-responses).

For more information about JavaScript resolvers, see [JavaScript resolvers\
overview](resolver-reference-overview-js.md).

The results have the following structure:

```TypeScript

{
    items = [ ... ],
    nextToken = "a pagination token",
    scannedCount = 10,
    startedAt = 1550000000000
}
```

The fields are defined as follows:

**`items`**

A list containing the items returned by the sync.

**`nextToken`**

If there might be more results, `nextToken` contains a pagination
token that you can use in another request. AWS AppSync encrypts and obfuscates the
pagination token returned from DynamoDB. This prevents your table data from being
inadvertently leaked to the caller. Also, these pagination tokens can’t be used
across different functions or resolvers.

**`scannedCount`**

The number of items that were retrieved by DynamoDB before a filter expression (if
present) was applied.

**`startedAt`**

The moment, in epoch milliseconds, when the sync operation started that you can
store locally and use in another request as your `lastSync` argument.
If a pagination token was included in the request, this value will be the same as
the one returned by the request for the first page of results.

## Example

The following example is a function request handler for the GraphQL query:
`syncPosts(nextToken: String, lastSync: AWSTimestamp)`.

In this example, if `lastSync` is omitted, all entries in the base table
are returned. If `lastSync` is supplied, only the entries in the delta sync
table that have changed since `lastSync` are returned.

```TypeScript

export function request(ctx) {
  const { nextToken, lastSync } = ctx.args;
  return { operation: 'Sync', limit: 100, nextToken, lastSync };
}
```
