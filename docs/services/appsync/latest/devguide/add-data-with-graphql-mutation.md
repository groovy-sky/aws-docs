# Using GraphQL mutations to add data to a DynamoDB table in the AWS AppSync console

Your next step is to add data to your blank DynamoDB table using a GraphQL mutation. Mutations are one of the
fundamental operation types in GraphQL. They are defined in the schema and allow you to manipulate data in your
data source. In terms of REST APIs, these are very similar to operations like `PUT` or
`POST`.

###### To add data to your data source

1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AppSync console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync).

2. Choose your API from the table.

3. In the tab to the left, choose **Queries**.

4. In the **Explorer** tab to the left of the table, you might see several
    mutations and queries already defined in the query editor:

![Explorer tab showing a dropdown menu with mutation and query options like createTodo and deleteTodo.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/explorer-example-1.png)

###### Note

This mutation is actually sitting in your schema as the `Mutation` type. It has the
code:

```SDL

type Mutation {
   	createTodo(input: CreateTodoInput!): Todo
   	updateTodo(input: UpdateTodoInput!): Todo
   	deleteTodo(input: DeleteTodoInput!): Todo
}
```

As you can see, the operations here are similar to what's inside the query editor.

AWS AppSync automatically generated these from the model we defined earlier. This example will use the
    `createTodo` mutation to add entries to our `TodoAPITable`
    table.

5. Choose the `createTodo` operation by expanding it under the `createTodo`
    mutation:

![Expanded createTodo mutation showing input fields like description, id, name, when, and where.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/devguide/images/explorer-example-2.png)

Enable the checkboxes for all of the fields like the picture above.

###### Note

The attributes you see here are the different modifiable elements of the mutation. Your
`input` can be thought of as the parameter of `createTodo`. The various
options with checkboxes are the fields that will be returned in the response once an operation is
performed.

6. In the code editor in the center of the screen, you'll notice that the operation appears underneath
    the `createTodo` mutation:

```TypeScript

mutation createTodo($createtodoinput: CreateTodoInput!) {
     createTodo(input: $createtodoinput) {
       where
       when
       name
       id
       description
     }
}
```

###### Note

To explain this snippet properly, we must also look at the schema code. The declaration
`mutation createTodo($createtodoinput: CreateTodoInput!){}` is the mutation with one of
its operations, `createTodo`. The full mutation is located in the schema:

```SDL

type Mutation {
   	createTodo(input: CreateTodoInput!): Todo
   	updateTodo(input: UpdateTodoInput!): Todo
   	deleteTodo(input: DeleteTodoInput!): Todo
}
```

Going back to the mutation declaration from the editor, the parameter is an object called
`$createtodoinput` with a required input type of `CreateTodoInput`. Note
that `CreateTodoInput` (and all inputs in the mutation) are also defined in the schema. For
example, here's the boilerplate code for `CreateTodoInput`:

```SDL

input CreateTodoInput {
   	name: String
   	when: String
   	where: String
   	description: String
}
```

It contains the fields we defined in our model, namely `name`, `when`,
`where`, and `description`.

Going back to the editor code, in `createTodo(input: $createtodoinput) {}`, we declare
the input as `$createtodoinput`, which was also used in the mutation declaration. We do
this because this allows GraphQL to validate our inputs against the provided types and ensure that
they are being used with the correct inputs.

The final part of the editor code shows the fields that will be returned in the response after an
operation is performed:

```SDL

{
       where
       when
       name
       id
       description
     }
```

In the **Query variables** tab below this editor, there will be a generic
    `createtodoinput` object that may have the following data:

```SDL

{
     "createtodoinput": {
       "name": "Hello, world!",
       "when": "Hello, world!",
       "where": "Hello, world!",
       "description": "Hello, world!"
     }
}
```

###### Note

This is where we allocate the values for the input mentioned earlier:

```SDL

input CreateTodoInput {
   	name: String
   	when: String
   	where: String
   	description: String
}
```

Change the `createtodoinput` by adding information we want to put in our DynamoDB table. In
    this case, we wanted to create some `Todo` items as reminders:

```SDL

{
     "createtodoinput": {
       "name": "Shopping List",
       "when": "Friday",
       "where": "Home",
       "description": "I need to buy eggs"
     }
}
```

7. Choose **Run** at the top of the editor. Choose **createTodo** in the drop-down list. On the right-hand side of the editor, you should see the
    response. It may look something like this:

```SDL

{
     "data": {
       "createTodo": {
         "where": "Home",
         "when": "Friday",
         "name": "Shopping List",
         "id": "abcdefgh-1234-1234-1234-abcdefghijkl",
         "description": "I need to buy eggs"
       }
     }
}
```

If you navigate to the DynamoDB service, you'll now see an entry in your data source with this
    information:

To summarize the operation, the GraphQL engine parsed the record, and a resolver inserted it into your
Amazon DynamoDB table. Again, you can verify this in the DynamoDB console. Notice that you don’t need to pass in an
`id` value. An `id` is generated and returned in the results. This is because the
example used an `autoId()` function in a GraphQL resolver for the partition key set on your DynamoDB
resources. We will cover how you can build resolvers in a different section. Take note of the returned
`id` value; you will use it in the next section to retrieve data with a GraphQL query.
