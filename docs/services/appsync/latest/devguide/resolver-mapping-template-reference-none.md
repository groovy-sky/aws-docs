# AWS AppSync resolver mapping template reference for `None` data source

###### Note

We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please consider using the
APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](resolver-reference-js-version.md).

The AWS AppSync resolver mapping template used with the data source of type _None_,
enables you to shape requests for AWS AppSync local operations.

## Request mapping template

The mapping template is simple and enables you to pass as much context information as
possible via the `payload` field.

```sh

{
   "version": string,
   "payload": any type
}
```

Here is the JSON schema representation of the request mapping template, once
resolved:

```sh

{
    "definitions": {},
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-06/schema#",
    "$id": "https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/request-mapping-template.json",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "version": {
            "$id": "/properties/version",
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [
                "2018-05-29"
            ],
            "title": "The Mapping template version.",
            "default": "2018-05-29"
        },
        "payload": {}
    },
    "required": [
        "version"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Here is an example where the field arguments are passed via the VTL context
property `$context.arguments`:

```sh

{
    "version": "2018-05-29",
    "payload": $util.toJson($context.arguments)
}
```

The value of the `payload` field will be forwarded to the response mapping
template and available on the VTL context property
( `$context.result`).

This is an example representing the interpolated value of the `payload`
field:

```sh

{
    "id": "postId1"
}
```

## Version

Common to all request mapping templates, the `version` field defines the version used
by the template.

The `version` field is required.

Example:

```sh

"version": "2018-05-29"
```

## Payload

The `payload` field is a container that can be used to pass any well-formed
JSON to the response mapping template.

The `payload` field is optional.

## Response mapping template

Because there is no data source, the value of the `payload` field will be
forwarded to the response mapping template and set on the `context` object
that is available via the VTL `$context.result` property.

If the shape of the `payload` field value exactly matches the shape of the
GraphQL type, you can forward the response using the following response mapping
template:

```sh

$util.toJson($context.result)
```

There are no required fields or shape restrictions that apply to the response mapping
template. However, because GraphQL is strongly typed, the resolved mapping template must
match the expected GraphQL type.
