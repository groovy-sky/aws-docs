# Using pipeline resolvers in AWS AppSync
<a name="tutorial-pipeline-resolvers"></a>

**Note**
We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please consider using the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/tutorials-js.html).

AWS AppSync provides a simple way to wire a GraphQL field to a single data source through unit resolvers. However, executing a single operation might not be enough. Pipeline resolvers offer the ability to serially execute operations against data sources. Create functions in your API and attach them to a pipeline resolver. Each function execution result is piped to the next until no function is left to execute. With pipeline resolvers you can now build more complex workflows directly in AWS AppSync. In this tutorial, you build a simple pictures viewing app, where users can post and view pictures posted by their friends.

## One-Click Setup
<a name="one-click-setup"></a>

If you want to automatically set up the GraphQL endpoint in AWS AppSync with all the resolvers configured and the necessary AWS resources, you can use the following AWS CloudFormation template :

[![Blue button labeled "Launch Stack" with an arrow icon indicating an action to start.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?templateURL=https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/awsappsync/resources/pipeline/pipeline-resolvers-full.yaml)

This stack creates the following resources in your account:
+ IAM Role for AWS AppSync to access the resources in your account
+ 2 DynamoDB tables
+ 1 Amazon Cognito user pool
+ 2 Amazon Cognito user pool groups
+ 3 Amazon Cognito user pool users
+ 1 AWS AppSync API

At the end of the AWS CloudFormation stack creation process you receive one email for each of the three Amazon Cognito users that were created. Each email contains a temporary password that you use to log in as an Amazon Cognito user to the AWS AppSync console. Save the passwords for the remainder of the tutorial.

## Manual Setup
<a name="manual-setup"></a>

If you prefer to manually go through a step-by-step process through the AWS AppSync console, follow the setup process below.

### Setting Up Your Non AWS AppSync Resources
<a name="setting-up-your-non-aws-appsync-resources"></a>

The API communicates with two DynamoDB tables: a **pictures** table that stores pictures and a **friends** table that stores relationships between users. The API is configured to use Amazon Cognito user pool as authentication type. The following CloudFormation stack sets up these resources in the account.

[![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?templateURL=https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/awsappsync/resources/pipeline/pipeline-resolvers-resources-only.yaml)

At the end of the AWS CloudFormation stack creation process you receive one email for each of the three Amazon Cognito users that were created. Each email contains a temporary password that you use to log in as an Amazon Cognito user to the AWS AppSync console. Save the passwords for the remainder of the tutorial.

### Creating Your GraphQL API
<a name="creating-your-graphql-api"></a>

To create the GraphQL API in AWS AppSync:

1. Open the AWS AppSync console and choose **Build From Scratch** and choose **Start**.

1. Set the name of the API to `AppSyncTutorial-PicturesViewer`.

1. Choose **Create**.

The AWS AppSync console creates a new GraphQL API for you using the API key authentication mode. You can use the console to set up the rest of the GraphQL API and run queries against it for the rest of this tutorial.

### Configuring The GraphQL API
<a name="configuring-the-graphql-api"></a>

You need to configure the AWS AppSync API with the Amazon Cognito user pool that you just created.

1. Choose the **Settings** tab.

1. Under the **Authorization Type** section, choose *Amazon Cognito User Pool*.

1. Under **User Pool Configuration**, choose **US-WEST-2** for the *AWS Region*.

1. Choose the **AppSyncTutorial-UserPool** user pool.

1. Choose **DENY** as *Default Action*.

1. Leave the **AppId client regex** field blank.

1. Choose **Save**.

The API is now set up to use Amazon Cognito user pool as its authorization type.

### Configuring Data Sources for the DynamoDB Tables
<a name="configuring-data-sources-for-the-ddb-tables"></a>

After the DynamoDB tables have been created, navigate to your AWS AppSync GraphQL API in the console and choose the **Data Sources** tab. Now, you’re going to create a datasource in AWS AppSync for each of the DynamoDB tables that you just created.

1. Choose the **Data source** tab.

1. Choose **New** to create a new data source.

1. For the data source name, enter `PicturesDynamoDBTable`.

1. For data source type, choose **Amazon DynamoDB table**.

1. For region, choose **US-WEST-2**.

1. From the list of tables, choose the **AppSyncTutorial-Pictures**DynamoDB table.

1. In the **Create or use an existing role** section, choose **Existing role**.

1. Choose the role that was just created from the CloudFormation template. If you did not change the *ResourceNamePrefix*, the name of the role should be **AppSyncTutorial-DynamoDBRole**.

1. Choose **Create**.

Repeat the same process for the **friends** table, the name of the DynamoDB table should be **AppSyncTutorial-Friends** if you did not change the *ResourceNamePrefix* parameter at the time of creating the CloudFormation stack.

### Creating the GraphQL Schema
<a name="creating-the-graphql-schema"></a>

Now that the data sources are connected to your DynamoDB tables, let’s create a GraphQL schema. From the schema editor in the AWS AppSync console, make sure your schema matches the following schema:

```
schema {
    query: Query
    mutation: Mutation
}

type Mutation {
    createPicture(input: CreatePictureInput!): Picture!
    @aws_auth(cognito_groups: ["Admins"])
    createFriendship(id: ID!, target: ID!): Boolean
    @aws_auth(cognito_groups: ["Admins"])
}

type Query {
    getPicturesByOwner(id: ID!): [Picture]
    @aws_auth(cognito_groups: ["Admins", "Viewers"])
}

type Picture {
    id: ID!
    owner: ID!
    src: String
}

input CreatePictureInput {
    owner: ID!
    src: String!
}
```

Choose **Save Schema** to save your schema.

Some of the schema fields have been annotated with the *@aws\_auth* directive. Since the API default action configuration is set to *DENY*, the API rejects all users that are not members of the groups mentioned inside the *@aws\_auth* directive. For more information about how to secure your API, you can read the [Security](security-authz.md#aws-appsync-security) page. In this case, only admin users have access to the *Mutation.createPicture* and *Mutation.createFriendship* fields, while users that are members of either *Admins* or *Viewers* groups can access the *Query.getPicturesByOwner* field. All other users don’t have access.

### Configuring Resolvers
<a name="configuring-resolvers"></a>

Now that you have a valid GraphQL schema and two data sources, you can attach resolvers to the GraphQL fields on the schema. The API offers the following capabilities:
+ Create a picture via the *Mutation.createPicture* field
+ Create friendship via the *Mutation.createFriendship* field
+ Retrieve a picture via the *Query.getPicture* field

#### Mutation.createPicture
<a name="mutation-createpicture"></a>

From the schema editor in the AWS AppSync console, on the right side choose **Attach Resolver** for `createPicture(input: CreatePictureInput!): Picture!`. Choose the DynamoDB*PicturesDynamoDBTable* data source. In the **request mapping template** section, add the following template:

```
#set($id = $util.autoId())

{
    "version" : "2018-05-29",

    "operation" : "PutItem",

    "key" : {
        "id" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($id),
        "owner": $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.input.owner)
    },

    "attributeValues" : $util.dynamodb.toMapValuesJson($ctx.args.input)
}
```

In the **response mapping template** section, add the following template:

```
#if($ctx.error)
    $util.error($ctx.error.message, $ctx.error.type)
#end
$util.toJson($ctx.result)
```

The create picture functionality is done. You are saving a picture in the **Pictures** table, using a randomly generated UUID as id of the picture, and using the Cognito username as owner of the picture.

#### Mutation.createFriendship
<a name="mutation-createfriendship"></a>

From the schema editor in the AWS AppSync console, on the right side choose **Attach Resolver** for `createFriendship(id: ID!, target: ID!): Boolean`. Choose the DynamoDB**FriendsDynamoDBTable** data source. In the **request mapping template** section, add the following template:

```
#set($userToFriendFriendship = { "userId" : "$ctx.args.id", "friendId": "$ctx.args.target" })
#set($friendToUserFriendship = { "userId" : "$ctx.args.target", "friendId": "$ctx.args.id" })
#set($friendsItems = [$util.dynamodb.toMapValues($userToFriendFriendship), $util.dynamodb.toMapValues($friendToUserFriendship)])

{
    "version" : "2018-05-29",
    "operation" : "BatchPutItem",
    "tables" : {
        ## Replace 'AppSyncTutorial-' default below with the ResourceNamePrefix you provided in the CloudFormation template
        "AppSyncTutorial-Friends": $util.toJson($friendsItems)
    }
}
```

Important: In the **BatchPutItem** request template, the exact name of the DynamoDB table should be present. The default table name is *AppSyncTutorial-Friends*. If you are using the wrong table name, you get an error when AppSync tries to assume the provided role.

For the sake of simplicity in this tutorial, proceed as if the friendship request has been approved and save the relationship entry directly into the **AppSyncTutorialFriends** table.

Effectively, you’re storing two items for each friendship as the relationship is bi-directional. For more details about Amazon DynamoDB best practices to represent many-to-many relationships, see [DynamoDB Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-adjacency-graphs.html) .

In the **response mapping template** section, add the following template:

```
#if($ctx.error)
    $util.error($ctx.error.message, $ctx.error.type)
#end
true
```

Note: Make sure your request template contains the right table name. The default name is *AppSyncTutorial-Friends*, but your table name might differ if you changed the CloudFormation **ResourceNamePrefix** parameter.

#### Query.getPicturesByOwner
<a name="query-getpicturesbyowner"></a>

Now that you have friendships and pictures, you need to provide the ability for users to view their friends’ pictures. To satisfy this requirement, you need to first check that the requester is friend with the owner, and finally query for the pictures.

Because this functionality requires two data source operations, you’re going to create two functions. The first function, **isFriend**, checks whether the requester and the owner are friends. The second function, **getPicturesByOwner**, retrieves the requested pictures given an owner ID. Let’s look at the execution flow below for the proposed resolver on the *Query.getPicturesByOwner* field:

1. Before mapping template: Prepare the context and field input arguments.

1. isFriend function: Checks whether the requester is the owner of the picture. If not, it checks whether the requester and owner users are friends by doing a DynamoDB GetItem operation on the friends table.

1. getPicturesByOwner function: Retrieves pictures from the Pictures table using a DynamoDB Query operation on the *owner-index* Global Secondary Index.

1. After mapping template: Maps picture result so DynamoDB attributes map correctly to the expected GraphQL type fields.

Let’s first create the functions.

##### isFriend Function
<a name="isfriend-function"></a>

1. Choose the **Functions** tab.

1. Choose **Create Function** to create a function.

1. For the data source name, enter `FriendsDynamoDBTable`.

1. For the function name, enter *isFriend*.

1. Inside the request mapping template text area, paste the following template:

   ```
   #set($ownerId = $ctx.prev.result.owner)
   #set($callerId = $ctx.prev.result.callerId)

   ## if the owner is the caller, no need to make the check
   #if($ownerId == $callerId)
       #return($ctx.prev.result)
   #end

   {
       "version" : "2018-05-29",

       "operation" : "GetItem",

       "key" : {
           "userId" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($callerId),
           "friendId" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ownerId)
       }
   }
   ```

1. Inside the response mapping template text area, paste the following template:

   ```
   #if($ctx.error)
       $util.error("Unable to retrieve friend mapping message: ${ctx.error.message}", $ctx.error.type)
   #end

   ## if the users aren't friends
   #if(!$ctx.result)
       $util.unauthorized()
   #end

   $util.toJson($ctx.prev.result)
   ```

1. Choose **Create Function**.

Result: You’ve created the **isFriend** function.

##### getPicturesByOwner function
<a name="getpicturesbyowner-function"></a>

1. Choose the **Functions** tab.

1. Choose **Create Function** to create a function.

1. For the data source name, enter `PicturesDynamoDBTable`.

1. For the function name, enter `getPicturesByOwner`.

1. Inside the request mapping template text area, paste the following template:

   ```
   {
       "version" : "2018-05-29",

       "operation" : "Query",

       "query" : {
           "expression": "#owner = :owner",
           "expressionNames": {
               "#owner" : "owner"
           },
           "expressionValues" : {
               ":owner" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.prev.result.owner)
           }
       },

       "index": "owner-index"
   }
   ```

1. Inside the response mapping template text area, paste the following template:

   ```
   #if($ctx.error)
       $util.error($ctx.error.message, $ctx.error.type)
   #end

   $util.toJson($ctx.result)
   ```

1. Choose **Create Function**.

Result: You’ve created the **getPicturesByOwner** function. Now that the functions have been created, attach a pipeline resolver to the *Query.getPicturesByOwner* field.

From the schema editor in the AWS AppSync console, on the right side choose **Attach Resolver** for `Query.getPicturesByOwner(id: ID!): [Picture]`. On the following page, choose the **Convert to pipeline resolver** link that appears underneath the data source drop-down list. Use the following for the before mapping template:

```
#set($result = { "owner": $ctx.args.id, "callerId": $ctx.identity.username })
$util.toJson($result)
```

In the **after mapping template** section, use the following:

```
#foreach($picture in $ctx.result.items)
    ## prepend "src://" to picture.src property
    #set($picture['src'] = "src://${picture['src']}")
#end
$util.toJson($ctx.result.items)
```

Choose **Create Resolver**. You have successfully attached your first pipeline resolver. On the same page, add the two functions you created previously. In the functions section, choose **Add A Function** and then choose or type the name of the first function, **isFriend**. Add the second function by following the same process for the **getPicturesByOwner** function. Make sure the **isFriend** function appears first in the list followed by the **getPicturesByOwner** function. You can use the up and down arrows to rearrange to order of execution of the functions in the pipeline.

Now that the pipeline resolver is created and you’ve attached the functions, let’s test the newly created GraphQL API.

## Testing Your GraphQL API
<a name="testing-your-graphql-api"></a>

First, you need to populate pictures and friendships by executing a few mutations using the admin user you created. On the left side of the AWS AppSync console, choose the **Queries** tab.

### createPicture Mutation
<a name="createpicture-mutation"></a>

1. In AWS AppSync console, choose the **Queries** tab.

1. Choose **Login With User Pools**.

1. On the modal, enter the Cognito Sample Client ID that was created by the CloudFormation stack for example, 37solo6mmhh7k4v63cqdfgdg5d).

1. Enter the user name you passed as parameter to the CloudFormation stack. Default is **nadia**.

1. Use the temporary password that was sent to the email you provided as parameter to the CloudFormation stack (for example, *UserPoolUserEmail*).

1. Choose Login. You should now see the button renamed to **Logout nadia**, or whatever user name you chose when creating the CloudFormation stack (that is, *UserPoolUsername*).

Let’s send a few *createPicture* mutations to populate the pictures table. Execute the following GraphQL query inside the console:

```
mutation {
  createPicture(input:{
    owner: "nadia"
    src: "nadia.jpg"
  }) {
    id
    owner
    src
  }
}
```

The response should look like below:

```
{
  "data": {
    "createPicture": {
      "id": "c6fedbbe-57ad-4da3-860a-ffe8d039882a",
      "owner": "nadia",
      "src": "nadia.jpg"
    }
  }
}
```

Let’s add a few more pictures:

```
mutation {
  createPicture(input:{
    owner: "shaggy"
    src: "shaggy.jpg"
  }) {
    id
    owner
    src
  }
}
```

```
mutation {
  createPicture(input:{
    owner: "rex"
    src: "rex.jpg"
  }) {
    id
    owner
    src
  }
}
```

You’ve added three pictures using **nadia** as the admin user.

### createFriendship Mutation
<a name="createfriendship-mutation"></a>

Let’s add a friendship entry. Execute the following mutations in the console.

Note: You must still be logged in as the admin user (the default admin user is **nadia**).

```
mutation {
  createFriendship(id: "nadia", target: "shaggy")
}
```

The response should look like:

```
{
  "data": {
    "createFriendship": true
  }
}
```

 **nadia** and **shaggy** are friends. **rex** is not friends with anybody.

### getPicturesByOwner Query
<a name="getpicturesbyowner-query"></a>

For this step, log in as the **nadia** user using Cognito User Pools, using the credentials set up in the beginning of this tutorial. As **nadia**, retrieve the pictures owned by **shaggy**.

```
query {
    getPicturesByOwner(id: "shaggy") {
        id
        owner
        src
    }
}
```

Since **nadia** and **shaggy** are friends, the query should return the corresponding picture.

```
{
  "data": {
    "getPicturesByOwner": [
      {
        "id": "05a16fba-cc29-41ee-a8d5-4e791f4f1079",
        "owner": "shaggy",
        "src": "src://shaggy.jpg"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Similarly, if **nadia** attempts to retrieve her own pictures, it also succeeds. The pipeline resolver has been optimized to avoid running the **isFriend** GetItem operation in that case. Try the following query:

```
query {
    getPicturesByOwner(id: "nadia") {
        id
        owner
        src
    }
}
```

If you enable logging on your API (in the **Settings** pane), set the debug level to **ALL**, and run the same query again, it returns logs for the field execution. By looking at the logs, you can determine whether the **isFriend** function returned early at the **Request Mapping Template** stage:

```
{
  "errors": [],
  "mappingTemplateType": "Request Mapping",
  "path": "[getPicturesByOwner]",
  "resolverArn": "arn:aws:appsync:us-west-2:XXXX:apis/XXXX/types/Query/fields/getPicturesByOwner",
  "functionArn": "arn:aws:appsync:us-west-2:XXXX:apis/XXXX/functions/o2f42p2jrfdl3dw7s6xub2csdfs",
  "functionName": "isFriend",
  "earlyReturnedValue": {
    "owner": "nadia",
    "callerId": "nadia"
  },
  "context": {
    "arguments": {
      "id": "nadia"
    },
    "prev": {
      "result": {
        "owner": "nadia",
        "callerId": "nadia"
      }
    },
    "stash": {},
    "outErrors": []
  },
  "fieldInError": false
}
```

The *earlyReturnedValue* key represents the data that was returned by the *\#return* directive.

Finally, even though **rex** is a member of the **Viewers** Cognito UserPool Group, and because **rex** isn’t friends with anybody, he won’t be able to access any of the pictures owned by **shaggy** or **nadia**. If you log in as **rex** in the console and execute the following query:

```
query {
    getPicturesByOwner(id: "nadia") {
        id
        owner
        src
    }
}
```

You get the following unauthorized error:

```
{
  "data": {
    "getPicturesByOwner": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": [
        "getPicturesByOwner"
      ],
      "data": null,
      "errorType": "Unauthorized",
      "errorInfo": null,
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 9,
          "sourceName": null
        }
      ],
      "message": "Not Authorized to access getPicturesByOwner on type Query"
    }
  ]
}
```

You have successfully implemented complex authorization using pipeline resolvers.
