# Versioning DynamoDB data sources in AWS AppSync
<a name="versioned-data-sources"></a>

AWS AppSync currently supports versioning on DynamoDB data sources. Conflict Detection, Conflict Resolution, and Sync operations require a `Versioned` data source. When you enable versioning on a data source, AWS AppSync will automatically:
+ Enhance items with object versioning metadata.
+ Record changes made to items with AWS AppSync mutations to a *Delta* table.
+ Maintain deleted items in the *Base* table with a “tombstone” for a configurable amount of time.

## Versioned data source configuration
<a name="versioned-data-source-configuration"></a>

When you enable versioning on a DynamoDB data source, you specify the following fields:

** `BaseTableTTL` **
The number of minutes to retain deleted items in the *Base* table with a “tombstone” - a metadata field indicating that the item has been deleted. You can set this value to *0* if you want items to be removed immediately when they are deleted. This field is required.

** `DeltaSyncTableName` **
The name of the table where changes made to items with AWS AppSync mutations are stored. This field is required.

** `DeltaSyncTableTTL` **
The number of minutes to retain items in the *Delta* table. This field is required.

## Delta sync table logging
<a name="delta-sync-table"></a>

AWS AppSync currently supports Delta Sync Logging for mutations using `PutItem`, `UpdateItem`, and `DeleteItem` DynamoDB operations.

When an AWS AppSync mutation changes an item in a versioned data source, a record of that change will be stored in a *Delta* table that is optimized for incremental updates. You can choose to use different *Delta* tables (e.g. one per type, one per domain area) for other versioned data sources or a single *Delta* table for your API. AWS AppSync recommends against using a single *Delta* table for multiple APIs to avoid the collision of primary keys.

The schema required for this table is as follows:

** `ds_pk` **
A string value that is used as the partition key. It is constructed by concatenating the *Base* data source name and the ISO 8601 format of the date the change occurred (e.g. `Comments:2019-01-01`).
When the `customPartitionKey` flag from the VTL mapping template is set as the column name of the partition key (see [Resolver Mapping Template Reference for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb.html#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb-updateitem) in the *AWS AppSync Developer Guide*), the format of `ds_pk` changes, and the string is constructed by appending it the value of the partition key in the new record in the *Base* table. For example, if the record in the *Base* table has a partition key value of `1a` and a sort key value of `2b`, the new value of the string will be: `Comments:2019-01-01:1a`.

** `ds_sk` **
A string value that is used as the sort key. It is constructed by concatenating the ISO 8601 format of the time the change occurred, the primary key of the item, and the version of the item. The combination of these fields guarantees uniqueness for every entry in the *Delta* table (e.g. for a time of `09:30:00` and an ID of `1a` and version of `2`, this would be `09:30:00:1a:2`).
When the `customPartitionKey` flag from the VTL mapping template is set to the column name of the partition key (see [Resolver Mapping Template Reference for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb.html#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb-updateitem) in the *AWS AppSync Developer Guide*), the format of `ds_sk` changes, and the string is constructed by replacing the value of the combination key with the value of the sort key in the *Base* table. Using the previous example above, if the record in the *Base* table has a partition key value of `1a` and a sort key value of `2b`, the new value of the string will be: `09:30:00:2b:3`.

** `_ttl` **
A numeric value that stores the timestamp, in epoch seconds, when an item should be removed from the *Delta* table. This value is determined by adding the `DeltaSyncTableTTL` value configured on the data source to the moment when the change occurred. This field should be configured as the DynamoDB TTL Attribute.

The IAM role configured for use with the *Base* table must also contain permission to operate on the *Delta* table. In this example, the permissions policy for a *Base* table called `Comments` and a *Delta* table called `ChangeLog` is displayed:

## Versioned data source metadata
<a name="versioned-data-source-metadata"></a>

AWS AppSync manages metadata fields on `Versioned` data sources on your behalf. Modifying these fields yourself may cause errors in your application or data loss. These fields include:

** `_version` **
A monotonically increasing counter that is updated any time that a change occurs to an item.

** `_lastChangedAt` **
A numeric value that stores the timestamp, in epoch milliseconds, when an item was last modified.

** `_deleted` **
A Boolean “tombstone” value that indicates that an item has been deleted. This can be used by applications to evict deleted items from local data stores.

** `_ttl` **
A numeric value that stores the timestamp, in epoch seconds, when an item should be removed from the underlying data source.

** `ds_pk` **
A string value that is used as the partition key for *Delta* tables.

** `ds_sk` **
A string value that is used as the sort key for *Delta* tables.

**`gsi_ds_pk`**
A string value attribute that's generated to support a global secondary index as a partition key. It will be included only if both the `customPartitionKey` and `populateIndexFields` flags are enabled in the VTL mapping template (see [Resolver Mapping Template Reference for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb.html#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb-updateitem) in the *AWS AppSync Developer Guide*). If enabled, the value will be constructed by concatenating the *Base* data source name and the ISO 8601 format of the date at which the change occurred (e.g. if the *Base* table is named *Comments*, this record will be set as `Comments:2019-01-01`).

**`gsi_ds_sk`**
A string value attribute that's generated to support a global secondary index as a sort key. It will be included only if both the `customPartitionKey` and `populateIndexFields` flags are enabled in the VTL mapping template (see [Resolver Mapping Template Reference for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb.html#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb-updateitem) in the *AWS AppSync Developer Guide*). If enabled, the value will be constructed by concatenating the ISO 8601 format of the time at which the change occurred, the partition key of the item in the *Base* table, the sort key of the item in the *Base* table, and the version of the item (e.g. for a time of `09:30:00`, a partition key value of `1a`, a sort key value of `2b`, and version of `3`, this would be `09:30:00:1a#2b:3`).

These metadata fields will impact the overall size of items in the underlying data source. AWS AppSync recommends reserving *500 bytes \+ Max Primary Key Size* of storage for versioned data source metadata when designing your application. To use this metadata in client applications, include the `_version`, `_lastChangedAt`, and `_deleted` fields on your GraphQL types and in the selection set for mutations.
