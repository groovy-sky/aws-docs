# Extensions

`extensions` contains a set of methods to make additional actions within your
resolvers.

**`extensions.evictFromApiCache(typeName: string,**
**fieldName: string, keyValuePair: Record<string, any>) :**
**Object`**

Evicts an item from the AWS AppSync server-side cache. The first argument
is the type name. The second argument is the field name. The third argument
is an object containing key-value pair items that specify the caching key
value. You must put the items in the object in the same order as the caching
keys in the cached resolver's `cachingKey`. For more information
about caching, see [Caching behavior](enabling-caching.md#caching-behavior).

**Example 1:**

This example evicts the items that were cached for a resolver called
`Query.allClasses` on which a caching key called
`context.arguments.semester` was used. When the mutation is
called and the resolver runs, if an entry is successfully cleared, then the
response contains an `apiCacheEntriesDeleted` value in the
extensions object that shows how many entries were deleted.

```

import { util, extensions } from '@aws-appsync/utils';

export const request = (ctx) => ({ payload: null });

export function response(ctx) {
	extensions.evictFromApiCache('Query', 'allClasses', {
		'context.arguments.semester': ctx.args.semester,
	});
	return null;
}
```

###### Note

This function **only** works for
mutations, not queries.

**`extensions.setSubscriptionFilter(filterJsonObject)`**

Defines enhanced subscription filters. Each subscription notification
event is evaluated against provided subscription filters and delivers
notifications to clients if all filters evaluate to `true`. The
argument is `filterJsonObject` (More information about this
argument can be found below in the _Argument:_
_filterJsonObject_ section.). See [Enhanced subscription filtering](aws-appsync-real-time-enhanced-filtering.md).

###### Note

You can use this extension function only in the response handler of a
subscription resolver. Also, we recommend using
`util.transform.toSubscriptionFilter` to create your
filter.

**`extensions.setSubscriptionInvalidationFilter(filterJsonObject)`**

Defines subscription invalidation filters. Subscription filters are
evaluated against the invalidation payload, then invalidate a given
subscription if the filters evaluate to `true`. The argument is
`filterJsonObject` (More information about this argument can
be found below in the _Argument:_
_filterJsonObject_ section.). See [Enhanced subscription filtering](aws-appsync-real-time-enhanced-filtering.md).

###### Note

You can use this extension function only in the response handler of a
subscription resolver. Also, we recommend using
`util.transform.toSubscriptionFilter` to create your
filter.

**`extensions.invalidateSubscriptions(invalidationJsonObject)`**

Used to initiate a subscription invalidation from a mutation. The
argument is `invalidationJsonObject`
(More information about this argument can be found below
in the _Argument: invalidationJsonObject_
section.).

###### Note

This extension can be used only in the response mapping templates of
the mutation resolvers.

You can only use at most five unique
`extensions.invalidateSubscriptions()` method calls in any
single request. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a GraphQL
error.

## Argument: filterJsonObject

The
JSON object defines either subscription or invalidation filters. It's an array of
filters in a `filterGroup`. Each filter is a collection of individual
filters.

```

{
    "filterGroup": [
        {
           "filters" : [
                 {
                    "fieldName" : "userId",
                    "operator" : "eq",
                    "value" : 1
                }
           ]

        },
        {
           "filters" : [
                {
                    "fieldName" : "group",
                    "operator" : "in",
                    "value" : ["Admin", "Developer"]
                }
           ]

        }
    ]
}
```

Each filter has three attributes:

- `fieldName` – The GraphQL schema field.

- `operator` – The operator type.

- `value` – The
values
to compare to the subscription notification
`fieldName` value.

The
following is an example assignment of these attributes:

```

{
 "fieldName" : "severity",
 "operator" : "le",
 "value" : context.result.severity
}
```

## Argument: invalidationJsonObject

The `invalidationJsonObject` defines the following:

- `subscriptionField` – The GraphQL schema subscription to
invalidate. A single subscription, defined as a string in the
`subscriptionField`, is considered for invalidation.

- `payload` – A key-value pair list that's used as the input
for invalidating subscriptions if the invalidation filter evaluates to
`true` against their values.

The following example invalidates subscribed and connected clients using the
`onUserDelete` subscription when the invalidation filter defined in
the subscription resolver evaluates to `true` against the
`payload` value.

```

export const request = (ctx) => ({ payload: null });

export function response(ctx) {
  	extensions.invalidateSubscriptions({
  		subscriptionField: 'onUserDelete',
  		payload: { group: 'Developer', type: 'Full-Time' },
  	});
  	return ctx.result;
}
```
