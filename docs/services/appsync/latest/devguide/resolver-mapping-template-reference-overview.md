# AWS AppSync resolver mapping template overview
<a name="resolver-mapping-template-reference-overview"></a>

**Note**
We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please consider using the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-reference-js-version.html).

AWS AppSync lets you respond to GraphQL requests by performing operations on your resources. For each GraphQL field you wish to run a query or mutation on, a resolver must be attached in order to communicate with a data source. The communication is typically through parameters or operations that are unique to the data source.

Resolvers are the connectors between GraphQL and a data source. They tell AWS AppSync how to translate an incoming GraphQL request into instructions for your backend data source, and how to translate the response from that data source back into a GraphQL response. They are written in the [Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL)](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/user-guide.html), which takes your request as input and outputs a JSON document containing the instructions for the resolver. You can use mapping templates for simple instructions, such as passing in arguments from GraphQL fields, or for more complex instructions, such as looping through arguments to build an item before inserting the item into DynamoDB.

There are two types of resolvers in AWS AppSync that leverage mapping templates in slightly different ways:
+ Unit resolvers
+ Pipeline resolvers

## Unit resolvers
<a name="unit-resolvers"></a>

Unit resolvers are self-contained entities which include a request and response template only. Use these for simple, single operations such as listing items from a single data source.
+ Request templates: Take the incoming request after a GraphQL operation is parsed and convert it into a request configuration for the selected data source operation.
+ Response templates: Interpret responses from your data source and map it to the shape of the GraphQL field output type.

## Pipeline resolvers
<a name="pipeline-resolvers"></a>

Pipeline resolvers contain one or more *functions* which are performed in sequential order. Each function includes a request template and response template. A pipeline resolver also has a *before* template and an *after* template that surround the sequence of functions that the template contains. The *after* template maps to the GraphQL field output type. Pipeline resolvers differ from unit resolvers in the way that the response template maps output. A pipeline resolver can map to any output you want, including the input for another function or the *after* template of the pipeline resolver.

 Pipeline resolver *functions* enable you to write common logic that you can reuse across multiple resolvers in your schema. Functions are attached directly to a data source, and like a unit resolver, contain the same request and response mapping template format.

The following diagram demonstrates the process flow of a unit resolver on the left and a pipeline resolver on the right.

![A diagram of a unit resolver that communicates with a single data source and a diagram of a pipeline resolver that communicates with multiple data sources.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/images/unit-pipeline-resolver.png)

Pipeline resolvers contain a superset of the functionality that unit resolvers support, and more, at the cost of a little more complexity.

### Anatomy of a pipeline resolver
<a name="anatomy-of-a-pipeline-resolver"></a>

A pipeline resolver is composed of a **Before** mapping template, an **After** mapping template, and a list of functions. Each function has a **request** and **response** mapping template that it executes against a data source. As a pipeline resolver delegates execution to a list of functions, it is therefore not linked to any data source. Unit resolvers and functions are primitives that execute operation against data sources. See the [Resolver mapping template overview](#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-overview) for more information.

#### Before mapping template
<a name="before-mapping-template"></a>

The request mapping template of a pipeline resolver, or the **Before** step, allows you to perform some preparation logic before executing the defined functions.

#### Functions list
<a name="functions-list"></a>

The list of functions a pipeline resolver will run in sequence. The pipeline resolver request mapping template evaluated result is made available to the first function as `$ctx.prev.result`. Each function output is available to the next function as `$ctx.prev.result`.

#### After mapping template
<a name="after-mapping-template"></a>

The response mapping template of a pipeline resolver, or the **After** step, allows you to perform some final mapping logic from the output of the last function to the expected GraphQL field type. The output of the last function in the functions list is available in the pipeline resolver mapping template as `$ctx.prev.result` or `$ctx.result`.

#### Execution flow
<a name="execution-flow"></a>

Given a pipeline resolver comprised of two functions, the list below represents the execution flow when the resolver is invoked:

![GraphQL request flow through BEFORE template, two functions with request and response templates accessing data sources, AFTER template, then GraphQL response.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/images/PipelineResolver.jpg)

1. Pipeline resolver **Before** mapping template

1. Function 1: Function request mapping template

1. Function 1: Data source invocation

1. Function 1: Function response mapping template

1. Function 2: Function request mapping template

1. Function 2: Data source invocation

1. Function 2: Function response mapping template

1. Pipeline resolver **After** mapping template

**Note**
Pipeline resolver execution flow is unidirectional and defined statically on the resolver.

#### Useful Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL) utilities
<a name="useful-apache-velocity-template-language-vtl-utilities"></a>

As the complexity of an application increases, VTL utilities and directives are here to facilitate development productivity. The following utilities can help you when you’re working with pipeline resolvers.

##### $ctx.stash
<a name="ctx-stash"></a>

The stash is a `Map` that is made available inside each resolver and function mapping template. The same stash instance lives through a single resolver execution. What this means is you can use the stash to pass arbitrary data across request and response mapping templates, and across functions in a pipeline resolver. The stash exposes the same methods as the [Java map](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) data structure.

##### $ctx.prev.result
<a name="ctx-prev-result"></a>

The `$ctx.prev.result` represents the result of the previous operation that was executed in the pipeline resolver.

If the previous operation was the pipeline resolver's Before mapping template, then `$ctx.prev.result` represents the output of the evaluation of the template and is made available to the first function in the pipeline. If the previous operation was the first function, then `$ctx.prev.result` represents the output of the first function and is made available to the second function in the pipeline. If the previous operation was the last function, then `$ctx.prev.result` represents the output of the last function and is made available to the pipeline resolver's After mapping template.

##### \#return(data: Object)
<a name="return-data-object"></a>

The `#return(data: Object)` directive comes handy if you need to return prematurely from any mapping template. `#return(data: Object)` is analogous to the *return* keyword in programming languages because it returns from the closest scoped block of logic. What this means is that using `#return` inside a resolver mapping template returns from the resolver. Using `#return(data: Object)` in a resolver mapping template sets `data` on the GraphQL field. Additionally, using `#return(data: Object)` from a function mapping template returns from the function and continues the execution to either the next function in the pipeline or the resolver response mapping template.

##### \#return
<a name="return"></a>

This is the same as `#return(data: Object)`, but `null` will be returned instead.

##### $util.error
<a name="util-error"></a>

The `$util.error` utility is useful to throw a field error. Using `$util.error` inside a function mapping template throws a field error immediately, which prevents subsequent functions from being executed. For more details and other `$util.error` signatures, visit the [Resolver mapping template utility reference](resolver-util-reference.md#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-util-reference).

##### $util.appendError
<a name="util-appenderror"></a>

The `$util.appendError` is similar to the `$util.error()`, with the major distinction that it doesn’t interrupt the evaluation of the mapping template. Instead, it signals there was an error with the field, but allows the template to be evaluated and consequently return data. Using `$util.appendError` inside a function will not disrupt the execution flow of the pipeline. For more details and other `$util.error` signatures, visit the [Resolver mapping template utility reference](resolver-util-reference.md#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-util-reference).

## Example template
<a name="example-template"></a>

Suppose you have a DynamoDB data source and a **Unit** resolver on a field named `getPost(id:ID!)` that returns a `Post` type with the following GraphQL query:

```
getPost(id:1){
    id
    title
    content
}
```

Your resolver template might look like the following:

```
{
    "version" : "2018-05-29",
    "operation" : "GetItem",
    "key" : {
        "id" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.args.id)
    }
}
```

This would substitute the `id` input parameter value of `1` for `${ctx.args.id}` and generate the following JSON:

```
{
    "version" : "2018-05-29",
    "operation" : "GetItem",
    "key" : {
        "id" : { "S" : "1" }
    }
}
```

AWS AppSync uses this template to generate instructions for communicating with DynamoDB and getting data (or performing other operations as appropriate). After the data returns, AWS AppSync runs it through an optional response mapping template, which you can use to perform data shaping or logic. For example, when we get the results back from DynamoDB, they might look like this:

```
{
        "id" : 1,
        "theTitle" : "AWS AppSync works offline!",
        "theContent-part1" : "It also has realtime functionality",
        "theContent-part2" : "using GraphQL"
}
```

You could choose to join two of the fields into a single field with the following response mapping template:

```
{
        "id" : $util.toJson($context.data.id),
        "title" : $util.toJson($context.data.theTitle),
        "content" : $util.toJson("${context.data.theContent-part1} ${context.data.theContent-part2}")
}
```

Here’s how the data is shaped after the template is applied to the data:

```
{
        "id" : 1,
        "title" : "AWS AppSync works offline!",
        "content" : "It also has realtime functionality using GraphQL"
}
```

This data is given back as the response to a client as follows:

```
{
        "data": {
                "getPost":      {
                        "id" : 1,
                        "title" : "AWS AppSync works offline!",
                        "content" : "It also has realtime functionality using GraphQL"
                }
        }
}
```

Note that under most circumstances, response mapping templates are a simple passthrough of data, differing mostly if you are returning an individual item or a list of items. For an individual item the passthrough is:

```
$util.toJson($context.result)
```

For lists the passthrough is usually:

```
$util.toJson($context.result.items)
```

## Evaluated mapping template deserialization rules
<a name="evaluated-mapping-template-deserialization-rules"></a>

Mapping templates evaluate to a string. In AWS AppSync, the output string must follow a JSON structure to be valid.

Additionally, the following deserialization rules are enforced.

### Duplicate keys are not allowed in JSON objects
<a name="duplicate-keys-are-not-allowed-in-json-objects"></a>

If the evaluated mapping template string represents a JSON object or contains an object that has duplicate keys, the mapping template returns the following error message:

 `Duplicate field 'aField' detected on Object. Duplicate JSON keys are not allowed.`

Example of a duplicate key in an evaluated request mapping template:

```
{
    "version": "2018-05-29",
    "operation": "Invoke",
    "payload": {
        "field": "getPost",
        "postId": "1",
        "field": "getPost" ## key 'field' has been redefined
    }
}
```

To fix this error, do not redefine keys in JSON objects.

### Trailing characters are not allowed in JSON objects
<a name="trailing-characters-are-not-allowed-in-json-objects"></a>

If the evaluated mapping template string represents a JSON object and contains trailing extraneous characters, the mapping template returns the following error message:

 `Trailing characters at the end of the JSON string are not allowed.`

Example of trailing characters in an evaluated request mapping template:

```
{
    "version": "2018-05-29",
    "operation": "Invoke",
    "payload": {
        "field": "getPost",
        "postId": "1",
    }
}extraneouschars
```

To fix this error, ensure that evaluated templates strictly evaluate to JSON.
