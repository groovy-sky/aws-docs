# Using CloudWatch to monitor and log GraphQL API data

You can log and debug your GraphQL API using CloudWatch metrics and CloudWatch logs. These
tools enable developers to monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize their
GraphQL operations effectively.

CloudWatch metrics is a tool that provides a wide range of metrics to monitor API
performance and usage. These metrics fall into two main categories:

1. **General API Metrics**: These include
    `4XXError` and `5XXError` for tracking client and server
    errors, `Latency` for measuring response times, `Requests` for
    monitoring total API calls, and `TokensConsumed` for tracking resource
    usage.

2. **Real-time Subscription Metrics**: These metrics focus
    on WebSocket connections and subscription activities. They include metrics for
    connection requests, successful connections, subscription registrations, message
    publishing, and active connections and subscriptions.

The guide also introduces Enhanced Metrics, which offer more granular data on resolver
performance, data source interactions, and individual GraphQL operations. These metrics
provide deeper insights but come with additional costs.

CloudWatch Logs is a tool that enables logging capabilities for your GraphQL APIs. Logs can
be set at two levels of the API:

1. **Request-level Logs**: These capture overall request
    information, including HTTP headers, GraphQL queries, operation summaries, and
    subscription registrations.

2. **Field-level Logs**: These provide detailed information
    about individual field resolutions, including request and response mappings, and tracing
    information for each field.

You can configure logging, interpret log entries, and use log data for troubleshooting and
optimization. AWS AppSync provides various log types that reveal your query’s execution,
parsing, validation, and field resolution data.

## Setup and configuration

To turn on automatic logging on a GraphQL API, use the AWS AppSync console.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AppSync\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync).

2. On the **APIs** page, choose the name of a GraphQL API.

3. On your API's homepage, in the navigation pane, choose
    **Settings**.

4. Under **Logging**, do the following:
1. Turn on **Enable Logs**.

2. For detailed request-level logging, select the check box under
       **Include verbose content**. (optional)

3. Under **Field resolver log level**, choose your preferred
       field-level logging level ( **None**,
       **Error**, **Info**, **Debug**, or **All**).
       (optional)

4. Under **Create or use an existing role**, choose
       **New role** to create a new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) that allows
       AWS AppSync to write logs to CloudWatch. Or, choose **Existing role**
       to select the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role in your
       AWS account.
5. Choose **Save**.

### Manual IAM role configuration

If you choose to use an existing IAM role, the role must grant AWS AppSync the
required permissions to write logs to CloudWatch. To configure this manually, you must provide
a service role ARN so that AWS AppSync can assume the role when writing the logs.

In the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), create a new policy
with the name `AWSAppSyncPushToCloudWatchLogsPolicy` that has the following
definition:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

Next, create a new role with the name **AWSAppSyncPushToCloudWatchLogsRole**, and attach the newly created policy
to the role. Edit the trust relationship for this role to the following:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "Service": "appsync.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

```

Copy the role ARN and use it when setting up logging for an AWS AppSync GraphQL
API.

## CloudWatch metrics

You can use CloudWatch metrics to monitor and provide alerts about specific events that can
result in HTTP status codes or from latency. The following metrics are emitted:

`4XXError`

Errors resulting from requests that are not valid due to an incorrect
client configuration. Typically, these errors happen anywhere outside of
GraphQL
processing.
For example, these errors can occur when the request includes an incorrect
JSON payload or an incorrect query, when the service is throttled, or when
the authorization settings are misconfigured.

**Unit**: _Count_. Use the
Sum statistic to get the total occurrences of these errors.

`5XXError`

Errors encountered during the
running
of a GraphQL query. For example, this can occur when invoking a query for an
empty or incorrect schema. It can also occur when the Amazon Cognito user pool ID
or AWS Region is not valid. Alternatively, this could also happen if
AWS AppSync encounters an issue during processing of a request.

**Unit**: _Count_. Use the
Sum statistic to get the total occurrences of these errors.

`Latency`

The time between when AWS AppSync receives a request from a client and when
it returns a response to the client. This doesn’t include the network
latency encountered for a response to reach the end devices.

**Unit**: _Millisecond_. Use
the Average statistic to evaluate expected latencies.

`Requests`

The number of requests (queries + mutations) that all APIs in your
account have processed, by Region.

**Unit**: _Count_. The
number of all requests processed in a particular Region.

`TokensConsumed`

Tokens are allocated to `Requests` based on the amount of
resources (processing time and memory used) that a `Request`
consumes. Usually, each `Request` consumes one token. However, a
`Request` that consumes large amounts of resources is
allocated additional tokens as needed.

**Unit**: _Count_. The
number of tokens allocated to requests processed in a particular
Region.

`NetworkBandwidthOutAllowanceExceeded`

###### Note

In the AWS AppSync console, on the cache settings page, the **Cache Health Metrics** option allows you to
enable this cache-related health metric.

The network packets dropped because the throughput exceeded the
aggregated bandwidth limit. This is useful for diagnosing bottlenecks in a
cache configuration. Data is recorded for a particular API by specifying the
`API_Id` in the
`appsyncCacheNetworkBandwidthOutAllowanceExceeded`
metric.

**Unit**: _Count_. The
number of packets dropped after exceeding the bandwidth limit for an API
specified by ID.

`EngineCPUUtilization`

###### Note

In the AWS AppSync console, on the cache settings page, the **Cache Health Metrics** option allows you to
enable this cache-related health metric.

The CPU utilization (percentage) allocated to the Redis OSS process. This
is useful for diagnosing bottlenecks in a cache configuration. Data is
recorded for a particular API by specifying the `API_Id` in the
`appsyncCacheEngineCPUUtilization` metric.

**Unit**: _Percent_. The CPU
percentage currently in use by the Redis OSS process for an API specified by
ID.

### Real-time subscriptions

All metrics are emitted in one dimension: **GraphQLAPIId**. This means that all metrics are coupled with GraphQL API
IDs. The following metrics are related to GraphQL subscriptions over pure
WebSockets:

`ConnectRequests`

The number of WebSocket connection requests made to AWS AppSync, including
both successful and unsuccessful attempts.

**Unit**: _Count_. Use the Sum statistic to get the total number of

because of client-side errors. This could imply that the service is
throttled or that the authorization settings are misconfigured.

**Unit**: _Count_. Use
the Sum statistic to get the total occurrences of the client-side
connection errors.

`ConnectServerError`

The number of errors that originated from AWS AppSync while processing
connections. This usually happens when an unexpected server-side issue
occurs.

`InvalidationRequestDropped`

The number of invalidation requests dropped when the invalidation
request quota was exceeded.

**Unit**: _Count_. Use the Sum statistic to get the total number of
dropped invalidation requests.

#### Comparing inbound and outbound messages

When a mutation is executed, subscription fields with the _@aws\_subscribe_ directive for that mutation are invoked. Each
subscription invocation generates one inbound message. For example, if two
subscription fields specify the same mutation in _@aws\_subscribe_, then two inbound messages are generated when that
mutation is called.

One outbound message equals 5 kB of data delivered to WebSocket clients. For
example, sending 15 kB of data to 10 clients results in 30 outbound messages (15 kB \*
10 clients / 5 kB per message = 30 messages).

You can request quota increases for either inbound or outbound messages. For more
information, see [AWS AppSync endpoints and\
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/appsync.html#limits_appsync) in the _AWS General Reference_
guide and the instructions for [Requesting a\
quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the _Service Quotas User_
_Guide_.

### Enhanced metrics

Enhanced metrics emit granular data on API usage and performance such as AWS AppSync
request and error counts, latency, and cache hits/misses. All enhanced metric data is
sent to your CloudWatch account, and you can configure the types of data that will be sent.

###### Note

Additional charges are applied when using enhanced metrics. For more information,
see **detailed monitoring** pricing tiers in [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

These metrics can be found on various settings pages in the AWS AppSync console. On the
API settings page, the **Enhanced Metrics** section allows
you to enable or disable the following items:

**Resolver metrics behavior**: These options control how
additional metrics for resolvers are collected. You can choose to enable full request
resolver metrics (metrics enabled for all resolvers in requests) or per-resolver metrics
(metrics only enabled for resolvers where the configuration is set to enabled). The
following options are available:

`GraphQL errors per resolver (GraphQLError)`

The number of GraphQL errors that occured per resolver.

**Metric dimension**:
`API_Id`, `Resolver`

**Unit**: _Count_.

`Requests per resolver (Request)`

The number of invocations that occurred during a request. This is
recorded on a per-resolver basis.

**Metric dimension**:
`API_Id`, `Resolver`

**Unit**: _Count_.

`Latency per resolver (Latency)`

The time to complete a resolver invocation. Latency is measured in
milliseconds and is recorded on a per-resolver basis.

**Metric dimension**:
`API_Id`, `Resolver`

**Unit**: _Millisecond_.

`Cache hits per resolver (CacheHit)`

The number of cache hits during a request. This will only be emitted
if a cache is used. Cache hits are recorded on a per-resolver
basis.

**Metric dimension**:
`API_Id`, `Resolver`

**Unit**: _Count_.

`Cache misses per resolver (CacheMiss)`

The number of cache misses during a request. This will only be emitted
if a cache is used. Cache misses are recorded on a per-resolver
basis.

**Metric dimension**:
`API_Id`, `Resolver`

**Unit**: _Count_.

**Data source metrics behavior**: These options control
how additional metrics for data sources are collected. You can choose to enable full
request data source metrics (metrics enabled for all data sources in requests) or
per-data source metrics (metrics only enabled for data sources where the configuration
is set to enabled). The following options are available:

`Requests per data source (Request)`

The number of invocations that occured during a request. Requests are
recorded on a per-data source basis. If full requests are enabled, each
data source will have its own entry in CloudWatch.

**Metric dimension**:
`API_Id`, `Datasource`

**Unit**: _Count_.

`Latency per data source (Latency)`

The time to complete a data source invocation. Latency is recorded on
a per-data source basis.

`GraphQL errors per operation (GraphQLError)`

The number of GraphQL errors that occurred during a specified GraphQL
operation.

**Metric dimension**:
`API_Id`, `Operation`

**Unit**: _Count_.

## CloudWatch logs

You can configure two types of logging on any new or existing GraphQL API: request-level
and field-level.

### Request-level logs

When request-level logging ( **Include verbose content**) is
configured, the following information is logged:

- The number of tokens consumed

- The request and response HTTP headers

- The GraphQL query that is running in the request

- The overall operation summary

- New and existing GraphQL subscriptions that are registered

### Field-level logs

When field-level logging is configured, the following information is logged:

- Generated request mapping with source and arguments for each field

- The transformed response mapping for each field, which includes the data as a
result of resolving that field

- Tracing information for each field

If you turn on logging, AWS AppSync manages the CloudWatch Logs. The process includes creating
log groups and log streams, and reporting to the log streams with these logs.

When you turn on logging on a GraphQL API and make requests, AWS AppSync creates a log
group and log streams under the log group. The log group is named following the
`/aws/appsync/apis/{graphql_api_id}` format. Within each log group, the
logs are further divided into log streams. These are ordered by **Last Event Time** as logged data is reported.

Every log event is tagged with the **x-amzn-RequestId**
of that request. This helps you filter log events in CloudWatch to get all logged information
about that request. You can get the RequestId from the response headers of every GraphQL
AWS AppSync request.

The field-Level logging is configured with the following log levels:

- **None** \- **No field-level**
**logs are captured.**

- ****Error** \- Logs the following information**
****only** for the fields that are in the**
**error category:**

- The error section in the server response

- Field-level errors

- The generated request/response functions that got resolved for
error fields

- ****Info** \- Logs the following information**
****only** for the fields that are in the info**
**and error categories:**

- Info-level messages

- The user messages sent through `$util.log.info` and
`console.log`

- Field-level tracing and mapping logs are not shown.

- If field-level logging is set to `INFO` or higher
with verbose-content included, AWS AppSync adds the transformed mapping
template logging messages. This will contain any information added
to the transformed mapping template, or the output of the resolver
or function executed JavaScript code, and should not be used if you
are planning to send sensitive information, such as passwords or
authorization headers, to downstream data sources and do not want
that information in your logs.

- ****Debug** \- Logs the following information**
****only** for the fields that are in the**
**debug, info, and error categories:**

- Debug-level messages

- The user messages sent through `$util.log.info`,
`$util.log.debug`, `console.log`, and
`console.debug`

- Field-level tracing and mapping logs are not shown.

- ****All** \- Logs the following information for**
****all** fields in the query:**

- Field-level tracing information

- The generated request/response functions that were resolved for
each field

### Benefits of monitoring

You can use logging and metrics to identify, troubleshoot, and optimize your GraphQL
queries. For example, these will help you debug latency issues using the tracing
information that is logged for each field in the query. To demonstrate this, suppose you
are using one or more resolvers nested in a GraphQL query. A sample field operation in
CloudWatch Logs might look similar to the following:

```nohighlight

{
    "path": [
        "singlePost",
        "authors",
        0,
        "name"
    ],
    "parentType": "Post",
    "returnType": "String!",
    "fieldName": "name",
    "startOffset": 416563350,
    "duration": 11247
}
```

This might correspond to a GraphQL schema, similar to the following:

```nohighlight

type Post {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  authors: [Author]
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Query {
  singlePost(id:ID!): Post
}
```

In the preceding log results, **path** shows a single
item in your data returned from running a query named `singlePost()`. In this
example, it’s representing the **name** field at the first
index (0). The **startOffset** gives an offset from the
start of the GraphQL query operation. The **duration** is
the total time to resolve the field. These values can be useful to troubleshoot why data
from a particular data source might be running slower than expected, or if a specific
field is slowing down the entire query. For example, you might choose to increase
provisioned throughput for an Amazon DynamoDB table, or remove a specific field from a query
that is causing the overall operation to perform poorly.

As of May 8, 2019, AWS AppSync generates log events as fully structured JSON. This can
help you use log analytics services such as CloudWatch Logs Insights and Amazon OpenSearch Service to understand
the performance of your GraphQL requests and usage characteristics of your schema
fields. For example, you can easily identify resolvers with large latencies that may be
the root cause of a performance issue. You can also identify the most and least
frequently used fields in your schema and assess the impact of deprecating GraphQL
fields.

### Conflict detection and sync logging

If an AWS AppSync API has logging to CloudWatch Logs configured with the **Field resolver**
**log level** set to **All**, then AWS AppSync emits conflict
detection and resolution information to the log group. This provides granular insight
into how the AWS AppSync API responded to a conflict. To help you interpret the response,
the following information is provided in the logs:

`conflictType`

Details whether a conflict occurred due to a version mismatch or the
customer-supplied condition.

`conflictHandlerConfigured`

States the conflict handler configured on the resolver at the time of
the request.

`message`

Provides information on how the conflict was detected and
resolved.

`syncAttempt`

The number of tries the server attempted in order to synchronize the
data before ultimately rejecting the request.

`data`

If the conflict handler configured is `Automerge`, this
field is populated to show what decision `Automerge` took for
each field. Actions provided can be:

- **REJECTED** \- When
`Automerge` rejects the incoming field value in favor
of the value in the server.

- **ADDED** \- When
`Automerge` adds on the incoming field due to no
pre-existing value in the server.

- **APPENDED** \- When
`Automerge` appends the incoming values to the values
for the List that exists in the server.

- **MERGED** \- When
`Automerge` merges the incoming values to the values
for the Set that exists in the server.

### Using token counts to optimize your requests

Requests that consume less than or equal to 1,500 KB-seconds of memory and vCPU time
are allocated one token. Requests with resource consumption greater than 1,500
KB-seconds receive additional tokens. For example, if a request consumes 3,350
KB-seconds, AWS AppSync allocates three tokens (rounded up to the next integer value) to
the request. By default, AWS AppSync allocates a maximum of 5,000 or 10,000 request tokens
per second to the APIs in your account, depending upon the AWS Region in which it's
deployed. If your APIs each use an average of two tokens per second, you'll be limited
to 2,500 or 5,000 requests per second, respectively. If you need more tokens per second
than the allotted amount, you can submit a request to increase the default quota for the
rate of request tokens. For more information, see [AWS AppSync endpoints and\
quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/appsync.html#limits_appsync) in the _AWS General Reference guide_ and [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the
_Service Quotas User Guide_.

A high per-request token count could indicate that there's an opportunity to optimize
your requests and improve the performance of your API. Factors that can increase your
per-request token count include:

- The size and complexity of your GraphQL schema.

- The complexity of request and response mapping templates.

- The number of resolver invocations per request.

- The amount of data returned from resolvers.

- The latency of downstream data sources.

- Schema and query designs that require successive data source calls (as opposed
to parallel or batched calls).

- Logging configuration, particularly field-level and verbose log
content.

###### Note

In addition to AWS AppSync metrics and logs, clients can access the number of tokens
consumed in a request via the response header
`x-amzn-appsync-TokensConsumed`.

### Log size limits

By default, if logging has been enabled, AWS AppSync will send up to 1 MB of logs per
request. Logs exceeding this size will be truncated. To reduce log sizes, choose the
`ERROR` logging level for field-level logs and disable
`VERBOSE` logging, or disable field-level logs entirely if not needed. As
an alternative to the `ALL` log level, you can use Enhanced Metrics to obtain
metrics on specific resolvers, data sources, or GraphQL operations, or utilize the
logging utilities provided by AppSync to log only the necessary information.

### Tracing

- **requestId:** Unique identifier for the
request.

- **graphQLAPIId:** ID of the GraphQL API making the
request.

- **startOffset:** The start offset for field
resolution, in nanoseconds, relative to the invocation, as an integer.

- **duration:** The time spent resolving the field, in
nanoseconds, as an integer.

- **fieldName:** The name of the field being
resolved.

- **parentType:** The parent type of the field being
resolved.

- **returnType:** The return type of the field being
resolved.

- **path:** A list of path segments, starting at the
root of the response and ending with the field being resolved.

- **resolverArn:** The ARN of the resolver used for
field resolution. Might not be present on nested fields.

## Analyzing your logs with CloudWatch Logs Insights

The following are examples of queries you can run to get actionable insights into the
performance and health of your GraphQL operations. These examples are available as sample
queries in the CloudWatch Logs Insights console. In the [CloudWatch\
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch), choose **Logs Insights**, select the AWS AppSync log
group for your GraphQL API, and then choose **AWS AppSync queries** under
**Sample queries**.

The following query returns the top 10 GraphQL requests with maximum tokens
consumed:

```default

filter @message like "Tokens Consumed"
| parse @message "* Tokens Consumed: *" as requestId, tokens
| sort tokens desc
| display requestId, tokens
| limit 10
```

The following query returns the top 10 resolvers with maximum latency:

```default

  fields resolverArn, duration
| filter logType = "Tracing"
| limit 10
| sort duration desc
```

The following query returns the most frequently invoked resolvers:

```default

  fields ispresent(resolverArn) as isRes
| stats count() as invocationCount by resolverArn
| filter isRes and logType = "Tracing"
| limit 10
| sort invocationCount desc
```

The following query returns resolvers with the most errors in mapping templates:

```default

  fields ispresent(resolverArn) as isRes
| stats count() as errorCount by resolverArn, logType
| filter isRes and (logType = "RequestMapping" or logType = "ResponseMapping") and fieldInError
| limit 10
| sort errorCount desc
```

The following query returns resolver latency statistics:

```default

  fields ispresent(resolverArn) as isRes
| stats min(duration), max(duration), avg(duration) as avg_dur by resolverArn
| filter isRes and logType = "Tracing"
| limit 10
| sort avg_dur desc
```

The following query returns field latency statistics:

```default

  stats min(duration), max(duration), avg(duration) as avg_dur
  by concat(parentType, '/', fieldName) as fieldKey
| filter logType = "Tracing"
| limit 10
| sort avg_dur desc
```

The results of CloudWatch Logs Insights queries can be exported to CloudWatch dashboards.

## Analyze your logs with OpenSearch Service

You can search, analyze, and visualize your AWS AppSync logs with Amazon OpenSearch Service to identify
performance bottlenecks and root causes of operational issues. You can identify resolvers
with the maximum latency and errors. In addition, you can use OpenSearch Dashboards to
create dashboards with powerful visualizations. OpenSearch Dashboards is an open source data
visualization and exploration tool available in OpenSearch Service. Using OpenSearch Dashboards, you can
continuously monitor the performance and health of your GraphQL operations. For example,
you can create dashboards to visualize the P90 latency of your GraphQL requests and drill
down into the P90 latencies of each resolver.

When using OpenSearch Service, use **“cwl\*”** as the filter pattern to
search OpenSearch indexes. OpenSearch Service indexes the logs streamed from CloudWatch Logs with a prefix of
**“cwl-”**. To differentiate AWS AppSync API logs from other
CloudWatch logs sent to OpenSearch Service, we recommend adding an additional filter expression of
`graphQLAPIID.keyword=YourGraphQLAPIID` to your
search.

## Log format migration

Log events that AWS AppSync generates are primarily formatted as fully structured JSON.
However, certain diagnostic and intermediate processing messages may be emitted in an
unstructured format. If you need to migrate unstructured logs to fully structured JSON,
you may use a script available in the [GitHub Sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-appsync-cwl-migrator).

You can also use [metric filters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogsConcepts.html) in
CloudWatch to turn log data into numerical CloudWatch metrics, so that you can graph or set an alarm on
them.
