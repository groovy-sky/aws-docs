# Math helpers in $util.math

###### Note

We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please
consider using the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](resolver-reference-js-version.md).

`$util.math` contains methods to help with common Math operations.

## $util.math utils list

**`$util.math.roundNum(Double) : Integer`**

Takes a double and rounds it to the nearest integer.

**`$util.math.minVal(Double, Double) : Double`**

Takes two doubles and returns the minimum value between the two
doubles.

**`$util.math.maxVal(Double, Double) : Double`**

Takes two doubles and returns the maximum value between the two
doubles.

**`$util.math.randomDouble() : Double`**

Returns a random double between 0 and 1.

###### Important

This function shouldn't be used for anything that needs high entropy
randomness (for example, cryptography).

**`$util.math.randomWithinRange(Integer, Integer) : Integer`**

Returns a random integer value within the specified range, with the first
argument specifying the lower value of the range and the second argument
specifying the upper value of the range.

###### Important

This function shouldn't be used for anything that needs high entropy
randomness (for example, cryptography).
