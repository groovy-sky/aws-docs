# Identity-based policies for AWS AppSync
<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples"></a>

By default, users and roles don't have permission to create or modify AWS AppSync resources. To grant users permission to perform actions on the resources that they need, an IAM administrator can create IAM policies.

To learn how to create an IAM identity-based policy by using these example JSON policy documents, see [Create IAM policies (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

For details about actions and resource types defined by AWS AppSync, including the format of the ARNs for each of the resource types, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for AWS AppSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsappsync.html) in the *Service Authorization Reference*.

To learn the best practices for creating and configuring IAM identity-based policies, see [IAM policy best practices](best-practices.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-policy-best-practices).

For a list of IAM identity-based policies for AWS AppSync, see [AWS managed policies for AWS AppSync](security_iam_policy_list.md).

## Using the AWS AppSync console
<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-console"></a>

To access the AWS AppSync console, you must have a minimum set of permissions. These permissions must allow you to list and view details about the AWS AppSync resources in your AWS account. If you create an identity-based policy that is more restrictive than the minimum required permissions, the console won't function as intended for entities (users or roles) with that policy.

You don't need to allow minimum console permissions for users that are making calls only to the AWS CLI or the AWS API. Instead, allow access to only the actions that match the API operation that they're trying to perform.

To ensure that IAM users and roles can still use the AWS AppSync console, also attach the AWS AppSync `ConsoleAccess` or `ReadOnly` AWS managed policy to the entities. For more information, see [Adding permissions to a user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Allow users to view their own permissions
<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-view-own-permissions"></a>

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and managed policies that are attached to their user identity. This policy includes permissions to complete this action on the console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or AWS API.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ViewOwnUserInfo",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetUserPolicy",
                "iam:ListGroupsForUser",
                "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies",
                "iam:ListUserPolicies",
                "iam:GetUser"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "NavigateInConsole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetGroupPolicy",
                "iam:GetPolicyVersion",
                "iam:GetPolicy",
                "iam:ListAttachedGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListPolicyVersions",
                "iam:ListPolicies",
                "iam:ListUsers"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Accessing one Amazon S3 bucket
<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-access-one-bucket"></a>

In this example, you want to grant an IAM user in your AWS account access to one of your Amazon S3 buckets, `examplebucket`. You also want to allow the user to add, update, and delete objects.

In addition to granting the `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject` permissions to the user, the policy also grants the `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`, `s3:GetBucketLocation`, and `s3:ListBucket` permissions. These are the additional permissions required by the console. Also, the `s3:PutObjectAcl` and the `s3:GetObjectAcl` actions are required to be able to copy, cut, and paste objects in the console. For an example walkthrough that grants permissions to users and tests them using the console, see [An example walkthrough: Using user policies to control access to your bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/walkthrough1.html).

## Viewing AWS AppSync {{widgets}} based on tags
<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-view-widget-tags"></a>

You can use conditions in your identity-based policy to control access to AWS AppSync resources based on tags. This example shows how you might create a policy that allows viewing a {{widget}}. However, permission is granted only if the {{widget}} tag `Owner` has the value of that user's user name. This policy also grants the permissions necessary to complete this action on the console.

You can attach this policy to the IAM users in your account. If a user named `richard-roe` attempts to view an AWS AppSync {{widget}}, the {{widget}} must be tagged `Owner=richard-roe` or `owner=richard-roe`. Otherwise he is denied access. The condition tag key `Owner` matches both `Owner` and `owner` because condition key names are not case-sensitive. For more information, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
