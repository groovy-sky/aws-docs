# What is AWS AppSync?

AWS AppSync enables developers to connect their applications and services to data and
events with secure, serverless and high-performing GraphQL and Pub/Sub APIs. You can do the
following with AWS AppSync:

- Access data from one or more data sources from a single GraphQL API endpoint.

- Combine multiple source GraphQL APIs into a single, merged GraphQL API.

- Publish real-time data updates to your applications.

- Leverage built-in security, monitoring, logging, and tracing, with optional caching for
low latency.

- Only pay for API requests and any real-time messages that are delivered.

###### Important

As of Mar 13, 2025, you can build a real-time PubSub API powered by WebSockets using
AWS AppSync Events. For more information, see [Publish events via WebSocket](../eventapi/publish-websocket.md) in the _AWS AppSync Events_
_Developer Guide_.

## Are you a first-time AWS AppSync user?

We recommend that first-time AWS AppSync users begin by reading the following sections:

- If you're unfamiliar with GraphQL, see the [Getting started: Creating your first GraphQL API in AWS AppSync](quickstart.md).

- If you're building applications that consume GraphQL APIs, see [Building a client application using Amplify client](building-a-client-app.md) and [Using subscriptions for real-time data applications in AWS AppSync](aws-appsync-real-time-data.md).

- If you're looking for GraphQL resolver information, see the following:
