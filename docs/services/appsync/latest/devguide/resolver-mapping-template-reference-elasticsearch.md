# AWS AppSync resolver mapping template reference for OpenSearch

###### Note

We now primarily support the APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its documentation. Please consider using the
APPSYNC\_JS runtime and its guides [here](resolver-reference-js-version.md).

The AWS AppSync resolver for Amazon OpenSearch Service enables you to use GraphQL to store and retrieve data in existing OpenSearch Service
domains in your account. This resolver works by allowing you to map an incoming GraphQL request into an OpenSearch Service
request, then map the OpenSearch Service response back to GraphQL. This section describes the mapping templates for the
supported OpenSearch Service operations.

## Request mapping template

Most OpenSearch Service request mapping templates have a common structure where just a few pieces change. The following
example runs a search against an OpenSearch Service domain, where documents are organized under an index called
`post`. The search parameters are defined in the `body` section, with many of the
common query clauses being defined in the `query` field. This example will search for documents
containing `"Nadia"`, or `"Bailey"`, or both, in the `author` field of a
document:

```sh

{
    "version":"2017-02-28",
    "operation":"GET",
    "path":"/post/_search",
    "params":{
        "headers":{},
        "queryString":{},
        "body":{
            "from":0,
            "size":50,
            "query" : {
                "bool" : {
                    "should" : [
                        {"match" : { "author" : "Nadia" }},
                        {"match" : { "author" : "Bailey" }}
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Response mapping template

As with other data sources, OpenSearch Service sends a response to AWS AppSync that needs to be
converted to GraphQL. .

Most GraphQL queries are looking for the `_source` field from an OpenSearch Service
response. Because you can do searches to return either an individual document or a list
of documents, there are two common response mapping templates used in OpenSearch Service:

**List of Results**

```sh

[
    #foreach($entry in $context.result.hits.hits)
      #if( $velocityCount > 1 ) , #end
        $utils.toJson($entry.get("_source"))
    #end
]
```

**Individual Item**

```sh

$utils.toJson($context.result.get("_source"))
```

## `operation` field

###### Note

This applies only to the Request mapping template.

HTTP method or verb (GET, POST, PUT, HEAD or DELETE) that AWS AppSync sends to the OpenSearch Service
domain. Both the key and the value must be a string.

```sh

"operation" : "PUT"
```

## `path` field

###### Note

This applies only to the Request mapping template.

The search path for an OpenSearch Service request from AWS AppSync. This forms a URL for the
operation’s HTTP verb. Both the key and the value must be strings.

```sh

"path" : "/<indexname>/_doc/<_id>"
"path" : "/<indexname>/_doc"
"path" : "/<indexname>/_search"
"path" : "/<indexname>/_update/<_id>
```

When the mapping template is evaluated, this path is sent as part of the HTTP request,
including the OpenSearch Service domain. For example, the previous example might translate to:

```sh

GET https://opensearch-domain-name.REGION.es.amazonaws.com/indexname/type/_search
```

## `params` field

###### Note

This applies only to the Request mapping template.

Used to specify what action your search performs, most commonly by setting the
**query** value inside of the **body**. However, there are several other capabilities that can be
configured, such as the formatting of responses.

- **headers**

The header information, as key-value pairs. Both the key and the value must be
strings. For example:

```sh

"headers" : {
      "Content-Type" : "application/json"
}
```

###### Note

AWS AppSync currently supports only JSON as a `Content-Type`.

- **queryString**

Key-value pairs that specify common options, such as code formatting for JSON
responses. Both the key and the value must be a string. For example, if you want
to get pretty-formatted JSON, you would use:

```sh

"queryString" : {
      "pretty" : "true"
}
```

- **body**

This is the main part of your request, allowing AWS AppSync to craft a
well-formed search request to your OpenSearch Service domain. The key must be a string
comprised of an object. A couple of demonstrations are shown below.

**Example 1**

Return all documents with a city matching “seattle”:

```sh

"body":{
    "from":0,
    "size":50,
    "query" : {
        "match" : {
            "city" : "seattle"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 2**

Return all documents matching “washington” as the city or the state:

```sh

"body":{
    "from":0,
    "size":50,
    "query" : {
        "multi_match" : {
            "query" : "washington",
            "fields" : ["city", "state"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Passing variables

###### Note

This applies only to the Request mapping template.

You can also pass variables as part of evaluation in the VTL statement. For example,
suppose you had a GraphQL query such as the following:

```sh

query {
    searchForState(state: "washington"){
        ...
    }
}
```

The mapping template could take the state as an argument:

```sh

"body":{
    "from":0,
    "size":50,
    "query" : {
        "multi_match" : {
            "query" : "$context.arguments.state",
            "fields" : ["city", "state"]
        }
    }
}
```

For a list of utilities you can include in the VTL, see [Access Request\
Headers](resolver-context-reference.md#aws-appsync-resolver-context-reference-util).
