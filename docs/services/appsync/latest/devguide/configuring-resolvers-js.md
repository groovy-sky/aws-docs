# Creating basic queries (JavaScript)

GraphQL resolvers connect the fields in a type’s schema to a data source. Resolvers are the mechanism by which
requests are fulfilled.

Resolvers in AWS AppSync use JavaScript to convert a GraphQL expression into a format the data source can
use. Alternatively, mapping templates can be written in [Apache Velocity Template Language\
(VTL)](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/2.0/vtl-reference.html) to convert a GraphQL expression into a format the data source can use.

This section describes how to configure resolvers using JavaScript. The [Resolver tutorials (JavaScript)](tutorials-js.md) section provides
in-depth tutorials on how to implement resolvers using JavaScript. The [Resolver reference (JavaScript)](resolver-reference-js-version.md)
section provides an explanation of utility operations that can be used with JavaScript resolvers.

We recommend following this guide before attempting to use any of the aforementioned tutorials.

In this section, we will walk through how to create and configure resolvers for queries and mutations.

###### Note

This guide assumes you have created your schema and have at least one query or mutation. If you're looking
for subscriptions (real-time data), then see [this](aws-appsync-real-time-data.md) guide.

In this section, we'll provide some general steps for configuring resolvers along with an example that uses
the schema below:

```

// schema.graphql file

input CreatePostInput {
  title: String
  date: AWSDateTime
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  date: AWSDateTime
}

type Mutation {
  createPost(input: CreatePostInput!): Post
}

type Query {
  getPost: [Post]
}
```

## Creating basic query resolvers

This section will show you how to make a basic query resolver.

Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AppSync\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync).
1. In the **APIs dashboard**, choose your GraphQL
       API.

2. In the **Sidebar**, choose **Schema**.
2. Enter the details of your schema and data source. See the [Designing your\
    schema](designing-your-schema.md) and [Attaching a data\
    source](attaching-a-data-source.md) sections for more information.

3. Next to the **Schema** editor, There's a window called
    **Resolvers**. This box contains a list of the types
    and fields as defined in your **Schema** window. You can
    attach resolvers to fields. You will most likely be attaching resolvers to your field
    operations. In this section, we'll look at simple query configurations. Under the
    **Query** type, choose **Attach** next to your query's field.

4. On the **Attach resolver** page, under **Resolver type**, you can choose between pipeline or unit
    resolvers. For more information about these types, see [Resolvers](resolver-components.md). This guide
    will make use of `pipeline resolvers`.

###### Tip

When creating pipeline resolvers, your data source(s) will be attached to the
pipeline function(s). Functions are created after you create the pipeline resolver
itself, which is why there's no option to set it in this page. If you're using a
unit resolver, the data source is tied directly to the resolver, so you would set it
in this page.

For **Resolver runtime**, choose `APPSYNC_JS`
    to enable the JavaScript runtime.

5. You can enable [caching](enabling-caching.md) for this API. We recommend turning this feature off for now.
    Choose **Create**.

6. On the **Edit resolver** page, there's a code editor
    called **Resolver code** that allows you to implement the
    logic for the resolver handler and response (before and after steps). For more
    information, see the [JavaScript\
    resolvers overview](resolver-reference-overview-js.md).

###### Note

In our example, we're just going to leave the request blank and the response set
to return the last data source result from the [context](resolver-context-reference-js.md):

```

import {util} from '@aws-appsync/utils';

export function request(ctx) {
       return {};
}

export function response(ctx) {
       return ctx.prev.result;
}
```

Below this section, there's a table called **Functions**.
    Functions allow you to implement code that can be reused across multiple resolvers.
    Instead of constantly rewriting or copying code, you can store the source code as a
    function to be added to a resolver whenever you need it.

Functions make up the bulk of a pipeline's operation list. When using multiple
    functions in a resolver, you set the order of the functions, and they will be run in
    that order sequentially. They are executed after the request function runs and before
    the response function begins.

To add a new function, under **Functions**, choose
    **Add function**, then **Create new**
**function**. Alternatively, you may see a **Create**
**function** button to choose instead.
1. Choose a data source. This will be the data source on which the resolver
       acts.

      ###### Note

      In our example, we're attaching a resolver for `getPost`, which
      retrieves a `Post` object by `id`. Let's assume we
      already set up a DynamoDB table for this schema. Its partition key is set to
      the `id` and is empty.

2. Enter a `Function name`.

3. Under **Function code**, you'll need to implement
       the function's behavior. This might be confusing, but each function will have
       its own local request and response handler. The request runs, then the data
       source invocation is made to handle the request, then the data source response
       is processed by the response handler. The result is stored in the [context](resolver-context-reference-js.md) object. Afterward, the next function in the list will run
       or will be passed to the after step response handler if it's the last one.

      ###### Note

      In our example, we're attaching a resolver to `getPost`, which
      gets a list of `Post` objects from the data source. Our request
      function will request the data from our table, the table will pass its
      response to the context (ctx), then the response will return the result in
      the context. AWS AppSync's strength lies in its interconnectedness with other
      AWS services. Because we're using DynamoDB, we have a [suite\
      of operations](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md) to simplify things like this. We have some
      boilerplate examples for other data source types as well.

      Our code will look like this:

      ```

      import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils';

      /**
       * Performs a scan on the dynamodb data source
       */
      export function request(ctx) {
        return { operation: 'Scan' };
      }

      /**
       * return a list of scanned post items
       */
      export function response(ctx) {
        return ctx.result.items;
      }
      ```

      In this step, we added two functions:

- `request`: The request handler performs the retrieval
operation against the data source. The argument contains the context
object ( `ctx`), or some data that is available to all
resolvers performing a particular operation. For example, it might
contain authorization data, the field names being resolved, etc. The
return statement performs a [`Scan`](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md#js-aws-appsync-resolver-reference-dynamodb-scan) operation (see [here](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/scan.md) for examples). Because we're working with DynamoDB,
we're allowed to use some of the operations from that service. The
scan performs a basic fetch of all items in our table. The result of
this operation is stored in the context object as a
`result` container before being passed to the
response handler. The `request` is run before the
response in the pipeline.

- `response`: The response handler that returns the
output of the `request`. The argument is the updated
context object, and the return statement is
`ctx.prev.result`. At this point in the guide, you
may not be familiar with this value. `ctx` refers to the
context object. `prev` refers to the previous operation
in the pipeline, which was our `request`. The
`result` contains the result(s) of the resolver as it
moves through the pipeline. If you put it all together,
`ctx.prev.result` is returning the result of the last
operation performed, which was the request handler.

4. Choose **Create** after you're
       done.
7. Back on the resolver screen, under **Functions**, choose
    the **Add function** drop-down and add your function to
    your functions list.

8. Choose **Save** to update the resolver.

CLI

**To add your function**

- Create a function for your pipeline resolver using the `create-function` command.

You'll need to enter a few parameters for this particular command:

1. The `api-id` of your API.

2. The `name` of the function in the AWS AppSync console.

3. The `data-source-name`, or the name of the data source the function
    will use. It must already be created and linked to your GraphQL API in the
    AWS AppSync service.

4. The `runtime`, or environment and language of the function. For
    JavaScript, the name must be `APPSYNC_JS`, and the runtime,
    `1.0.0`.

5. The `code`, or request and response handlers of your function.
    While you can type it in manually, it's far easier to add it to a .txt file (or
    a similar format) and then pass it in as the argument.

###### Note

Our query code will be in a file passed in as the argument:

```

import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils';

/**
    * Performs a scan on the dynamodb data source
    */
export function request(ctx) {
     return { operation: 'Scan' };
}

/**
    * return a list of scanned post items
    */
export function response(ctx) {
     return ctx.result.items;
}
```

An example command may look like this:

```

aws appsync create-function \
--api-id abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \
--name get_posts_func_1 \
--data-source-name table-for-posts \
--runtime name=APPSYNC_JS,runtimeVersion=1.0.0 \
--code file://~/path/to/file/{filename}.{fileType}
```

An output will be returned in the CLI. Here's an example:

```nohighlight

{
    "functionConfiguration": {
        "functionId": "ejglgvmcabdn7lx75ref4qeig4",
        "functionArn": "arn:aws:appsync:us-west-2:107289374856:apis/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/functions/ejglgvmcabdn7lx75ref4qeig4",
        "name": "get_posts_func_1",
        "dataSourceName": "table-for-posts",
        "maxBatchSize": 0,
        "runtime": {
            "name": "APPSYNC_JS",
            "runtimeVersion": "1.0.0"
        },
        "code": "Code output goes here"
    }
}
```

###### Note

Make sure you record the `functionId` somewhere as this will be used to
attach the function to the resolver.

**To create your resolver**

- Create a pipeline function for `Query` by running the `create-resolver` command.

You'll need to enter a few parameters for this particular command:

1. The `api-id` of your API.

2. The `type-name`, or the special object type in your schema (Query,
    Mutation, Subscription).

3. The `field-name`, or the field operation inside the special object
    type you want to attach the resolver to.

4. The `kind`, which specifies a unit or pipeline resolver. Set this
    to `PIPELINE` to enable pipeline functions.

5. The `pipeline-config`, or the function(s) to attach to the
    resolver. Make sure you know the `functionId` values of your
    functions. Order of listing matters.

6. The `runtime`, which was `APPSYNC_JS` (JavaScript). The
    `runtimeVersion` currently is `1.0.0`.

7. The `code`, which contains the before and after step
    handlers.

###### Note

Our query code will be in a file passed in as the argument:

```

import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils';

/**
    * Sends a request to `put` an item in the DynamoDB data source
    */
export function request(ctx) {
     const { id, ...values } = ctx.args;
     return {
       operation: 'PutItem',
       key: util.dynamodb.toMapValues({ id }),
       attributeValues: util.dynamodb.toMapValues(values),
     };
}

/**
    * returns the result of the `put` operation
    */
export function response(ctx) {
     return ctx.result;
}
```

An example command may look like this:

```

aws appsync create-resolver \
--api-id abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \
--type-name Query \
--field-name getPost \
--kind PIPELINE \
--pipeline-config functions=ejglgvmcabdn7lx75ref4qeig4 \
--runtime name=APPSYNC_JS,runtimeVersion=1.0.0 \
--code file:///path/to/file/{filename}.{fileType}
```

An output will be returned in the CLI. Here's an example:

```nohighlight

{
    "resolver": {
        "typeName": "Mutation",
        "fieldName": "getPost",
        "resolverArn": "arn:aws:appsync:us-west-2:107289374856:apis/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/types/Mutation/resolvers/getPost",
        "kind": "PIPELINE",
        "pipelineConfig": {
            "functions": [
                "ejglgvmcabdn7lx75ref4qeig4"
            ]
        },
        "maxBatchSize": 0,
        "runtime": {
            "name": "APPSYNC_JS",
            "runtimeVersion": "1.0.0"
        },
        "code": "Code output goes here"
    }
}
```

CDK

###### Tip

Before you use the CDK, we recommend reviewing the CDK's [official documentation](../../../cdk/v2/guide/home.md)
along with AWS AppSync's [CDK reference](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-readme.md).

The steps listed below will only show a general example of the snippet used to add a
particular resource. This is **not** meant to be a working
solution in your production code. We also assume you already have a working app.

A basic app will need the following things:

1. Service import directives

2. Schema code

3. Data source generator

4. Function code

5. Resolver code

From the [Designing your schema](designing-your-schema.md) and [Attaching a data source](attaching-a-data-source.md)
sections, we know that the stack file will include the import directives of the form:

```nohighlight

import * as x from 'x'; # import wildcard as the 'x' keyword from 'x-service'
import {a, b, ...} from 'c'; # import {specific constructs} from 'c-service'
```

###### Note

In previous sections, we only stated how to import AWS AppSync constructs. In real code, you'll
have to import more services just to run the app. In our example, if we were to create a
very simple CDK app, we would at least import the AWS AppSync service along with our data source,
which was a DynamoDB table. We would also need to import some additional constructs to deploy
the app:

```

import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as appsync from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-appsync';
import * as dynamodb from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
```

To summarize each of these:

- `import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';`: This allows you to define your
CDK app and constructs such as the stack. It also contains some useful utility
functions for our application like manipulating metadata. If you're familiar with
this import directive, but are wondering why the cdk core library is not being used
here, see the [Migration](../../../cdk/v2/guide/migrating-v2.md) page.

- `import * as appsync from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-appsync';`: This imports the
[AWS AppSync service](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-readme.md).

- `import * as dynamodb from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb';`: This imports
the [DynamoDB service](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-dynamodb-readme.md).

- `import { Construct } from 'constructs';`: We need this to define the
root [construct](../../../cdk/v2/guide/constructs.md).

The type of import depends on the services you're calling. We recommend looking at the CDK
documentation for examples. The schema at the top of the page will be a separate file in your
CDK app as a `.graphql` file. In the stack file, we can associate it with a new
GraphQL using the form:

```

const add_api = new appsync.GraphqlApi(this, 'graphQL-example', {
  name: 'my-first-api',
  schema: appsync.SchemaFile.fromAsset(path.join(__dirname, 'schema.graphql')),
});
```

###### Note

In the scope `add_api`, we're adding a new GraphQL API using the
`new` keyword followed by `appsync.GraphqlApi(scope: Construct, id:
                                string , props: GraphqlApiProps)`. Our scope is `this`, the CFN id is
`graphQL-example`, and our props are `my-first-api` (name of the
API in the console) and `schema.graphql` (the absolute path to the schema
file).

To add a data source, you'll first have to add your data source to the stack. Then, you need
to associate it with the GraphQL API using the source-specific method. The association will happen
when you make your resolver function. In the meantime, let's use an example by creating the
DynamoDB table using `dynamodb.Table`:

```

const add_ddb_table = new dynamodb.Table(this, 'posts-table', {
  partitionKey: {
    name: 'id',
    type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING,
  },
});
```

###### Note

If we were to use this in our example, we'd be adding a new DynamoDB table with the CFN id of
`posts-table` and a partition key of `id (S)`.

Next, we need to implement our resolver in the stack file. Here's an example of a simple query
that scans for all items in a DynamoDB table:

```

const add_func = new appsync.AppsyncFunction(this, 'func-get-posts', {
  name: 'get_posts_func_1',
  add_api,
  dataSource: add_api.addDynamoDbDataSource('table-for-posts', add_ddb_table),
  code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
      export function request(ctx) {
        return { operation: 'Scan' };
      }

      export function response(ctx) {
        return ctx.result.items;
      }
  `),
  runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
});

new appsync.Resolver(this, 'pipeline-resolver-get-posts', {
  add_api,
  typeName: 'Query',
  fieldName: 'getPost',
  code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
      export function request(ctx) {
        return {};
      }

      export function response(ctx) {
        return ctx.prev.result;
      }
 `),
  runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
  pipelineConfig: [add_func],
});
```

###### Note

First, we created a function called `add_func`. This order of creation may seem
a bit counterintuitive, but you have to create the functions in your pipeline resolver
before you make the resolver itself. A function follows the form:

```

AppsyncFunction(scope: Construct, id: string, props: AppsyncFunctionProps)
```

Our scope was `this`, our CFN id was `func-get-posts`, and our props
contained the actual function details. Inside props, we included:

- The `name` of the function that will be present in the AWS AppSync console
( `get_posts_func_1`).

- The GraphQL API we created earlier ( `add_api`).

- The data source; this is the point where we link the data source to the GraphQL
API value, then attach it to the function. We take the table we created
( `add_ddb_table`) and attach it to the GraphQL API
( `add_api`) using one of the `GraphqlApi` methods ( [`addDynamoDbDataSource`](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-graphqlapi.md#addwbrdynamowbrdbwbrdatawbrsourceid-table-options)). The id value
( `table-for-posts`) is the name of the data source in the AWS AppSync
console. For a list of source-specific methods, see the following pages:

- [DynamoDbDataSource](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-dynamodbdatasource.md)

- [EventBridgeDataSource](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-eventbridgedatasource.md)

- [HttpDataSource](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-httpdatasource.md)

- [LambdaDataSource](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-lambdadatasource.md)

- [NoneDataSource](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-nonedatasource.md)

- [OpenSearchDataSource](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-opensearchdatasource.md)

- [RdsDataSource](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-rdsdatasource.md)

- The code contains our function's request and response handlers, which is a simple
scan and return.

- The runtime specifies that we want to use the APPSYNC\_JS runtime version 1.0.0.
Note that this is currently the only version available for APPSYNC\_JS.

Next, we need to attach the function to the pipeline resolver. We created our resolver
using the form:

```

Resolver(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ResolverProps)
```

Our scope was `this`, our CFN id was `pipeline-resolver-get-posts`,
and our props contained the actual function details. Inside the props, we included:

- The GraphQL API we created earlier ( `add_api`).

- The special object type name; this is a query operation, so we simply added the
value `Query`.

- The field name ( `getPost`) is the name of the field in the schema under
the `Query` type.

- The code contains your before and after handlers. Our example just returns
whatever results were in the context after the function performed its
operation.

- The runtime specifies that we want to use the APPSYNC\_JS runtime version 1.0.0.
Note that this is currently the only version available for APPSYNC\_JS.

- The pipeline config contains the reference to the function we created
( `add_func`).

To summarize what happened in this example, you saw an AWS AppSync function that implemented a request and
response handler. The function was responsible for interacting with your data source. The request handler
sent a `Scan` operation to AWS AppSync, instructing it on what operation to perform against your DynamoDB
data source. The response handler returned the list of items ( `ctx.result.items`). The list of
items was then mapped to the `Post` GraphQL type automatically.

## Creating basic mutation resolvers

This section will show you how to make a basic mutation resolver.

Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AppSync\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync).
1. In the **APIs dashboard**, choose your GraphQL
       API.

2. In the **Sidebar**, choose **Schema**.
2. Under the **Resolvers** section and the **Mutation** type, choose **Attach**
    next to your field.

###### Note

In our example, we're attaching a resolver for `createPost`, which adds
a `Post` object to our table. Let's assume we're using the same DynamoDB
table from the last section. Its partition key is set to the `id` and is
empty.

3. On the **Attach resolver** page, under **Resolver type**, choose `pipeline resolvers`. As a
    reminder, you can find more information about resolvers [here](resolver-components.md). For **Resolver runtime**, choose `APPSYNC_JS` to enable
    the JavaScript runtime.

4. You can enable [caching](enabling-caching.md) for this API. We
    recommend turning this feature off for now. Choose **Create**.

5. Choose **Add function**, then choose **Create new function**. Alternatively, you may see a **Create function** button to choose instead.
1. Choose your data source. This should be the source whose data you will
       manipulate with the mutation.

2. Enter a `Function name`.

3. Under **Function code**, you'll need to implement
       the function's behavior. This is a mutation, so the request will ideally perform
       some state-changing operation on the invoked data source. The result will be
       processed by the response function.

      ###### Note

      `createPost` is adding, or "putting", a new `Post`
      in the table with our parameters as the data. We could add something like
      this:

      ```

      import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils';

      /**
       * Sends a request to `put` an item in the DynamoDB data source
       */
      export function request(ctx) {
        return {
          operation: 'PutItem',
          key: util.dynamodb.toMapValues({id: util.autoId()}),
          attributeValues: util.dynamodb.toMapValues(ctx.args.input),
        };
      }

      /**
       * returns the result of the `put` operation
       */
      export function response(ctx) {
        return ctx.result;
      }
      ```

      In this step, we also added `request` and `response`
      functions:

- `request`: The request handler accepts the context as
the argument. The request handler return statement performs a [`PutItem`](js-resolver-reference-dynamodb.md#js-aws-appsync-resolver-reference-dynamodb-putitem) command, which is a built-in
DynamoDB operation (see [here](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-step-2.md) or [here](../../../dynamodb/latest/developerguide/workingwithitems.md#WorkingWithItems.WritingData) for examples). The `PutItem` command
adds a `Post` object to our DynamoDB table by taking the
partition `key` value (automatically generated by
`util.autoid()`) and `attributes` from the
context argument input (these are the values we will pass in our
request). The `key` is the `id` and
`attributes` are the `date` and
`title` field arguments. They're both preformatted
through the [`util.dynamodb.toMapValues`](dynamodb-helpers-in-util-dynamodb-js.md#utility-helpers-in-toMap-js) helper to
work with the DynamoDB table.

- `response`: The response accepts the updated context
and returns the result of the request handler.

4. Choose **Create** after you're
       done.
6. Back on the resolver screen, under **Functions**, choose
    the **Add function** drop-down and add your function to
    your functions list.

7. Choose **Save** to update the resolver.

CLI

**To add your function**

- Create a function for your pipeline resolver using the `create-function` command.

You'll need to enter a few parameters for this particular command:

1. The `api-id` of your API.

2. The `name` of the function in the AWS AppSync console.

3. The `data-source-name`, or the name of the data source the function
    will use. It must already be created and linked to your GraphQL API in the
    AWS AppSync service.

4. The `runtime`, or environment and language of the function. For
    JavaScript, the name must be `APPSYNC_JS`, and the runtime,
    `1.0.0`.

5. The `code`, or request and response handlers of your function.
    While you can type it in manually, it's far easier to add it to a .txt file (or
    a similar format) then pass it in as the argument.

###### Note

Our query code will be in a file passed in as the argument:

```

import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils';

/**
    * Sends a request to `put` an item in the DynamoDB data source
    */
export function request(ctx) {
     return {
       operation: 'PutItem',
       key: util.dynamodb.toMapValues({id: util.autoId()}),
       attributeValues: util.dynamodb.toMapValues(ctx.args.input),
     };
}

/**
    * returns the result of the `put` operation
    */
export function response(ctx) {
     return ctx.result;
}
```

An example command may look like this:

```

aws appsync create-function \
--api-id abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \
--name add_posts_func_1 \
--data-source-name table-for-posts \
--runtime name=APPSYNC_JS,runtimeVersion=1.0.0 \
--code file:///path/to/file/{filename}.{fileType}
```

An output will be returned in the CLI. Here's an example:

```nohighlight

{
    "functionConfiguration": {
        "functionId": "vulcmbfcxffiram63psb4dduoa",
        "functionArn": "arn:aws:appsync:us-west-2:107289374856:apis/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/functions/vulcmbfcxffiram63psb4dduoa",
        "name": "add_posts_func_1",
        "dataSourceName": "table-for-posts",
        "maxBatchSize": 0,
        "runtime": {
            "name": "APPSYNC_JS",
            "runtimeVersion": "1.0.0"
        },
        "code": "Code output foes here"
    }
}
```

###### Note

Make sure you record the `functionId` somewhere as this will be used to
attach the function to the resolver.

**To create your resolver**

- Create a pipeline function for `Mutation` by running the `create-resolver` command.

You'll need to enter a few parameters for this particular command:

1. The `api-id` of your API.

2. The `type-name`, or the special object type in your schema (Query,
    Mutation, Subscription).

3. The `field-name`, or the field operation inside the special object
    type you want to attach the resolver to.

4. The `kind`, which specifies a unit or pipeline resolver. Set this
    to `PIPELINE` to enable pipeline functions.

5. The `pipeline-config`, or the function(s) to attach to the
    resolver. Make sure you know the `functionId` values of your
    functions. Order of listing matters.

6. The `runtime`, which was `APPSYNC_JS` (JavaScript). The
    `runtimeVersion` currently is `1.0.0`.

7. The `code`, which contains the before and after step.

###### Note

Our query code will be in a file passed in as the argument:

```

import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils';

/**
    * Sends a request to `put` an item in the DynamoDB data source
    */

     const { id, ...values } = ctx.args;
     return {
       operation: 'PutItem',

     };
}

/**
    * returns the result of the `put` operation
    */
export function response(ctx) {
     return ctx.result;

CDK

###### Tip

Before you use the CDK, we recommend reviewing the CDK's [official documentation](../../../cdk/v2/guide/home.md)
along with AWS AppSync's [CDK reference](../../../cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib-aws-appsync-readme.md).

The steps listed below will only show a general example of the snippet used to add a
particular resource. This is **not** meant to be a working
solution in your production code. We also assume you already have a working app.

- To make a mutation, assuming you're in the same project, you can add it to the stack
file like the query. Here's a modified function and resolver for a mutation that adds a
new `Post` to the table:

```

const add_func_2 = new appsync.AppsyncFunction(this, 'func-add-post', {
    name: 'add_posts_func_1',
    add_api,
    dataSource: add_api.addDynamoDbDataSource('table-for-posts-2', add_ddb_table),
        code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
            export function request(ctx) {
              return {
                operation: 'PutItem',
                key: util.dynamodb.toMapValues({id: util.autoId()}),
                attributeValues: util.dynamodb.toMapValues(ctx.args.input),
              };
            }

            export function response(ctx) {
              return ctx.result;
            }
        `),
    runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
});

new appsync.Resolver(this, 'pipeline-resolver-create-posts', {
    add_api,
    typeName: 'Mutation',
    fieldName: 'createPost',
        code: appsync.Code.fromInline(`
            export function request(ctx) {
              return {};
            }

            export function response(ctx) {
              return ctx.prev.result;
            }
        `),
    runtime: appsync.FunctionRuntime.JS_1_0_0,
    pipelineConfig: [add_func_2],
});
```

###### Note

Since this mutation and the query are similarly structured, we'll just explain the
changes we made to make the mutation.

In the function, we changed the CFN id to `func-add-post` and name to
`add_posts_func_1` to reflect the fact that we're adding
`Posts` to the table. In the data source, we made a new association
to our table ( `add_ddb_table`) in the AWS AppSync console as
`table-for-posts-2` because the `addDynamoDbDataSource`
method requires it. Keep in mind, this new association is still using the same table
we created earlier, but we now have two connections to it in the AWS AppSync console: one
for the query as `table-for-posts` and one for the mutation as
`table-for-posts-2`. The code was changed to add a `Post`
by generating its `id` value automatically and accepting a client's input
for the rest of the fields.

In the resolver, we changed the id value to
`pipeline-resolver-create-posts` to reflect the fact that we're
adding `Posts` to the table. To reflect the mutation in the schema, the
type name was changed to `Mutation`, and the name,
`createPost`. The pipeline config was set to our new mutation
function `add_func_2`.

To summarize what's happening in this example, AWS AppSync automatically converts arguments defined in the
`createPost` field from your GraphQL schema into DynamoDB operations. The example stores records
in DynamoDB using a key of `id`, which is automatically created using our `util.autoId()`
helper. All of the other fields you pass to the context arguments ( `ctx.args.input`) from
requests made in the AWS AppSync console or otherwise will be stored as the table's attributes. Both the key and
the attributes are automatically mapped to a compatible DynamoDB format using the
`util.dynamodb.toMapValues(values)` helper.

AWS AppSync also supports test and debug workflows for editing resolvers. You can use a mock
`context` object to see the transformed value of the template before invoking it. Optionally,
you can view the full request to a data source interactively when you run a query. For more information, see
[Test and debug\
resolvers (JavaScript)](test-debug-resolvers-js.md) and [Monitoring and logging](monitoring.md#aws-appsync-monitoring).

## Advanced resolvers

If you are following the optional pagination section in [Designing your schema](designing-your-schema.md#aws-appsync-designing-your-schema), you still need to add your resolver to your request to make use of
pagination. Our example used a query pagination called `getPosts` to return only a portion of the
things requested at a time. Our resolver's code on that field may look like this:

```sh

/**
 * Performs a scan on the dynamodb data source
 */
export function request(ctx) {
  const { limit = 20, nextToken } = ctx.args;
  return { operation: 'Scan', limit, nextToken };
}

/**
 * @returns the result of the `put` operation
 */
export function response(ctx) {
  const { items: posts = [], nextToken } = ctx.result;
  return { posts, nextToken };
}
```

In the request, we pass in the context of the request. Our `limit` is
`20`, meaning we return up to 20 `Posts` in the first query. Our
`nextToken` cursor is fixed to the first `Post` entry in the data source. These
are passed to the args. The request then performs a scan from the first `Post` up to the scan
limit number. The data source stores the result in the context, which is passed to the response. The
response returns the `Posts` it retrieved, then sets the `nextToken` is set to the
`Post` entry right after the limit. The next request is sent out to do the exact same thing
but starting at the offset right after the first query. Keep in mind that these sorts of requests are done
sequentially and not in parallel.
