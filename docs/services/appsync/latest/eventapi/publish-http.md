# Publish events via HTTP

AWS AppSync Events allows you to publish events via your API’s HTTP endpoint using a POST operation. Publishing is the only supported action over the endpoint.

**Publish steps**

1. Send a POST request to the address: `https://HTTP_DOMAIN/event`.

2. Add the authorization header(s) required to authorize your request.

3. Specify the following in the request body:

- The channel that you are publishing to.

- The list of events you are publishing. You can publish up to 5 events in a batch.

Each specified event in your publish request must be a stringified valid JSON value.

**Publish example**

The following is an example of a request.

```json

{
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "da2-your-api-key"
  },
  "body": {
    "channel": "default/channel",
    "events": [
      "{\"event_1\":\"data_1\"}",
      "{\"event_2\":\"data_2\"}"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can use your Browser’s `fetch API` to publish the events. The following example demonstrates this.

```json

await fetch(`https://${HTTP_DOMAIN}/event`, {
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "da2-your-api-key"
  },
  "body": {
    "channel": "default/channel",
    "events": [
      "{\"event_1\":\"data_1\"}",
      "{\"event_2\":\"data_2\"}"
    ]
  }
})
```
