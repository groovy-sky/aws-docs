# Understanding the Event API WebSocket protocol

AWS AppSync Events' WebSocket API allows a client to subscribe and receive events in real-time.
After the client is connected, the client can also publish to channels. Establishing a valid
connection and subscribing to receive events is a simple multi-step process.

First, a client establishes a WebSocket connection with the AWS real-time endpoint, sends
a connection initialization message, and waits for acknowledgment.

After a successful connection is established, the client registers subscriptions by sending
a “subscribe” message with a unique ID and a channel path of interest. AWS AppSync confirms
successful subscriptions with acknowledgment messages. The client then listens for
subscription events, which are triggered when a publisher publishes events that are broadcast
by the service. To maintain the connection, AWS AppSync sends periodic keep-alive messages.

When finished, the client unsubscribes by sending “unsubscribe” messages. This system
supports multiple subscriptions on a single WebSocket connection and accommodates various
authorization modes, including API keys, Amazon Cognito user pools, IAM, and Lambda.

The following diagram demonstrates the WebSocket protocol message flow between the
WebSocket client and the real-time endpoint.

**WebSocket protocol overview**

![The WebSocket protocol message flow overview.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appsync/latest/eventapi/images/WebSocket-protocol.png)

In the preceeding diagram, the following WebSocket steps occur in the message flow.

- A client establishes a WebSocket connection with the AWS AppSync real-time endpoint. If
there is a network error, the client should do a jittered exponential backoff. For more
information, see [Exponential backoff and jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter) on the _AWS Architecture_
_Blog_.

- After successfully establishing the WebSocket connection, the client can optionally
send a `connection_init` message.

- The client waits for a `connection_ack` message from AWS AppSync. This
message includes a `connectionTimeoutMs` parameter, which is the
maximum wait time in milliseconds for a "ka" (keep-alive) message.

- AWS AppSync sends "ka" messages periodically. The client keeps track of the time that it
received each "ka" message. If the client doesn't receive a "ka" message within
`connectionTimeoutMs` milliseconds, the client should close the
connection.

- The client registers the subscription by sending a subscribe message. A single
WebSocket connection supports multiple subscriptions, even if they are in different
authorization modes.

- The client waits for AWS AppSync to send `subscribe_success` messages to
confirm successful subscriptions.

- The client listens for subscription events, which are sent after events are published
to the channel of interest.

- The client unregisters the subscription by sending an `unsubscribe`
subscription message.

- At any time after connection, the client can publish a message by sending a
`publish` message. Subscribing to a channel is not required before
publishing.

- The client receives a `publish_success` acknowledgement.

- After unregistering all subscriptions and checking that there are no messages
transferring through the WebSocket, the client can disconnect from the WebSocket
connection.

## Handshake details to establish the WebSocket connection

All interactions with the AWS AppSync real-time endpoint begin with establishing a WebSocket
connection. The connection remains open as long as the client remains connected, up to a
maximum of 24 hours. Connecting is an operation that requires authorization credentials to
complete the handshake. To connect and initiate a successful handshake with AWS AppSync, a
WebSocket client needs the following information:

- The AWS AppSync Events realtime and HTTP endpoints

- The authorization details

To authorize your WebSocket connection establishment, send the authorization information
as a WebSocket subprotocol. To do this, a client must wrap the appropriate authorization
credentials in a JSON object, encode the object in Base64URL format, and append the encoded
header string in the list of subprotocols.

The following JavaScript example converts an authorization object into a base64URL
encoded string.

```

/**
 * Encodes an object into Base64 URL format
 * @param {*} authorization - an object with the required authorization properties
 **/
function getBase64URLEncoded(authorization) {
  return btoa(JSON.stringify(authorization))
    .replace(/\+/g, '-') // Convert '+' to '-'
    .replace(/\//g, '_') // Convert '/' to '_'
    .replace(/=+$/, '') // Remove padding `=`
}
```

Next, this example creates the required subprotocol value.

```

function getAuthProtocol(authorization) {
  const header = getBase64URLEncoded(authorization)
  return `header-${header}`
}
```

The following example uses bash to create a header, and then uses wscat to connect. You
must specify `aws-appsync-event-ws` as one of the subprotocols.

```bash

$ REALTIME_DOMAIN='example1234567890000.appsync-realtime-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'
$ HTTP_DOMAIN='example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
$ API_KEY='da2-12345678901234567890123456'

$ header="{\"host\":\"$HTTP_DOMAIN\", \"x-api-key\":\"$API_KEY\"}"
$ header=`echo "$header" | base64 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '\n='`
$ wscat -p 13 -s "header-$header" -s "aws-appsync-event-ws" -c "wss://$REALTIME_DOMAIN/event/realtime"

Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Discovering the real-time endpoint from the Event API endpoint

AWS AppSync Event APIs are configured with two endpoints: a realtime endpoint and an HTTP
endpoint. You can retrieve your endpoint information by visiting your API’s
**Settings** page in the AWS Management Console or by running the AWS CLI command
`aws appsync get-api`.

**AWS AppSync Events HTTP endpoint**

https://example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/event

**AWS AppSync Events real-time endpoint**

wss://example1234567890000.appsync-realtime-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/event/realtime

Applications can connect to the HTTP endpoint (https://) using any HTTP client, and
can connect to the real-time endpoint (wss://) using any WebSocket client.

With custom domain names, you can interact with both endpoints using a single domain.
For example, if you configure api.example.com as your custom domain, you can interact
with your HTTP and real-time endpoints using the following URLs.

**AWS AppSync Events HTTP endpoint**

https://api.example.com/event

**AWS AppSync Events real-time endpoint**

wss://api.example.com/event/realtime

## Authorization formatting based on the AWS AppSync API authorization mode

The format of the authorization subprotocol varies depending on the AWS AppSync authorization
mode. AWS AppSync supports API key, Amazon Cognito user pools, OpenID Connect (OIDC), AWS Lambda, and
IAM authorization modes. The host field in the object refers to the AWS AppSync Events HTTP
endpoint, which is used to validate the connection even if the wss:// call is made against
the real-time endpoint.

Use the following sections to learn how to format the authorization subprotocol for the
supported authorization modes.

### API key subprotocol format

**Header content**

- `"host": <string>`: The host for the AWS AppSync Events HTTP
endpoint or your custom domain name. Only required for connection authorization.

- `"x-api-key": <string>`: The API key configured for the AWS AppSync
Event API.

**Example**

```json

{
  "host":"example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  "x-api-key":"da2-12345678901234567890123456"
}
```

### Amazon Cognito user pools and OpenID Connect (OIDC) subprotocol format

**Header content**

- `"host": <string>`: The host for the AWS AppSync Events HTTP
endpoint or your custom domain name. Only required for connection authorization.

- `"Authorization": <string>`: A JWT ID token. The header can
use a Bearer scheme.

}
```

### AWS Lambda subprotocol format

**Header content**

- `"host": <string>`: The host for the AWS AppSync Events HTTP
endpoint or your custom domain name. Only required for connection authorization.

- `"Authorization": <string>`: A custom authorization token of
your design.

**Example**

```json

{
  "Authorization":"M0UzQzM1MkQtMkI0Ni00OTZCLUI1NkQtMUM0MTQ0QjVBRTczCkI1REEzRTIxLTk5NzItNDJENi1BQjMwLTFCNjRFNzQ2NzlCNQo=",

}
```

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) subprotocol format

**Header content**

- `"accept": "application/json, text/javascript"`: A constant string
parameter.

- `"content-encoding": "amz-1.0"`: A constant string parameter.

- `"content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"`: A constant
string parameter.

- `"host": <string>`: This is the host for the AWS AppSync Events
HTTP endpoint.

- `"x-amz-date": <string>`: The timestamp must be in UTC and in
the following ISO 8601 format: YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'. For example, 20150830T123600Z
is a valid timestamp. Don't include milliseconds in the timestamp. For more
information, see [Elements of an\
AWS API request signature](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-sigv-signing-elements.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- `"X-Amz-Security-Token": <string>`: The AWS session token,
which is required when using temporary security credentials. For more information,
see [Use temporary\
credentials with AWS resources](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-credentials-temp-use-resources.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- `"Authorization": <string>`: Signature Version 4 (SigV4)
signing information for the AWS AppSync endpoint. For more information on the signing
process, see [Create a\
signed AWS API request](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-sigv-create-signed-request.md) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

The SigV4 signing HTTP request includes a canonical URL, which is the AWS AppSync
HTTP endpoint with `/event` appended. The service endpoint AWS Region is
the same Region where you're using the AWS AppSync API, and the service name is
'appsync'.

The HTTP request to sign to connect is the following.

```json

{
  url: "https://example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/event",
  data: "{}",
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "accept": "application/json, text/javascript",
    "content-encoding": "amz-1.0",
    "content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8",
    "host": "example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  }
}
```

The following is the request to sign when sending a subscribe message. The channel
name is specified in the request.

```json

{
  url: "https://example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/event",
  body: "{\"channel\":\"/your/channel/*\"}",
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "accept": "application/json, text/javascript",
    "content-encoding": "amz-1.0",
    "content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8",
    "host": "example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  }
}
```

The following is the request to sign when publishing over WebSocket. The channel name
and event payload are specified in the request.

```json

{
  url: "https://example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/event",
  body: "{\"channel\":\"/your/channel/*\",\"events\":[{\"event_1\":\"data_1\"},{\"event_2\":\"data_2\"}]}",
  method: "POST",

}
```

## Real-time WebSocket operations

After initiating a successful WebSocket handshake with AWS AppSync, the client must send a
subsequent message to connect to AWS AppSync for different operations. The WebSocket API has the
following properties.

**WebSocket API message properties**

**id**

The client provided ID of the operation. This property is required and is used
to correlate response error and success messages. For subscriptions, this property
must be unique for all subscriptions within a connection. The property is a string
and is limited to a maximum of 128 alphanumeric and special character `(_,+,-)`
characters: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9-_+]{1,128}$/`.

**type**

The type of operation being performed. Supported client operations are
subscribe, unsubscribe, publish. The property is a string and must be one of the
message types defined in the next section, _Configuring message_
_details_.

**channel**

The channel to subscribe to, or to publish events to. The property is a string
made up of one to five segments separated by a slash. Each segment is limited to
50 alphanumeric + dash characters. The property is case sensitive. For example:
`channelNamespaceName` or
`channelNamespaceName/sub-segment-1/subSegment-2` `/^\/?[A-Za-z0-9](?:[A-Za-z0-9-]{0,48}[A-Za-z0-9])?(?:\/[A-Za-z0-9](?:[A-Za-z0-9-]{0,48}[A-Za-z0-9])?){0,4}\/?$/`

**events**

An array of events to be published. You can publish up to five events in a
batch. Each specified event in your publish request must be a stringified valid
JSON value.

**authorization**

The authorization headers necessary to authorize the operation. For example,
ApiKey will contain `x-api-key`, while Amazon Cognito, OIDC, and Lambda will
contain `authorization`. IAM will contain `host`,
`x-amz-date`, `x-amz-security-token`, and
`authorization`. The `host` header is required for IAM
only.

## Configuring message details

This section provides information about the syntax to use to configure the details for
various message types.

**Connection init message**

(Optional) After the client has established the WebSocket connection, the client sends
an init message to initiate the connection session.

```json

{ "type": "connection_init" }
```

**Connection acknowledge message**

AWS AppSync responds with an “ack” message that contains a connection timeout value. If the
client doesn’t receive a keep-alive message within the connection timeout period, the
client should close the connection. The connection timeout period is 5 minutes.

```json

{
    "type": "connection_ack",
    "connectionTimeoutMs": 300000
}
```

**Keep-alive message**

AWS AppSync periodically sends a keep-alive message to the client to maintain the connection.
If the client doesn’t receive a keep-alive message within the connection timeout period,
the client should close the connection. The keep-alive interval is 60 seconds. Clients do
not need to acknowledge these messages.

```

{ "type": "ka" }
```

**Subscribe message**

After receiving a `connection_ack` message, the client can send a
subscription registration message to listen for events on a channel.

- “id” is the ID of the subscription. This ID must be unique per client connection
otherwise AWS AppSync returns an error message indicating the subscription message is
duplicated.

- “channel” is the channel to which the subscribed client is listening. Any messages
published to this channel will be delivered to the subscribed client.

- “authorization” is an object containing the fields required for authorization. The
authorization object follows the same rules as the headers for connecting to the
WebSocket.

```json

{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
  "channel": "/namespaceA/subB/subC",
  "authorization": {
    "x-api-key": "da2-12345678901234567890123456",
    "host": "example1234567890000.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
   }
}
```

**Subscription acknowledgment message**

AWS AppSync acknowledges with a success message. “id” is the ID of the corresponding
subscribe operation that succeeded.

```json

{
  "type": "subscribe_success",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69"
}
```

In case of an error, AWS AppSync sends a `subscribe_error` response.

```json

{
  "type": "subscribe_error",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
  "errors": [
    {
      "errorType": "SubscriptionProcessingError",
      "message": "There was an error processing the operation"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Data message**

When an event is published to a channel the client is subscribed to, the event is
broadcast and delivered in a data message. “id” is the ID of the corresponding subscription
for the channel to which the message was published.

```json

{
  "type": "data",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
  "event": ["\"my event content\""]
}
```

In case of an error, such as a broadcasting error, an error can be received at the
client:

```json

{
  "type": "broadcast_error",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
  "errors": [
    {
      "errorType": "MessageProcessingError",
      "message": "There was an error processing the message"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Unsubscribe message**

When the client wants to stop listening to a subscribed channel, the client sends a
message to unregister the subscription. “id” is the ID of the corresponding subscription to
which the client wants to unregister.

```json

{
  "type": "unsubscribe",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69"
}
```

AWS AppSync acknowledges with a success message. “id” is the ID of the corresponding
subscribe operation that succeeded.

```json

{
  "type": "unsubscribe_success",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69"
}
```

If an error occurs, an error message is sent back to the client

```json

{
  "type": "unsubscribe_error",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
  "errors": [
    {
      "errorType": "UnknownOperationError",
      "message": "Unknown operation id ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Publish message**

Once connected, the client can start publishing messages to channels. `“id”` is the ID of
the publish operation. `“channel”` is the channel to which the events are published. The
events will be delivered to all clients subscribed to the channel. `“authorization”` is an
object containing the fields required for authorization. The authorization object follows
the same rules as the headers for subscribing to the channel.

```json

{
  "type": "publish",
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
  "channel": "/namespaceA/subB/subC",
  "events": [ "{ \"msg\": \"Hello World!\" }" ],
  "authorization": {
    "x-api-key": "da2-12345678901234567890123456",
   }
}
```

**Publish success message**

The server acknowledges with a success message. `“id”` is the ID of the corresponding
publish operation that succeeded. `“failed”` is the list of events which were marked in error
while executing the publish handler.

```json

{
  "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
  "type": "publish_success",
  "successful": [
    {
      "identifier": "221b6b3f-46fd-4ac1-a327-bd2623b7402e",
      "index": 0
    }
  ],
  "failed": []
}
```

If an error occurs, an error message is sent back to the client.

```json

{
    "id": "ee849ef0-cf23-4cb8-9fcb-152ae4fd1e69",
    "type": "publish_error",
    "errors": [
        {
            "errorType": "An error type",
            "message": "A message"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Disconnecting the WebSocket

Before disconnecting the WebSocket, to avoid data loss, the client should have the
necessary logic to check that no operation is currently in place through the WebSocket
connection. All subscriptions should be unregistered before disconnecting from the
WebSocket.
