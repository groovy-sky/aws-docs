# Using service-linked roles for AWS Artifact
<a name="using-service-linked-roles"></a>

AWS Artifact uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role). A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to AWS Artifact. Service-linked roles are predefined by AWS Artifact and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.

A service-linked role makes setting up AWS Artifact easier because you don't have to manually add the necessary permissions. AWS Artifact defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only AWS Artifact can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.

You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting its related resources. This protects your AWS Artifact resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources.

For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) and look for the services that have **Yes** in the **Service-linked roles** column. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.

## Service-linked role permissions for AWS Artifact
<a name="slr-permissions"></a>

AWS Artifact uses the service-linked role named **AWSServiceRoleForArtifact** – Allows AWS Artifact to gather information about an organization via AWS Organizations.

The AWSServiceRoleForArtifact service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
+  `artifact.amazonaws.com`

The role permissions policy named AWSArtifactServiceRolePolicy allows AWS Artifact to complete the following actions on the `organizations` resource.
+  `DescribeOrganization`
+  `DescribeAccount`
+  `ListAccounts`
+  `ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization`

## Creating a service-linked role for AWS Artifact
<a name="create-slr"></a>

You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you go to the **Organization agreements** tab in an organization management account and choose the **Get started** link in the AWS Management Console, AWS Artifact creates the service-linked role for you.

If you delete this service-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you go to the **Organization agreements** tab in an organization management account and choose the **Get started** link, AWS Artifact creates the service-linked role for you again.

## Editing a service-linked role for AWS Artifact
<a name="edit-slr"></a>

AWS Artifact does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForArtifact service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see [Editing a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Deleting a service-linked role for AWS Artifact
<a name="delete-slr"></a>

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don't have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up the resources for your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.

**Note**
If the AWS Artifact service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.

**To delete AWS Artifact resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForArtifact**

1. Visit the 'Organization Agreements' table in the AWS Artifact console

1. Terminate any active Organization agreements

 **To manually delete the service-linked role using IAM**

Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForArtifact service-linked role. For more information, see [Deleting a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*.
