# Accepting agreements for your organization in AWS Artifact
<a name="accept-org-agreement"></a>

If you're the owner of the management account of an AWS Organizations organization, then you can accept an agreement with AWS on behalf of all AWS accounts in your organization.

**Important**
Before you accept an agreement, we recommend that you consult with your legal, privacy, and compliance team.

AWS Organizations has two available feature sets: *consolidated billing features* and *all features*. To use AWS Artifact for your organization, the organization that you belong to must be enabled for [all features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#feature-set). If your organization is configured only for consolidated billing, see [Enabling all features in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.

To accept or terminate organization agreements, you must be signed in to the management account with the correct AWS Artifact permissions. Users of member accounts that have `organizations:DescribeOrganization` permissions can view the organization agreements that are accepted on their behalf.

For more information, see [Managing accounts in an organization with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.

**Required permissions**
To accept an agreement, the owner of the management account must have the required [permissions](example-iam-policies.md#example-policy-organizational-agreements).

For more information, see [Identity and access management in AWS Artifact](security-iam.md).
