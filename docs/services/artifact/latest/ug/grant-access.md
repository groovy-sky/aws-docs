## Step 1: Create an IAM policy

As an IAM administrator, you can create a policy that grants permissions to AWS Artifact actions and resources.<a name="create-iam-policy-proc"></a>

**To create an IAM policy**

Use the following procedure to create an IAM policy that you can use to grant permissions to your IAM users and groups.

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**.

1. Choose **Create policy**.

1. Choose the **JSON** tab.

1. Enter a policy document. You can create you own policy, or you can use one of the policies from [Example IAM policies for AWS Artifact in commercial AWS Regions](example-iam-policies.md).

1. Choose **Review Policy**. The policy validator reports any syntax errors.

1. On the **Review policy** page, enter a unique name that helps you remember the purpose of the policy. You can also provide a description.

1. Choose **Create policy**.

## Step 2: Create an IAM group and attach the policy
<a name="create-iam-group"></a>

As an IAM administrator, you can create a group and attach the policy that you created to the group. You can add IAM users to the group at any time.

**To create an IAM group and attach your policy**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Groups** and then choose **Create New Group**.

1. For **Group Name**, enter a name for your group and then choose **Next Step**.

1. In the search field, enter the name of the policy that you created. Select the check box for your policy and then choose **Next Step**.

## Step 3: Create IAM users and add them to the group
<a name="create-iam-user"></a>

As an IAM administrator, you can add users to a group at any time. This grants the users the permissions granted to the group.

**To create an IAM user and add the user to a group**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** and then choose **Add user**.

1. For **User name**, enter the names for one or more users.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**. Configure an auto-generated or custom password. You can optionally select **User must create a new password at next sign-in** to require a password reset when the user first signs in.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**.

1. Choose **Add user to group** and then select the group that you created.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**. You can optionally add tags to your users.

1. Choose **Next: Review**. When you are ready, choose **Create user**.
