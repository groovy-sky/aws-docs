# Terminating agreements for your organization in AWS Artifact

If you used the AWS Artifact console to [accept an agreement on behalf of all member accounts\
in an organization in AWS Organizations](accept-org-agreement.md), then you can use the console to terminate
that agreement. Otherwise, see [Offline agreements in AWS Artifact](manage-offline-agreement.md).

If a member account is removed from an organization, then that member account is longer
covered by organization agreements. Before removing member accounts from an
organization, a management account administrator should communicate this to member
accounts so that they can put new agreements in place if necessary. You can view a list
of active organization agreements in the AWS Artifact console on the
**Agreements** page, under [Organization\
agreements](https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/home?).

For more information about AWS Organizations, see [Managing accounts in\
an organization with AWS Organizations](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-accounts.md) in the
_AWS Organizations User Guide_.

###### Required permissions

To terminate an agreement, the owner of the management account must have the required [permissions](example-iam-policies.md#example-policy-manage-terminate-agreements).

For more information, see [Identity and access management in AWS Artifact](security-iam.md).
