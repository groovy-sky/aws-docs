# Uploading files for the first time

You can use the AWS Supply Chain Auto-association feature to upload your raw data and automatically associate your raw data with AWS Supply Chain data model. You can also view the _required_
columns and tables for each AWS Supply Chain module within the AWS Supply Chain web application.

For a brief demonstration of how auto-association works, watch the following video:

###### Note

You can only upload CSV files to Amazon S3 when you are using Auto-association.

After the source columns from your dataset are associated with the destination columns, AWS Supply Chain will automatically generate the SQL recipe.

###### Note

AWS Supply Chain uses Amazon Bedrock for Auto-association, which it's not supported in all
the &AWS Regions that AWS Supply Chain is available in. Hence,
AWS Supply Chain will call Amazon Bedrock endpoint from the closest available
region, Europe (Ireland) Region – Europe (Frankfurt) and Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region
– US West (Oregon).

###### Note

Auto-association using the Large Language Models (LLM) is only supported when data is ingested through Amazon S3.

05. On the **Which capabilities do you want to run** page, choose the
     AWS Supply Chain modules that you want to use. You can choose more than one
     module.

06. Under **Upload your source files** section, add a suffix to the **Source system name**. For example, oracle\_test.

07. To upload your source dataset, choose **files** or drag and drop files.

    The source tables with the name and status are displayed.

08. Choose **Upload to S3**. The _upload status_ will change to display the status.

09. Under **Review data requirements**, review all the required data entities and
     columns for the selected AWS Supply Chain feature. All of the required
     primary and foreign keys are displayed.

10. Choose **Continue**.

11. Under **Manage your source tables**, the following source tables and the
     columns listed will be auto associated and imported into data lake.

13. Under **Manage Destination Flows**, you can review each auto-associated table.

    By default, **Auto-Association** is enabled and the source columns are auto-associated with the destination columns. To update the auto-associated columns, you can update the SQL recipe to create your custom recipe.

14. Under **Source Columns**, all of the unassociated source columns are listed.
     Drag and drop the unassociated columns to the **Destination**
    **Columns** on the right.

15. Follow the preceding step for each auto-associated table.

16. Choose **Submit**.

17. Choose **Exit and Review Destination Flows**.
