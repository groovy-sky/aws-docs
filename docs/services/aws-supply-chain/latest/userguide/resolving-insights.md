# Resolving an inventory risk insight

Insights recommends one or more ways to resolve an inventory risk depending on the distance, time horizon, available transportation modes in the ingested data (transportation\_lane.trans\_mode), shipping
costs (transportation\_lane.unit\_costs), and emissions that you've configured under Insights settings. The recommendation might include an inventory transfer from other locations within a certain distance and this
would resolve an inventory risk in the location under review.

Under **Settings** \> **Insights**, **Rebalancing Recommendations Score Weights**, you can adjust the core weight values
to determine how ranking is calculated for rebalance recommendations. You can setup the radius surrounding the stocked out site to search for available stock for rebalance. You can set the distance in miles and kilometers. You can configure the rebalance model to
optimize inventory levels for both supplying and receiving sites. Insights supports up to a maximum of six weeks beyond the current date, and you can customize the time horizon by
factoring your lead times to see the impact of the rebalance before and after transfers.

Inventory risk recommendations are helpful for immediately resolving stockout issues rather than overstocks. You may see rebalancing recommendations linked with overstock or excess stock issues but those will have a stockout risk at the receiving site.
