# Overview

###### Note

You can only view the **Overview** page after the forecast is generated
for the first time.

The **Overview** tab provides the following information.

- **Overall Influence Factors** – Indicates the
impact score of product metadata attributes and demand drivers (if any), used to generate forecast in the current
planning cycle. You can view the influence factors after the first successful forecast
generation. A negative value indicates the attributes caused the forecast to go down and
vice versa. A zero value indicates that the attribute has no influence on the forecast
result. For information on forecast based on demand drivers, see [Forecast based on demand drivers](demand-drivers.md).

- **Accuracy Metrics** – After you update the dataset (outbound\_order\_line) that contains the actual demand for the forecast period, choose **Recalculate**. You can view the accuracy metrics for the latest demand plan under the **Demand Plan** tab.
Accuracy metrics measure how the accuracy of the current demand plan aligns with the actual demand.

Accuracy metrics are available at **plan (aggregate)**
and **granular lowest** level during forecast generation. The
**Overview** page displays the aggregate level metrics and under
**Accuracy Metrics**, you can choose **Download** to
download the granular metrics.

The following are the formulas used to calculate the metrics displayed on the web application.

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** –
MAPE takes the absolute value of the percentage error between observed and predicted
values for each unit of time and averages those values.

The formula at granular and plan level is below:

![Calculating MAPE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/aws-supply-chain/latest/userguide/images/MAPE_formula.png)

A MAPE less than 5% indicates the forecast is acceptably accurate. A MAPE greater
than 10% but less than 25% indicates low, but acceptable accuracy, and MAPE greater
than 25% indicates very low accuracy and the forecast is not acceptable.

- **Weighted Average Percentage Error (WAPE)** –
WAPE measures the overall deviation of forecasted values from observed values. WAPE is
calculated by taking the sum of observed values and the sum of predicted values, and
calculating the error between those two values. A lower value indicates a more
accurate model.

The formula at granular and plan level is below:

![Calculating WAPE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/aws-supply-chain/latest/userguide/images/WAPE_formula.png)

A WAPE less than 5% is considered as acceptably accurate. A WAPE greater than 10%
but less than 25% indicates low, but acceptable accuracy and WAPE greater than 25%
indicates very low accuracy.

See the following example:

![WAPE calculation example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/aws-supply-chain/latest/userguide/images/Accuracy_metrics.png)

The metrics are not calculated when actual is zero or null. When a new forecast is generated subsequently, the previous reported metrics will no longer be available on the web application. Make sure the latest outbound\_order\_line dataset is updated and choose **Recalculate** to view the updated metrics.

The accuracy metrics reflect the accuracy of the current demand plan for all time
periods that have an actual demand value in the current executed forecast.

For example, if your current planning cycle has forecast from January to December 2023 with monthly forecasts and you updated the actual data for January 2023, accuracy metrics will be computed for January 2023. Similarly, if your current planning cycle has forecast from January to
December 2023 with monthly forecasts and you updated the actual data for January 2023 and February 2023, accuracy metrics will be computed for January 2023 and February 2023. The Demand Planning web application will display the aggregated metric for Jan-Feb-2023 and the export file will display the granular details.

###### Note

When you modify the _Time interval_ or _Hierarchy_
configuration and regenerate the forecast, the accuracy metrics will not be displayed since
the accuracy metric values are not relevant.

## Demand pattern

You can expand the individual metrics to view the demand characteristics such as _Smooth Demand_, _Intermittent Demand_, _Erratic Demand_, and _Lumpy Demand_.
The segments are derived based on the actual demand used in the last forecast.

When one or more of the four segments are missing in the Demand Planning web application, it indicates that the Demand Planning web application could not find any product aligned with the patterns associated with the missing segments.

The following intermediate results are calculated:

###### Note

Records with zero demand are not considered for ADI and CV² computation.

- _Average Demand Interval (ADI)_ – Represents the average time between consecutive demands. ADI = total number of periods / number of demand buckets

- _Squared Coefficient of Variation (CV²)_ – Measures the variability in demand
quantities. CV² = (standard deviation of a population / average value of the population)²

The following cut-offs are applied to derive the segments:

- _Smooth Demand_ (ADI less then 1.32 and CV² less than 0.49) is highly
regular in time and quantity, making it easy to forecast with low error
margins.

- _Intermittent Demand_ (ADI greater than or equal to 1.32 and CV² lesser
than 0.49) exhibits little variation in quantity but high variation in demand
interval, leading to higher forecast error margins.

- _Erratic Demand_ (ADI less then 1.32 and CV² greater than or equal to
0.49) has regular occurrence in time but high variations in quantity, resulting in
shaky forecast accuracy.

- _Lumpy Demand_ (ADI greater than or equal to 1.32 and CV² greater than or
equal to 0.49) is characterized by large variations in both quantity and time, making
it unforecastable.

## Forecast validation

By default, forecast validation is enabled. To make sure the forecast generated is accurate, Demand Planning will monitor and update you on the forecast quality or accuracy. If Demand Planning determines the forecast requires additional validation, Demand Planning will delay publishing the forecast and you will see a message that displays the date and time when the forecast will be published on the AWS Supply Chain web application.

You can also opt-out and Demand Planning will not monitor your forecast. For more information on how to opt-out, see [Opt-out preference](../adminguide/data-protection.md#opt-out-preference).

You can view the last published demand plan in read-only mode.

## Lags

Lags represent the time interval between when the forecast was created and the actual forecast was realized. You can configure up to three forecast lags when you configure demand plan. For more information, see [Create your first demand plan](onboarding.md). The forecast accuracy metrics displays the analysis based on the lag intervals defined.

Forecasts for the defined lags are generated for every planning cycle and the accuracy metrics can only be evaluated after the corresponding number of planning cycles. For example, if you choose lag six, accuracy
metrics for lag six forecast will be calculated after six planning cycles.

###### Note

When you change the lag configuration, the drop-down values displayed are the newly selected lags. Choose **Refresh Metrics** to view the latest metrics. When you change the
time interval (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly), or hierarchy (product/site/customer/channel) granularity, the previous lag metrics will no longer be available when you choose **Refresh Metrics**.
The recalculation results will display the latest demand planning cycle as the only cycle in history.

Choose **Export Metrics** to download a detailed file that includes granular data corresponding to the aggregated metrics displayed on the web application. The downloaded file will contain the following information:

- Timestamp - Forecasted Period, Forecast Creation Date, Last Actual Period, Lag

- XYZ segment (smooth, intermittent, erratic or lumpy)

- Granularity - Product/site/customer/channel as configured

- Baseline forecasts - P10, P50 and P90

- Actual demand

- Metrics - Bias Units, Bias %, MAPE, SMAPE (at granular level, MAPE and WAPE are the same)
