# Forecast Algorithms

AWS Supply Chain Demand Planning offers a combination of 25 built-in forecast models to create baseline
demand forecasts for products with diverse demand patterns in customers’ datasets. The list of 25 forecast
models includes 11 forecast ensemblers (each ensembler is unique based on the set of models that make up
the ensembler and/or the metric the ensembler optimizes to) and 14 individual forecast algorithms including
statistical algorithms like Autoregressive Integrated and Moving Average (ARIMA) to complex neural network
algorithms like CNN-QR, Temporal Fusion Transformer and DeepAR+. Customers have the choice of using forecast
ensembler or individual forecast algorithm based on their use case and unique needs. While the forecast
ensemblers offer the advantage of customers not having to manually deal with cumbersome tasks such as model
selection, hyperparameter tuning and having to simply pick the forecast error metric that is best suited for
the customer use case that the ensembler would optimize , the individual forecast algorithms offer flexibility
for customer use cases that and best forecasted with a single model instead of an ensemble.

The following table lists the 25 built-in forecast models offered by AWS Supply Chain Demand Planning
along with what they are best suited for.

The following table lists the metrics available in Support Demand Planning forecast models.

MetricMetric DescriptionMetric FormulaWhen to use this metric to optimizeLink

MAPE

MAPE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts, expressed as a percentage of the actual values.

Not Applicable

It is commonly used for evaluating the accuracy of predictive models, especially in time series forecasting, where all time series are treated equal for forecast error evaluation.

[https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html#autogluon.timeseries.metrics.MAPE](https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html)

WAPE

WAPE is a variation of MAPE that considers the weighted contributions of different data points.

Not Applicable

It is particularly useful when the data has varying importance or when some observations are more significant than others.

[https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html#autogluon.timeseries.metrics.WAPE](https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html)

RMSE

RMSE measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.

Not Applicable

RMSE is sensitive to large errors because of the squaring operation, which gives more weight to larger errors.In use cases where only a few large mispredictions can be very costly, the RMSE is the more relevant metric.

[https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html#autogluon.timeseries.metrics.RMSE](https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html)

WCD

WCD is a measure of cumulative forecast error weighted by a set of predetermined weights.

Not Applicable

This metric is often used in applications where certain time periods, products, or data points have more importance than others, allowing for prioritization in the error analysis.

Not Applicable

wQL

wQL is a loss function that evaluates the performance of a model based on quantiles, with weighted contributions from different data points.

Not Applicable

It’s useful for assessing model performance in scenarios where the importance of different quantiles (e.g., 90th percentile, 50th percentile) or observations varies. It is particularly useful when there are different costs for underpredicting and overpredicting.

[https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html#autogluon.timeseries.metrics.WQL](https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-metrics.html)

MASE

MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error) is a performance metric used to evaluate the accuracy of time series forecasting models. It compares the mean absolute error (MAE) of the forecasted values to the mean absolute error of a naive forecast.

Not Applicable

MASE is ideal for datasets that are cyclical in nature or have seasonal properties. For example, forecasting for items that are in high demand during summers and in low demand during winters can benefit from taking into account the seasonal impact.
