# Test your application for Amazon Connect Agent Workspace locally

Once you have a minimal version of the app that you want to use in the Amazon Connect
agent workspace with the Amazon Connect SDK that you want to test in the agent
workspace, run your app locally and create an application in the AWS console with an _AccessUrl_ using the localhost endpoint, like `http://localhost:3000`
.

## Creating an application and associating to your instance

###### Note

Detailed steps for creating and managing applications can be found in the
admin guide under [Third-party applications (3P\
apps) in the agent workspace (Preview)](../../../connect/latest/adminguide/3p-apps.md).

01. Open the Amazon Connect
     [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect)
     (https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/).

02. Navigate to **Third-party applications** in the left hand
     panel.

03. Choose **Add application**.

04. Fill out the necessary required information:
    1. **Name**: The name of the application
        is what will show up to agents in the app launcher in the agent
        workspace.

    2. **Namespace**: Namespace must be
        unique per application and, in the future, allow for applications to
        support custom events. Once an app is created, its namespace cannot
        be updated.

    3. **AccessUrl**: Set to the localhost
        url for your application.

    4. **Permissions**: A list of allowed
        functions that grants your application the ability to subscribe to
        agent/contact events that occur in the agent workspace or make
        requests for agent/contact data.
05. Select the Amazon Connect instance you are testing with to associate
     the app with that instance.

06. Choose **Add application** to finish creating your app.

07. Log into your test instance as an admin user.

08. Navigate to **Security profiles** and select the `
                            Admin` security profile.

09. Under **Agent applications** find your application and
     make sure the `View` permission is selected.
    1. Open the agent application `/agent-app-v2`
10. Open your app by choosing the app launcher and selecting your application.
     Your app will be opened in a new application tab.

After following these steps you will have your app loaded from your local machine
into the workspace. This will only work when loading the agent workspace on your
local machine that has the app running on it. If you want to be able to load your
app from any browser / computer, then you must deploy your app somewhere that is
internet accessible.

Assuming the logging was included from the code snippet above, you should see the
following in the console log of your browser’s dev tools when you open your app in
the workspace.

```

App initialized:  00420d405e

```

When your app is closed, for example, by closing the tab in the agent workspace,
you should see the following series of logs entries.

```

> App destroyed: begin
> App being destroyed
> App destroyed
> App destroyed: end

```

If you see these, then your app correctly integrates with the _Amazon Connect Amazon Connect SDK_ and the [The create event in Amazon Connect Agent Workspace](integrating-with-agent-workspace-lifecycle-events-create.md) / [The destroy event in Amazon Connect Agent Workspace](integrating-with-agent-workspace-lifecycle-events-destroy.md) destroy
lifecycle events.
