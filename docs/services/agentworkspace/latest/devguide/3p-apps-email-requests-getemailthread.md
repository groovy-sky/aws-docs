# Get a list of email contacts in an email contact's tree in Amazon Connect Agent Workspace

Returns an array of EmailThreadContact objects (for the provided
contactAssociationId) that represent that contact's email thread. The
contactAssociationId is the root contact id which is used as a unique identifier for
all subsequent contacts in a contact tree. Returns an object that includes:

- `contacts: EmailThreadContact[]`: an array of EmailThreadContact
objects, each an email contact in the thread

- `nextToken?: string`: The token for the next set of results; use
the value returned in the previous response in the next request to retrieve the
next set of results

**Usage**

```typescript

const inboundEmailData = await emailClient.getEmailData({
   contactId: sampleContactId, // The inbound email contact you've accepted (or is still connecting)
   activeContactId: sampleContactId, // The email contact you're actively working; in this example, its the same as the accepted inbound email
});

const emailThreadContacts = await emailClient.getEmailThread({
  contactAssociationId: inboundEmailData.contactAssociationId,
});

// OPTIONAL: Filter out contacts that have been transferred to avoid displaying duplicated email content
const previousContactIdsSet = new Set(
    emailThreadContacts
        .map(emailThreadContact => emailThreadContact.previousContactId)
        .filter(Boolean)
);

const filteredEmailContactsInEmailThread = emailThreadContacts.filter(emailContact =>
    emailContact.contactId === sampleContactId ||
    !previousContactIdsSet.includes(emailContact.contactId)
);
```

###### Note

Each time an email contact is transferred, a new contact ID is created with
initiationMethod === 'TRANSFER' and its previousContactId is the contact id
before the transfer. You may optionally filter out these transferred contacts to
avoid duplicate content when rendering the email thread.
