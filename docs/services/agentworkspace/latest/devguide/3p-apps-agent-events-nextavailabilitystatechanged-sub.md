# Subscribe a callback function when an Connect Customer agent workspace agent's next queued availability state changes

Subscribes a callback function to be invoked whenever the agent's next queued
availability state changes in the Connect Customer agent workspace. The next state
is the availability state that is queued to apply once all of the agent's active
contacts are cleared. This event fires when a new next state is queued, when a
queued next state is replaced, or when a queued next state is cleared.

**Signature**

```typescript

onNextAvailabilityStateChanged(handler: NextAvailabilityStateChangedHandler)

```

**Usage**

```typescript

const handler: NextAvailabilityStateChangedHandler = async (data: NextAgentAvailabilityStateChanged) => {
    console.log("Next availability state changed! " + data.nextState?.name);
};

agentClient.onNextAvailabilityStateChanged(handler);

// NextAgentAvailabilityStateChanged Structure
{
  nextState: AgentState | null;
  previous?: {
    nextState: AgentState;
  };
}

```

**Permissions required:**
