# List the contact-handling security profile permissions for the agent in Connect Customer agent workspace

Returns the list of contact-handling security profile permissions granted to
the agent currently logged in to the Connect Customer agent workspace. Each
permission is returned as a string identifier (for example,

contact-handling functionality based on what the agent is authorized to do.

```typescript

async listSecurityProfilePermissions(): Promise<string[]>
