# Creating cost categories

Cost allocation helps you map and assign your AWS Cloud costs to the correct groups
within your organization. To allocate these costs, create cost categories. Cost categories are available only to management accounts of AWS Organizations. When you use billing transfer, each management account (bill transfer and bill source) can configure cost categories only for accounts in its own AWS Organizations.Cost
categories are composed of rules.

There are two types of rules:

1. Rules to group costs

2. Rules to split costs

**Rules to group costs**

Define rules to group costs by using one or more of the following
dimensions:

- Accounts

- Cost allocation tags

- Charge Type, such as credits and refunds

- Service

- Region

- Usage Type, such as BoxUsage:t2.micro

- Billing Entity, such as AWS and AWS Marketplace

Rules are evaluated in the order in which they're defined.

###### Example: Rules to group costs

Your engineering department has projects
`Alpha` and
`Beta`, and the marketing department has
project `Gamma`.

All resources are tagged with the project name that they're used for,
such as `Project:Alpha`,
`Project:Beta`, or
`Project:Gamma`.

You create a cost category named `Department`
to allocate costs to the `Marketing` and
`Engineering` departments. For the
`Department` cost category, you define your
rules as:

- Rule 1: If a cost has a cost allocation tag of
`Project:Alpha` or
`Project:Beta`, then assign the
cost to
`Department:Engineering`.

- Rule 2: If a cost has a cost allocation tag of
`Project:Gamma`, then assign the
cost to `Department:Marketing`.

You can also provide a default name for uncategorized costs. In this
example, costs associated with untagged resources should be allocated to
the `IT` department

- Rule 1: If a cost has a cost allocation tag of
`Project:Alpha` or
`Project:Beta`, then assign the
cost to
`Department:Engineering`.

- Rule 2: If a cost has a cost allocation tag of
`Project:Gamma`, then assign the
cost to `Department:Marketing`.

- For all other costs, assign it to
`Department:IT`.

In this example, the cost category name is
`Department`. The cost category values are
`Engineering`,
`Marketing`, and
`IT`.

**Rules to split costs**

Costs that are allocated to one cost category value can be split among
others. In this example, if `IT` costs should be
split between `Engineering` and
`Marketing` departments in a 70:30 ratio, you
can define a split charge rule to perform that allocation.

When you create your cost category, you can provide additional details
such as:

- **Effective Date** – Set the start date
for your cost category. By default, this date will be set to the
current month. If you choose a prior month, your cost category rules
are then applied retroactively from that date.

- **Tags** – To control access to who can
edit this cost category, add a tag to the cost category. You then
update your IAM policy to allow or deny access to that cost
category. For example, you can add a tag
`Role:Administrator` to your cost
categories and then update an IAM policy to explicitly allow
specific roles access to cost categories that have that tag.

Dy default, regular accounts and the management account in AWS Organizations have access to
create cost categories.

###### Tip

To request a backfill of your cost data in your AWS Cost and Usage Report, create a support case. In your support case, specify the report name and the billing period that you want backfilled. For more information, see [Contacting Support](billing-get-answers.md#billing-support).

Use the following procedure to create a cost category. After you create a cost
category, wait up to 24 hours for your usage records to be updated with the cost
category values.

###### To create a cost category

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

02. In the navigation pane, choose
     **Cost Categories**.

03. Choose **Create cost category**. You can use the cost
     preview panel as reference as you update your rules.

04. Next to **Group your costs**, enter the name of your
     cost category. Your cost category name must be unique within your
     account.

05. Use either the **Rule Builder** or **JSON**
    **editor** to define your cost categories.

    For more information about the JSON request syntax, see the [Cost category](../../../../reference/aws-cost-management/latest/apireference/api-costcategory.md) section in the
     _AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference_

06. For **Rule builder**, choose **Add**
    **rule**.

07. Choose **Rule type**, either **Manually define how to**
    **group costs (Regular rule)** or **Automatically group costs**
    **by account or tag (Inherit rule)**.

08. For regular rule, choose if your costs meets **all** or
     **any** of the conditions.

09. Choose a billing **Dimension** from the list.
    1. For a regular rule type, you can choose **Accounts**,
        **Service**, **Charge Type** (for
        example, `recurring reservation fee`),
        **Tag key**, **Region**,
        **Usage Type**, **Cost Category**,
        or **Billing Entity**. (You can choose **Cost**
       **Category** to create hierarchical relationships among your
        cost categories.)

    2. For an inherited value rule type, you can choose
        **Account** or **Tag key**
        (Cost allocation tags key).
10. For a regular rule type, choose **Operator** from the
     dropdown list. Your options are **Is**,
     **Contains**, **Starts with**, and
     **Ends with**.

    ###### Note

    **Contains**, **Starts with**, and
    **Ends with** are only supported with Accounts and Tag
    dimensions. If you use these operators with Accounts, the engine evaluates
    against account name, and not account ID.

11. Choose a filtered value or enter your own value for your
     **Dimension** in the attribute selector.

    ###### Note

    The **Account** dimension uses account names, not account
    IDs for the inherited cost category value.

12. Choose **Add a condition** as needed and repeat steps 9 -
     11.

13. For **Group costs together as**, enter a cost category
     value.

14. Choose **Create rule**.

15. (Optional) Add a default value. It categorizes all unmatched costs to this
     value.

16. (Optional) To rearrange the rule order, use the arrows or change the number on
     the top right of each rule.

    Rules are processed in order. If there are multiple rules that match the line
     item, then the first rule to match is used to determine that cost category
     value.

17. (Optional) To remove a rule, select the rule and choose
     **Delete**.

18. Choose **Next**.

19. (Optional) To split your cost, choose **Add a split**
    **charges**. For more information about split charge rules, see [Splitting charges within cost categories](splitcharge-cost-categories.md).
    1. Choose **Add a split charge**.

    2. Under **Source value**, choose your cost category
        value.

    3. Under **Target values**, choose one or more
        cost category values you wish to allocate split charges to.

    4. Under **Charge allocation method**, choose how you
        want to allocate your costs. Your choices are
        **proportional**, **fixed**, and
        **even split**.

    5. For **fixed** charge allocation, enter the percentage
        amount to allocate each target cost category value.

    6. Repeat step 19 as needed.
20. Choose **Next**.

21. (Optional) To add a lookback period for your cost category rules, choose
     the month from when you want to retroactively apply the rules.

22. (Optional) To add a tag, choose **Add new resource tag** and
     enter a key and value.

23. Choose **Create cost category**.

## Understanding the cost preview panel

The cost preview panel shows you in real time how your costs group together or
split apart as you create or update your cost categories rules. The results you
see in the cost preview panel is an estimate based on your month-to-date net
amortized cost.

Here are some things to keep in mind as you use the cost preview panel:

- The cost preview results might not be accurate if your rules have complex
conditions. For example, containing too many matched values with
`Contains`, `Starts With`, `Ends With`
operators.

For a more precise results, save your rules and check the
cost categories details page.

- If your rules are too complex or takes too long to calculate in real time,
the preview will not show a cost breakdown.
