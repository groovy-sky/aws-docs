# Setting up your India billing

If you sign up for a new account and choose India for your contact and billing address,
your user agreement is with Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (AWS India), a local AWS seller in India. AWS India
manages your billing, and your invoice total is listed in rupees instead of dollars.

## Changing the seller of record to or from AWS India

You can change your AWS account seller of record (SOR) of your AWS account to another SOR by updating your billing or tax information. This does not apply if your AWS India account is operating in the legacy model where the functionality isn't available. When you edit your country or region in your AWS account billing or tax details,
the SOR for your account will automatically change if the service provider of the new location is
different from your current location.

If you're changing your account to or from AWS India, you do not need to update your
default payment method if it is set to invoice or wire transfer. If your default payment
method is credit or debit card, you are required to reconfirm your default payment card
details. This is to ensure the payment method is stored separately from the transactions
outside of AWS India. For more information, see [Viewing eligible credit or debit cards for AWS India invoices](edit-aispl-payment-method.md#aispl-payment-view).

###### Note

If you have an AWS India account with a credit or debit card as your default payment
method and you have e-mandate set up for automatic payments, you must deactivate the
e-mandate before you can edit your default payment preferences.

To change the SOR of your AWS account, you can edit this information using the
following options:

To change the SOR using billing information

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Payment**
**preferences**.

3. In the **Default payment preferences** section,
    choose **Edit**.

4. Enter the new billing address.

5. In the **Payment currency** section, choose a
    default currency from the list of accepted currencies of your new
    SOR.

6. (If your default payment method is credit or debit card) Under the
    **Confirm payment method** section, reenter the
    details of your default payment card to confirm usage under the new
    service provider.

To change default cards under the new SOR, add your card at a
    later time and change your default payment method setting.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

After a few minutes, your changes including the updated SOR appears on the
**Payment preferences** page.

To change the SOR using billing and tax information

To move your account to a different SOR, you must update the tax
registration number (TRN) associated with the account and provide a new,
valid TRN. You can also delete the TRN associated with the account. The new
SOR of your account automatically resolves based on the country of your new
tax address, and your current billing address, in order of availability and
priority. When your account’s SOR changes, you will receive a notification
that your account is moving in or out of AWS India.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. On the navigation pane, choose **Tax**
**Settings**.

3. Select your account and choose **Manage tax**
**registration**, then choose either
    **Edit**, **Edit all**, or
    **Delete TRN**.

4. (If your default payment method is credit or debit card) On the
    navigation pane, choose **Payment**
**preferences**.

5. Choose **Add payment method** to reenter the
    details of your default payment card, or add a new payment
    card.

6. After the card is saved, choose **Set as**
**default**.

The **Default payment preferences** section alerts you
that your previous default payment method is not eligible for use in the new
SOR. Refresh the page after you add your payment card for this alert to
disappear.

If you're unable to change the SOR using the preceding procedures, your account is likely operating in the legacy model where the functionality isn't available. We are currently migrating AWS India account from the legacy to the new model where the functionality is available. The expected completion date is December 2025.
