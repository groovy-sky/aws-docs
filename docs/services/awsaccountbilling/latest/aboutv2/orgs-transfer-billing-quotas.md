# Quotas

Billing transfer quotas are managed using AWS Service Quotas. You can view your current quota values and request increases to some of these values by visiting [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas). The following are the default maximums for billing transfer entities.

The following are the _default_ maximums for billing transfer entities.

## Maximum values

**Terms and concepts**

The following are terms and concepts for billing transfers:

- **Inbound billing**: Billing transfers that allow you to manage and pay for another organization’s consolidated bill.

- **Outbound billing**: Billing transfers that allow an account outside your organization to manage and pay your consolidated bill.

- **Bill-transfer chain**: A collection of billing transfers that are interconnected (for example, Organization A transfers to Organization B, and Organization B transfers to Organization C).

###### Note

- These quotas apply only to actions performed from the AWS Organizations management account.

- AWS Organizations is a global service that is physically hosted in the US East (N. Virginia) Region ( `us-east-1`). Therefore, you must use `us-east-1` to access these quotas when using the Service Quotas console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.
