## Service version index file definitions

The following list defines the terms in the service version index file.

change from `v1` to `v2`.

**disclaimer**

Any disclaimers that apply to the service version index file.

**publicationDate**

The date and time in UTC format when a service version index file was published. For
example, `2023-03-28T23:47:21Z`.

**offerCode**

A unique code for the product of an AWS service. For example,
`AmazonRDS` or `AmazonS3`.

**currentVersion**

The latest version number of the AWS service. For example,
`20230328234721`.

**versions**

The list of available versions for this AWS service.

**versions:version**

A unique code for the version of a price list for an
AWS service. This is used as the lookup key in the versions list.
For example, `20230328234721`,

**versions:version:versionEffectiveBeginDate**

The start date and time in UTC format, which this version is
effective. For example, `2023-03-28T23:47:21Z`.

**versions:version:versionEffectiveEndDate**

The end date and time in UTC format, which this version is
