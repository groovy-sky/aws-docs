# Rollingback your bulk migration policy changes

You can rollback all policy changes you make during the bulk migration process safely, using the steps provided in the bulk migration tool. The rollback feature works at an account-level. You can rollback policy updates for all accounts, or specific groups of migrated accounts. However, you can't rollback changes for specific policies in an account.

###### To rollback bulk migration changes

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

2. In the search bar at the top of the page, enter `Bulk Policy Migrator`.

3. On the **Manage new IAM actions** page, choose the **Rollback changes** tab.

4. Select any accounts to rollback. The accounts must have `Migrated` showing in the **Rollback status** column.

5. Choose **Rollback changes** button.

6. Remain on the console page until rollback is complete.
