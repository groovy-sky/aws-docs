# Managing ACH direct debit
<a name="manage-ach-debit"></a>

You can add a US bank account to your AWS account to make payments by ACH direct debit. You can use any personal or business bank account, provided that the account is located at a bank in the United States and payments are in USD.

We offer two ways to add a US bank account. You can link your bank account through your online banking credentials for immediate verification, or you can manually enter your bank account and routing number.

If you pay by ACH direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and initiates the charge to your payment method within 10 days of the start of the month. It can take up to 20 days for the payment to complete successfully, even if the payment shows as **Succeeded** in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console.

You can use the [Payment preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentpreferences) page of the AWS Billing and Cost Management console to perform the following US bank account tasks:

**Topics**
+ [Link your bank account to your AWS payment methods](#link-ach-bank-account)
+ [Manually add a direct debit account to your AWS payment methods](#manually-add-ach-bank-account)
+ [Update your direct debit account information](#update-ach-bank-account)

## Link your bank account to your AWS payment methods
<a name="link-ach-bank-account"></a>

You can link your US bank account to your AWS account by signing in to your bank account. This verifies your ownership of the bank account immediately, so you do not need to manually enter your routing and account numbers.

We work with Finicity, a Mastercard company, to connect to your bank and securely verify ownership of your bank account. An encrypted end-to-end connection protects your information during this one-time validation process. We only use your personal data to verify that you own the connected bank account.<a name="link-ach-bank-account-steps"></a>

**To link your bank account**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Payment preferences**.

1. Choose **Add payment method**.

1. For **Bank account setup method**, choose **Link your bank account**.

1. Select your bank from the provided options.

1. Sign in to your bank account. Use the credentials for your bank account, not the credentials for your AWS account. Your connection is encrypted and your credentials are protected. We don't access or store your online banking credentials.
**Note**
Your bank might ask that you sign in your account with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

1. (Optional) For **Set as default payment method**, select whether you want this direct debit account to be your default payment method.

1. For **Billing address information**, enter the billing address of the primary account owner.

1. (Optional) Enter the tag key and value. You can add up to 50 tags. For more information on tags, see [Manage payment method access using tags](manage-payments-tags.md).

1. Choose **Add payment method** to agree to the **Terms and Conditions** and add your bank account. Your bank account is now verified and added to your AWS payment methods.

**Note**
Your online banking credentials stay with your bank. We do not access or store them. Your bank might ask for your consent to share additional information. We can confirm your ownership of the bank account and charge your bank account after we first collect this information. Our access to this information will expire based on local regulations and your bank's policy.
To remove direct debit payments from your account, see [Remove a payment method](manage-payment-method.md#manage-remove-credit).
