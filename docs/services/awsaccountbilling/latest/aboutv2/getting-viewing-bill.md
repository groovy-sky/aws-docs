# Understanding your bill

_**For questions about your AWS bills or to appeal your charges, contact Support to address your inquiries immediately. To get help, see [Getting help with your bills and payments](billing-get-answers.md). To understand your bills page contents, see [Using the Bills page to understand your monthly charges and invoice](#invoice).**_

###### Note

If your AWS organization uses billing transfer, contact the bill transfer account owner first because they control your cost data and receive your AWS invoices. To find the bill transfer account information, go to the **billing transfer** page, **Outbound billing** tab.

You receive AWS invoices monthly for usage charges and recurring fees. For one-time
fees, such as fees for purchasing an All Upfront Reserved Instance, you're charged
immediately.

At any time, you can view estimated charges for the current month and final charges for
previous months. This topic describes how to view your monthly bill and past bills, how to
receive and read billing reports, and how to download invoices. To make a payment, see [Making payments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-making-a-payment.html).

## Viewing your monthly charges

Follow this procedure to view your monthly charges from the Billing and Cost Management console.

###### To view your monthly charges

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Bills**.

3. Choose a **Billing period** (for example, August
    2023).

4. View your AWS bill summary.

###### To view your monthly charges

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. In the navigation pane, choose [Bills](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home).

3. For **Billing period**, choose a month.

The **Summary** section displays a summary and
    details of your charges for that month.

###### Note

The summary isn't an invoice until the month's activity closes and
AWS calculates the final charges.

If you use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations, the
    **Bills** page lists totals for all accounts on the
    **Charges by account** tab. Choose the account ID
    to see the activity for each account in the organization. For more
    information about consolidated billing, see [Consolidating billing for AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html).

## Using the Bills page to understand your monthly charges and invoice

At the end of a monthly billing period, or when you incur a one-time fee, AWS issues
an invoice as a PDF file. If you're paying by credit card, AWS also charges the credit
card that you have on file at this time.

To download invoices and view your monthly charge details, you can use the
**Bills** page in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console.

If you use billing transfer and sign in to the **Bills** page with a bill source account or its linked accounts, the bill transfer account controls the cost data. The **Bills** page doesn't show invoices for the bill source account or its linked accounts because these are sent to the bill transfer account. The bill transfer account sees separate invoices for each bill source account on the **Bills** page.

###### Note

IAM users need explicit permission to access some of the pages in the Billing and Cost Management
console. For more information, see [Overview of managing access permissions](control-access-billing.md).

**Bills page**

You can use the **Bills** page to see your monthly
chargeable costs, along with details of your AWS services and purchases
made through AWS Marketplace. Invoices are generated when a monthly billing period
closes (the billing status appears as **Issued**), or when
subscriptions or one-time purchases are made. For monthly billing periods
that haven't closed (the billing status appears as
**Pending**), this page shows the most recent estimated
charges based on your AWS services metered to date.

If you're signed in as the management account of your AWS Organizations, you can see
the consolidated charges for your member accounts. You can use the
**Charges by account** to also view account-level
details.

When you sign in as a management account that uses AWS Billing Conductor, you can view pro forma costs for your billing groups by activating billing view mode and selecting a billing group view. If you use billing transfer and you sign in as a bill transfer account, you can view pro forma costs for AWS Organizations that transfer their billing to your account by enabling billing view mode and selecting a billing transfer showback or chargeback view. When you sign in as a bill source account, the bill transfer account controls the cost data shown on the **Bills** page.

For more information about pro forma data, see [What is pro forma billing data?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/understanding-proforma.html) in the _AWS Billing Conductor User Guide_.

To customize the visible sections, choose the gear icon at the top of the
page. These preferences are saved for ongoing visits to the
**Bills** page.

**AWS bill summary**

The **AWS bill summary** section shows an overview of
your monthly charges. The information shows your invoice totals for the
closed billing periods (the billing status appears as
**Issued**).

Billing periods that haven't closed have the
**Pending** billing status. The totals show the most
recent estimated charges based on your AWS services metered to date.
Totals are shown in US dollars (USD). If your invoices are issued in another
currency, the total in the other currency is also shown.

**Payment information**

The **Payment information**
section lists invoices for the selected billing period that AWS received
payments for. You can find the service provider, charge types, document
types, invoice IDs, payment status, the date AWS received the payments,
and the total amount in USD. If your invoices are issued in another
currency, the total in the other currency is also shown. For more
information, see [Managing Your Payments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-payments.html).

**Highest cost by service provider**

The **Highest cost by service provider** section
identifies your account's service and AWS Region with the highest cost for
the billing period, and shows the month-over-month trends for each. For
pending billing periods, the month-over-month trend compares the
month-to-date spend in the current billing period with the equivalent
portion of the previous billing period.

**Charges by service**

The **Charges by service** tab
shows your spend in each AWS service. You can sort by service name or
amount in USD, and filter by service name and Region. Choose the
`+` icon next to each service to see the charges for that
service by **Region**. Choose a **Region**
to see charge details.

**Charges by account**

If you use AWS Organizations and signed in to your
management account, the **Charges by account** tab shows the
spend of each of your member accounts. You can sort by account ID, account
name, or amount in USD, and filter by account ID or account name. Choose the
`+` icon next to each account to see charges for that account
by service provider. Choose the `+` icon next to each line item
to see charges by service and Region. Choose a **Region**
to see charge details.

**Invoices**

The **Invoices** tab lists the
invoices for each service provider that you transacted with during the
selected billing period. This includes details such as charge type, invoice
date, and total in USD. If your invoices are issued in another currency, the
total in the other currency is also shown. To view and download a PDF format
for individual invoices, choose the **Invoice ID**.

When you sign in as a bill transfer account, you can view invoices for AWS Organizations that transfer their bills to you. You receive one invoice for each organization. When you sign in as a bill source account, the bill transfer account controls the cost data shown on the **Bills** page. You don't receive AWS invoices while billing transfer is active.

**Savings**

The **Savings** tab summarizes
your savings during the billing period as the outcome of Savings Plans, credits, or
other discount programs. These savings are also reflected in the
**Charges by service**, **Charges by**
**account**, and **Invoices** tabs. Choose each
savings type to see the details by service.

**Taxes by service**

The **Taxes by service** tab
shows the pre-tax, tax, and post-tax charges for each service that was
charged taxes. You can sort by service name, post-tax charge, pre-tax
charge, or tax in USD, and filter by service name.

**Tax Invoices and Supplemental Documents**

The **Tax Invoices and Supplemental**
**Documents** section lists tax invoices and other supplemental
documents for the selected billing period. Not all service providers issue
tax invoices. The **Invoice ID** column shows the
associated commercial invoice associated with that tax invoice. To view and
download a PDF format for individual invoices, choose the **Document**
**ID**.
