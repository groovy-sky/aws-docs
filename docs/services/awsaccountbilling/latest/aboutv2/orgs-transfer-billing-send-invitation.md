# Sending invitations

When you sign in to your organization's management account, you can invite the management
account of another organization to designate your account to manage and pay their
consolidated bill.

## Considerations

**Only management accounts can send invitations**

Invitations can only be sent between management accounts.

**Invitations are unidirectional**

Only the account that will manage and pay for the consolidated bill (bill-transfer
account) can send invitations. Bill-source accounts cannot send invitations asking other
accounts to manage and pay for their consolidated bill.

**Invitations must be accepted before the start**
**date**

Invites must be accepted 24 hours before the billing transfer start date. For example,
an invitation with a start date of May 1st, needs to be accepted by April 29th 6:59:59PM
Eastern Standard Time (11:59:59 PM UTC), which is two days before the start date.

**Transfers start at the beginning of month**

If an invitation is accepted, the start date is 00:00:00 UTC on the first day of the month specified in the invitation (for Eastern Standard Time this is 7:00 PM on the evening before the first day of the month).

## Send an invitation

To send a billing transfer invitation, complete the following steps.

###### Terms and concepts

The following are terms and concepts used in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console:

- **Inbound billing**: Billing transfers that allow you to
manage and pay for another organization’s consolidated bill.

- **Outbound billing**: Billing transfers that allow an
account outside your organization to manage and pay your consolidated
bill.

###### Minimum permissions

To send an invitation, you must have the following permissions:

- `organizations:InviteOrganizationToTransferResponsibility`

- `billingconductor:CreateBillingGroup`

- `billingconductor:ListPricingPlans`

###### To send an invitation

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. On the left navigation in **Preferences and**
**Settings**, choose **Billing**
**transfers**.

3. On the **Billing transfers** page, select the
    **Inbound billing** tab.

4. On the **Inbound billing** page, choose
    **Send invitation**.

5. On the **Send a billing transfer invitation**
    page, enter the following information:

- **Name:** Name you want to
assign to the transfer.

###### Note

When you use two-level billing transfer as a bill
receiver account, you can control the names only for
your direct transfers. The bill transfer accounts
control transfer names for their bill source accounts.
For distribution partners, we recommend using your
downstream sellers' names consistently for each billing
transfer. This helps you search for all billing
transfers associated with a specific downstream
seller.

- **Email address or account ID of the**
**AWS management account:** Account you want to
invite. This must be the management account of an
organization.

- **Monthly billing period**
**start:** Start date when your account will
begin managing and paying for their consolidated bills. It
can be either the first day of the next month or two months
in the future.

###### Note

The start date is the first day of the month you
select. Transfers begin on the start date regardless of
the date the invitation is accepted. Invitations expire
at 8 PM Eastern Standard Time two days before the start
date.

- **Pricing configuration:**
Pricing seen by the _bill-source account_
once the transfer begins.

- **(Optional) Message to include in the**
**request**: Text included in the email sent to
the management account. For example, "Hello account owner,
I'd like to pay your organization's consolidated
bill."

- **(Optional) Add new tags**:
Specify one or more tags that are automatically applied to
the inbound transfer. To do this, choose **Add**
**tag** and then enter a key and an optional
value. Leaving the value blank sets it to an empty string;
it isn't `null`. You can attach up to 50 tags to
an inbound transfer.

6. On the **Send a billing transfer invitation**
    page, choose **Send invitation**.
