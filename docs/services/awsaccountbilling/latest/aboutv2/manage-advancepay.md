# Using Advance Pay
<a name="manage-advancepay"></a>

**Note**
*Advance Pay is in public preview for AWS Billing and Cost Management and is subject to change. This feature is available for a select group of customers. Your use of advance pay is subject to the Betas and Previews terms of the [AWS Service Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) (Section 2).*
When you use billing transfer, Advance Pay funds from your bill source account don't apply to bill transfer account payments. Contact Support for help with Advance Pay while billing transfer is active.

Use *Advance Pay* to pay for your AWS usage in advance. AWS uses the funds to pay for your invoices automatically when they're due. Your default payment method is used when you don't have Advance Pay balance available.

You can register for Advance Pay in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. You can add funds to Advance Pay by using electronic fund transfer. AWS Inc. customers can add funds using any personal or business bank account with a US branch location. To use Advance Pay in Europe, your account requires an AWS Europe invoice.

**Notes**
You can use Advance Pay if your seller of record (SOR) is AWS Inc. (USD only) or AWS Europe (USD, EUR, or GBP). If you don’t see the **Advance Pay** tab, this can be for the following reasons:
You have a different SOR for your AWS account. To find your SOR, go to the **Payment preferences** page and under your default payment method, see the name under **Service provider**. You can also find this information in the **Tax settings** page, under the **Seller** column.
If you’re a member account that is part of an organization, only the management account (also called the payer account) can use Advance Pay.
Advance Pay isn’t available in AWS GovCloud (US).
For a full list of service restrictions for Advance Pay, see [Advance Pay](billing-limits.md#limits-ap).
