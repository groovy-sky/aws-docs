# Migrating access control for AWS Billing

###### Note

The following AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions have reached the end of standard support on July 2023:

- `aws-portal` namespace

- `purchase-orders:ViewPurchaseOrders`

- `purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders`

If you're using AWS Organizations, you can use the [bulk policy migrator scripts](migrate-iam-permissions.md) or bulk policy migrator to update
polices from your payer account. You can also use the [old to granular action\
mapping reference](migrate-granularaccess-iam-mapping-reference.md) to verify the IAM actions that need to be added.

If you have an AWS account, or are a part of an AWS Organizations created on or after
March 6, 2023, 11:00 AM (PDT), the fine-grained actions are already in effect in your
organization.

You can use fine-grained access controls to provide individuals in your organization access to AWS Billing and Cost Management services. For example, you can provide access to Cost Explorer without providing access to the Billing and Cost Management console.

To use the fine-grained access controls, you'll need to migrate your policies from under `aws-portal` to the new IAM actions.

The following IAM actions in your permission policies or service control policies (SCP)
require updating with this migration:

- `aws-portal:ViewAccount`

- `aws-portal:ViewBilling`

- `aws-portal:ViewPaymentMethods`

- `aws-portal:ViewUsage`

- `aws-portal:ModifyAccount`

- `aws-portal:ModifyBilling`

- `aws-portal:ModifyPaymentMethods`

- `purchase-orders:ViewPurchaseOrders`

- `purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders`

To learn how to use the **Affected policies** tool to identify your impacted IAM policies, see [How to use the affected policies tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/migrate-security-iam-tool.html).

###### Note

API access to AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Cost and Usage Reports, and AWS Budgets remains unaffected.

[Activating access to the Billing and Cost Management console](control-access-billing.md#ControllingAccessWebsite-Activate) remain unchanged.

## Managing access permissions

AWS Billing integrates with the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service so that you can control
who in your organization can access specific pages on the [Billing and Cost Management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing). This includes
features like Payments, Billing, Credits, Free Tier, Payment preferences, Consolidated
billing, Tax settings, and Account pages.

Use the following IAM permissions for granular control for the Billing and Cost Management console.

To provide fine-grained access, replace the `aws-portal` policy with
`account`, `billing`, `payments`,
`freetier`, `invoicing`, `tax`, and `consolidatedbilling`.

Additionally, replace `purchase-orders:ViewPurchaseOrders` and
`purchase-orders:ModifyPurchaseOrders` with the fine-grained actions
under `purchase-orders`, `account`, and
`payments`.

### Using fine-grained AWS Billing actions

This table summarizes the permissions that allow or deny IAM users and roles
access to your billing information. For examples of policies that use these
permissions, see [AWS Billing policy examples](billing-example-policies.md).

For a list of actions for the AWS Cost Management console, see [AWS Cost Management actions policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/billing-permissions-ref.html#user-permissions) in the _AWS Cost Management User_
_Guide_.
