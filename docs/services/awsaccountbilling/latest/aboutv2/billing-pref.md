# Customizing your Billing preferences

You can use the **AWS Billing preferences** page to manage your invoice
delivery, alerts, credit sharing, Reserved Instances (RI) and Savings Plans discount sharing, and
detailed billing (legacy) reports. For some sections, only the payer account can update
them. If you use billing transfer, the preferences set up in the bill transfer account apply to all AWS Organizations that transfer their bills.

You can assign user permissions to view the **Billing**
**preferences** page. For more information, see [Using fine-grained AWS Billing actions](migrate-granularaccess-whatis.md#migrate-user-permissions).

The Billing preferences page contains the following sections.

Changing the sharing preferences of Reserved Instances and Savings Plans in your AWS organization, will impact your AWS bills. This also applies to customers opted in Billing Conductor or billing transfer.

## Savings Plans and Reserved Instances discount sharing preferences

Reserved Instances (RI) and (SP) discount sharing allows you to control how commitment-based discounts
are distributed across accounts in your AWS Organizations. This feature helps you align cost savings with your
organizational structure and business requirements.

###### Note

This section is only available for the management account (payer account) in AWS Organizations.

If you use billing transfer, the management account (not the bill transfer account) controls the credit sharing preferences.

### Understanding Sharing Options

You can choose from three sharing preference options:

Sharing TypeDescriptionUse CaseOpen sharingDiscounts are available to all sharing-activated accounts within the organization (default)Cost optimization across your entire organizationPrioritized group sharingDiscounts apply to the purchasing account first, then within defined groups, then to remaining sharing-activated accounts within the organizationBalance between group control and organization-wide optimizationRestricted group sharingDiscounts are exclusively shared within defined groups onlyStrict cost allocation by business unit or department

### Managing Basic Discount Sharing

###### To activate or deactivate discount sharing for accounts:

1. Open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Billing preferences**

3. In the **Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discount sharing preference** section, choose **Edit**

4. Select accounts from the table and choose **Activate** or **Deactivate**

5. Choose **Update**

###### Tip

- **Default sharing for newly created member accounts**: Automatically activates sharing for new accounts joining your organization

- **Download preference history (CSV)**: Export a history of your sharing preference changes

### Setting Up Group Sharing

Group sharing requires creating Cost Categories to define your sharing groups.

###### Step 1: Configure sharing preferences

1. Open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Billing preferences**

3. In the **Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discount sharing preferences** section, choose **Edit**

4. Select either:

- **Prioritized group sharing** (first within groups, then beyond)

- **Restricted group sharing** (only within groups)

###### Step 2: Create Cost Categories for sharing groups

1. Under **Cost Category**, select an existing category or choose **Create Cost Categories**

2. If creating a new Cost Category:

1. Enter a **Cost category name** (for example, "Business Units", "Geographic Regions")

2. For each sharing group, add a rule:

1. Select the **Linked accounts** for this group

2. Enter a **SP/RI group sharing name** (for example, "Research and Development", "EMEA Operations") in the **Then group costs together as field**

3. Choose **Create Rule**.

3. Use **Add new rule** for additional groups

4. Choose **Next** through the remaining steps without making changes.

5. Choose **Create cost category**.

3. Return to **Billing preferences** and select your Cost Category

4. Review the impact warning and choose **Proceed**

5. Select your implementation preference:

- **Create estimate and update later**: Simulate impact before applying

- **Update and create estimate later**: Apply changes immediately

6. Choose **Update**

###### Important Considerations

###### Group Configuration Rules

- Each account can belong to only one sharing group

- The management account cannot belong to any sharing group

- Groups must be mutually exclusive with no overlapping accounts

###### Billing Impact

- **Optimization trade-off**: Group sharing might reduce overall discount optimization as it prioritizes group allocation over maximum savings

- **Timing**: You can change your preference at any time. Each estimated bill is computed by using the last set of preferences. The final bill for the month is calculated based on the preferences set at 23:59:59 UTC time on the last day of the month.

- **Savings Plans requirement**: The Savings Plans owner account must be active in discount sharing preferences

###### Best Practices

- Use the Pricing Calculator integration to simulate billing impact before implementation

- Start with open sharing to maximize savings, then move to group sharing if organizational requirements demand it

- Regularly review and adjust groups as your organization evolves

### Modifying Existing Groups

1. Open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Cost Categories**.

3. Select the Cost Category that you want to modify.

4. Choose **Edit**.

5. Update group membership or create new groups following the same process above

methods will not be supported at a later date.
