## Navigating to your cost category details page

You can choose any cost category name in the Billing and Cost Management console to open a details
page. The details page is also shown when you add or edit a
cost category.

###### To view your cost category details page

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Cost categories**.

3. Under the **Cost category** column, choose a
    cost category name.

## Understanding your cost category details page

Your cost category details page breaks down your month-to-date cost
allocations using the **Category details** and **Category**
**values** sections.

- Use the **month selector** on the top right of the page
to change the month you're viewing. You can see a detailed breakdown of
cost category value cost allocations within your
cost category.

- Under the **Category details** section, you can view your
current [status](manage-cost-categories.md#cost-categories-stat), [default value](manage-cost-categories.md#cost-categories-default-value), value
count, and your total month-to-date net amortized costs.

- The graph under **Categorized costs** shows the
allocation of cost category values in your monthly spend. Any
uncategorized costs are shown as **Uncategorized**.

## Your cost category month-to-date categorizations

In the **Category values** section, you can see the month-to-date
spend for each configured cost category value. The amounts that are shown are
the net amortized costs.

To further explore your costs, open Cost Explorer by choosing **View in**
