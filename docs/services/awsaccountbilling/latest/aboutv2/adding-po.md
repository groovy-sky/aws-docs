# Adding a purchase order

You can use the Billing and Cost Management console to add purchase orders to use in your invoices. Adding a
purchase order is a two-step process involving purchase orders and line item
configurations. First, you enter your purchase order details (for example, purchase
order ID, shipping address, effective and expiration month). Then, you define the
purchase order line item configurations that are used to match the purchase order with
an invoice. If you add multiple purchase orders, we use the purchase order that has the
line item best matching the invoice being generated.

###### To add a purchase order

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

    If you use billing transfer, sign in to your bill transfer account to add a purchase order number to invoices. You can assign one purchase order number to all AWS invoices from organizations that transfer their bills to you.

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Purchase orders**.

03. Choose **Add purchase order**.

04. For **Purchase order ID**, enter a unique identifier for your
     purchase order ID. Purchase order IDs must be unique within your account. For
     details about character restrictions for your purchase ID, see [Purchase orders](billing-limits.md#limits-po).

05. (Optional) For **Description**, describe your purchase order,
     including any notes for your reference.

06. For **Bill from**, choose the AWS billing entity that you
     are invoiced from.

    ###### Note

    Remittance details are different for each **Bill from**
    location. Be sure to verify your **Bill from** selection.
    You must make your payments to the legal entity that you're billed from. We
    don't recommend configuring more than one **Bill from**
    location for a purchase order.

07. (Optional) If your purchase order is invoiced from the **Amazon Web Services**
    **EMEA SARL** billing entity: For **Tax registration**
    **number**, select the tax registration numbers that you want to
     associate with your purchase order. Your purchase order is associated with only
     the invoices generated for the tax registration numbers that you select.

    ###### Note

    The **Tax registration number** selection is available
    for only the **Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL** billing entity. For
    more information on your tax registration number settings, see [Setting up your tax information](manage-account-payment.md).

08. For **Ship to**, enter your shipping address.

    (Optional) Select **Copy Bill to address** to copy and edit
     the address populated from your **Bill to** field.

09. For **Effective month**, choose the billing period when you
     want your purchase order to start. Your purchase order is eligible for invoices
     that are associated with usage, starting from the billing period that you
     specify.

10. For **Expiration month**, choose the billing period when you
     want your purchase order to end. Your purchase order expires at the end of the
     specified billing period. It's not used for invoices that are associated with
     usage after the billing period.

11. (Optional) For **Purchase order contacts**, enter the contact name, email
     address, and phone number. You can add up to 20 contacts.

12. (Optional) Enter the tag key and value. You can add up to 50 tags.

13. Choose **Configure line items**.

14. For **Line item number**, enter a unique identifier for your
     line item number.

15. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a description for your
     line item.

16. For **Line item type**, choose your preferred line item type.
     For a detailed description for each line item type, see [Managing your purchase orders](manage-purchaseorders.md).

17. For **Start month**, choose the month you want your line item
     to start from. This date cannot be earlier than your purchase order
     **Effective month**.

18. For **End month**, choose the month you want your line item
     to end. This date cannot be later than your purchase order **Expiration**
    **month**.

19. (Optional) Choose **Enable balance tracking** to track the
     balance of your line item.

20. For **Amount**, enter the total amount of your purchase order
     line item.

21. For **Quantity**, enter the quantity amount.

22. (Optional) For **Tax**, enter the tax amount. This can be an
     absolute value or a percentage of the line item amount.

    For **Tax type**, choose **% of amount** to
     enter a percentage, or **amount in $** to enter an absolute tax
     amount.

23. To add other line items, choose **Add new line item**. You
     can add up to 100 line items.

24. Choose **Submit purchase order**.

Some fields are automatically filled and cannot be edited. Here is a list of where the

order billing address should match your invoice billing address.
