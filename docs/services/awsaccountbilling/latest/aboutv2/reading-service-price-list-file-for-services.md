as format version and publication date

- Product details – Product metadata that lists the products in a
service price list file, along with product information

- Pricing details (terms) – Prices for all products in this service
price list file

## CSV file

The first five rows of the CSV file contain the metadata for the price list file. The
sixth row has the column names for the products and their attributes, such as
`SKU`, `OfferTermCode`, `RateCode`,
`TermType`, and more.

The number of columns depends on the service. The first few columns contain
the pricing details, and other columns contain the product details for a
service.

## JSON file

The product details and pricing details are in separate sections. The same
product can be offered under multiple terms, and the same term can apply to
multiple products. For example, an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance is available for
an `Hourly` or `Reserved` term. You can use the SKU of a
product to identify the terms that are available for that product.

## Service price list definitions

The following list defines the terms in the service price list files.

**formatVersion**

list file is in. The `formatVersion` of the file is
updated when the structure is changed. For example, the version will
change from `v1` to `v2`.

**disclaimer**

**offerCode**

A unique code for the product of an AWS service. For example,
`AmazonEC2` for Amazon EC2 or `AmazonS3` for
Amazon S3.

**version**

An attribute that tracks the version of the service price list
file. Each time a new file is published, it contains a new version
number. For example, `20150409022205` and
`20150910182105`.

**publicationDate**

The date and time in UTC format when a service price list file was
published. For example, `2015-04-09T02:22:05Z` and
`2015-09-10T18:21:05Z`.

## Product details (products) definitions

This section provides information about products in a service price list file
for an AWS service. Products are indexed by SKU.

**products:sku**

is available only for a price that also lists

`compute` for Amazon EC2 or `storage` for
Amazon S3.

                                    Type`, `Processor`, or `OS`.

**products:sku:attributes:Attribute Value**

`m1.small` (instance type), `xen` (type of
processor), or `Linux` (type of OS).

## Product details (terms) definitions

This section provides information about the prices for products in a service
price list file for an AWS service. Prices are indexed by the terms.
