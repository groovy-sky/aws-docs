# Viewing Billing and Cost Management data as a Bill Transfer account

When the transfer begins, the bill transfer account:

- Receives distinct AWS invoices (for example, distinct consolidated bills) for charges from bill source accounts after the transfer becomes effective. These appear only in the bill transfer account. For more information, see [What is AWS Billing and Cost Management?](billing-what-is.md).

- Controls the cost data visible to the bill source account in the Billing and Cost Management console, using Billing Conductor.

- Gains access to two billing transfer views for each bill source account:

\- My view: Shows the billing data that the bill transfer account is financially responsible for.

\- Showback/chargeback view: Shows billing data configured through Billing Conductor for showback or chargeback purposes using Billing Conductor.

The bill transfer account can access these billing views in Cost Explorer, AWS Cost and Usage Report, Budgets, and Bills page.

###### Note

For both Invoices and Payments, you don’t need to enable the Billing View mode. Payments and invoices are billing view agnostic resources, which means that they are associated with your account, not with a billing view (either your primary view, Billing Transfer - My view, or Billing Transfer Showback/chargeback view.

If you have more than 10 billing views, you will see the **All views** option at the bottom of the drop down. Choose this option to open a modal to navigate across all your billing views.

5. To configure resources (for example, Cost Explorer Saved Reports, Cost and Usage Reports, Budgets) you need to select the specific billing view in scope for the resource you want to create. For more information, see [What is AWS Billing and Cost Management?](billing-what-is.md).
