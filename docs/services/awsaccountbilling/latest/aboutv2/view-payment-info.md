# View remaining invoices, unapplied funds, and payment history
<a name="view-payment-info"></a>

You can use the **Payments account summary** page in your Billing and Cost Management console to see your AWS account's financial status. This section outlines what each console component represents.

If you use transfer billing and you sign in as a bill transfer account, you see payments for charges from AWS Organizations that transfer their bills to you. When you sign in as a bill source account, you see payments for usage that occurred before billing transfer was active.

**Payments account summary**
This page shows your consolidated view of your AWS account's financial status. This includes what you owe AWS and the funds you have available to use. This is a simplified view to understand your payment obligations and manage your available balances.

**Total outstanding balance**
This shows the amount you currently owe, including any invoice amounts that are past due. To make a payment, see [Making payments](manage-making-a-payment.md).

**Total unapplied funds**
This is the total amount of unused funds that are currently available in your AWS account. This might include **unapplied cash**, **credit memos**, or **Advance Pay** balance. Advance Pay balance is automatically used to pay for your invoices. For more information, see [Using Advance Pay](manage-advancepay.md).
Your account might have unapplied funds or credit memos for various reasons, such as past overpayments, missing remittance advice, or billing adjustments. To use unapplied funds or credit memos towards your invoice payments or refund this amount, send the AWS remittance instructions using the email address in your invoice. You can also contact Support by following the instructions in [Contacting Support](billing-get-answers.md#billing-support). After you request to use your unapplied funds, you can pay the total outstanding balance excluding the unapplied funds amount.
**Total unapplied funds** do not include AWS Credits. For more information, see [Applying AWS credits](useconsolidatedbilling-credits.md).

You can search and filter the **Payments due**, **Unapplied funds**, and **Payment history** tables described in the following procedures. Choose the gear icon to change the default columns and customize other table settings. Download items individually by choosing the appropriate ID, or choose **Download**, and then ** Download CSV** to download a CSV file of the table for reporting purposes.<a name="view-outstanding-invoices-procedure"></a>

   The **Unapplied funds** table lists all unapplied credit memos. The table shows your total invoice amount and remaining balance.

   If the status is **Unapplied**, there are available credit memos to be applied to an invoice.

   If the status is **Partially applied**, there are credit memos where some amounts have been applied to a previous invoice.<a name="view-payment-history-procedure"></a>

**To view payment history**

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Payments**.

1. Choose the **Transactions** tab to view the **Transactions** table.

   With the **Transactions** table, you get a single, real-time view to reconcile your payments and understand your account balances. In one place, you can view the status and amounts for your invoices, payments, refunds, credit memos, and unapplied funds (payments not yet applied to an invoice). You can also view adjustments (including adjustment sub-types), enterprise Advance Pay summary, and scheduled payment status. Forgiven invoices and credit memo transactions are also included.

   For each invoice, you can view the payment method used and download the invoice PDF. You can select an invoice to complete a payment. To find specific records, you can filter and sort the table, including by purchase order. If you use transfer billing, the table also reflects your transfer billing activity.

   To see detailed settlement information, choose an ID in the table to open its details page. Details pages are available for invoices, payments, and credit memos. On an invoice details page, you can see all the payments, adjustments, and credit memos, and how each was applied to the invoice.
