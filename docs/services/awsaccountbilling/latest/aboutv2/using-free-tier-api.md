# Using the Free Tier API

[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) offers free usage each month for
AWS services and products. You can use the Free Tier API to programmatically track your
free tier usage against the monthly usage limits.

Use the API to understand when your free usage will change to pay-as-you-go pricing each
month. This helps you avoid unintended charges by comparing forecasted usage to the free
tier limit for each service throughout the month. For example, to know when your usage might
exceed the free offer limit for AWS Glue, you can use the API to track your AWS account
usage. You can then decide whether to keep the service or make any changes before the free
tier limit ends.

You can also use the API to create visualizations or write scripts to automate changes to
AWS resources based on your API responses.

###### Example: Find your free tier offers for AWS Glue

The following AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command uses the `GetFreeTierUsage` API
operation to filter by free tier usage for AWS Glue.

**Request**

```

aws freetier get-free-tier-usage --filter '{"Dimensions": {"Key": "SERVICE", "Values": ["Glue"], "MatchOptions": ["CONTAINS"]}}'
```

**Response**

The following response returns two `Always Free` offers from AWS Glue.

```json
