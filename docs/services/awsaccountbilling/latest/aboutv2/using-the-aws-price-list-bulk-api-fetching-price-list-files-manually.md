You can use the service index file to find available AWS services and Savings Plans that
are provided by the AWS Price List Bulk API.

To download the service index file, navigate to the following URL.

```nohighlight

https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/index.json
```

In the service index file, you can search for the service to find its prices. To
download the service-specific price list file, use either the `offerCode` or
`serviceCode`.

For an AWS service or Savings Plan that you retrieved in [step 1](#fetching-price-list-manually-step-1), you can find all
the historical versions of the price lists by using the [service version index file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/using-the-aws-price-list-bulk-api-reading-price-list-files-reading-service-version-index-file.html).

To download the service version index file, use the
`serviceCode` or `savingsPlanCode`. To find the values for
`serviceCode` and `savingsPlanCode`, see [Step 1: Finding available AWS services](using-the-aws-price-list-bulk-api.md#price-bulk-api-step-1-find-available-services).

To download the service version index file for an AWS service, navigate to the following URL.
Replace `<serviceCode>` with your own
information.

```nohighlight

https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/<serviceCode>/index.json
```

For example, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) appears in a URL like the following URL.

```nohighlight

https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonEC2/index.json
```

###### Note

In addition to the versions available in the service version index file, there
is another version named `current`. The `current` version
points to the latest version of the price list files for a specific AWS service.

To download the latest service version index file for
Savings Plan, specify `savingsPlanCode` and `current` in the
URL. Replace `<savingsPlanCode>` with your own
information.

```nohighlight

https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/savingsPlan/v1.0/aws/<savingsPlanCode>/current/index.json
```

For example, the current version of
`AWSComputeSavingsPlan` appears like the following
URL.

```nohighlight

https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/savingsPlan/v1.0/aws/AWSComputeSavingsPlan/current/index.json
```

For more information, see [Reading the service version index file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/using-the-aws-price-list-bulk-api-reading-price-list-files-reading-service-version-index-file.html).

For a version of an AWS service or Savings Plan in [the previous step](#fetching-price-list-files-manually-step-2),
you can find all the AWS Regions and edge locations in which an AWS service
provides products for purchase.

To download the service Region index file for an AWS service, navigate to the following URL.
Replace `<serviceCode>` and
`<version>` with your own information.

```nohighlight

https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/<serviceCode>/<version>/region_index.json
```

For example, the service code for `AmazonRDS` and its
`current` version has the following URL.

```nohighlight

https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonRDS/current/region_index.json
```

To download the service Region index file for Savings Plan, navigate to the
following URL. Replace `<savingsPlanCode>` with your own
information.

```nohighlight
