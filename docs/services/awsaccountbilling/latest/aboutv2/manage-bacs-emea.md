# Managing your Bacs direct debit payment method
<a name="manage-bacs-emea"></a>

 AWS Europe customers can add a bank account to allow Bacs direct debit payments. You can use any personal or business bank account, provided that the account is located in the UK and payments are made using British pound (GBP).

If you pay by UK direct debit, AWS provides your invoice and initiates the charge to your payment method within three business days. It can take up to six business days for the payment to complete successfully, even if the payment shows as **Succeeded** in the AWS Billing console.

You can use the [Payment preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentpreferences) page of the AWS Billing console to perform the following UK direct debit tasks:

## Verify and link your bank account to your AWS Europe payment methods
<a name="direct-link-verify-account-bacs"></a>

You can verify and link a Bacs direct debit account to your AWS account by signing in to your bank account and approving a penny charge. You must sign in to your bank account to verify ownership of the bank account.

AWS works with TrueLayer to connect to your bank and securely verify ownership of your bank account. Your information is protected with an encrypted end-to-end connection during this one-time validation process. Your personal data won’t be shared or used beyond the purpose of verifying that you're the owner of the connected bank account.

If you don't have access to the bank account sign in credentials, you can create an IAM entity (such as a user or role) for the bank account owner to provide them access to the Billing console. Then, they can update the AWS account payment method. We recommend that you don't share sensitive information, including username, password, or payment methods for your account. For more information, see the following topics:
+ [Overview of managing access permissions](control-access-billing.md)
+ [Best practices to protect your account's root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.html) in the *AWS Account Management Reference Guide*

**To verify and link your bank account**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Payment preferences**.

1. Choose **Add payment method**.

1. Choose **Bacs Direct Debit** and **Choose bank**.

1. Choose your bank from the provided options.

1. Sign in to your bank account to confirm the penny charge. Use the credentials for your bank account, *not* the credentials for your AWS account. Your connection is encrypted and your credentials are protected. AWS won't access or store your online banking credentials.

1. Choose **Confirm payment**. The information that you share will only be used to confirm your ownership of the bank account and to prevent fraud. You will be refunded immediately.

1. For **Billing address information**, enter the billing address of the primary account owner.

1. Choose **Add payment method** to agree to the **Terms and Conditions** and add your direct debit account. Your bank account is now verified and added to your AWS Europe payment methods.

**Note**
AWS won't access or store your online banking credentials. AWS will ask for your explicit consent and will only request the following information from your bank:
Name of account holder
Account number
Mandate ID
Your bank might ask for your consent to share additional information. However, any additional information won't be shared with AWS. AWS can confirm your ownership of the bank account and charge your bank account after we first collect this information. AWS access to this information will expire based on local regulations and your bank’s policy.
To remove direct debit payments from your account, see [Remove a payment method](manage-payment-method.md#manage-remove-credit). To remove AWS data access to your bank information, see the [TrueLayer documentation](https://support.truelayer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025794833-Can-my-users-revoke-their-access-to-TrueLayer).
