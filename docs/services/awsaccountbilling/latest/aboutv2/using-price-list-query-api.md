# Finding services and products using AWS Price List Query API

To provide feedback about AWS Price List, complete this [short survey](https://amazonmr.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cO0deTMyKyFeezA). Your responses will be anonymous. **Note:** This survey is in English only.

We recommend that you use the Price List Query API when you want to:

- Find pricing information about a product.

- Search for products and rates that match your filters.

- Quickly find products and prices that you need when you're developing applications
that have limited resources, such as front-end environments.

To find AWS services, their products, and the product attributes and prices, see the
following steps.

Once you find the service, you can then get its attributes by using the
`DescribeServices` API operation. If you know the service code, you
can also use the AWS Price List Query API to get attributes for a service. Then, you
can use the service attributes to find the products that meet your requirements
based on the attribute values.

### Examples: Find services

The following AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands show how to find services.

###### Example: Find all services

```bash

aws pricing describe-services --region us-east-1
```

**Response**

```json

{
    "FormatVersion": "aws_v1",
    "NextToken": "abcdefg123",
    "Services": [
        {
            "AttributeNames": [
                "volumeType",
                "maxIopsvolume",
                "instanceCapacity10xlarge",
                "locationType",
                "operation"
            ],
            "ServiceCode": "AmazonEC2"
        },
        {
            "AttributeNames": [
                "productFamily",
                "volumeType",
                "engineCode",
                "memory"
            ],
            "ServiceCode": "AmazonRDS"
        },
        {...}
    ]
}
```

###### Example: Find service metadata for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

The following command shows how to find service metadata for Amazon EC2.

```bash

aws pricing describe-services --region us-east-1 --service-code AmazonEC2
```

**Response**

```json

{
    "FormatVersion": "aws_v1",
    "NextToken": "abcdefg123",
    "Services": [
        {
            "AttributeNames": [
                "productFamily",
                "volumeType",
                "engineCode",
                "memory"
            ],
            "ServiceCode": "AmazonEC2"
        }
    ]
}
```

The AWS Region is the API endpoint for the Price List Query API. The endpoints
aren't related to product or service attributes.

For more information, see [DescribeServices](../../../../reference/aws-cost-management/latest/apireference/api-pricing-describeservices.md) in the
_AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference_.

In [step 1](#price-list-query-api-find-services), you retrieved
a list of attributes for an AWS service. In this step, you use these attributes to
search for products. In step 3, you need the available values for these
attributes.

To find the values for an attribute, use the `GetAttributeValues` API
operation. To call the API, specify the `AttributeName` and
`ServiceCode` parameters.

### Example: Get attribute values

The following AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) command shows how to get attribute values for
an AWS service.

###### Example: Find attribute values for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)

```bash

aws pricing get-attribute-values --service-code AmazonRDS --attribute-name operation --region us-east-1
```

**Response**

```json

{
    "AttributeValues": [
        {
            "Value": "CreateDBInstance:0002"
        },
        {
            "Value": "CreateDBInstance:0003"
        },
        {
            "Value": "CreateDBInstance:0004"
        },
        {
            "Value": "CreateDBInstance:0005"
        }
    ],
    "NextToken": "abcdefg123"
}
```

The AWS Region is the API endpoint for the Price List Query API. The endpoints
aren't related to product or service attributes.

For more information, see [GetAttributeValues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_GetAttributeValues.html) and [language-specific AWS SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_GetAttributeValues.html#API_pricing_GetAttributeValues_SeeAlso) in the
_AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference_.

In this step, you use the information from [step 1](#price-list-query-api-find-services) and [step 2](#price-list-query-api-find-attributes) to find the
products and their terms. To get information about products, use the
`GetProducts` API operation. You can specify a list of filters to
return the products that you want.

###### Note

The Price List Query API supports only `"AND"` matching. The response
to your command only contains products that match all specified filters.

### Examples: Find products from attributes

The following AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands show how to find products by using
attributes.

###### Example: Find products with specified filters

The following command shows how you can specify filters for Amazon Relational Database Service
(Amazon RDS).

```bash

aws pricing get-products --service-code AmazonRDS --region us-east-1 --filters Type=TERM_MATCH,Field=operation,Value="CreateDBInstance:0002"
```

**Response**

```json

{
    "FormatVersion": "aws_v1",
    "PriceList": ["{
        \"product\":{
            \"productFamily\":\"Database Instance\",
            \"attributes\":{
                \"engineCode\":\"2\",
                \"enhancedNetworkingSupported\":\"Yes\",
                \"memory\":\"64 GiB\",
                \"dedicatedEbsThroughput\":\"2000 Mbps\",
                \"vcpu\":\"16\",
                \"locationType\":\"AWS Region\",
                \"storage\":\"EBS Only\",
                \"instanceFamily\":\"General purpose\",
                \"regionCode\":\"us-east-1\",
                \"operation\":\"CreateDBInstance:0002\",
                ...
            },
            \"sku\":\"22ANV4NNQP3UUCWY\"},
            \"serviceCode\":\"AmazonRDS\",
            \"terms\":{...}"
    ],
    "NextToken": "abcd1234"
}
```

###### Example: Use the filters.json file to specify filters

The following command shows how you can specify a JSON file that contains
all filters.

```bash

aws pricing get-products --service-code AmazonRDS --region us-east-1 --filters file://filters.json
```

For example, the `filters.json` file might include the
following filters.

```json

[
  {
    "Type": "TERM_MATCH",
    "Field": "operation",
    "Value": "CreateDBInstance:0002"
  }
]
```

The following example shows how you can specify more than one
filter.

```json

[
  {
    "Type": "TERM_MATCH",
    "Field": "AttributeName1",
    "Value": "AttributeValue1"
  },
  {
    "Type": "TERM_MATCH",
    "Field": "AttributeName2",
    "Value": "AttributeValue2"
  },
  ...
]
```

**Response**

```json

{
    "FormatVersion": "aws_v1",
    "PriceList": ["{
        \"product\":{
            \"productFamily\":\"Database Instance\",
            \"attributes\":{
                \"engineCode\":\"2\",
                \"enhancedNetworkingSupported\":\"Yes\",
                \"memory\":\"64 GiB\",
                \"dedicatedEbsThroughput\":\"2000 Mbps\",
                \"vcpu\":\"16\",
                \"locationType\":\"AWS Region\",
                \"storage\":\"EBS Only\",
                \"instanceFamily\":\"General purpose\",
                \"regionCode\":\"us-east-1\",
                \"operation\":\"CreateDBInstance:0002\",
                ...
            },
            \"sku\":\"22ANV4NNQP3UUCWY\"},
            \"serviceCode\":\"AmazonRDS\",
            \"terms\":{...}"
    ],
    "NextToken": "abcd1234"
}
```
