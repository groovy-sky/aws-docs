# Getting price list files using the AWS Price List Bulk API

To provide feedback about AWS Price List, complete this [short survey](https://amazonmr.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cO0deTMyKyFeezA). Your responses will be anonymous. **Note:** This survey is in English only.

We recommend that you use the Price List Bulk API when you want to do the following
tasks:

- Consume large amounts of product and pricing information for
AWS services.

- Consume product and pricing information with a high throughput for an
AWS service, such as processing in bulk.

Also, when the Price List Query API doesn't provide sufficient throughput and quotas for your
use case, use the Price List Bulk API.

We recommend that you use the AWS Price List Bulk API to find and download price list files
programmatically. To get the URL of the price list files, see the following steps.

If you don't want to use the AWS Price List Bulk API, you can download the price list files manually.
For more information, see [Getting price list files manually](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/using-the-aws-price-list-bulk-api-fetching-price-list-files-manually.html).

Use the `DescribeServices` API operation to find all available
AWS services that the Price List Bulk API supports. This API operation returns the
`ServiceCode` value from the list of services. You use this value later
to find relevant price list files.

###### Example: Find available services

The following command shows how to find available AWS services.

```bash

aws pricing describe-services --region us-east-1
```

The AWS Region is the API endpoint for the Price List Bulk API. The endpoints
aren't related to product or service attributes.

                "operation"
            ],
            "ServiceCode": "AmazonEC2"
        },

            "AttributeNames": [
                "productFamily",

            ],
            "ServiceCode": "AmazonRDS"
        },
        {...}
    ]
}
```

For more information about this API operation, see [DescribeServices](../../../../reference/aws-cost-management/latest/apireference/api-pricing-describeservices.md) and [language-specific AWS SDKs](../../../../reference/aws-cost-management/latest/apireference/api-pricing-describeservices.md#API_pricing_DescribeServices_SeeAlso) in the
_AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference_

###### Note

While the `DescribeServices` API currently doesn't return `serviceCodes` for Savings Plans, you will need the following `serviceCodes` to use Savings Plans in subsequent API calls:

ServiceCodeSavingsPlanCodeComputeSavingsPlansAWSComputeSavingsPlanMachineLearningSavingsPlansAWSMachineLearningSavingsPlansDatabaseSavingsPlansAWSDatabaseSavingsPlans

Use the `ServiceCode` values when working with the `ListPriceLists` and `GetPriceListFileUrl` API operations. The `SavingsPlanCode` is only needed if you are downloading price list files manually instead of using the APIs.

Use the `ListPriceLists` API operation to get a list of price list
references that you have permission to view. To filter your results, you can specify the
`ServiceCode`, `CurrencyCode`, and `EffectiveDate`
parameters.

The AWS Region is the API endpoint for the Price List Bulk API. The endpoints
aren't related to product or service attributes.

#### Examples to find price list files

###### Example: Find price list files for all AWS Regions

If you don't specify the `--region-code` parameter, the API
operation returns price list file references from all available AWS Regions.

```bash

aws pricing list-price-lists --service-code AmazonRDS --currency-code USD --effective-date "2023-04-03 00:00"
```

**Response**

```json

{
   "NextToken": "abcd1234",
   "PriceLists": [
      {
         "CurrencyCode": "USD",
         "FileFormats": [ "json", "csv" ],
         "PriceListArn": "arn:aws:pricing:::price-list/aws/AmazonRDS/USD/20230328234721/us-east-1",
         "RegionCode": "us-east-1"
      },
      {
         "CurrencyCode": "USD",
         "FileFormats": [ "json", "csv" ],
         "PriceListArn": "arn:aws:pricing:::price-list/aws/AmazonRDS/USD/20230328234721/us-west-2",
         "RegionCode": "us-west-2"
      },
      ...
   ]
}
```

###### Example: Find price list files for a specific Region

If you specify the `RegionCode` parameter, the API operation
returns price list file references that are specific to that Region. To find historical
price list files, use the `EffectiveDate` parameter. For example, you can
specify a date in the past to find a specific price list file.

From the response, you can then use the `PriceListArn` value with
the [GetPriceListFileUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_GetPriceListFileUrl.html) API
operation to get your preferred price list files.

```bash

aws pricing list-price-lists --service-code AmazonRDS --currency-code USD --region-code us-west-2 --effective-date "2023-04-03 00:00"
```

**Response**

```json

{
   "PriceLists": [
      {
         "CurrencyCode": "USD",
         "FileFormats": [ "json", "csv" ],
         "PriceListArn": "arn:aws:pricing:::price-list/aws/AmazonRDS/USD/20230328234721/us-west-2",
         "RegionCode": "us-west-2"
      }
   ]
}
```

For more information about this API operation, see [ListPriceLists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_ListPriceLists.html) and [language-specific AWS SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_pricing_ListPriceLists.html#API_pricing_ListPriceLists_SeeAlso) in the
_AWS Billing and Cost Management API Reference_.

Use the `GetPriceListFileUrl` API operation to get a URL for a price list file. This
URL is based on the `PriceListArn` and `FileFormats` values that
you retrieved from the `ListPriceLists` response in [step 1](#price-bulk-api-step-1-find-available-services) and [step\
2](#price-list-bulk-api-step-2-find-available-price-list-files)

###### Example: Get a specific price list file

The following command gets the URL for a specific price list file for
Amazon RDS.

```bash

aws pricing get-price-list-file-url --price-list-arn arn:aws:pricing:::price-list/aws/AmazonRDS/USD/20230328234721/us-east-1 --file-format json --region us-east-1
```

**Response**

```json

{
    "Url": "https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/offers/v1.0/aws/AmazonRDS/20230328234721/us-east-1/index.json"
}
```

From the response, you can use the URL to download the price list file.
