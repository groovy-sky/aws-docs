# Manage payment method access using tags

You can use attribute-based access control (ABAC) to manage access to your purchase methods. When you create your payment methods, you can tags with key-value pairs. You can then create IAM policies and specify the tags. For example, if you add the `project` key and assign it a value of `test`, your IAM policies can explicitly allow or deny access to any payment instruments that has this tag.

To add tags to new payment instruments or update existing ones, see [Managing credit card and ACH direct debit](manage-cc.md).

###### Example Use tags to allow access

The following policy allows the IAM entity to access payment instruments that have the `creditcard` key and a value of visa.

JSON

```json

{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "payments:ListPaymentInstruments",
            "payments:GetPaymentInstrument",
            "payments:ListTagsForResource"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:payments::123456789012:payment-instrument/*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
            "aws:ResourceTag/creditcard": "visa"
            }
        }
    }]
}

```

###### Example Use tags to deny access

The following policy denies the IAM entity from completing any payment action on payment methods that have the `creditcard` key and a value of `visa`.

JSON

```json

{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "payments:*",
        "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": "payments:GetPaymentInstrument",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:payments::123456789012:payment-instrument:*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
            "aws:ResourceTag/creditcard": "visa"
            }
        }
    }]
}

```
