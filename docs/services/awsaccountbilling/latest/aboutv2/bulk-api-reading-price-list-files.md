## Reading the service index file

To provide feedback about AWS Price List, complete this [short survey](https://amazonmr.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cO0deTMyKyFeezA). Your responses will be anonymous. **Note:** This survey is in English only.

After you have the service index file, you can use it to find an service price list
file.

The service index file is available as a JSON file. To read the file, you can use a
text application or a program that parses the JSON.

The service index file has two main sections:

- Metadata about the service index file

- Either a list of the services that AWS offers or via AWS Marketplace.

The information about the service index file includes the URL where you can download
the prices and a URL for the service Region index file for that service.

### Example: Service index file

The service index file looks like the following.

```json

{
   "formatVersion":"The version number for the offer index format",
   "disclaimer":"The disclaimers for this offer index",
   "publicationDate":"The publication date of this offer index",
   "offers":{
      "firstService":{
         "offerCode":"The service that this price list is for",
         "currentVersionUrl":"The URL for this offer file",
         "currentRegionIndexUrl":"The URL for the regional offer index file",
         "savingsPlanVersionIndexUrl":"The URL for the Savings Plan index file (if applicable)"
      },
      "secondService":{
         "offerCode": ...,
         "currentVersionUrl": ...,
         "currentRegionIndexUrl": ...,
         "savingsPlanVersionIndexUrl":...
      },
      ...
   },
}
```

### Service index file definitions

The following list defines the terms that are used in the service index
file:

**FormatVersion**

An attribute that tracks which format version the service version index file is in. The
`formatVersion` of the file is updated when the structure
is changed. For example, the version will change from `v1` to
`v2`.

**Disclaimer**

Any disclaimers that apply to the service version index file.

**PublicationDate**

The date and time in UTC format when a service version index file was published. For
example, this might look like `2015-04-09T02:22:05Z` and
`2015-09-10T18:21:05Z`.

**Offers**

A list of available service price list files.

**Offers:OfferCode**

A unique code for the product of an AWS service. For example, this
might be `AmazonEC2` or `AmazonS3`. The
`OfferCode` is used as the lookup key for the
index.

**Offers:CurrentVersionUrl**

The URL where you can download the most up-to-date service
price list file.

**Offers:currentRegionIndexUrl**

A list of available service price list files by Region.

**Offers:savingsPlanVersionIndexUrl**

The list of applicable Savings Plan offers.
