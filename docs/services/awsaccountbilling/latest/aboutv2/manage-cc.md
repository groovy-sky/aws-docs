## Manage ACH direct debit payment methods

If you meet the eligibility requirements, add a US bank account as an ACH direct
debit payment method to your payment methods.

To be eligible, you must be an Amazon Web Services customer and also meet the following
requirements:

- You created your AWS account at least 60 days ago

- You paid at least one invoice (in full) in the previous 12 months

- You paid at least $100 (cumulatively) over the previous 12 months

- You set USD as the preferred currency

If you pay by ACH direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and
initiates the charge to your payment method within 10 days of the start of the month. It can take up to 20 days for the payment to complete
successfully, even if the payment shows as **Succeeded** on the
AWS Billing and Cost Management console.

You can use Billing and Cost Management console to add or update a direct debit account.
