# Responding to invitations

When you sign in to your organization's management account, you can respond to invitations
you have received.

## Considerations

**Transfers are inherited**

If you are the _bill-transfer account_ for another organization,
and you accept a _billing transfer invitation_ from a different
account, that account becomes your _bill-transfer account_ and will
manage and pay for any consolidated bills that you manage and pay for.

**Transfers start at the beginning of month**

If an invitation is accepted, the start date is 00:00:00 UTC on the first day of the month specified in the invitation (for Eastern Standard Time this is 7:00 PM on the evening before the first day of the month).

**Invitations must be accepted before the start**
**date**

Invites must be accepted 24 hours before the billing transfer start date. For example, an invitation with a start date of May 1st, needs to be accepted by April 29th 6:59:59PM Eastern Standard Time (11:59:59 PM UTC), which is two days before the start date.

bill.
