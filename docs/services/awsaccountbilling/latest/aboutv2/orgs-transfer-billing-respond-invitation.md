# Responding to invitations
<a name="orgs_transfer_billing-respond-invitation"></a>

When you sign in to your organization's management account, you can respond to invitations you have received.

## Considerations
<a name="orgs_transfer_billing-respond-invitation-considerations"></a>

**Transfers are inherited**

If you are the *bill-transfer account* for another organization, and you accept a *billing transfer invitation* from a different account, that account becomes your *bill-transfer account* and will manage and pay for any consolidated bills that you manage and pay for.

**Transfers start at the beginning of month**

If an invitation is accepted, the start date is 00:00:00 UTC on the first day of the month specified in the invitation (for Eastern Standard Time this is 7:00 PM on the evening before the first day of the month).

**Invitations must be accepted before the start date**

Invites must be accepted 24 hours before the billing transfer start date. For example, an invitation with a start date of May 1st, needs to be accepted by April 29th 6:59:59PM Eastern Standard Time (11:59:59 PM UTC), which is two days before the start date.
