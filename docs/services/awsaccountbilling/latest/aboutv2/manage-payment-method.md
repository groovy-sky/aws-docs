# Customizing your AWS payment preferences

You can use the [Payment\
preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) page of the AWS Billing and Cost Management console to perform the following tasks
for all payment types:

###### Topics

- [View your payment methods](#manage-view-credit)

- [Designate a default payment method](#manage-designate-default)

- [Remove a payment method](#manage-remove-credit)

- [Changing the currency to pay your bill](#manage-account-payment-change-currency)

- [Adding additional billing contact email addresses](#manage-billing-contact-emails)

For a list of accepted payment methods organized by AWS service providers ("SOR", "seller of record), see [What payment methods does AWS accept?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/accepted-payment-methods) in the _Knowledge Center_.

For a full list of supported currencies, see [What currencies does AWS currently support?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/supported-aws-currencies).

###### Notes

- IAM users need explicit permission to access some of the pages in the
Billing console. For more information, see [Overview of managing access permissions](control-access-billing.md).

- You can also use the **Payment preferences** page to manage
your credit cards and direct debit accounts. For more information, see [Managing credit card and ACH direct debit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-cc.html) and [Manage ACH direct debit payment methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-cc.html#manage-debit).

- If you use billing transfer, the bill transfer account controls the payment preferences for invoices of AWS Organizations that transfer their bills. The bill source account can configure and change existing payment preferences. However, these preferences don't take effect while billing transfer is active.
