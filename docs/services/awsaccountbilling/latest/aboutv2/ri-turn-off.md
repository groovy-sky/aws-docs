# Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discount sharing

The management account of an organization can control Reserved Instance discount and Savings Plans discount sharing for any accounts in that organization. AWS offers enhanced sharing capabilities by allowing organizations to define how commitment discounts are applied across their AWS accounts.

## Overview of Sharing Options

AWS provides flexible options for sharing Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discounts:

- **Organization-wide sharing**: Sharing across all accounts in the organization

- **Group-based sharing**: Define specific account groups for targeted discount sharing

- **Account-level control**: Activate or deactivate sharing for individual accounts

- To share the Savings Plans discount, the Savings Plans owner account must be active in the RI and Savings Plans discount sharing preferences. This enables the discount usage across other eligible linked accounts in the organization.

- When you use Billing Conductor alone or with billing transfer, changes to Reserved Instances and Savings Plans sharing preferences affect the standard AWS bill.

- When you use Billing Conductor with billing transfer, each AWS Organizations controls its own sharing preferences. You can't share these preferences across multiple AWS Organizations.

### Sharing Modes

###### Organization-wide sharing

- Commitments benefit the account owner first

- After satisfying the account owner, remaining benefits can be shared with other organization accounts

- Maximizes overall commitment discount rates

###### Prioritized Group Sharing

- Commitments benefit the account owner first

- After satisfying the account owner, commitments are shared with accounts within defined groups

- After satisfying the group's usage, remaining benefits can be shared with other organization accounts

- Maximizes overall commitment utilization and discount rates while prioritizing specific groups

###### Restricted Group Sharing

- Commitments benefit the account owner first

- Commitments are exclusively shared within defined account groups

- No sharing occurs outside designated groups, even with unused capacity

###### Note

###### Account Grouping Requirements

Group sharing uses AWS Cost Categories to define account groups:

- Each account can only belong to one sharing group

- Payer account cannot be part of a sharing group

- Cost Categories must be configured through the AWS Billing Console

- Only the **Accounts** dimension can be used when creating or editing sharing groups

- The Cost Category **Uncategorized costs** default value must not overlap with any sharing group name

- Existing Cost Categories can be reused if it meets the Reserved Instances and Savings Plan group sharing requirements or new ones created specifically for group sharing

###### Note

###### The following criteria must be met:

Group sharing uses AWS Cost Categories to define account groups:

- Savings Plans first apply to the purchasing account

- The Savings Plans owner account must remain active in sharing preferences

- Both purchasing and benefit receiving accounts must have sharing activated to share discounts

- Accounts with the largest calculated savings are prioritized

- You can change your preference at any time. Each estimated bill is computed by using the last set of preferences. The final bill for the month is calculated based on the preferences set at 23:59:59 UTC time on the last day of the month.

- If a Savings Plans owner account leaves the organization, Savings Plans no longer apply to the consolidated bill
