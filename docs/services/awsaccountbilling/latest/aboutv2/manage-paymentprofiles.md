# Using payment profiles

_Payment profiles_ allows you to manage payment methods when receiving invoices from multiple AWS service providers ("SOR", "seller of record"). You can create payment profiles configured to each AWS service provider, specifying the currency and preferred payment method used.

After you create a payment profile for a service provider, your payment profile pays your AWS
bills automatically by using the currency and payment method that you specified.

Payment profiles aren't required. If you don't create a payment profile, your default payment preference is used that was created when you signed up for your AWS account.

Payment profiles are useful in avoiding situations such as incomplete payments, failed
subscription orders, and unprocessed contract renewals despite having a valid default
payment method. When you use payment profiles, you can do the following:

- Use different currencies for different AWS service providers

- Use different payment methods for different AWS service providers

- Consistently have valid payment methods for your automatic bill payments

- Avoid service interruptions and incomplete balances

###### Note

Because some country and technological limitations, not all payment methods are
available for all providers. If your default payment method isn't valid for different
service providers, create payment profiles by using the payment methods that are accepted by
your service provider. For more information, see [Creating your payment profiles](#manage-paymentprofiles-setup).

When you use billing transfer and sign in as a bill transfer account, you can use payment profiles to pay invoices from bill source accounts if you used invoice configuration to assign different tax profiles to these invoices. For more information, see [Customizing your invoice preferences with AWS invoice configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/invoice-configuration.html).

that you receive from the AWS Inc. service provider. In this example, your
AWS Organizations management account is with AWS Europe (shown as "AWS EMEA SARL" as the
service provider). Your default payment currency is Euro (EUR).

If you have a valid default payment method on file, you can pay your AWS Europe
invoices automatically. Examples of a valid payment method include a credit card
and a SEPA direct debit account. For more information, see [Managing your payments in AWS Europe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/emea-payments.html).

For your AWS Inc. invoices, you can create a payment profile to pay using a different
currency (for example, USD) and a different payment method (for example, a
credit card).
