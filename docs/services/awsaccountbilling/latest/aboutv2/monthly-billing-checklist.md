# Reviewing your monthly billing best practices
<a name="monthly-billing-checklist"></a>

AWS uses information that you provide in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console to prepare and issue your invoices with proper header information, such as your preferred payment currency, tax settings, business legal name and address.

If this information is missing or inaccurate, AWS might issue inaccurate invoices that you can't use or process.

Follow this 10-minute checklist before the end of the monthly billing period to review your invoice and ensure that your information is up-to-date in your AWS account.

## Check purchase order balance and expiration
<a name="check-po-balanceexpiration"></a>

As part of the procure-to-pay process, you can use purchase orders to procure AWS services and approve invoices for payment. To avoid issues with billing and payment, verify that your purchase orders aren't expired or out-of-balance.

**To check purchase order balance and expiration**

1. Navigate to the [Purchase orders](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/purchaseorders) page in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. The purchase order dashboard shows the state of your purchase orders.

1. Choose a purchase order to see the **Purchase order details** page.

1. Review the purchase order **Balance** and **Expiration** fields.

**Tip**
You can set up email notifications so that you can proactively take action on expiring or out-of-balance purchase orders. For more information, see [Enabling purchase order notifications](notify-po-details.md).
To add a purchase order to use in your invoices, see [Adding a purchase order](adding-po.md).

## Review tax settings
<a name="review-tax-settings"></a>

To determine your account's location for tax purposes, AWS uses the tax registration number (TRN) and the business legal address associated with your account. A TRN is also known as a value-added tax (VAT) number, VAT ID, VAT registration number, or business registration number.

**To review tax settings**

1. Navigate to the [Tax settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/tax-settings) page in the Billing and Cost Management console.

1. Under the **Tax registrations** tab, select the account IDs to edit.

1. Under **Manage tax registration**, choose **Edit**.

1. Enter your updated information and then choose **Update**.

**Note**
If you use billing transfer, the bill transfer account controls the tax settings of AWS Organizations that transfer their bills.

For more information, see [Updating and deleting tax registration numbers](manage-account-payment.md#manage-account-payment-update-delete-tax-numbers).

## Enable tax setting inheritance
<a name="turning-on-tax-setting-inheritance"></a>

The management account and member accounts that are part of AWS Organizations can have different TRNs or the same TRN. Unless your organization needs to use different TRNs for member accounts, we recommend that you enable tax settings inheritance.

After you enable this setting from the management account, your tax registration information is added to your member accounts in your organization. This saves you time so that you don't need to enter this information for individual accounts. Tax invoices are processed with consistent tax information, and your usage from member accounts will consolidate to a single tax invoice.

**To enable tax settings inheritance**

1. Navigate to the [Tax settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/tax-settings) page in the Billing and Cost Management console.

1. Under **Tax registrations**, select **Enable tax settings inheritance**.

1. In the dialog box, choose **Enable**.

**Note**
If you use billing transfer, AWS Organizations that transfer their bills inherit the tax settings of the bill transfer account by default. For information about managing tax settings and tax inheritance with billing transfer, see [Setting up your tax information](manage-account-payment.md).

For information about how to manage documents required for US tax exemptions, see [Managing your US tax exemptions](manage-account-payment.md#manage-account-tax-awstaxexemption).

## Update billing contact information
<a name="update-billing-contact-information"></a>

Verify that your billing contact information is correct. AWS uses these contacts to contact you about any billing or payment related communications. You can add additional billing contacts in two ways:
+ The **Payment preferences** page
+ The **Accounts** page

**To add billing contacts from the Payments preference page**

1. Navigate to the [Payment preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentpreferences/paymentmethods) page in the Billing and Cost Management console.

1. In the **Default payment preferences** section, review the **Billing contact email** field. AWS uses this contact for any billing or payment related communications.

1. Choose **Edit**.

1. In the **Billing contact email - *optional*** field, enter the email addresses that you want AWS to send billing related email notifications, payment reminders and payment support notifications to. You can add up to 15 email addresses.

1.  Choose **Save changes**.

You can add alternate contacts so that AWS has an alternate email address to contact about issues with your account, even if the AWS account root user contact is unavailable. For the Billing alternate contact, you can specify the email address to receive the invoice. Your alternate contact will be authorized to communicate with AWS for billing, invoice, and payment issues.

The alternate contact doesn't have to be a specific person. For example, you can add an email distribution list if you have a team that manages billing, operations, and security related issues.

**Note**
If you use billing transfer, AWS Organizations that transfer their bills can update their billing contacts. However, while billing transfer is active, this information isn't used because bills are sent to the bill transfer account using its billing contact information.

**To update alternate contact information from the Accounts page**

1. Navigate to the [Accounts](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/account) page in the Billing and Cost Management console and scroll down to the **Alternate contacts** section.

1. For the **Billing** field, review the contact information and confirm the email address where you want your invoices delivered.

 For more information about how to use alternate contacts, see [Adding or updating alternate contacts](billing-getting-started.md#manage-account-payment-alternate-contacts).

## Review payment currency
<a name="review-payment-currency"></a>

The payment currency is the currency that your default payment method will be charged in. This is also the currency displayed on your invoice under your default service provider. Some organizations can't process invoices that are issued in the wrong currency, so it's important to ensure that your payment currency is accurate.

**To review your payment currency**

1. Navigate to [Payment preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentpreferences/paymentmethods) in the Billing and Cost Management console.

1. In the **Default payment preferences** section, choose **Edit**.

1. In the **Payment currency** section, ensure that the **Default payment currency** is correct.

For more information about payment methods, see [Managing credit cards](manage-cc.md).
