# Reviewing your monthly billing best practices

AWS uses information that you provide in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console to prepare and issue
your invoices with proper header information, such as your preferred payment currency, tax
settings, business legal name and address.

If this information is missing or inaccurate, AWS might issue inaccurate invoices that
you can't use or process.

Follow this 10-minute checklist before the end of the monthly billing period to review
your invoice and ensure that your information is up-to-date in your AWS account.

## Check purchase order balance and expiration

As part of the procure-to-pay process, you can use purchase orders to procure
AWS services and approve invoices for payment. To avoid issues with billing and
payment, verify that your purchase orders aren't expired or out-of-balance.

###### To check purchase order balance and expiration

1. Navigate to the [Purchase orders](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) page in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. The purchase
    order dashboard shows the state of your purchase orders.

2. Choose a purchase order to see the **Purchase order**
**details** page.

3. Review the purchase order **Balance** and
    **Expiration** fields.

###### Tip

- You can set up email notifications so that you can proactively take action
on expiring or out-of-balance purchase orders. For more information, see
[Enabling purchase order notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/notify-po-details.html).

- To add a purchase order to use in your invoices, see [Adding a purchase order](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/adding-po.html).

## Review tax settings

To determine your account's location for tax purposes, AWS uses the tax registration
number (TRN) and the business legal address associated with your account. A TRN is also
known as a value-added tax (VAT) number, VAT ID, VAT registration number, or business
registration number.

###### To review tax settings

1. Navigate to the [Tax\
    settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) page in the Billing and Cost Management console.

2. Under the **Tax registrations** tab, select the account IDs
    to edit.

3. Under **Manage tax registration**,
    choose **Edit**.

4. Enter your updated information and then choose **Update**.

###### Note

If you use billing transfer, the bill transfer account controls the tax settings of AWS Organizations that transfer their bills.

For more information, see [Updating and deleting tax registration numbers](manage-account-payment.md#manage-account-payment-update-delete-tax-numbers).

## Enable tax setting inheritance

The management account and member accounts that are part of AWS Organizations can have different
TRNs or the same TRN. Unless your organization needs to use different TRNs for member
accounts, we recommend that you enable tax settings inheritance.

After you enable this setting from the management account, your tax registration
information is added to your member accounts in your organization. This saves you time
so that you don't need to enter this information for individual accounts. Tax invoices
are processed with consistent tax information, and your usage from member accounts will
consolidate to a single tax invoice.

###### To enable tax settings inheritance

1. Navigate to the [Tax\
    settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) page in the Billing and Cost Management console.

2. Under **Tax registrations**, select **Enable tax**
**settings inheritance**.

3. In the dialog box, choose **Enable**.

###### Note

If you use billing transfer, AWS Organizations that transfer their bills inherit the tax settings of the bill transfer account by default. For information about managing tax settings and tax inheritance with billing transfer, see [Setting up your tax information](manage-account-payment.md).

For information about how to manage documents required for US tax exemptions, see
[Managing your US tax exemptions](manage-account-payment.md#manage-account-tax-awstaxexemption).

## Update billing contact information

Verify that your billing contact information is correct. AWS uses these contacts to
contact you about any billing or payment related communications. You can add additional
billing contacts in two ways:

- The **Payment preferences** page

- The **Accounts** page

###### To add billing contacts from the Payments preference page

1. Navigate to the [Payment\
    preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) page in the Billing and Cost Management console.

2. In the **Default payment preferences** section, review the
    **Billing contact email** field. AWS uses this contact
    for any billing or payment related communications.

3. Choose **Edit**.

4. In the **Billing contact email -**
**_optional_** field, enter the email addresses
    that you want AWS to send billing related email notifications, payment
    reminders and payment support notifications to. You can add up to 15 email
    addresses.

5. Choose **Save changes**.

You can add alternate contacts so that AWS has an alternate email address to contact
about issues with your account, even if the AWS account root user contact is unavailable. For the
Billing alternate contact, you can specify the email address to receive the invoice.
Your alternate contact will be authorized to communicate with AWS for billing,
invoice, and payment issues.

The alternate contact doesn't have to be a specific person. For example, you can add
an email distribution list if you have a team that manages billing, operations, and
security related issues.

###### Note

If you use billing transfer, AWS Organizations that transfer their bills can update their billing contacts. However, while billing transfer is active, this information isn't used because bills are sent to the bill transfer account using its billing contact information.

###### To update alternate contact information from the Accounts page

1. Navigate to the [Accounts](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) page in the Billing and Cost Management console and scroll down to the
    **Alternate contacts** section.

2. For the **Billing** field, review the contact information and
    confirm the email address where you want your invoices delivered.

For more information about how to use alternate contacts, see [Adding or updating alternate contacts](billing-getting-started.md#manage-account-payment-alternate-contacts).

## Review payment currency

The payment currency is the currency that your default payment method will be
charged in. This is also the currency displayed on your invoice under your default
service provider. Some organizations can't process invoices that are issued in the wrong
currency, so it's important to ensure that your payment currency is accurate.

###### To review your payment currency

1. Navigate to [Payment\
    preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) in the Billing and Cost Management console.

2. In the **Default payment preferences** section,
    choose **Edit**.

3. In the **Payment currency** section, ensure that the
    **Default payment currency** is correct.

For more information about payment methods, see [Managing credit card and ACH direct debit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-cc.html).
