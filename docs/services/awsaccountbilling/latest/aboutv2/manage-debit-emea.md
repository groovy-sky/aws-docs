# Managing your SEPA direct debit payment method

AWS Europe customers can add a bank account to allow SEPA direct debit payments. You can
use any personal or business bank account, provided that the account is located at a
branch in a SEPA-supported country and payments are in the Euro currency.

If you pay by SEPA direct debit, AWS provides you with your invoice and
initiates the charge to your payment method either the following day or the invoice due date, whichever is latest. It can take up to 5 business days for the payment to complete
successfully, even if the payment shows as **Succeeded** in the
AWS Billing console.

You can use the [Payment\
preferences](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home) page of the AWS Billing console to perform the following SEPA
direct debit tasks:

## Verify and link your bank account to your AWS Europe payment methods

###### Note

To use this feature, you must have a billing address in Germany, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Finland, Ireland, Austria, or Belgium. To
change your billing address, see [Update your direct debit account information](#update-your-direct-debit-account-information).

You can verify and link a SEPA direct debit account to your AWS account by
signing in to your bank account. We ask that you to sign in to your bank account, so
that we can verify your identity and confirm your ownership of the bank
account.

AWS works with TrueLayer to connect to your bank and securely
verify ownership of your bank account. Your information is protected with an
encrypted end-to-end connection during this one-time validation process. Your
personal data won’t be shared or used beyond the purpose of verifying that you're
the owner of the connected bank account.

If you don't have access to the bank account sign in credentials, you can create
an IAM entity (such as a user or role) for the bank account owner to provide them
access to the Billing console. Then, they can update the AWS account payment
method. We recommend that you don't share sensitive information, including username,
password, or payment methods for your account. For more information, see the
following topics:

- [Overview of managing access permissions](control-access-billing.md)

- [Best practices to protect your account's root\
user](../../../accounts/latest/reference/best-practices-root-user.md) in the _AWS Account Management Reference_
_Guide_

###### To verify and link your bank account

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Billing and Cost Management console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Payment**
    **preferences**.

03. Choose **Add payment method**.

04. Choose **Bank account**.

05. Choose **Sign in to your bank**.

06. Choose **Link your bank account**.

07. Select your bank name.

08. Choose **Allow**. The information that you share will
     only be used to confirm your ownership of the bank account and to prevent
     fraud.

09. Sign in to your bank account. Use the credentials for your bank account,
     _not_ the credentials for your AWS account. Your
     connection is encrypted and your credentials are protected. AWS won't
     access or store your online banking credentials.

    ###### Note

    Your bank might ask that you sign in your account with multi-factor
    authentication (MFA).

10. For **Billing address information**, enter the billing
     address of the primary account owner.

11. Choose **Add payment method** to agree to the
     **Terms and Conditions** and add your direct debit
     account. Your bank account is now verified and added to your AWS Europe payment
     methods.

###### Note

AWS won't access or store your online banking credentials. AWS will ask
for your explicit consent and will only request the following information from
your bank:

- Name of account holder

- Account number

Your bank might ask for your consent to share additional information. However,
any additional information won't be shared with AWS. AWS can confirm your
ownership of the bank account and charge your bank account after we first
collect this information. AWS access to this information will expire based on
local regulations and your bank’s policy.

To remove direct debit payments from your account, see [Remove a payment method](manage-payment-method.md#manage-remove-credit). To
remove AWS data access to your bank information, see the [TrueLayer documentation](https://support.truelayer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025794833-Can-my-users-revoke-their-access-to-TrueLayer).
