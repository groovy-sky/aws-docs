# Understanding dates for cost allocation tags

###### Prerequisites

To view these dates in the **Cost allocation tags** page of the
AWS Billing and Cost Management console, you must have the `ce:ListCostAllocationTags`
permission.

For more information about updating your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, see [Managing access permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/migrate-granularaccess-whatis.html#migrate-control-access-billing).

When you use cost allocation tags, you can determine when the tags were last used or
last updated with the following metadata fields:

- **Last updated date** – The last date that the tag key
was either activated or deactivated for cost allocation.

For example, suppose that your tag key `lambda:createdby` changed
from inactive to active on July 1, 2023. This means that the **Last**
**updated date** column will show July 1, 2023.

- **Last used month** – The last month that the tag key
was used on an AWS resource.

For example, suppose that your tag key `lambda:createdby` was last
used on April 2023. The **Last used month** column will show
April 2023. This means that the tag key hasn't been associated with any resource
since that date.

###### Notes

- The **Last updated date** column appears empty
for newly created tag keys that haven't been activated.

- The **Last used month** column shows
**-** for tag keys that aren't currently associated with any
resource.
