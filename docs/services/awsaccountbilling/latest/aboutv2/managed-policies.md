# AWS managed policies

Managed policies are standalone identity-based policies that you can attach to
multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. You can use AWS managed
policies to control access in Billing.

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that's created and administered by
AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common
use cases. AWS managed policies make it easier for you to assign appropriate
permissions to users, groups, and roles than if you had to write the policies
yourself.

You can't change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. AWS
occasionally updates the permissions that are defined in an AWS managed policy.
When this occurs, the update affects all principal entities (users, groups, and
roles) that the policy is attached to.

Billing provides several AWS managed policies for common use cases.
