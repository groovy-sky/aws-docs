# Using recommended actions to bulk migrate legacy policies
<a name="migrate-console-streamlined"></a>

You can migrate all of your legacy policies by using the fine-grained actions mapped by AWS. For AWS Organizations, this applies to all legacy policies across all accounts. Once you complete your migration process, the fine-grained actions are effective. You have the option to test the bulk migration process using test accounts before committing your entire organization. For more information, see the following section.

**To migrate all of your policies using fine-grained actions mapped by AWS**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

1. In the search bar at the top of the page, enter **Bulk Policy Migrator**.

1. On the **Manage new IAM actions** page, choose **Confirm and migrate**.

1. Remain on the **Migration in progress** page until the migration is complete. See the status bar for progress.

1. Once the **Migration in progress** section updates to **Migration successful**, you are redirected to the **Manage new IAM actions** page.
