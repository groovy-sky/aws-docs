# Recover deleted EBS volumes, EBS snapshots, and EBS-backed AMIs with Recycle Bin

Recycle Bin is a data recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally
deleted EBS volumes, EBS snapshots, and EBS-backed AMIs. When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are
retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify before being permanently deleted.

You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before its retention period expires.
After you restore a resource from the Recycle Bin, the resource is removed from the Recycle Bin and
you can use it in the same way that you use any other resource of that type in your account. If the retention
period expires and the resource is not restored, the resource is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin
and it is no longer available for recovery.

Using Recycle Bin helps to ensure business continuity by protecting your business-critical
data against accidental deletion.

Recycle Bin is assessed as a service capability of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Any [AWS services in Scope by Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope)
Program (FedRAMP, HIPAA BAA, SOC, etc) which lists Amazon EBS will also apply to Recycle Bin.
