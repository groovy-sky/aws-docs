# Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EBS

Amazon CloudWatch metrics are statistical data that you can use to view, analyze, and set alarms on
the operational behavior of your volumes.

Data is available automatically in 1-minute periods at no charge.

When you get data from CloudWatch, you can include a `Period` request parameter to
specify the granularity of the returned data. This is different than the period that we use
when we collect the data (1-minute periods). We recommend that you specify a period in your
request that is equal to or greater than the collection period to ensure that the returned
data is valid.

You can get the data using either the CloudWatch API or the Amazon EC2 console. The console takes
the raw data from the CloudWatch API and displays a series of graphs based on the data.
Depending on your needs, you might prefer to use either the data from the API or the
graphs in the console.

## Metrics for Amazon EBS volumes

The `AWS/EBS` namespace includes the following metrics for EBS volumes
that are attached to all instance types. All Amazon EBS volume types automatically send
1-minute metrics to CloudWatch, but only when the volume is attached to an instance.

To get information about the available disk space from the operating system on an
instance, see [View free disk space](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-describing-volumes.html#ebs-view-free-disk-space-lin).

###### Note

Some metrics have differences on instances that are built on the Nitro System. For a
list of these instance types, see [Instances \
built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.html).

MetricDescriptionUnitsDimensionsMeaningful statistics`VolumeAvgIOPS`\*

###### Note

Supported for all EBS volume types attached to Nitro instances. Not published
for volumes attached to Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate tasks.

The average read and write IOPS driven to the volume in a minute. If no operations
were driven to the volume within the last minute, then value for the metric is zero
( `0`). For more information, see [Monitor I/O characteristics using CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-io-characteristics.html#ebs-io-metrics).

For Multi-Attach enabled volumes, use the `InstanceId` dimension to view
average IOPS for a specific volume-instance attachement.

`VolumeThroughputPercentage`

###### Note

Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes only. Not supported with Multi-Attach enabled volumes.

The percentage of I/O operations per second (IOPS) delivered of the total IOPS
provisioned for an Amazon EBS volume. Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes deliver their provisioned performance
99.9 percent of the time. During a write, if there are no other pending I/O requests
in a minute, the metric value will be 100 percent. Also, a volume's I/O performance
may become degraded temporarily due to an action you have taken (for example, creating
a snapshot of a volume during peak usage, running the volume on a non-EBS-optimized
instance, or accessing data on the volume for the first time).

`VolumeConsumedReadWriteOps`

###### Note

Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes only.

The total amount of read and write operations (normalized to 256K capacity units) consumed
in a specified period of time. I/O operations that are smaller than 256K each count as 1
consumed IOPS. I/O operations that are larger than 256K are counted in 256K capacity units.
For example, a 1024K I/O would count as 4 consumed IOPS.

(for `st1` and `sc1`) remaining in the burst bucket. Data is reported to CloudWatch only when the
volume is active. If the volume is not attached, no data is reported. If the baseline performance
of the volume exceeds the maximum burst performance, credits are never spent. For other
instances, the reported burst balance is 100%. For more information, see

`EBSReadOps`

Completed read operations from all Amazon EBS volumes attached to the instance in a
specified period of time. To calculate the average read I/O operations per second
(Read IOPS) for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number
of seconds in that period. If you are using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can
divide this number by 300 to calculate the Read IOPS. If you have detailed
(1-minute) monitoring, divide it by 60. You can also use the CloudWatch metric math function
`DIFF_TIME` to find the operations per second. For example, if you have
graphed `EBSReadOps` in CloudWatch as `m1`, the metric math formula
`m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns the metric in operations/second. For more
information about `DIFF_TIME` and other metric math functions, see
[Use metric math](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

`EBSWriteOps`

Completed write operations to all EBS volumes attached to the instance in a specified
period of time. To calculate the average write I/O operations per second (Write IOPS)
for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in
that period. If you are using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can divide this number
by 300 to calculate the Write IOPS. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring, divide
it by 60. You can also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME` to find
the operations per second. For example, if you have graphed `EBSWriteOps` in
CloudWatch as `m1`, the metric math formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns
the metric in operations/second. For more information about `DIFF_TIME` and
other metric math functions, see [Use metric math](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

`EBSReadBytes`

Bytes read from all EBS volumes attached to the instance in a
specified period of time. The number reported is the number of bytes read during the period. If you are
using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find Read
Bytes/second. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring, divide it by 60. You can
also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME` to find the bytes
per second. For example, if you have graphed `EBSReadBytes` in CloudWatch as
`m1`, the metric math formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns
the metric in bytes/second. For more information about `DIFF_TIME` and
other metric math functions, see [Use metric\

Write Bytes/second. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring, divide it by 60.
You can also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME` to find the

## Amazon EC2 console graphs

After you create a volume, you can view the volume's monitoring graphs in the
Amazon EC2 console. Select a volume on the **Volumes** page in the
console and choose **Monitoring**. The following table lists the
graphs that are displayed. The column on the right describes how the raw data
metrics from the CloudWatch API are used to produce each graph. The period for all the
graphs is 5 minutes.
