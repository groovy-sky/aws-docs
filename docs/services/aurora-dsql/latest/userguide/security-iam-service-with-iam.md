To get a high-level view of how Aurora DSQL and other AWS services work with most IAM features, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Identity-based policies for Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies"></a>

**Supports identity-based policies:** Yes

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based policy, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. To learn about all of the elements that you can use in a JSON policy, see [IAM JSON policy elements reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Resource-based policies within Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-resource-based-policies"></a>

**Supports resource-based policies:** Yes

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resource-based policies are IAM role trust policies and Amazon S3 bucket policies. In services that support resource-based policies, service administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must [specify a principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html) in a resource-based policy. Principals can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services. Resource-based policies are inline policies that are located in that service. You can't use AWS managed policies from IAM in a resource-based policy.

To learn how to create and manage resource-based policies for Aurora DSQL clusters, see [Resource-based policies for Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/resource-based-policies.html).

## Policy actions for Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions"></a>

**Supports policy actions:** Yes

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Action` element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.

To see a list of Aurora DSQL actions, see [Actions Defined by Amazon Aurora DSQL ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_your_service.html#your_service-actions-as-permissions) in the *Service Authorization Reference*.

Policy actions in Aurora DSQL use the following prefix before the action:

```
dsql
```

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas.

```
"Action": [
      "dsql:{{action1}}",
      "dsql:{{action2}}"
]
```

To view examples of Aurora DSQL identity-based policies, see [Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Aurora DSQL](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md).

## Policy resources for Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources"></a>

**Supports policy resources:** Yes

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Resource` JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. As a best practice, specify a resource using its [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html). For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, use a wildcard (\*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.

```
"Resource": "*"
```

To see a list of Aurora DSQL resource types and their ARNs, see [Resources Defined by Amazon Aurora DSQL ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_your_service.html#your_service-resources-for-iam-policies) in the *Service Authorization Reference*. To learn with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource, see [Actions Defined by Amazon Aurora DSQL ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_your_service.html#your_service-actions-as-permissions).

To view examples of Aurora DSQL identity-based policies, see [Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Aurora DSQL](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md).

## Policy condition keys for Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-conditionkeys"></a>

**Supports service-specific policy condition keys:** Yes

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Condition` element specifies when statements execute based on defined criteria. You can create conditional expressions that use [condition operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html), such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request. To see all AWS global condition keys, see [AWS global condition context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

To see a list of Aurora DSQL condition keys, see [Condition keys for Amazon Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonauroradsql.html#amazonauroradsql-policy-keys) in the *Service Authorization Reference*. To learn with which actions and resources you can use a condition key, see [Actions defined by Amazon Aurora DSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonauroradsql.html#amazonauroradsql-actions-as-permissions).

To view examples of Aurora DSQL identity-based policies, see [Identity-based policy examples for Amazon Aurora DSQL](security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.md).

## ACLs in Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-acls"></a>

**Supports ACLs:** No

Access control lists (ACLs) control which principals (account members, users, or roles) have permissions to access a resource. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they do not use the JSON policy document format.

## ABAC with Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-tags"></a>

**Supports ABAC (tags in policies):** Yes

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes called tags. You can attach tags to IAM entities and AWS resources, then design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the resource.

To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the [condition element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) of a policy using the `aws:ResourceTag/{{key-name}}`, `aws:RequestTag/{{key-name}}`, or `aws:TagKeys` condition keys.

If a service supports all three condition keys for every resource type, then the value is **Yes** for the service. If a service supports all three condition keys for only some resource types, then the value is **Partial**.

For more information about ABAC, see [Define permissions with ABAC authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) in the *IAM User Guide*. To view a tutorial with steps for setting up ABAC, see [Use attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Using temporary credentials with Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-roles-tempcreds"></a>

**Supports temporary credentials:** Yes

Temporary credentials provide short-term access to AWS resources and are automatically created when you use federation or switch roles. AWS recommends that you dynamically generate temporary credentials instead of using long-term access keys. For more information, see [Temporary security credentials in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) and [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Cross-service principal permissions for Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-principal-permissions"></a>

**Supports forward access sessions (FAS):** Yes

 Forward access sessions (FAS) use the permissions of the principal calling an AWS service, combined with the requesting AWS service to make requests to downstream services. For policy details when making FAS requests, see [Forward access sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_forward_access_sessions.html).

## Service roles for Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-roles-service"></a>

**Supports service roles:** Yes

 A service role is an [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM. For more information, see [Create a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

**Warning**
Changing the permissions for a service role might break Aurora DSQL functionality. Edit service roles only when Aurora DSQL provides guidance to do so.

## Service-linked roles for Aurora DSQL
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-roles-service-linked"></a>

**Supports service-linked roles:** Yes

 A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf. Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

For details about creating or managing service-linked roles for Aurora DSQL, see [Using service-linked roles in Aurora DSQL](working-with-service-linked-roles.md).
