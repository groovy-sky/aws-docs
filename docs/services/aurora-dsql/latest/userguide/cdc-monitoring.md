# Monitoring streams
<a name="cdc-monitoring"></a>

When Aurora DSQL encounters an error delivering a CDC record, the stream transitions to `IMPAIRED` status. An impaired stream continues to process and deliver other records—Aurora DSQL retries only the failing record. Aurora DSQL measures replication lag from the oldest undelivered record, and the lag grows until you resolve the issue. Aurora DSQL retains undelivered changes internally for one week.

If you resolve the underlying issue within this window, the next retry succeeds, the error state clears, and the stream transitions back to `ACTIVE`. Fix the external issue (IAM policy, AWS KMS key, Amazon Kinesis capacity, and so on) and Aurora DSQL retries automatically.

If the replication lag exceeds the failure threshold, the stream transitions to `FAILED`.

**Important**
A failed stream can't recover. You must delete the failed stream and create a new one.

## Stream lifecycle
<a name="cdc-lifecycle"></a>

A stream transitions through the following statuses during its lifecycle:
+ **`CREATING`** – Aurora DSQL is setting up the stream. Aurora DSQL doesn't deliver CDC records yet.
+ **`ACTIVE`** – The stream is operational and delivering CDC records to the target.
+ **`IMPAIRED`** – The stream has encountered an issue that requires your action. Aurora DSQL retries the failing record with exponential backoff, although other records can continue delivering. Aurora DSQL measures replication lag from the oldest undelivered record, and the lag grows until you resolve the issue. Aurora DSQL buffers undelivered changes internally for one week. See [Error code reference](#cdc-failure-reasons).
+ **`FAILED`** – The stream has encountered a persistent error and is no longer delivering CDC records. A failed stream can't recover and you must delete it. See [Error code reference](#cdc-failure-reasons) for the conditions that cause a stream to enter this state.
+ **`DELETING`** – Aurora DSQL is removing stream resources.
+ **`DELETED`** – Aurora DSQL has deleted the stream. After deletion completes, `GetStream` returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`.

Call `GetStream` to view the stream status at any time. When the stream is `IMPAIRED` or `FAILED`, the response includes a `statusReason` object with the error code and timestamp. For more details about the `GetStream` response fields, see [GetStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/APIReference/API_GetStream.html) in the Amazon Aurora DSQL API Reference.

## Troubleshooting an impaired or failed stream
<a name="cdc-troubleshooting"></a>

Follow these steps when a CDC stream becomes impaired or fails. If the stream is `FAILED`, you can't recover it—delete the stream, resolve the underlying issue, and create a new one.

1. **Get the stream status.** Call `GetStream` and verify the `status` field. If the status is `ACTIVE`, the stream is healthy.

   ```
   aws dsql get-stream \
     --cluster-identifier {{cluster-id}} \
     --stream-identifier {{stream-id}} \
     --region {{region}}
   ```

1. **Read the error code.** If the status is `IMPAIRED` or `FAILED`, the response includes a `statusReason` object. The `error` field contains the error code.

   ```
   {
       "status": "IMPAIRED",
       "statusReason": {
           "error": "KINESIS_THROUGHPUT_EXCEEDED",
           "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
       }
   }
   ```

1. **Follow the remediation.** If the stream is `IMPAIRED`, look up the error code in the following table and apply the recommended fix. Aurora DSQL retries automatically after you resolve the underlying issue. If the stream is `FAILED`, delete it, resolve the issue, and create a new stream.

## Error code reference
<a name="cdc-failure-reasons"></a>

The following table describes each error code, its cause, whether the stream can recover, and the steps to resolve it.

| Error code | Cause | Recoverable? | How to resolve |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |
| KINESIS\_THROUGHPUT\_EXCEEDED | Your Kinesis data stream exceeded its throughput limit, or AWS KMS throttled encryption operations on the Kinesis data stream, and the replication lag has grown. | Yes | Increase the number of shards on your Kinesis data stream, or switch to on-demand capacity mode. If the Kinesis data stream uses an AWS KMS customer managed key, verify that the key's request quota is large enough. After you increase capacity, Aurora DSQL retries automatically. |
| KINESIS\_STREAM\_NOT\_FOUND | The target Kinesis data stream no longer exists. | No | The stream transitions directly to FAILED. Delete the CDC stream and create a new one pointing to a valid Kinesis data stream. |
| ROLE\_ACCESS\_DENIED | Aurora DSQL can't assume the IAM role specified in the target definition. The AWS STS AssumeRole call returned AccessDenied. | Yes | Verify the role's trust policy allows the Aurora DSQL service principal (dsql.amazonaws.com) to assume it. Verify the aws:SourceAccount and aws:SourceArn conditions match your cluster. For details, see [Service role trust policy](cdc-iam.md#cdc-iam-trust-policy). After you fix the trust policy, Aurora DSQL retries automatically. |
| KINESIS\_ACCESS\_DENIED | The assumed role doesn't have permission to write to the Kinesis data stream. Kinesis returned AccessDeniedException. | Yes | Add kinesis:PutRecord and kinesis:PutRecords permissions to the role's policy for the target Kinesis data stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN). After you fix the policy, Aurora DSQL retries automatically. |
| KINESIS\_KMS\_ACCESS\_DENIED | The assumed role doesn't have permission to use the AWS KMS key that encrypts the Kinesis data stream. This error covers AWS KMS access denial and invalid key states. | Yes | Verify the role has kms:GenerateDataKey permission on the AWS KMS key that the Kinesis data stream uses. Also verify that the AWS KMS key is in an enabled and valid state. This key is the encryption key on the Kinesis data stream, not the cluster's AWS KMS key. For details, see [Service role permissions policy](cdc-iam.md#cdc-iam-permissions-policy). After you fix the permissions or key state, Aurora DSQL retries automatically. |
| KINESIS\_OVERSIZE\_RECORD | A CDC record exceeded the maximum record size configured on the Kinesis data stream. | Yes | Increase MaxRecordSizeInKiB on the Kinesis data stream to 10240 (10 MiB). You can update this setting on an existing Kinesis data stream without deleting it. After you increase the limit, Aurora DSQL retries the oversized record automatically and the stream transitions back to ACTIVE. |
| CLUSTER\_CMK\_INACCESSIBLE | The AWS KMS customer managed key that encrypts the Aurora DSQL cluster is inaccessible. | Yes | Verify the AWS KMS key policy and key state. Re-enable or restore access to the key. After the key becomes accessible again, the stream transitions back to ACTIVE. |

The preceding table lists every `StreamFailureErrorCode` value. For details about the `statusReason` response field, see [GetStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/APIReference/API_GetStream.html) in the [Amazon Aurora DSQL API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/CHAP_api_reference.html).

## Recovering an impaired stream
<a name="cdc-how-recovery-works"></a>

Most errors first transition the stream to `IMPAIRED`. An impaired stream continues to process other records and retries the failing record automatically. A `FAILED` stream isn't recoverable—you must delete it and create a new one.
+ **For recoverable errors:** fix the external issue (IAM policy, AWS KMS key, Kinesis capacity, or Kinesis record size limit). The next successful retry clears the error state and transitions the stream back to `ACTIVE`.
+ **For `KINESIS_STREAM_NOT_FOUND`:** the stream transitions directly to `FAILED`. Delete the failed stream and create a new one pointing to a valid Kinesis data stream.

For all other error codes, if the replication lag exceeds the failure threshold before you resolve the issue, the stream transitions from `IMPAIRED` to `FAILED`. A failed stream can't transition back to `ACTIVE`. Delete the failed stream, resolve the underlying issue, and create a new one.

## Monitoring stream health
<a name="cdc-stream-health"></a>

Use CloudWatch metrics and the `GetStream` API to monitor stream health. CloudWatch metrics provide continuous visibility into CDC pipeline performance, and `GetStream` provides the specific error code when a stream is impaired or failed.

For the full list of CDC metrics, including `IsImpaired`, `BehindSourceLag`, `PublishedBytes`, and `PublishedRecords`, see [CloudWatch metrics for CDC streams](#cdc-cloudwatch-metrics). For more details about the `GetStream` response fields, see [GetStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/APIReference/API_GetStream.html) in the Amazon Aurora DSQL API Reference.

## CloudWatch metrics for CDC streams
<a name="cdc-cloudwatch-metrics"></a>

Use the following CloudWatch metrics to monitor the health and throughput of each CDC stream. Aurora DSQL publishes these metrics in the `AWS/AuroraDSQL` namespace with the dimensions `ClusterId` and `StreamId`. The last metric is a standard Amazon Kinesis metric in the `AWS/Kinesis` namespace that measures downstream reading lag.

**Note**
Aurora DSQL also publishes the `BytesStreamed` and `StreamDPU` metrics in the `AWS/AuroraDSQL` namespace for usage and billing tracking. For descriptions, see [CDC stream metrics](cloudwatch-monitoring.md#cdc-stream-metrics).

| Metric name | Useful statistic | Description |
| --- |--- |--- |
| IsImpaired | Maximum | Indicates whether the stream is impaired. The value is 1 when the stream is in the IMPAIRED state, and 0 when the stream is healthy. Aurora DSQL emits this metric continuously for each active or impaired stream. Use this metric to create a CloudWatch alarm that notifies you when a stream becomes impaired. |
| BehindSourceLag | Average | The delay, in milliseconds, between when a transaction commits in Aurora DSQL and when the CDC system processes the resulting record. A rising value indicates that the CDC pipeline is falling behind the write workload. |
| PublishedBytes | Sum | The total bytes of CDC records that Aurora DSQL wrote to the target during the period. Use this metric together with your Kinesis shard count to determine whether you've provisioned enough write capacity. |
| PublishedRecords | Sum | The total number of CDC records that Aurora DSQL wrote to the target during the period. Each committed row change produces one record. |
| GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds (AWS/Kinesis) | Average | A standard Kinesis metric that reports the age of the last record read from the Kinesis data stream by your downstream app, in milliseconds. Use the StreamName dimension. A rising value indicates that your downstream app can't keep up with the rate at which Aurora DSQL writes CDC records to Kinesis. |

The Aurora DSQL console's **Monitoring** tab shows an **Average end-to-end latency** value that combines `BehindSourceLag` (CDC source latency) and `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds` (Kinesis reader lag). This combined value represents the total delay from database commit to downstream read.

## Monitoring best practices
<a name="cdc-monitoring-best-practices"></a>

Use the following practices to detect and resolve CDC pipeline issues before they affect your downstream systems.

**Set alarms on `BehindSourceLag`**
Create a CloudWatch alarm that fires when `BehindSourceLag` exceeds a threshold that matters to your workload. For example, set 60 seconds for a one-minute latency target. A sustained increase in this metric means the CDC pipeline is falling behind. If the lag reaches the failure threshold, the stream transitions to FAILED. Catching the trend gives you time to increase Kinesis capacity or investigate throughput bottlenecks before the stream degrades.

**Monitor `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds` on the Kinesis side**
Even when Aurora DSQL delivers records on time, your downstream app can fall behind. Create a CloudWatch alarm on `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds` (in the `AWS/Kinesis` namespace, dimension `StreamName`) to detect downstream lag independently. If this metric rises and `BehindSourceLag` stays flat, the bottleneck is in your downstream app, not in Aurora DSQL.

**Track `PublishedBytes` against Kinesis shard capacity**
Each Kinesis shard supports up to 1 MiB per second for writes. Compare the `PublishedBytes` Sum per minute against your total shard write capacity (number of shards × 60 MiB per minute). If usage approaches 80 percent, add shards or switch to on-demand capacity mode before throttling triggers `KINESIS_THROUGHPUT_EXCEEDED`.

**Alarm on `IsImpaired` for instant impairment detection**
Create a CloudWatch alarm that fires when `IsImpaired` Maximum is greater than or equal to `1` for one evaluation period. This gives you a direct signal when a stream enters the `IMPAIRED` state, without polling the API. After the alarm fires, call `GetStream` to read the `statusReason.error` field and follow the remediation steps in [Troubleshooting an impaired or failed stream](#cdc-troubleshooting).

**Poll `GetStream` for detailed status**
The `IsImpaired` metric tells you that a stream is impaired, but the `GetStream` API provides the specific error code and timestamp. Poll `GetStream` on a schedule (for example, every five minutes) or in response to an `IsImpaired` alarm. The `statusReason.error` field tells you what went wrong. Pair this with the troubleshooting steps in [Troubleshooting an impaired or failed stream](#cdc-troubleshooting) for quick resolution.

**Use dashboards to correlate metrics**
Create a CloudWatch dashboard that shows `IsImpaired`, `BehindSourceLag`, `PublishedRecords`, `PublishedBytes`, and `GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds` side by side. Correlating these metrics helps you distinguish between a CDC pipeline issue (rising `BehindSourceLag`) and a downstream reading issue (rising `IteratorAge` with stable `BehindSourceLag`).
