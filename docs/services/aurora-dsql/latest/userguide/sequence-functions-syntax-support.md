# Sequence manipulation functions

This section describes functions for operating on sequence objects, also called sequence
generators or just sequences. Sequence objects are special single-row tables created with
[CREATE SEQUENCE](create-sequence-syntax-support.md). Sequence objects are commonly used to generate
unique identifiers for rows of a table. The sequence functions provide simple, multiuser-safe
methods for obtaining successive sequence values from sequence objects.

###### Important

When using sequences, the cache value should be carefully considered. For
more information, see the Important callout on the [CREATE SEQUENCE](create-sequence-syntax-support.md) page.

For guidance on how best to use sequences based on workload patterns, see [Working with sequences and identity columns](sequences-identity-columns-working-with.md).

FunctionDescription`nextval ( regclass ) → bigint`Advances the sequence object to its next value and returns that value. This is done
atomically: even if multiple sessions run `nextval` concurrently, each
will safely receive a distinct sequence value. If the sequence object has been created
with default parameters, successive `nextval` calls will return increasing
values beginning with 1. Other behaviors can be obtained by using appropriate parameters
in the [CREATE SEQUENCE](create-sequence-syntax-support.md) command. This function requires
`USAGE` or `UPDATE` privilege on the sequence.`setval ( regclass, bigint [, boolean ] ) → bigint`Sets the sequence object's current value, and optionally its
`is_called` flag. The two-parameter form sets the sequence's
`last_value` field to the specified value and sets its `is_called`
field to `true`, meaning that the next `nextval` will advance the
sequence before returning a value. The value that will be reported by
`currval` is also set to the specified value. In the three-parameter form,
`is_called` can be set to either `true` or `false`.
`true` has the same effect as the two-parameter form. If it's set to
`false`, the next `nextval` will return exactly the specified
value, and sequence advancement commences with the following `nextval`.
Furthermore, the value reported by `currval` isn't changed here.
For example:

```sql

SELECT setval('myseq', 42);           -- Next nextval will return 43
SELECT setval('myseq', 42, true);     -- Same as above
SELECT setval('myseq', 42, false);    -- Next nextval will return 42
```

The result returned by `setval` is just the value of its second argument.
This function requires `UPDATE` privilege on the sequence.`currval ( regclass ) → bigint`Returns the value most recently obtained by `nextval` for this sequence
in the current session. (An error is reported if `nextval` has never been
called for this sequence in this session.) Because this is returning a session-local
value, it gives a predictable answer whether or not other sessions have run
`nextval` because the current session did. This function requires
`USAGE` or `SELECT` privilege on the sequence.`lastval () → bigint`Returns the value most recently returned by `nextval` in the current
transaction. This function is identical to `currval`, except that instead of
taking the sequence name as an argument it refers to whichever sequence
`nextval` was most recently applied to in the current transaction. It's an
error to call `lastval` if `nextval` hasn't yet been called in
the current transaction. This function requires `USAGE` or
`SELECT` privilege on the last used sequence.

###### Warning

The value obtained by `nextval` isn't reclaimed for re-use if the calling
transaction later aborts. This means that transaction aborts or database crashes can result
in gaps in the sequence of assigned values. That can happen without a transaction abort, too.
For example, an `INSERT` with an `ON CONFLICT` clause will compute the
to-be-inserted tuple, including doing any required `nextval` calls, before detecting
any conflict that would cause it to follow the `ON CONFLICT` rule instead. Thus,
Aurora DSQL's sequence objects _can't be used to obtain "gapless" sequences_.

Likewise, sequence state changes made by `setval` are immediately visible to
other transactions, and aren't undone if the calling transaction rolls back.

The sequence to be operated on by a sequence function is specified by a `regclass`
argument, which is simply the OID of the sequence in the `pg_class` system catalog.
You don't have to look up the OID by hand, however, because the `regclass` data type's
input converter will do the work for you. See the PostgreSQL documentation on
[Object Identifier\
Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-oid.html) for details.
