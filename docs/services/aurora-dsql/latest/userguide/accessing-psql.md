# Use the PostgreSQL interactive terminal (psql) to access Aurora DSQL

## Use AWS CloudShell to access Aurora DSQL with the PostgreSQL interactive terminal (psql)

Use the following procedure to access Aurora DSQL with the PostgreSQL interactive terminal from
AWS CloudShell. For more information, see [What is AWS CloudShell](../../../cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.md).

###### To connect using AWS CloudShell

1. Sign in to the [Aurora DSQL\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dsql).

2. Choose the cluster for which you would like to open in CloudShell. If you haven't yet
    created a cluster, follow the steps in [Step 1: Create an Aurora DSQL single-Region cluster](getting-started.md#getting-started-create-cluster) or [Create a multi-Region\
    cluster](getting-started.md#getting-started-multi-region).

3. Choose **Connect with Query Editor** and then choose **Connect**
**with CloudShell**.

4. Choose whether you want to connect as an admin or with a [custom database role](authentication-authorization.md#authentication-authorization-iam-role-connect).

5. Choose **Launch in CloudShell** and choose **Run**
    in the following CloudShell dialog.

## Use the local CLI to access Aurora DSQL with the PostgreSQL interactive terminal (psql)

Use `psql`, a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL utility, to interactively enter in queries, issue them to PostgreSQL, and view the query results.

###### Note

To improve query response times, use the PostgreSQL version 17 client. If you use the CLI in a
different environment, make sure you manually set up Python version 3.8+ and psql version
14+.

Download your operating system's installer from the [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download) page. For more information
about `psql`, see [PostgreSQL Client Applications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.htm) on the _PostgreSQL_ website.

If you already have the AWS CLI installed, use the following example to connect to your
cluster.

```nohighlight

# Aurora DSQL requires a valid IAM token as the password when connecting.
# Aurora DSQL provides tools for this and here we're using Python.
export PGPASSWORD=$(aws dsql generate-db-connect-admin-auth-token \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --expires-in 3600 \
  --hostname your_cluster_endpoint)

# Aurora DSQL requires SSL and will reject your connection without it.
export PGSSLMODE=require

# Connect with psql, which automatically uses the values set in PGPASSWORD and PGSSLMODE.
# Quiet mode suppresses unnecessary warnings and chatty responses but still outputs errors.
psql --quiet \
  --username admin \
  --dbname postgres \
  --host your_cluster_endpoint
```
