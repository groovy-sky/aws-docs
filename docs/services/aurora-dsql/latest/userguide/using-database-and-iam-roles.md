# Using database roles and IAM authentication
<a name="using-database-and-iam-roles"></a>

Aurora DSQL supports authentication using both IAM roles and IAM users. You can use either method to authenticate and access Aurora DSQL databases.

## IAM roles
<a name="dsql-iam-roles"></a>

An IAM role is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions but is not associated with a specific person. Using IAM roles provide temporary security credentials. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in several ways:
+ By switching roles in the AWS Management Console
+ By calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation
+ By using a custom URL

After assuming a role, you can access Aurora DSQL using the role's temporary credentials. For more information about methods for using roles, see [IAM Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in the *IAM user guide*.

## IAM users
<a name="dsql-iam-users"></a>

An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions and is associated with a single person or application. IAM users have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys that can be used to access Aurora DSQL.

**Note**
To run SQL commands with IAM authentication, you can use either IAM role ARNs or IAM user ARNs in the examples below.

## Authorizing database roles to connect to your cluster
<a name="using-database-and-iam-roles-custom-database-roles"></a>

Create an IAM role and grant connection authorization with the IAM policy action: `dsql:DbConnect`.

The IAM policy must also grant permission to access the cluster resources. Use a wildcard (`*`) or follow the instructions in [Using IAM condition keys with Amazon Aurora DSQL](using-iam-condition-keys.md#using-iam-condition-keys-create-cluster).

## Authorizing database roles to use SQL in your database
<a name="using-database-and-iam-roles-custom-database-roles-sql"></a>

You must use an IAM role with authorization to connect to your cluster.

1. Connect to your Aurora DSQL cluster using a SQL utility.

   Use the `admin` database role with an IAM identity that is authorized for IAM action `dsql:DbConnectAdmin` to connect to your cluster.

1. Create a new database role, making sure to specify the `WITH LOGIN` option.

   ```
   CREATE ROLE example WITH LOGIN;
   ```

1. Associate the database role with the IAM role ARN.

   ```
   AWS IAM GRANT example TO 'arn:aws:iam::{{012345678912}}:role/{{example}}';
   ```

1. Grant database-level permissions to the database role

   The following examples use the `GRANT` command to provide authorization within the database.

   ```
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA myschema TO example;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA myschema TO example;
   ```

For more information, see [PostgreSQL `GRANT`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html) and [PostgreSQL Privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## Viewing IAM to database role mappings
<a name="using-database-and-iam-roles-view-mappings"></a>

To view the mappings between IAM roles and database roles, query the `sys.iam_pg_role_mappings` system table.

```
SELECT * FROM sys.iam_pg_role_mappings;
```

Example output:

```
 iam_oid |                  arn                   | pg_role_oid | pg_role_name | grantor_pg_role_oid | grantor_pg_role_name
---------+----------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+---------------------+----------------------
   {{26398}} | arn:aws:iam::{{012345678912}}:role/{{example}} |       {{26396}} | {{example}}      |               {{15579}} | admin
(1 row)
```

This table shows all the mappings between IAM roles (identified by their ARN) and PostgreSQL database roles.

## Revoking database authorization from an IAM role
<a name="using-database-and-iam-roles-revoke"></a>

To revoke database authorization, use the `AWS IAM REVOKE` operation.

```
AWS IAM REVOKE example FROM 'arn:aws:iam::{{012345678912}}:role/{{example}}';
```

To learn more about revoking authorization, see [Revoking authorization using IAM and PostgreSQL](authentication-authorization.md#authentication-authorization-revoke).
