# Use JetBrains DataGrip to access Aurora DSQL
<a name="accessing-datagrip"></a>

JetBrains DataGrip is a cross-platform IDE for working with SQL and databases, including PostgreSQL. DataGrip includes a robust GUI with an intelligent SQL editor. To download DataGrip, go to the [download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download) on the *JetBrains* website.

**To set up a new Aurora DSQL connection in JetBrains DataGrip**

1. Choose **New Data Source** and choose PostgreSQL.

1. In the **Data Sources/General** tab, enter the following information:

   1. **Host** – Use your cluster endpoint.

     **Port** – Aurora DSQL uses the PostgreSQL default: `5432`

     **Database** – Aurora DSQL uses the PostgreSQL default of `postgres`

     **Authentication** – Choose `User & Password `.

     **Username** – Enter `admin`.

     **Password** – [ Generate a token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_authentication-token.html) and paste it into this field.

     **URL** – Don't modify this field. It will be auto-populated based on the other fields.

1.  **Password** – Provide this by generating an authentication token. Copy the resulting output of the token generator and paste it into the password field.
**Note**
You must set SSL mode in the client connections. Aurora DSQL supports `PGSSLMODE=require and PGSSLMODE=verify-full`. Aurora DSQL enforces SSL communication on the server side and rejects non-SSL connections. For the `verify-full` option you will need to install the SSL certificates locally. For more information see [SSL/TLS certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/configure-root-certificates.html).

1. You should be connected to your cluster and can start running SQL statements:

**Important**
Some views provided by DataGrip for PostgreSQL databases (such as Sessions) don't apply to Aurora DSQL databases because of their unique architecture. While accessible, these screens don't provide reliable information about the actual sessions connected to the database.
