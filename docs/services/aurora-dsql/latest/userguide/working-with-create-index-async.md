# Asynchronous indexes in Aurora DSQL
<a name="working-with-create-index-async"></a>

The `CREATE INDEX ASYNC` command creates an index on one or more columns of a specified table. This command is an asynchronous DDL operation that doesn't block other transactions. When you run `CREATE INDEX ASYNC`, Aurora DSQL immediately returns a `job_id`.

You can monitor the status of this asynchronous job using the `sys.jobs` system view. While the index creation job is in progress, you can use these procedures and commands:

**`sys.wait_for_job(job_id){{'your_index_creation_job_id'}}`**
Blocks the current session until the specified job completes or fails. Returns a Boolean value indicating success or failure.

**`DROP INDEX`**
Cancels an in-progress index build job.
When the asynchronous index creation completes, Aurora DSQL updates the system catalog to mark the index as active.
 Note that concurrent transactions accessing objects in the same namespace during this update might encounter concurrency errors.

When Aurora DSQL finishes an asynchronous index task, it updates the system catalog to show that the index is active. If other transactions reference the objects in the same namespace at this time, you might see a concurrency error.

For the supported syntax and a description of each parameter, see [`CREATE INDEX`](create-index-syntax-support.md).

## Usage notes
<a name="working-with-create-index-usage-notes"></a>

Consider the following guidelines:
+ The `CREATE INDEX ASYNC` command doesn't introduce locks. It also doesn't affect the base table that Aurora DSQL uses to create the index.
+ During schema migration operations, the `sys.wait_for_job(job_id){{'your_index_creation_job_id'}}` procedure is useful. It ensures that subsequent DDL and DML operations target the newly created index.
+ Every time Aurora DSQL runs a new asynchronous task, it checks the `sys.jobs` view and deletes tasks that have a status of `completed` or `failed` for more than 30 minutes. Thus, `sys.jobs` primarily shows in-progress tasks and doesn’t contain information about old tasks.
+ If Aurora DSQL fails to build an asynchronous index, the index stays `INVALID`. For unique indexes, DML operations are subject to uniqueness constraints until you drop the index. We recommend that you drop invalid indexes and recreate them.

## Creating an index: example
<a name="working-with-create-index-example"></a>

The following example demonstrates how to create a schema, a table, and then an index.

1. Create a table named `test.departments`.

   ```
   CREATE SCHEMA test;

   CREATE TABLE test.departments (name varchar(255) primary key NOT null,
        manager varchar(255),
        size varchar(4));
   ```

1. Insert a row into the table.

   ```
   INSERT INTO test.departments VALUES ('Human Resources', 'John Doe', '10')
   ```

1. Create an asynchronous index.

   ```
   CREATE INDEX ASYNC test_index on test.departments(name, manager, size);
   ```

   The `CREATE INDEX` command returns a job ID, as shown below.

   ```
   job_id
   --------------------------
   jh2gbtx4mzhgfkbimtgwn5j45y
   ```

   The `job_id` indicates that Aurora DSQL has submitted a new job to create the index. You can use the procedure `sys.wait_for_job(job_id){{'your_index_creation_job_id'}}` to block other work on the session until the job finishes or times out.

## Querying the status of index creation: example
<a name="dsql-index-status-example"></a>

Query the `sys.jobs` system view to check the creation status of your index, as shown in the following example.

```
SELECT * FROM sys.jobs where job_id = 'wqhu6ewifze5xitg3umt24h5ua';
```

Aurora DSQL returns a response similar to the following.

```
           job_id           |  status   | details |  job_type   | class_id | object_id |    object_name    |       start_time       |      update_time
----------------------------+-----------+---------+-------------+----------+-----------+-------------------+------------------------+------------------------
 wqhu6ewifze5xitg3umt24h5ua | completed |         | INDEX_BUILD |     1259 |     26433 | public.nt2_c1_idx | 2025-09-25 22:07:31+00 | 2025-09-25 22:07:46+00
```

The status column can be one of the following values.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| submitted | The task is submitted, but Aurora DSQL hasn't started to process it yet. |
| processing | Aurora DSQL is processing the task. |
| failed | The task failed. See the details column for more information. If Aurora DSQL failed to build the index, Aurora DSQL doesn't automatically remove the index definition. You must manually remove the index with the DROP INDEX command. |
| completed | Aurora DSQL has completed the task successfully. |

You can also query the state of the index via the catalog tables `pg_index`and `pg_class`. Specifically, the attributes `indisvalid` and `indisimmediate` can tell you what state your index is in. While Aurora DSQL creates your index, it has an initial status of `INVALID`. The `indisvalid` flag for the index returns `FALSE` or `f`, which indicates that the index isn't valid. If the flag returns `TRUE` or `t`, the index is ready.

```
SELECT relname AS index_name, indisvalid as is_valid, pg_get_indexdef(indexrelid) AS index_definition
from pg_index, pg_class
WHERE pg_class.oid = indexrelid AND indrelid = 'test.departments'::regclass;
```

```
    index_name    | is_valid |                                                 index_definition
------------------+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 department_pkey  |     t    | CREATE UNIQUE INDEX department_pkey ON test.departments USING btree_index (title) INCLUDE (name, manager, size)
 test_index1      |     t    | CREATE INDEX test_index1 ON test.departments USING btree_index (name, manager, size)
```

## Unique index build failures
<a name="unique-index-failures"></a>

If your asynchronous unique index build job shows a failed state with the detail `Found duplicate key while validating index for UCVs`, this indicates that a unique index could not be built due to uniqueness constraint violations.

**To resolve unique index build failures**

1. Remove any rows in your primary table that have duplicate entries for the keys specified in your unique secondary index.

1. Drop the failed index.

1. Issue a new create index command.

## Detecting uniqueness violations in primary tables
<a name="detect-uniqueness-violation"></a>

The following SQL query helps you identify duplicate values in a specified column of your table. This is particularly useful when you need to enforce uniqueness on a column that isn't currently set as a primary key or doesn't have a unique constraint, such as email addresses in a user table.

 The examples below demonstrate how to create a sample users table, populate it with test data containing known duplicates, and then run the detection query.

** Define table schema **

```
-- Drop the table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;

-- Create the users table with a simple integer primary key
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Insert sample data that includes sets of duplicate email addresses**

```
-- Insert sample data with explicit IDs
INSERT INTO users (user_id, email, first_name, last_name) VALUES
    (1, 'john.doe@example.com', 'John', 'Doe'),
    (2, 'jane.smith@example.com', 'Jane', 'Smith'),
    (3, 'john.doe@example.com', 'Johnny', 'Doe'),
    (4, 'alice.wong@example.com', 'Alice', 'Wong'),
    (5, 'bob.jones@example.com', 'Bob', 'Jones'),
    (6, 'alice.wong@example.com', 'Alicia', 'Wong'),
    (7, 'bob.jones@example.com', 'Robert', 'Jones');
```

** Run duplicate detection query **

```
-- Query to find duplicates
WITH duplicates AS (
    SELECT email, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
    FROM users
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT u.*, d.duplicate_count
FROM users u
INNER JOIN duplicates d ON u.email = d.email
ORDER BY u.email, u.user_id;
```

** View all records with duplicate email addresses **

```
 user_id |         email          | first_name | last_name |         created_at         | duplicate_count
---------+------------------------+------------+-----------+----------------------------+-----------------
       4 | akua.mansa@example.com | Akua       | Mansa     | 2025-05-21 20:55:53.714432 |               2
       6 | akua.mansa@example.com | Akua       | Mansa     | 2025-05-21 20:55:53.714432 |               2
       1 | john.doe@example.com   | John       | Doe       | 2025-05-21 20:55:53.714432 |               2
       3 | john.doe@example.com   | Johnny     | Doe       | 2025-05-21 20:55:53.714432 |               2
(4 rows)
```

**If we were to try the index creation statement now, it would fail: **

```
postgres=> CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ASYNC idx_users_email ON users(email);
      job_id
