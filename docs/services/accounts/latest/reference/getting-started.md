# Getting started with an AWS account

If you're new to AWS, you need to sign up for an AWS account. When you do so, AWS
will create an account using the details you provide and assign it to you.

To sign up for an AWS account, you'll need to provide the following information:

- **Root user email**
**address** – The email address is used as the sign-in
name for the [root user](root-user.md) and is required for account
recovery. You must be able to receive email messages that are sent to this address.
Before you can perform certain tasks, you must verify that you have access to email
sent to this address.

- **AWS account name** – The name of the
account appears in several places, such as on your invoice, and in consoles such as
the Billing and Cost Management dashboard and the AWS Organizations console. We recommend that you use a standard
way to name your accounts so that you can give your accounts names that are easy to
recognize. For company accounts, consider using a naming standard such as _organization_- _purpose_- _environment_ (for example,
_AnyCompany_- _audit_- _prod_). For personal
accounts, consider using a naming standard such as _first_
_name_- _last name_- _purpose_ (for example, _paulo-santos-testaccount_).

- **Address** – If your contact and billing
address is in India, the user agreement for your account is with Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (AWS India), a
local AWS seller in India. You must provide your CVV as part of the verification
process. You might also have to enter a one-time password, depending on your bank.
AWS India charges your payment method 2 INR as part of the verification process.
AWS India refunds the 2 INR after verification is complete.

- **Phone number** – This number is used for
identity verification purposes and to confirm the ownership of your account. You must
be able to receive calls and SMS messages at this phone number.

###### Important

If this account is for a business, use a corporate phone number so that your
company can retain access to the AWS account even when an employee changes
positions or leaves the company.

## Step 1: Create your account

These instructions are for creating an AWS account outside of India. For creating an
account in India, see [Create an AWS account with AWS India](managing-accounts-india.md#create-india-account). For creating an account that's part of an organization
managed by AWS Organizations, see [Creating a member account in an\
organization](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-accounts-create.md) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

AWS Management Console

###### To create an AWS account

01. Open the [Sign up for AWS](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register) page.

02. Enter the root user email address and AWS account name, and then choose
     **Verify email address**. This sends a
     verification code to your email address.

    ###### Important

    If this account is for a business, use a secure corporate
    distribution list (for example, `it.admins@example.com`)
    so that your company can retain access to the AWS account even
    when an employee changes positions or leaves the company. Because
    the email address can be used to reset the account's root user
    credentials, protect access to this distribution list or
    address.

03. Enter your verification code, and then choose
     **Verify**.

04. Enter a strong password for your root user, confirm it, and then choose
     **Continue**. AWS requires that your password
     meet the following conditions:

- It must have a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128
characters.

- It must include a minimum of three of the following mix of
character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and ! @ # $ % ^
& \\* () <\> \[\] {} \| \_+-= symbols.

- It must not be identical to your AWS account name or email
address.

05. Choose your account plan. For more information, see [Free\
     Tier plans](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-plans.md).

06. Enter your contact information, then read and accept the [AWS Customer\
     Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement). Make sure you understand the terms before
     accepting.

    ###### Important

    If this account is for a business, it's a best practice to enter a
    company phone number rather than a number for a personal phone.
    Configuring the account's root user with an individual email address or
    a personal phone number can make your account insecure.

07. Enter your billing information. If you want to use a different
     billing address for your AWS billing information, choose
     **Use a new address**.

    You can't proceed with the sign-up process until you add a valid
     payment method.

08. You might need to confirm your identity:
    1. For **Country or region code**, enter a phone number that can
        be reached in the next few minutes.

    2. For **Phone number**, enter a phone number that can be reached in the next few minutes.

    3. Choose **Send SMS**.

    4. When the automated system contacts you, enter the code you
        receive and then choose
        **Continue**.
09. Choose one of the available AWS Support plans. For a description of the
     available Support plans and their benefits, see [Compare Support\
     plans](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/features).

10. Choose **Complete sign up**. A confirmation page
     appears that indicates that your account is being activated.

11. Check your email and spam folder for an email message that confirms
     your account was activated. Activation usually takes a few minutes but
     can sometimes take up to 24 hours.

12. After you receive the activation message, you can sign-in to the
     [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) to start using AWS services. For general information
     about how to manage your account settings, see [Configure your AWS account](managing-accounts.md).

For multiple AWS accounts managed through AWS Organizations, assign administrative
access to an administrative user in IAM Identity Center. For instructions, see [Set up AWS account access for an IAM Identity Center administrative user](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-assign-account-access-admin-user.md) in
the _IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

AWS CLI & SDKs

You can create member accounts in an organization that is managed by AWS Organizations
by running the [CreateAccount](../../../../reference/organizations/latest/apireference/api-createaccount.md) operation
while signed in to the organization's management account.

You can't create a standalone AWS account outside of an organization by
using an AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API operation.

## Step 2: (Recommended) Install the AWS CLI

Install the AWS CLI by following the instructions at [Installing the\
AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md). You need version 2.32.0 or later.

You can use the AWS CLI to have an agent manage AWS resources on your behalf.

After you install the AWS CLI, use the following command to sign in
programmatically:

```bash

aws login
```

This automatically rotates your credentials every 15 minutes, keeping your session
valid for up to 12 hours without manual intervention.

Use the following command to verify your credentials are working:

```bash

aws sts get-caller-identity
```

For more information about accessing your AWS account, see [Accessing your AWS account](accounts-access-account.md).

## Step 3: (Recommended) Set up the AWS MCP Server

The AWS MCP Server is a managed server that gives agents access to AWS through the
Model Context Protocol (MCP). Agents can search AWS documentation and retrieve service
information without authentication. To execute AWS API calls, run Python scripts in a
sandboxed environment, or follow curated skills, agents authenticate through your
existing IAM credentials. For more information, see [What is the AWS\
Agent Toolkit?](../../../agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/what-is-agent-toolkit.md)
