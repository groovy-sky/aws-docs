# Enable trusted access for AWS Account Management

Enabling trusted access for AWS Account Management allows the administrator of the management account
to modify the information and metadata (for example, primary or alternate contact details)
specific to each member account in AWS Organizations. For more information, see [AWS Account Management and AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-account.html#integrate-enable-ta-account) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_. For
general information about how trusted access works, see [Using AWS Organizations with other AWS\
services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html).

After trusted access has been enabled, you can use the `accountID` parameter in
those [Account Management API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/API_Operations.html) that support it. You can
use this parameter successfully only if you call the operation using credentials from the
management account, or from the delegated admin account for your organization if you enable
one. For more information, see [Enable a delegated admin account for AWS Account Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/using-orgs-delegated-admin.html).

Use the following procedure to enable trusted access for Account Management in your
organization.
