# DisableRegion

Disables (opts-out) a particular Region for an account.

###### Note

The act of disabling a Region will remove all IAM access to any resources that
reside in that Region.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

POST /disableRegion HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json

{
   "AccountId": "string",
   "RegionName": "string"
}
```

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[AccountId](#API_DisableRegion_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the 12-digit account ID number of the AWS account that you want to access
or modify with this operation. If you don't specify this parameter, it defaults to the
Amazon Web Services account of the identity used to call the operation. To use this
parameter, the caller must be an identity in the [organization's\
management account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#account) or a delegated administrator account. The specified
account ID must be a member account in the same organization. The organization must have
[all features\
enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html), and the organization must have [trusted access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html) enabled for
the Account Management service, and optionally a [delegated\
admin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html#delegated-admin) account assigned.

###### Note

The management account can't specify its own `AccountId`. It must call
the operation in standalone context by not including the `AccountId`
parameter.

To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an organization, don't
specify this parameter. Instead, call the operation using an identity belonging to the
account whose contacts you wish to retrieve or modify.

Type: String

Pattern: `\d{12}`

Required: No

**[RegionName](#API_DisableRegion_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the Region-code for a given Region name (for example,
`af-south-1`). When you disable a Region, AWS performs actions to
deactivate that Region in your account, such as destroying IAM resources in the Region.
This process takes a few minutes for most accounts, but this can take several hours. You
cannot enable the Region until the disabling process is fully completed.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 50.

Required: Yes

## Response Syntax

```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.
