# Update your AWS account name

When managing multiple AWS accounts, use clear naming conventions aligned with business
units and applications for identification and organization. During reorganizations, mergers,
acquisitions, or naming convention updates, you might need to rename accounts to maintain
consistent identification and administrative standards.

The name of an account appears in several places, such as on your invoice and in consoles
such as the Billing and Cost Management dashboard and the AWS Organizations console. We
recommend that you use a standard way to name your accounts so that your account names are
easy to recognize. For company accounts, consider using a naming standard such as _organization_- _purpose_- _environment_ (for example,
_sales_- _catalog_- _prod_). For privacy and security
reasons, avoid using account names that reflect personally identifiable information
(PII).

- **Standalone AWS accounts –** For
AWS accounts not associated with an organization, you can update your account name
using the AWS Management Console, or the AWS CLI and SDKs. To learn how to do this, see [Update your account name for a standalone AWS account](#update-account-name-standalone).

- **AWS accounts within an organization –**
For member accounts that are part of a AWS Organizations, a user in the management account or
delegated admin account can centrally update the account name of any member account
in the organization from the AWS Organizations console, or programmatically via the AWS CLI and
SDKs. To learn how to do this, see [Update your account name for any AWS account in your organization](#update-account-name-orgs).

###### Note

Changes to an AWS account can take up to four hours to propagate everywhere.
