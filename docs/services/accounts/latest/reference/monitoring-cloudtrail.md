# Logging AWS Account Management API calls using AWS CloudTrail

The AWS Account Management APIs are integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of
actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service that calls an Account Management operation. CloudTrail
captures all Account Management API calls as events. The calls captured include all calls to the Account Management
operations. If you create a trail, you can turn on continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an
Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Account Management operations. If you don't configure a trail, you can
still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event history**.
Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that called an Account Management
operation, the IP address used to make the request, who made the request and when, and
additional details.

To learn more about CloudTrail, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide.md).

## Account Management information in CloudTrail

CloudTrail is turned on in your AWS account when you create the account. When activity
occurs with an Account Management operation, CloudTrail records that activity in a CloudTrail event along with
other AWS service events in **Event history**. You can view, search,
and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event\
History](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md).

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Account Management
operations, create a trail. A _trail_ enables CloudTrail to deliver log
files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the AWS Management Console, the trail
applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS
partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can
configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected
in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

- [Overview\
for creating a trail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.md)

- [CloudTrail supported services and integrations](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics.md#cloudtrail-aws-service-specific-topics-integrations)

- [Configuring\
Amazon SNS notifications for CloudTrail](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/getting-notifications-top-level.md)

- [Receiving CloudTrail log files from multiple Regions](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.md)

- [Receiving CloudTrail log files from multiple accounts](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.md)

AWS CloudTrail logs all Account Management API operations found in the [API\
Reference](api-reference.md) section of this guide. For example, calls to the
`CreateAccount`, `DeleteAlternateContact`, and
`PutAlternateContact` operations generate entries in the CloudTrail log
files.

Every event or log entry contains information about who generated the request. The
identity information helps you determine the following:

- Whether the request was made with root user or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user
credentials

- Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for an IAM
role or federated user

- Whether the request was made by another AWS service

For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity\
element](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.md).

## Understanding the Account Management log entries

A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3
bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event
represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested
operation, the date and time of the operation, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log
files aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't appear in any
specific order.

**Example 1:** The following example shows a CloudTrail log
entry for a call to the `GetAlternateContact` operation to retrieve the
current `OPERATIONS` alternate contact for an account. The values returned by
the operation aren't included in the logged information.
