## I don’t know how to delete or cancel my account

To close your account, follow the instructions in [Close an AWS account](manage-acct-closing.md).

## I don’t see the Close account button on the Accounts page

If you are not signed in as the root user, you will not see the **Close**
**account** button displayed on the **Accounts** page. You
must [Sign\
in to the AWS Management Console as the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial.html) to close your account. If you can’t
sign in, see [Troubleshooting issues\
with the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting_root-user.html).

## I closed my account but still haven’t received an email confirmation

This confirmation email is only sent to the root user email
address for the
AWS account. If you don’t receive this email within a few hours, you can [Sign\
in to the AWS Management Console as the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial.html) to check that your account is closed.
If your account was closed successfully, you will see a message displayed that indicates
your account is closed. If the account you closed is a member account, you can verify
successful closure by checking if the closed account is labeled as
`CLOSED` in the AWS Organizations console. For more information, see [Closing a\
member account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html) in the
_AWS Organizations User Guide_.

If you are trying to close a **management account** and
do not receive an email confirmation about the account closure, your organization most
likely has active member accounts. You can only close the management account if your
organization doesn’t have any active member accounts.
To verify that there are no active member accounts
remaining in your organization, go to the AWS Organizations console, and make sure that all
member accounts are showing `Closed` next to their account names. After
that, you can close the management account.

## I receive a "ConstraintViolationException" error when trying to close my account

You are trying to close a management account using the AWS Organizations console, which is not
possible. To close a management account, you need to [Sign\
in to the AWS Management Console as the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial.html) for the management account and close it
from the **Accounts** page. For more information, see [Closing a\
management account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close_management.html) in the
_AWS Organizations User Guide_.

## I receive a "CLOSE\_ACCOUNT\_QUOTA\_EXCEEDED" error when trying to close a member account

You can only close 10% of member accounts within a rolling 30 day period. This quota
is not bound by a calendar month, but starts when you close an account. Within 30 days
of that initial account closure, you can't exceed the 10% account closure limit. The
minimum account closure is 10 and the maximum account closure is 1000, even if 10% of
accounts exceeds 1000. For more information about Organizations quotas, see [Quotas for AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_reference_limits.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

## Do I need to delete my AWS organization before closing the management account?

No, you don’t need to delete your AWS organization before closing the management
account. However, you can only close the management account if your organization doesn’t
have any active member accounts. To verify that there are no active member accounts
remaining in your organization, go to the AWS Organizations console, and make sure that all
member accounts are showing `Closed` next to their account names. After
that, you can close the management account.
