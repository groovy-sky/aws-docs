# PutAccountName

Updates the account name of the specified account. To use this API, IAM principals
must have the `account:PutAccountName` IAM permission.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

POST /putAccountName HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json

{
   "AccountId": "string",
   "AccountName": "string"
}
```

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[AccountId](#API_PutAccountName_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the 12 digit account ID number of the AWS account that
you want to access or modify with this operation.

If you do not specify this parameter, it defaults to the AWS account of the
identity used to call the operation.

To use this parameter, the caller must be an identity in the [organization's management account](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-getting-started-concepts.md#account) or a delegated administrator account, and
the specified account ID must be a member account in the same organization. The
organization must have [all features \
enabled](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage-org-support-all-features.md), and the organization must have [trusted access](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-account.md) enabled for the
Account Management service, and optionally a [delegated\
administrator](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-getting-started-concepts.md#delegated-admin) account
assigned.

###### Note

The management account can't specify its own `AccountId`; it must call
the operation in standalone context by not including the `AccountId`
parameter.

To call this operation on an account that is not a member of an organization, then
don't specify this parameter, and call the operation using an identity belonging to
the account whose contacts you wish to retrieve or modify.
