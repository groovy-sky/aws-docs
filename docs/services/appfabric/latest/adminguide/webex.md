## AppFabric support for Webex
<a name="webex-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Webex.

### Prerequisites
<a name="webex-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Webex to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have a Collaboration Flex plan, Meet Plan, Call Plan, or higher. For more information about creating or upgrading to the applicable Webex plan type, see [Webex pricing for all features](https://pricing.webex.com/us/en/hybrid-work/meetings/all-features/) on the Webex website.
+ Your account must have the [Pro Pack](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/np3c1rm/Pro-Pack-For-Control-Hub) license to access Security Audit Events provided by one of the Cisco AuditLog APIs.
+ You must have a user with the **Organizational Administrator** > **Full Administrator** role.
+ The **Administrator Roles** configuration for your **Full Administrator** must have the **Compliance Officer** option enabled.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="webex-rate-limits"></a>

Webex imposes rate limits on the Webex API. For more information about the Webex API rate limits, see [Rate limits](https://developer.webex.com/docs/basics#upper-limits-for-api-requests) in the *Webex Developers Guide* on the Webex website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Webex API applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="webex-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Webex account
<a name="webex-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Webex. To find the information required to authorize Webex with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="webex-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with Webex using OAuth. To create an OAuth application in Webex, use the following steps:

1. Follow the instructions in the [Registering your Integration](https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations#registering-your-integration) section in the **Integrations & Authorization** page of the *Webex Developers Guide*.

1. Use a redirect URL with the following format.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, `{{<region>}}` is the code for the AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

### Required scopes
<a name="webex-required-scopes"></a>

You must add the following scopes to your Webex OAuth application:
+ `spark-compliance:events_read`
+ `audit:events_read`
+ `spark-admin:people_read`

### App authorizations
<a name="webex-app-authorizations"></a>

#### Tenant ID
<a name="webex-tenant-id"></a>

AppFabric will request your tenant ID. The tenant ID in AppFabric is your Webex organization ID. For information about how to find your Webex organization ID, see [Look Up Your Organization ID in CiscoWebex Control Hub](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/k5pal8/Look-Up-Your-Organization-ID-in-Cisco-Webex-Control-Hub) on the Webex Help Center website.

#### Tenant name
<a name="webex-temant-names"></a>

Enter a name that identifies this unique Webex instance. AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions created from the app authorization.

#### Client ID
<a name="webex-client-id"></a>

AppFabric will request your Webex client ID. To find your Webex client ID, use the following steps:

1. Sign into your Webex account at [https://developer.webex.com](https://developer.webex.com).

1. Choose your avatar at the top right.

1. Choose **My Webex Apps**.

1. Choose the OAuth2 application that you use for AppFabric.

1. Enter the client ID on this page into the **Client ID** field in AppFabric.

#### Client secret
<a name="webex-client-secret"></a>

AppFabric will request your Webex client secret. Webex only presents your client secret once when you initially create your OAuth application. To generate a new client secret if you didn't save the initial client secret, use the following steps:

1. Sign into your Webex account at [https://developer.webex.com](https://developer.webex.com).

1. Choose your avatar at the top right.

1. Choose **My Webex Apps**.

1. Choose the OAuth2 application that you use for AppFabric.

1. On this page, generate a new client secret.

1. Enter the new client secret into the **Client secret** field in AppFabric.

#### Approve authorization
<a name="webex-approve-authorization"></a>

After creating the app authorization in AppFabric you will receive a pop-up window from Webex to approve the authorization. To approve the AppFabric authorization, choose **accept**.
