# Monitoring AWS AppFabric with Amazon CloudWatch

You can monitor AWS AppFabric using CloudWatch, which collects raw data and processes it into
readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are kept for 15 months, so that you can
access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or
service is performing. You can also set alarms that watch for certain thresholds, and send
notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met. For more information, see the
[Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring.md).

The AppFabric service reports the following metrics in the `AWS/AppFabric`
namespace.
