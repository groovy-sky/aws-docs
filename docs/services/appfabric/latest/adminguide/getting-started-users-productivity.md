# Get started with AppFabric for productivity (preview) for end users

The AWS AppFabric for productivity feature is in preview and is subject to change.

This section is intended for end users of SaaS applications who want to enable AWS AppFabric for productivity
(preview) to improve their task management and workflow efficiency. Follow these steps to connect
your applications and authorize AppFabric to surface cross-app insights and help you complete actions
(such as send an email or schedule a meeting) from your preferred applications. You can connect
applications such as Asana, Atlassian Jira Suite, Google
Workspace, Microsoft 365, Miro, Slack,
Smartsheet, and more. After you authorize AppFabric to access your content, AppFabric
brings cross-app insights and actions directly within your preferred apps — helping you work more
efficiently and stay within your current workflows.

AppFabric for productivity uses generative AI that is powered by Amazon Bedrock. AppFabric will generate insights and
actions only after receiving your explicit permission. You authorize each individual application
to remain in full control of which content is used. AppFabric will not use your data to train or
improve the underlying large language models used to generate insights. For more information,
please see [Amazon Bedrock FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/faqs).

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the following:

- Credentials to sign in to AppFabric: To start using AppFabric for productivity, you will need federated
sign-in credentials (user name and password) for one of the following providers:
Asana, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, or
Slack. Signing in to AppFabric helps us identify you as a user across each
application you enable AppFabric for productivity. After signing in, you can connect your applications to start
generating insights.

- Credentials to connect your applications: Cross-app insights and actions are only
generated based on applications that you authorize. You will need sign-in credentials (user
name and password) for each of the applications you want to authorize. Supported applications
include Asana, Atlassian Jira Suite, Google
Workspace, Microsoft 365, Miro, Slack,
and Smartsheet.

## Step 1. Sign in to AppFabric

Connect applications to AppFabric to bring your content and insights directly within your
preferred applications.

1. Every application will use AppFabric for productivity in different ways to bring you richer app
    experiences. Due to this, every application will have a different entry point to reach the
    AppFabric for productivity home page below. The home page sets context about the process to enable AppFabric and
    first prompts you to sign in. Every application you want to enable AppFabric in will reach this
    screen.

![Sign-in prompt for AWS AppFabric, highlighting AI-powered productivity features.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-01.png)

2. Sign in with your credentials from one of these providers: Asana,
    Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, or Slack. For
    the best experience, we recommend signing in using the same provider for each application you
    enable AppFabric in. For instance, if you choose Google Workspace credentials in App1, we recommend
    choosing Google Workspace in App2, as well as every other time you need to sign
    back in. If you sign in with a different provider, you’ll need to restart the process of
    connecting applications.

![AWS AppFabric sign-in page with options for Slack, Microsoft, Google, and Asana.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-02.png)

3. If prompted, enter your sign-in credentials and accept signing into AppFabric from this
    provider.

![Sign-in interface for AWS AppFabric with Slack, showing account selection and connection details.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-04.png)

## Step 2. Provide consent for the app to display insights

After signing in, AppFabric will display a consent page asking if you allow AppFabric to display
cross-app insights and actions inside the application you’re enabling AppFabric for productivity in.
For example, do you allow AppFabric to take your Google Workspace emails and calendar
events and display them in Asana. You only need to complete this consent step one
time per application that you enable AppFabric in.

![Dialog box requesting permission to display insights and artifacts within an application.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-05.png)

## Step 3. Connect your applications to generate insights and actions

After you complete the consent page, you're taken to the **Connect**
**applications** page where you can connect, disconnect, or reconnect individual
applications that are ultimately used to generate your cross-app insights and actions. In most
cases, after you’ve signed in and provided consent, you'll continue to use this page to manage
your connected applications.

To connect an application, choose the **Connect** button next to any
application that you use.

![List of applications to connect, including Smartsheet, Slack, and Google Workspace, all showing as not connected.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-06.png)

You will need to provide your sign-in credentials for the application, and allow AppFabric
permission to access your data to generate insights and complete actions.

![Dialog box requesting permission for AWS AppFabric to access Slack workspace data.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-07.png)

After you successfully connect an application, the Status for that application will change
from “Not Connected” to “Connected”. Reminder: you need to complete this authorization step for
every application you want to be used for generating insights and actions.

After you connect an application, it's not connected forever. You'll need to periodically
re-connect applications. We do this to ensure we still have your permission to generate
insights.

The possible application statuses are:

- Connected - AppFabric is authorized and is generating insights using your data from this
application.

- Not Connected - AppFabric isn't generating insights using data from this application. You can
connect to begin generating insights.

- Authorization failed. Please reconnect. - There may be an authorization failure with a
specific application. If you see this error, try reconnecting your application using the
**Connect** button.

![Application connection status interface showing connected and unconnected apps.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-08.png)

The set up is complete and you can return to your application. It can take at least a few
hours to start seeing insights inside your applications.

As needed, you can navigate back to this page to manage your connected applications. If you
choose to **Disconnect** an application, AppFabric will stop using data from that
application or gathering new data to generate new insights. Data from disconnected applications
will be automatically be deleted within 7 days if you choose to not reconnect the application in
that time.

## Step 4. Start seeing insights and execute cross-app actions in your application

After you connect your applications with AppFabric, you'll have access to valuable insights and
the ability to perform cross-app actions directly from your preferred application. Note: this
functionality is not guaranteed in each app and entirely dependent on which AppFabric for productivity features
the application developer has chosen to enable.

**Cross-app insights**

AppFabric for productivity offers two types of insights:

- Actionable insights: AppFabric analyzes information from your emails, calendar events, tasks,
and messages across your connected apps and generates key insights that may be important for
you to prioritize. Additionally, AppFabric may generate recommended actions (such as send email,
schedule meeting, and create task) that you can edit and execute while staying in your
preferred application. For example, you may receive an insight saying there’s a customer
escalation to deal with and a suggested next action to schedule a meeting with your
customer.

- Meeting preparation insights: This feature helps you best prepare for upcoming meetings.
AppFabric will analyze your upcoming meetings and generate a concise summary about the meeting
purpose. Additionally, it will surface relevant artifacts (such as emails, messages, and tasks)
from your connected applications that will be useful to help you efficiently prepare for the
meeting without switching between apps to find content.

**Cross-app actions**

For certain insights, AppFabric may also generate recommended actions such as sending an email,
scheduling a meeting, or creating a task. When generating actions, AppFabric may pre-populate certain
fields based on the content and context of your connected applications. For example, AppFabric may
generate a suggested email response or task name based on the insight. When you click on a
suggested action, you will be taken to an AppFabric owned user interface where you can edit the
pre-populated content before executing the action. AppFabric will not execute actions without user
review and input first as generative AI and the underlying large language models (LLM) may
hallucinate from time to time.

###### Note

You have the responsibility to validate and confirm the AppFabric LLM outputs. AppFabric does not
guarantee the accuracy or quality of its LLM outputs. For more information, see [AWS Responsible AI\
Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/responsible-ai/policy).

### Create tasks (Smartsheet)

AppFabric allows you to edit and create a task in Smartsheet from within your
preferred application. We support basic task fields such as Task Name, Task Owner, Due Date, and
Task Description. AppFabric may generate content in these fields to help you reduce the time to
create the task. After you're done editing the task, choose **Create** to
create the task. For Smartsheet tasks, AppFabric will create a new private
Smartsheet sheet and populate any created tasks. This is done to help centralize
AppFabric generated actions in a single place in a structured manner.

The following fields are required to create an Smartsheet task:

- Title and Description fields.

- Assignee must be valid email address if provided.

![Create Task form with fields for title, assignees, due date, and description for an AWS AppFabric Action.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/fabric-18.png)

After the task is created, you'll see a confirmation that the task has been created in
Smartsheet. Additionally, you'll see a link to view the task in
Smartsheet. You can use this link to quickly navigate to the application to view
the task in the created Smartsheet sheet. All future Smartsheet
tasks will be populated in this sheet. If the sheet is deleted, AppFabric will create a new
one.
