## Benefits

You can use AppFabric for security to do the following:

- Connect your applications in minutes, and reduce operational costs.

- Increase visibility across SaaS application data to elevate your security posture.

## Use cases

You can use AppFabric for security to:

- Connect your SaaS applications quickly

- AppFabric for security natively connects top SaaS productivity and security applications to
each other, providing a fully managed SaaS interoperability solution.

- Elevate your security posture

- Application data is automatically normalized, enabling administrators to set common
policies, standardize security alerts, and easily manage user access across multiple
applications.

## Accessing AppFabric for security

AppFabric for security is available in the US East (N. Virginia), Europe (Ireland), and
Asia Pacific (Tokyo) AWS Regions. For more information about AWS Regions, see [AWS AppFabric endpoints and quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/appfabric.md) in the
_AWS General Reference_.

In each Region, you can access AppFabric for security in any of the following ways:

**AWS Management Console**

The AWS Management Console is a browser-based interface that you can use to create and manage AWS
resources. The AppFabric console provides access to your AppFabric resources. You can use the AppFabric
console to create and manage all AppFabric resources.

**AppFabric API**

To access AppFabric programmatically, use the AppFabric API, and issue HTTPS requests directly to
the service. For more information, see the [AWS AppFabric API Reference](../api/welcome.md).

**AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)**

With the AWS CLI, you can issue commands at your system's command line to interact with AppFabric
and other AWS services. If you want to build scripts that perform tasks, the command line tools
are also useful. For information about installing and using the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide for\
Version 2](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.md). For information about the AWS CLI commands for AppFabric, see the [AppFabric section of the AWS CLI\
Reference](../../../cli/latest/reference/appfabric.md).

## Related services

You can use the following AWS services with AppFabric for security:

**Amazon Data Firehose**

Amazon Data Firehose is an extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that reliably captures,
transforms, and delivers streaming data to data lakes, data stores, and analytics services. When
you use AppFabric, you can choose to output your Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)
normalized or raw audit logs in JSON format to a Firehose stream as your destination. For more
information, see [Create an output location in\
Firehose](prerequisites.md#output-location-firehose).

**Amazon Security Lake**

Amazon Security Lake automatically centralizes security data from AWS environments, SaaS
providers, on premises and cloud sources into a purpose-built data lake stored in your account.
You can integrate AppFabric audit log data with Security Lake by selecting Amazon Data Firehose as a destination
and configuring Firehose to deliver data in the correct format and path in Security Lake. For more
information, see [Collecting data from custom\
sources](../../../security-lake/latest/userguide/custom-sources.md) in the _Amazon Security Lake User Guide_.

**Amazon Simple Storage Service**

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data
availability, security, and performance. When you use AppFabric, you can choose to output your OCSF
normalized (JSON or Apache Parquet) or raw (JSON) audit logs to a new or existing
Amazon S3 bucket as your destination. For more information, see [Create an output location in Amazon S3](prerequisites.md#output-location-s3).

**Amazon Quick**

Quick powers data-driven organizations with unified business intelligence (BI) at hyperscale.
With Quick, all users can meet varying analytic needs from the same source of truth through
modern interactive dashboards, paginated reports, embedded analytics, and natural language
queries. You can analyze AppFabric audit log data in Quick, by choosing the Amazon S3 bucket where
your AppFabric logs are stored as your source. For more information, see [Creating a dataset using Amazon S3\
files](../../../quicksight/latest/user/create-a-data-set-s3.md) in the _Quick User Guide_. You can also import AppFabric data in
Amazon S3 to Amazon Athena and select Amazon Athena as the data source in Quick. For more information, see
[Creating\
a dataset using Amazon Athena data](../../../quicksight/latest/user/create-a-data-set-athena.md) in the _Quick User Guide_.

**AWS Key Management Service**

With AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), you can create, manage, and control cryptographic keys across your
applications and AWS services. When you create an app bundle in AppFabric, you set up an encryption
key to securely protect your authorized application data. This key encrypts your data within the
AppFabric service. AppFabric can use an AWS owned key created and managed by AppFabric on your behalf, or a
customer managed key that you create and manage in AWS KMS. For more information, see [Create an AWS KMS key](prerequisites.md#create-kms-keys).
