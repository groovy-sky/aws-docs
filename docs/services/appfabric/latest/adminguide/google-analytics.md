# Configure Google Analytics for AppFabric

Google Analytics is a web analytics service that provides statistics and
basic analytical tools for search engine optimization (SEO) and marketing purposes.
Google Analytics is used to track website performance and collect visitor
insights. It can help organizations determine top sources of user traffic, gauge the success
of their marketing activities and campaigns, track goal completions (such as purchases,
adding products to carts), discover patterns and trends in user engagement and obtain other
visitor information such as demographics. Small and medium-sized retail websites often use
Google Analytics to obtain and analyze various customer behavior
analytics, which can be used to improve marketing campaigns, drive website traffic and
better retain visitors.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from Azure
Monitor, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)
format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Google Analytics

AppFabric supports receiving audit logs from Google Analytics.

### Prerequisites

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Google Analytics to
supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must be Administrator of the Google Analytics
account.

- For AppFabric to deliver logs, you need to enable the [Google Analytics Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=analyticsadmin.googleapis.com) on your
Google Cloud project. Be sure to use a new project when
setting up the Google Analytics OAuth application.

### Rate limit considerations

Google Analytics imposes rate limits on the Google
Analytics API. For more information about Google
Analytics API rate limits, see [Limits and Quotas](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1/quotas) on the _Google Analytics website_.
If the combination of AppFabric and your existing _Google Analytics_
API applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be
delayed.

### Data delay considerations

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your
destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application
as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be
customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Google Analytics account

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric
with Google Analytics. Use the following steps to find the information
required to authorize Google Analytics with AppFabric.

### Create an OAuth application

AppFabric integrates with the Google Analytics using OAuth. Complete
the following steps to create an OAuth application in Google
Analytics:

1. To configure your OAuth consent screen, follow the instructions in
    Configure the OAuth consent screen in the Google Developer Guide on the
    Google website.

2. Choose External for the User type

3. To configure OAuth credentials for AppFabric, follow the instructions in
    the OAuth client ID credentials section of the Create access credentials
    page in the Google Developer Guide.

4. Use a redirect URL with the following format.

```nohighlight

https://<region>.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
```

In that address, `<region>` is
    the code for the AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app
    bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is
    `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is
    `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

### Required scopes

You must add the following scope to your Google Analytics OAuth
application:

```

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.edit
```
