# Configure Terraform Cloud for AppFabric
<a name="terraform"></a>

HashiCorp Terraform Cloud is the world’s most widely used multi-cloud provisioning product. The Terraform ecosystem has more than 3,000 providers, 14,000 modules, and 250 million downloads. Terraform Cloud is the fastest way to adopt Terraform, providing everything practitioners, teams, and global businesses need to create and collaborate on infrastructure and manage risks for security, compliance, and operational constraints.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from Terraform Cloud, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Terraform Cloud
<a name="terraform-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Terraform Cloud.

### Prerequisites
<a name="terraform-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Terraform Cloud to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ To access the audit logs, you must have a Terraform Cloud Plus Edition plan and be the owner of the organization. For more information about Terraform Cloud plans, see [Terraform pricing](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing?ajs_aid=33c212cb-664b-45d6-aee8-d3791e90a893&product_intent=terraform) on the HashiCorp Terraform website.
+  TBD Audit logs are available for organizations that can be created from the Terraform Cloud account.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="terraform-rate-limit"></a>

Terraform Cloud imposes rate limits on the Terraform Cloud API. For more information about the Terraform Cloud API rate limits, see [ API Rate Limiting](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/general#api-rate-limiting) in the Terraform Cloud Developer administration general setting on the Terraform Cloud website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Terraform Cloud API applications exceed Terraform Cloud's limits, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="terraform-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Terraform Cloud account
<a name="terraform-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Terraform Cloud. To find the information required to authorize Terraform Cloud with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an organization API token
<a name="terraform-create-org-token"></a>

AppFabric integrates with Terraform Cloud using an organization API token. For more information about the Terraform Cloud organization API tokens, see [ Organization API Tokens](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens). To create an organization, follow the instructions in [Creating Organizations](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/organizations#creating-organizations). To create an organization API token in Terraform Cloud, use the following steps.

1. Navigate to the [Terraform Cloud sign in](https://app.terraform.io/session) page and sign in.

1. Choose **Organization**, **Settings** on the left-side panel, and then choose **API tokens**.

1. Under **Organization Tokens**, choose **Create an organization token** and then choose **Generate token**.

1. (Optional) Enter the token's expiration date or time, or create a token that never expires.

1. Copy and save the token. You'll need this later in AppFabric. If you close the page before saving the token you must revoke the old token and create a new one.

### App authorizations
<a name="terraform-app-authorizations"></a>

#### Tenant ID
<a name="terraform-tenant-id"></a>

AppFabric will request a tenant ID. The tenant ID for your Terraform Cloud account is the current organization URL of your account. You can find this by logging in to your Terraform Cloud organization and copying the current organization URL. The tenant ID should follow one of the following formats:

```
https://app.terraform.io/app/{{organization_URL}}
```

#### Tenant name
<a name="terraform-tenant-name"></a>

Enter a name that identifies this unique Terraform Cloud organization. AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions created from the app authorization.

#### Service account token
<a name="terraform-service-token"></a>

AppFabric will request your service account token. The service account token in AppFabric is the organization API token you created in [Create an organization API token](#terraform-create-org-token).
