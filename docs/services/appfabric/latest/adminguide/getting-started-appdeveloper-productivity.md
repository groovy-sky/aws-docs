# Get started with AppFabric for productivity (preview) for application developers

The AWS AppFabric for productivity feature is in preview and is subject to change.

This section helps app developers integrate AWS AppFabric for productivity (preview) into their
applications. AWS AppFabric for productivity enables developers to build richer app experiences for their
users by generating AI-powered insights and actions from emails, calendar events, tasks,
messages, and more across multiple applications. For a list of supported applications, see
[AWS AppFabric Supported\
Applications](https://aws.amazon.com/appfabric/supported-applications).

AppFabric for productivity offers app developers access to build and experiment within a secure and
controlled environment. When you first start using AppFabric for productivity, you create an AppClient and
register a single test user. This approach is designed to help you understand and test the
authentication and communication flow between your application and AppFabric. After you've
tested with a single user, you can submit your application to AppFabric for verification before
expanding access to additional users (see [Step 5. Request AppFabric to verify your application](#request_verification)). AppFabric will verify application information
before enabling wide spread adoption to help protect app developers, end users, and their
data — paving the way for expanding user adoption in a responsible manner.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you need to create an AWS account. For more information, see
[Sign up for an AWS account](prerequisites.md#sign-up-for-aws). You also need to
create at least one user with access to the `"appfabric:CreateAppClient"` IAM
policy listed below, which allows the user to register your application with AppFabric. For
more information about granting permissions for the AppFabric for productivity features, see [AppFabric for productivity IAM policy examples](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#appfabric-for-productivity-policy-examples). While having an
administrative user is beneficial, it's not mandatory for initial setup. For more
information, see [Create a user with administrative access](prerequisites.md#create-an-admin).

AppFabric for productivity is only in US East (N. Virginia) during preview. Ensure you’re in this region
before you start the steps below.

## Step 1. Create an AppFabric for productivity AppClient

Before you can start surfacing AppFabric for productivity insights within your application, you need
to create an AppFabric AppClient. An AppClient is essentially your gateway to AppFabric for productivity,
functioning as a secure OAuth application client enabling secure communication between
your application and AppFabric. When you create an AppClient, you'll be provided with an
AppClient ID, a unique identifier crucial for ensuring that AppFabric knows that it's
working with your application and your AWS account.

AppFabric for productivity offers app developers access to build and experiment within a secure and
controlled environment. When you first start using AppFabric for productivity, you create an AppClient
and register a single test user. This approach is designed to help you understand and
test the authentication and communication flow between your application and AppFabric. After
you've tested with a single user, you can submit your application to AppFabric for
verification before expanding access to additional users (see [Step 5. Request AppFabric to verify your application](#request_verification)). AppFabric will
verify application information before enabling wide spread adoption to help protect app
developers, end users, and their data — paving the way for expanding user adoption in a
responsible manner.

To create an AppClient, use the AWS AppFabric `CreateAppClient` API operation.
If you need to update the AppClient after, you can use the `UpdateAppClient`
API operation to change only the redirectUrls. If you need to change any of the other
parameters associated with your AppClient such as appName or description, you must
delete the AppClient and create a new one. For more information, see [CreateAppClient](api-createappclient.md).

You can register your application with AWS services using the
`CreateAppClient` API using several programming languages, including
Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go and Rust. For more information, see [Request\
signature examples](../../../iam/latest/userguide/signature-v4-examples.md) in the _IAM User Guide_. You need to
use your account signature version 4 credentials to perform this API operation. For more
information about signature version 4, see [Signing AWS API\
requests](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-aws-signing.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

**Request Fields**

- `appName` \- The name of the application that will be displayed to
the users on the consent page of the AppFabric user portal. The consent page asks
end users for permission to display AppFabric insights inside your application. For
details about the consent page, see [Step 2. Provide consent for the app to display insights](getting-started-users-productivity.md#provide-consent).

- `description` \- A description for the application.

- `redirectUrls` \- The URI to redirect end users to after
authorization. You can add up to 5 redirectUrls. For example,
`https://localhost:8080`.

- `starterUserEmails` \- A user email address that will be allowed
access to receive the insights until the application is verified. Only one email
address is allowed. For example, `anyuser@example.com`

- `customerManagedKeyIdentifier` (optional) - The ARN of the customer
managed key (generated by KMS) to be used to encrypt the data. If not specified,
then AWS AppFabric managed key will be used. For more information about
AWS owned keys and customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and\
AWS keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#key-mgmt) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer_
_Guide_.

**Response Fields**

- `appClientArn` \- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that includes the
AppClient ID. For example, the AppClient ID is
`a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111`.

- `verificationStatus` \- The AppClient verification status.

- `pending_verification` \- The verification of the AppClient
is still in progress with AppFabric. Until the AppClient is verified, only
one user (specified in `starterUserEmails`) can use the
AppClient. The user will see a notification in the AppFabric user portal,
introduced in [Step 3. Add the AppFabric user portal URL to your application](#end_user_portal), indicating that the application
isn't verified.

- `verified` \- The verification process has been successfully
completed by AppFabric and the AppClient is now fully verified.

- `rejected` \- The verification process for the AppClient was
rejected by AppFabric. The AppClient cannot be used by additional users
until the verification process is re-initiated and completed
successfully.

    "starterUserEmails": ["anyuser@example.com"],
    "customerManagedKeyIdentifier": "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account>:key/<key>"
}'
```

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

```nohighlight

{
    "appClientConfigSummary": {
        "appClientArn": "arn:aws:appfabric:<region>:<account>:appclient/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
        "verificationStatus": "pending_verification"
    }
}
```

## Step 2. Authenticate and authorize your application

Enable your application to securely integrate AppFabric insights by establishing an OAuth
2.0 authorization flow. First, you need to create an authorization code, which verifies
your application identity. For more information, see [Authorize](api-authorize.md). Then you'll exchange this authorization code for an
access token, which grants your application the permissions to fetch and display AppFabric
insights within your application. For more information, see [Token](api-token.md).

For more information about granting permission to authorize an application, see [Allow access to authorize applications](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-productivity-token).

1. To create an authorization code, use the AWS AppFabric
    `oauth2/authorize` API operation.

**Request Fields**

- `app_client_id` (required) - The AppClient ID for the
AWS account created in [Step 1. Create\
an AppClient](#create_appclient). For example,
`a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111`.

- `redirect_uri` (required) - The URI to redirect end users
to after authorization you used in [Step\
1\. Create an AppClient](#create_appclient). For example,
`https://localhost:8080`.

- `state` (required) - A unique value to maintain the state
between the request and callback. For example,
`a8904edc-890c-1005-1996-29a757272a44`.

```nohighlight

GET https://productivity.appfabric.<region>.amazonaws.com/oauth2/authorize?app_client_id=a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111\
redirect_uri=https://localhost:8080&state=a8904edc-890c-1005-1996-29a757272a44
```

2. After authentication, you’ll be redirected to the specified URI with an
    authorization code returned as a query parameter. For example, where
    `code=mM0NyJ9.MEUCIHQQgV3ChXGs2LRwxLtpsgya3ybfPYXfX-sxTAdRF-gDAiEAxX7BYKlD9krG3J2VtprOjVXZ0FSUX9whdekqJ-oampc`.

```

https://localhost:8080/?code=mM0NyJ9.MEUCIHQQgV3ChXGs2LRwxLtpsgya3ybfPYXfX-sxTAdRF-gDAiEAxX7BYKlD9krG3J2VtprOjVXZ0FSUX9whdekqJ-oampc&state=a8904edc-890c-1005-1996-29a757272a44
```

3. Exchange this authorization code for an access token using the AppFabric
    `oauth2/token` API operation.

This token is used for API requests and is initially valid for the
    `starterUserEmails` until the AppClient is verified. After the
    AppClient is verified, this token can be used for any user. You need to use your
    account signature version 4 credentials to perform this API operation. For more
    information about signature version 4, see [Signing AWS API\
    requests](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-aws-signing.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Request Fields

- `code` (required) - The authorization code you received
after authenticating in the last step. For example,
`mM0NyJ9.MEUCIHQQgV3ChXGs2LRwxLtpsgya3ybfPYXfX-sxTAdRF-gDAiEAxX7BYKlD9krG3J2VtprOjVXZ0FSUX9whdekqJ-oampc`.

- `app_client_id` (required) - The AppClient ID for the
AWS account created in [Step 1. Create\
an AppClient](#create_appclient). For example,
`a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111`.

- `grant_type` (required) - The value must be
`authorization_code`.

- `redirect_uri` (required) - The URI to redirect users to
after authorization you used in [Step 1.\
Create an AppClient](#create_appclient). This must be the same redirect URI used
to create an authorization code. For example,
`https://localhost:8080`.

**Response Fields**

- `expires_in` \- How soon before the token expires. The
default expiration time is 12 hours.

- `refresh_token` \- The refresh token received from the
initial /token request.

- `token` \- The token received from the initial /token
request.

- `token_type` \- The value will be
`Bearer`.

- `appfabric_user_id` \- The AppFabric user id. This is returned
only for requests that use the `authorization_code` grant
type.

```nohighlight

curl --location \
"https://appfabric.<region>.amazonaws.com/oauth2/token" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-Amz-Content-Sha256: <sha256_payload>" \
--header "X-Amz-Security-Token: <security_token>" \
--header "X-Amz-Date: 20230922T172215Z" \
--header "Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 ..." \
--data "{
    \"code\": \"mM0NyJ9.MEUCIHQQgV3ChXGs2LRwxLtpsgya3ybfPYXfX-sxTAdRF-gDAiEAxX7BYKlD9krG3J2VtprOjVXZ0FSUX9whdekqJ-oampc",
    \"app_client_id\": \"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111\",
    \"grant_type\": \"authorization_code\",
    \"redirect_uri\": \"https://localhost:8080\"
}"
```

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200
response.

```nohighlight

{
    "expires_in": 43200,
    "refresh_token": "apkaeibaerjr2example",
    "token": "apkaeibaerjr2example",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "appfabric_user_id" : "<userId>"
}
```

## Step 3. Add the AppFabric user portal URL to your application

End users need to authorize AppFabric to access data from their applications that are used
to generate insights. AppFabric removes the complexity for app developers to own this
process by building a dedicated user portal (a pop-up screen) for end users to authorize
their apps. When users are ready to enable AppFabric for productivity, they'll be taken to the user
portal which enables them to connect and manage applications used to generate insights
and cross-app actions. When logged in, users can connect applications to AppFabric for productivity and
then go back to your application to explore the insights and actions. To integrate your
application with AppFabric for productivity, you need to add a specific AppFabric URL to your application.
This step is crucial for enabling users to access the AppFabric user portal directly from
your application.

1. Navigate to your application’s settings and locate the section for adding
    redirect URLs.

2. After you find the appropriate area, add the following AppFabric URL as a redirect
    URL to your application:

```nohighlight

https://userportal.appfabric.<region>.amazonaws.com/eup_login
```

After you add the URL, your application will be set up to direct users to the AppFabric
user portal. Here, users can log in and connect and manage their applications used to
generate AppFabric for productivity insights.

## Step 4. Use AppFabric to surface cross-app insights and actions

After users connect their applications, you can bring your user’s insights to improve
their productivity by helping reducing app and context switching. AppFabric only generates
insight for a user based on what the user has permission to access. AppFabric stores user
data in an AWS account owned by AppFabric. For information about how AppFabric uses your data,
see [Data processing in AppFabric](productivity-data-processing.md).

You can use the following AI-powered APIs to generate and surface user-level insights
and actions within your apps:

- `ListActionableInsights` — For more information, see the
[Actionable insights](#productivity-actionable-insights)
section below.

- `ListMeetingInsights` — For more information, see the [Meeting preparation](#productivity-meeting-insights) section
later in this guide.

### Actionable insights ( `ListActionableInsights`)

The `ListActionableInsights` API helps users best manage their day
surfacing actionable insights based on activity across their applications, including
emails, calendar, messages, tasks, and more. Returned insights will also show
embedded links to artifacts used to generate the insight — helping users to quickly
view what data was used to generate the insight. Additionally, the API may return
suggested actions based on the insight and allow users to execute cross-app actions
from within your application. Specifically, the API integrates with platforms like
Asana, Google Workspace, Microsoft
365, and Smartsheet to enable users to send emails,
create calendar events, and create tasks. The large language models (LLMs) may
pre-populate details within a recommended action (such as email body or task name),
which users can customize before execution — simplifying decision-making and
enhancing productivity. Similar to the experience for end users to authorize
applications, AppFabric uses the same dedicated portal for users to view, edit, and
execute cross-app actions. For executing actions, AppFabric requires ISVs to re-direct
users to a AppFabric user portal where they can see action details and execute them.
Every action generated by AppFabric has a unique URL. This URL is available in the
response of `ListActionableInsights` API response.

Below is a summary of the supported cross-app actions and in which apps:

- Send email (Google Workspace, Microsoft
365)

- Create calendar event (Google Workspace, Microsoft
365)

- Create task (Asana, Smartsheet)

**Request Fields**

- `nextToken` (optional) - The pagination token to fetch the next
set of insights.

- `includeActionExecutionStatus` \- A filter which accepts list of
action execution statuses. The actions are filtered based on status values
passed in. Possible values: `NOT_EXECUTED` \|
`EXECUTED`

**Request Header**

- Authorization header needs to be passed in with the `Bearer Token
                          ` value.

**Response Fields**

- `insightId` \- The unique id for the generated insight.

- `insightContent` \- This returns a summary of the insight and
embedded links to artifacts used to generate the insight. Note: This would
be an HTML content containing embedded links (<a> tags).

- `insightTitle` \- The title of the generated insight.

- `createdAt` \- When the insight was generated.

- `actions` \- A list of actions recommend for the generated
insight. Action object:

- `actionId` \- The unique id for the generated
action.

- `actionIconUrl` \- The icon URL for the app that the
action is suggested to be executed in.

- `actionTitle` \- The title of the generated
action.

- `actionUrl` \- The unique URL for the end user to view
and execute the action in AppFabric’s user portal. Note: for executing
actions, ISV apps will re-direct users to AppFabric user portal (pop up
screen) using this URL.

- `actionExecutionStatus` \- An enum indicating the status
of the action. The possible values are: `EXECUTED` \|
`NOT_EXECUTED`

- `nextToken` (optional) - The pagination token to fetch the next
set of insights. It’s an optional field which if returned null means there
are no more insights to load.

### Provide feedback for your insights or actions

Use the AppFabric `PutFeedback` API operation to provide feedback for the
generated insights and actions. You can embed this feature in your apps to provide a
way to submit a feedback rating (1 to 5, where the higher rating the better) for a
given InsightId or ActionId.

**Request fields**

- `id` \- The identifier of the object for which feedback is being
submitted. This can be either the InsightId or the ActionId.

- `feedbackFor` \- The resource type for which feedback is being
submitted. Possible values: `ACTIONABLE_INSIGHT` \|
`MEETING_INSIGHT` \| `ACTION`

- `feedbackRating` \- Feedback rating from `1` to
`5`. Higher rating the better.

**Response fields**

- There are no response fields.

For more information, see [PutFeedback](api-putfeedback.md).

```nohighlight

curl --request POST \
  --url "https://productivity.appfabric.<region>.amazonaws.com"\
"/feedback" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "id": "1234-5678-9012",
    "feedbackFor": "ACTIONABLE_INSIGHT"
    "feedbackRating": 3
}'
```

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 201 response with an
empty HTTP body.

## Step 5. Request AppFabric to verify your application

To this point, you've updated your application UI to embed AppFabric cross-app insights
and actions, and received insights for a single user. After you’re satisfied with
testing and want to extend your AppFabric-enriched experience to additional users, you can
submit your application to AppFabric for review and verification. AppFabric will verify
application information before enabling wide spread adoption to help protect app
developers, end users, and their data — paving the way for expanding user adoption in a
responsible manner.

**Initiate the verification process**

Begin the verification process by sending an email to [appfabric-appverification@amazon.com](mailto:appfabric-appverification@amazon.com) and requesting that your app be
verified.

Include the following details in your email:

- Your AWS account ID

- The name of the application you're seeking verification for

- Your AppClient ID

- Your contact information

Additionally, provide the following information, if available, to help us assess
priority and impact:

- An estimated number of users you plan to grant access to

- Your target launch date

###### Note

If you have an AWS account manager or AWS partner development manager, please
copy them on your email. Including these contacts can help expedite the verification
process.

**Verification criteria**

Before initiating the verification process, you must meet the following
criteria:

- You must use a valid AWS account to use AppFabric for productivity

Additionally, you meet at least one of these criteria:

- Your organization is an AWS partner on the AWS Partner Network with at least an “AWS
Select” tier. For more information, see [AWS Partner Services\
Tiers](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/services-tiers).

- Your organization should have spent at least $10,000 on AppFabric services within
the last three years.

- Your application should be listed on the AWS Marketplace. For more information, see the
[AWSMarketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace).

**Await verification status update**

After your application is reviewed, we'll respond via email and the status of your
AppClient will change from `pending_verification` to `verified`.
If your application is rejected, you’ll need to re-initiate the verification
process.
