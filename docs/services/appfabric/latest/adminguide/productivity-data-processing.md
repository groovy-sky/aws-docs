# Data processing in AppFabric

The AWS AppFabric for productivity feature is in preview and is subject to change.

AppFabric takes steps to store user content individually, in an Amazon S3 bucket managed by AppFabric, and
separately; which helps ensure that we generate user-specific insights. We use reasonable
safeguards to protect your content, which can include encryption at-rest and in-transit. We've
configured our systems to delete customer content automatically within 30 days from ingestion.
AppFabric does not generate insights using data artifacts to which a user no longer has access. For
example, when a user disconnects a data source (an app), AppFabric stops collecting data from that app
and does not use any lingering artifacts from the disconnected apps to generate insights. AppFabric’s
systems are configured to delete such data within 30 days.

AppFabric does not use user content to train or improve the underlying large language models used
to generate insights. For more information about AppFabric's generative AI feature, see [Amazon Bedrock FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/faqs).

## Encryption at rest

AWS AppFabric supports encryption at rest, a server-side encryption feature in which AppFabric
transparently encrypts all data related to users when it is persisted to disk, and decrypts them
when you access the data.

## Encryption in transit

AppFabric secures all content in transit using TLS 1.2 and signs API requests for AWS services
with AWS Signature Version 4.
