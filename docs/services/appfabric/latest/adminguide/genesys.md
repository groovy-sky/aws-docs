# Configure Genesys Cloud for AppFabric

Genesys Cloud creates fluid conversations across digital and voice channels
in an easy, all-in-one interface. This positions companies to provide exceptional
experiences for employees and customers and reap the benefits of speedy deployments, reduced
complexity and simple administration.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from Genesys
Cloud, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)
format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Genesys Cloud

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Genesys
Cloud.

### Prerequisites

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Genesys Cloud to supported
destinations, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must have a Genesys Cloud account.

- You must have a user with the Administrator role in your Genesys
Cloud account.

### Rate limit considerations

Genesys Cloud imposes rate limits on the Genesys
Cloud API. For more information about the Genesys Cloud
API rate limits, see [Rate\
limits](https://developer.genesys.cloud/platform/api/rate-limits) on the Genesys Cloud Developer website.

### Data delay considerations

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your
destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application
as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be
customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Genesys Cloud account

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric
with Genesys Cloud. To find the information required to authorize
Genesys Cloud with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application

AppFabric integrates with Genesys Cloud using OAuth. To create an OAuth
application in Genesys Cloud, use the following steps:

1. Follow the instructions in [Create an OAuth Client](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-an-oauth-client) on the _Genesys_
_Cloud Resource Center_ website.

For **Grant types**, choose **Code**
**Authorization**.

2. Use a redirect URL with the following format as the **Authorized**
**redirect URIs**.

```nohighlight

https://<region>.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
```

In this URL, `<region>` is the code for the
    AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example,
    the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is
    `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is
    `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

3. Select the **Scope** box to display a list of scopes
    available to your app. Select scope `audits:readonly` and
    `users:readonly`. For information about scopes, see [OAuth Scopes](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/authorization/scopes.html) in the Genesys Cloud Developer
    Center.

4. Choose **Save**. Genesys Cloud creates a
    Client ID and a Client Secret (token).

### Required scopes

You must add the following scopes to your Genesys Cloud OAuth
application:

- `audits:readonly`

- `users:readonly`

### App authorizations

#### Tenant ID

AppFabric will request your tenant ID. The tenant ID in AppFabric is your
Genesys Cloud instance name. You can find your tenant ID in
the address bar of your browser. For example, `usw2.pure.cloud` is
the tenant ID in the following URL
`https://login.usw2.pure.cloud`.

#### Tenant name

Enter a name that identifies this unique Genesys Cloud
organization. AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any
ingestions created from the app authorization.

#### Client ID

AppFabric will request a client ID. To find your client ID in Genesys
Cloud, use the following steps:

1. Choose **Admin**.

2. Under **Integrations**, choose
    **OAuth**.

3. Choose the OAuth client to get the Client ID.

#### Client secret

AppFabric will request a client secret. To find your client secret in
Genesys Cloud, use the following steps:

1. Choose **Admin**.

2. Under **Integrations**, choose
    **OAuth**.

3. Choose the OAuth client to get the Client Secret.
