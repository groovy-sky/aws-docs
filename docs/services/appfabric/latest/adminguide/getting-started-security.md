# Get started with AWS AppFabric for security

To get started with AWS AppFabric for security, you must first create an app bundle and then
authorize and connect applications to your app bundle. After app authorizations are connected to
applications, you can use AppFabric for security features such as audit log ingestions and user
access.

This section explains how to start using AppFabric in the AWS Management Console.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you must first create an AWS account and an administrative user.
For more information, see [Sign up for an AWS account](prerequisites.md#sign-up-for-aws) and
[Create a user with administrative access](prerequisites.md#create-an-admin).

## Step 1: Create app bundle

An app bundle stores all of your AppFabric for security app authorizations and ingestions. To create
an app bundle, set up an encryption key to securely protect your authorized application
data.

1. Open the AppFabric console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric).

2. In the **Select a Region** selector in the upper-right corner of the
    page, select an AWS Region. AppFabric is available in the US East (N. Virginia), Europe (Ireland),
    and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Regions only.

3. Choose **Getting started**.

4. On the **Getting started** page, for **Step 1. Create app**
**bundle**, choose **Create app bundle**.

5. In the
    **Encryption** section, set up an encryption key to securely protect your
    data from all authorized applications. This key is used to encrypt your data within the AppFabric
    for security service.

AppFabric for security encrypts data by default. AppFabric can use an AWS owned key created and
    managed by AppFabric on your behalf or a customer managed key that you create and manage in AWS Key Management Service
    (AWS KMS).

6. For **AWS KMS**
**Key**, choose either **Use AWS owned key** or
    **Customer managed key**.

If you choose to use a customer managed key, enter either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the key
    ID of the existing key that you want to use, or choose **Create an AWS KMS**
**key**.

Consider the following when choosing an AWS owned key or a customer managed key:

- **AWS owned keys** are a collection of AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
keys that an AWS service owns and manages for use in multiple AWS accounts. Although
AWS owned keys are not in your AWS account, an AWS service can use an AWS owned key
to protect the resources in your account. AWS owned keys don't count against the AWS KMS
quotas for your account. You don't need to create or maintain the key or its key policy. The
rotation of AWS owned keys varies across services. For information about the rotation of an
AWS owned key for AppFabric, see [Encryption at\
rest](data-protection.md#encryption-rest).

- Customer managed keys are KMS keys in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage. You
have full control over these AWS KMS keys. You can establish and maintain their key policies,
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, and grants. You can enable and disable them, rotate their
cryptographic material, add tags, create aliases that refer to the AWS KMS keys, and schedule
the AWS KMS keys for deletion. Customer managed keys appear on the **Customer managed keys**
**page** of the AWS Management Console for AWS KMS.

To definitively identify a customer managed key, use the `DescribeKey` operation. For
customer managed keys, the value of the `KeyManager` field of the `DescribeKey`
response is `CUSTOMER`. You can use your customer managed key in cryptographic operations
and audit usage in AWS CloudTrail logs. With many AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS, you can
specify a customer managed key to protect the data stored and managed for you. Customer managed keys incur a
monthly fee and a fee for use in excess of the AWS Free Tier. Customer managed keys count against
the AWS KMS quotas for your account.

For more information about AWS owned keys and customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and\
AWS keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#key-mgmt) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Note

When an app bundle is created, AppFabric for security also creates a special IAM role in your
AWS account called a service-linked role (SLR) for AppFabric. It allows the service to send
metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. After you add an audit log destination, the SLR allows the AppFabric for security
service access to your AWS resources (Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon Data Firehose delivery streams). For more
information, see [Using service-linked roles for AppFabric](using-service-linked-roles.md).

7. (Optional) For **Tags**, you have the option to add tags to your app
    bundle. Tags are key-value pairs that assign metadata to resources that you create. For more
    information, see [Tagging your AWS resources](../../../tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.md) in the _AWS Tag Editor User_
_Guide_.

8. To create your app bundle, choose **Create app bundle**.

## Step 2: Authorize applications

After your app bundle is created successfully, you can now authorize AppFabric for security to
connect and interact with each of your applications. Authorized applications are encrypted and
stored in your app bundle. To set up multiple app authorizations per app bundle, repeat the app
authorization step as needed for each application.

Before you begin the steps to authorize applications, review and verify prerequisites for
each application, such as the plan type needed, in [Supported applications in AppFabric for security](supported-applications.md).

1. On the **Getting started** page, for **Step 2. Authorize**
**applications**, choose **Create app authorization**.

2. In the **App authorization** section, select the application that you
    want to grant permission for AppFabric for security to connect to from the
    **Application** dropdown. The applications shown are those that are currently
    supported by AppFabric for security.

3. When you select an application, required fields of information appear. These fields
    include tenant ID and tenant name and might also include client ID, client secret, or personal
    access token. The input values for these fields varies by application. For detailed
    application-specific instructions on how to find these values, see [Supported applications in AppFabric for security](supported-applications.md).

4. (Optional) For **Tags**, you have the option to add tags to your app
    authorization. Tags are key-value pairs that assign metadata to resources that you create. For
    more information, see [Tagging your AWS resources](../../../tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.md) in the
    _AWS Tag Editor User Guide_.

5. Choose **Create app authorization**.

6. If a pop-up window appears (dependent upon the application that is being connected),
    select **Allow** to authorize AppFabric for security to connect with your
    application.

If your app authorization was successful, you will see a success message of **App**
**authorization connected** on the **Getting Started** page.

7. You can check the status of your app authorization at any time on the **App**
**authorizations** page listed in the navigation pane, under status for each
    application. A **Connected** status means that your app authorization has been
    granted for AppFabric for security to connect to the application and is complete.

8. Possible app authorization statuses are shown in the following table, including
    troubleshooting steps that you can take to fix related errors.

Status nameStatus descriptionTroubleshooting steps

**Pending**

A status of Pending means that an app authorization for the application is created,
but AppFabric for security isn't yet connected to the application.

When you see this status, select **Connect** from the
**Actions** dropdown of the **App authorization** page
to initiate a connection. If this error persists, check if your browser's pop-up blocker
is disabled. If there is any error message, like **400 Bad Request** in
the pop-up window, check that all the information, such as tenant ID, client ID, and
client secret, is correctly entered. It's also possible that the app authorization of the
application isn't created correctly. For more information, see [Supported applications](supported-applications.md).

**Connection validation failed**

A status of Connection validation failed means that AppFabric for security can't validate the
connection of the app authorization with an application.

Check that all the information, such as tenant ID, client ID and client secret, is
entered correctly for the app authorization.

**Token auto-rotation failed**

A status of token auto-rotation failed means that the OAuth refresh token has failed
after the app authorization was successfully connected.

If this error persists, check the authentication application of the application. For
more information, see [Supported\
applications](supported-applications.md).

9. To authorize additional applications, repeat steps 1 through 8 as needed.

## Step 3: Set up audit log ingestions

After you have at least one app authorization created in your app bundle, you can now set up
an audit log ingestion. An audit log ingestion consumes audit logs from an authorized application
and normalizes them into the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF). It then delivers them to
one or more destinations within AWS. You can also choose to deliver raw JSON files to your
destinations.

1. On the **Getting started** page, for the **Step 3. Set up audit**
**log ingestions** section, select **Ingestions quick setup**.

###### Note

For faster setup, use the **Ingestions quick setup** page, accessible
from the **Getting started** page only, to create ingestions for multiple app
authorizations at a time, with the same ingestion destination. For example, the same Amazon S3
bucket or Amazon Data Firehose data stream.

You can also create ingestions from the **Ingestions** page, accessible
from the navigation pane. On the **Ingestions** page, you can set up one
ingestion at a time to distinct destinations. On the **Ingestions** page, you
can also create a tag for an ingestion. The following instructions are for the
**Ingestions quick setup** page.

2. For **Select app authorizations**, select the app authorizations that you
    want to create an audit log ingestions for. The tenant names that appear in the **App**
**authorizations** dropdown are the tenant names of applications that you have
    previously created an app authorization for with AppFabric for security.

3. For **Add destination**, select a destination for the audit log ingestions
    of the applications that you selected. Destination options include **Amazon S3 - Existing**
**Bucket**, **Amazon S3 - New Bucket**, or **Amazon Data Firehose**.
    If you select multiple tenant names, the destination you choose is applied to each ingestion of
    an app authorization.

4. When you choose a destination, additional required fields appear.
1. If you choose **Amazon S3 — New bucket** as your destination, you
       must enter the name of the S3 bucket that you want to create. For more instructions on how to
       create an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Create an output\
       destination](prerequisites.md#create-output-location).

2. If you choose **Amazon S3 — Existing bucket** as your destination,
       select the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that you want to use.

3. If you choose **Amazon Data Firehose** as your destination, select the name of the
       delivery stream from the Firehose delivery stream name dropdown list. For more instructions
       on how to create an Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream, see [Create an output destination](prerequisites.md#create-output-location), and note the permissions policy required for
       AppFabric for security.
5. For **Schema & Format**, you can choose to store your audit logs in
    **Raw - JSON**, **OCSF - JSON**, **OCSF -**
**Parquet for Amazon S3 buckets**, or **Raw - JSON or OCSF-JSON for**
**Firehose**.

The Raw data format provides your audit log data converted to JSON from a string of data.
    The OCSF data format normalizes your audit log data to the AppFabric for security Open Cybersecurity
    Schema Framework (OCSF) schema. For more information about how AppFabric uses OCSF, see [Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework for AWS AppFabric](ocsf-schema.md). You can select only one schema and format
    data type at a time for an ingestion. If you want to add an additional schema and format data
    type, you can set up an additional ingestion destination by repeating the ingestion creation
    process.

6. (Optional) If you want to add a tag to an ingestion, go to the
    **Ingestions** page from the navigation pane. To go to the ingestion details
    page, select the tenant name. For **Tags**, you have the option to add tags to
    your ingestion. Tags are key-value pairs that assign metadata to resources that you create. For
    more information, see [Tagging your AWS resources](../../../tag-editor/latest/userguide/tagging.md) in the
    _AWS Tag Editor User Guide_.

7. Choose **Set up ingestions**.

When you successfully set up an ingestion, you will see a success message of
    **Ingestion created** on the **Getting Started**
    page.

8. You can also check the state of your ingestions and status of your ingestion destinations
    at any time on the **Ingestions** page from the navigation pane. On this page,
    you can see the tenant name created upon creating app authorization, destination, and state of
    your ingestions. A state of **Enabled** for your ingestion means that your
    ingestion is enabled. If you choose the tenant name of an app authorization on this page, you
    can see a detail page for that app authorization, including destination details and status. A
    status of **Active** for your ingestion destination means that the destination
    is set up properly and active. If the app authorization has the **Connected**
    status and the ingestion destination status is **Active**, then the audit log
    should be processed and delivered. If the app authorization status or the ingestion destination
    status are any of the failed states, the audit log will not be processed or delivered even if
    the ingestion status is enabled. To fix an app authorization failure, see [Step 2. Authorize\
    applications](#getting-started-2-authorize-application).

9. Possible ingestion and
    ingestion destination statuses are shown in the following table, with troubleshooting steps
    that you can take to fix any error status.

State or status nameDescription Troubleshooting steps

**Disabled**

A **Disabled** state for the ingestion means that your ingestion is
disabled.

You can enable the ingestion by selecting **Enable** from the
**Actions** dropdown of the **Ingestions** page.

**Failed**

A **Failed** state for the ingestion destination means that the
ingestion destination isn't accepting the audit log. For example, this status might occur
because of a full storage location.

To fix these issues, go to the Amazon S3 or Firehose consoles.

## Step 4: Use the user access tool

Using the AppFabric for security user access tool, security and IT Admin teams can quickly see who
has access to specific applications by running a simple search using the employee’s corporate
email address. This approach can be helpful in reducing time spent on tasks like user
deprovisioning that might require manually checking or auditing a user’s access across SaaS
applications. If a user is found, AppFabric for security provides the user’s name in the application and
their in-app user status (for example, Active) if provided by the application. AppFabric for security
searches all authorized applications in an app bundle to return a list of applications that the
user has access to.

1. On the **Getting Started** page, for **Step 4. Use the user**
**access tool**, choose **Look up user**.

2. In the **Email address** field, type a user’s email address, and choose
    **Search**.

3. In the **Search results** section, you see a list of all authorized
    applications that the user has access to. To show the user’s name in the application and their
    status (if available), select a search result.

4. A message of **User found** in the search results column means that the
    user can access the app listed. The following table shows the possible search results, errors,
    and the actions that you can take to address the errors.

Search resultDescription

The user not found

No user is found with the email address used.

An authorization token was not found. Connect the app authorization for the

## Step 5: Connect AppFabric for security data in security tools and other destinations

Normalized (or raw) application data from AppFabric is compatible with any tool that supports
data ingestion from Amazon S3 and integration with Firehose, including security tools like
Barracuda XDR, Dynatrace, Logz.io,
Netskope, NetWitness, Rapid7, and
Splunk, or your proprietary security solution. To get normalized (or raw)
application data from AppFabric, follow the previous steps 1 through 3. For more details on how to
set up specific security tools and services, see [Compatible\
security tools and services](security-tools.md).
