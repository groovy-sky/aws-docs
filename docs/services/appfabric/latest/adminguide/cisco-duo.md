<a name="cisco-duo"></a>

Cisco Duo protects against breaches with a leading access management suite that provides strong multi-layered defenses and innovative capabilities that allow legitimate users in and keep bad actors out. For any organization concerned about being breached and needs a solution fast, Cisco Duo quickly enables strong security while also improving user productivity.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from Cisco Duo, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Cisco Duo
<a name="cisco-duo-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Cisco Duo.

### Prerequisites
<a name="cisco-duo-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Cisco Duo to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ To access the audit logs, you need to have an active subscription to a Duo Essentials, Duo Advantage, or Duo Premier edition. Alternatively, new customers with an Advantage or Premier trial can also access. For more information about Cisco Duo editions, see [Editions & Pricing](https://duo.com/editions-and-pricing).
+ You need to be an Administrator with Owner role to create or modify Admin API.
+ You need to add Grant read log resource” permissions to access audit logs in the admin API.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="cisco-duo-rate-limit"></a>

Cisco Duo imposes rate limits on the Cisco Duo API. For more information about the Cisco Duo API rate limits, see the rate limits under [Authentication Logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#authentication-logs). If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Cisco Duo API applications exceed Cisco Duo's limits, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed. Contact Cisco Duo if you need a rate limit increase.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="cisco-duo-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).
