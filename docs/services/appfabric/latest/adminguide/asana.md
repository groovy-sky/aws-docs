# Configure Asana for AppFabric
<a name="asana"></a>

Asana is a work management platform that helps individuals, teams, and organizations orchestrate work, from daily tasks to cross-functional strategic initiatives. It provides a living system of clarity where everyone can communicate, collaborate, and coordinate work. With Asana, teams integrate critical business tools into one place so work moves forward no matter where it happens.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from Asana, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Asana
<a name="asana-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Asana.

### Prerequisites
<a name="asana-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Asana to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have an **Enterprise account** with Asana. For more information about creating or upgrading to an Asana Enterprise account, see [Asana Enterprise](https://asana.com/enterprise) on the Asana website.
+ You must have a user with the **Super Admin** role in your Asana account. For more information about roles, see [Admin and super admin roles in Asana](https://help.asana.com/hc/en-us/articles/14141552580635-Admin-and-super-admin-roles-in-Asana) on the Asana website.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="asana-rate-limits"></a>

Asana imposes rate limits on the Asana API. For more information about the Asana API rate limits, see [Rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/rate-limits) on the *Asana Developers Guide* website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Asana applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="asana-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Asana account
<a name="asana-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Asana. To find the information required to authorize Asana with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### App authorizations
<a name="asana-app-authorizations"></a>

#### Tenant ID
<a name="asana-tenant-id"></a>

AppFabric will request your tenant ID. The tenant ID in AppFabric is called the domain ID in Asana. To find the domain ID, use the following instructions from the Asana home screen:

1. Choose your account profile picture and select **Admin Console**.

1. Then select **Settings**.

1. Scroll to **Domain Settings**.

1. Enter the domain ID from this section into the AppFabric Tenant ID configuration.

#### Tenant name
<a name="asana-tenant-name"></a>

Enter a name that identifies this unique Asana organization. AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions created from the app authorization.

#### Service account token
<a name="asana-service-account-token"></a>

You must have a service account token from an Asana service account to enter into the AppFabric Asana app authorization. If you don't have a service account token, use the following instructions:

1. To create a service account, follow the instructions in [Service Accounts](https://help.asana.com/hc/en-us/articles/14217496838427-Service-Accounts) on the *Asana Guide* website.

1. Copy and save the token from the bottom of the **Add service account** page the first time you view the **Add service account** page.

1. If you close the **Add service account** page before saving the token, you must edit your service account, generate a new token, and save it.
