# Prerequisites and recommendations to use AWS AppFabric
<a name="prerequisites"></a>

If you're a new AWS customer, complete the setup prerequisites that are listed on this page before you start using AWS AppFabric for security. For these setup procedures, you use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. For complete information about IAM, see the [IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/).

## Sign up for an AWS account
<a name="sign-up-for-aws"></a>

To get started with AWS, you need an AWS account. For information about creating an AWS account, see [Getting started with an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/getting-started.html) in the *AWS Account Management Reference Guide*.

## (Required) Complete application prerequisites
<a name="application-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric for security to receive user information and audit logs from applications, many applications require that you have specific role and plan types. Ensure that you have reviewed the prerequisites for each application that you want to authorize with AppFabric for security, and that you have the proper plans and roles. For more information about the application-specific prerequisites, see [Supported Applications](supported-applications.md), or choose one of the following application-specific topics.

## (Optional) Create an output location
<a name="create-output-location"></a>

AppFabric for security supports Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Data Firehose as audit log ingestion destinations.

### Amazon S3
<a name="output-location-s3"></a>

You can create a new Amazon S3 bucket using the AppFabric console when you create an ingestion destination. You can also create a bucket using the Amazon S3 service. If you choose to create your bucket using the Amazon S3 service, you must create the bucket before creating the AppFabric ingestion destination, and then select the bucket when you create the ingestion destination. You can choose to use an existing Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account, as long as it meets the following requirements for existing buckets:
+ AppFabric for security requires that your Amazon S3 bucket be in the same AWS Region as your Amazon S3 resources.
+ Your can encrypt your bucket using one of the following:
  + Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
  + Server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) using the default AWS managed key (`aws/s3`).

### Amazon Data Firehose
<a name="output-location-firehose"></a>

You can choose to use Amazon Data Firehose as your ingestion destination for AppFabric for security data. To use Firehose, you can create the Firehose delivery stream in your AWS account before creating an ingestion or while you're creating an ingestion destination in AppFabric. You can create a Firehose delivery stream using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or the AWS APIs or SDKs. For stream configuration instructions, see the following topics:
+ AWS Management Console instructions – [Creating an Amazon Data Firehose Delivery Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html) in the *Amazon Data Firehose Developer Guide*
+ AWS CLI instructions – [create-delivery-stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*
+ AWS APIs and SDKs instructions – [CreateDeliveryStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeliveryStream.html) in the *Amazon Data Firehose API Reference*

The requirements when using Amazon Data Firehose as the AppFabric for security output destination are as follows:
+ You must create the stream in the same AWS Region as your AppFabric for security resources.
+ You must select **Direct PUT** as the source.
+ Attach **AmazonKinesisFirehoseFullAccess** AWS managed policy to your user, or attach the following permissions to your user:

  ```
  {
      "Sid": "TagFirehoseDeliveryStream",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["firehose:TagDeliveryStream"],
      "Condition": {
          "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {"aws:TagKeys": "AWSAppFabricManaged"}
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:firehose:*:*:deliverystream/*"
  }
  ```

Firehose supports integration with a variety of third-party security tools, such as Splunk and Logz.io. For information about how to properly configure Amazon Kinesis so that it outputs data to these tools, see [Destination Settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/create-destination.html) in the *Amazon Data Firehose Developer Guide*.

## (Optional) Create an AWS KMS key
<a name="create-kms-keys"></a>

In the process of creating an AppFabric for security app bundle, you will select or set up an encryption key to securely protect your data from all authorized applications. This key will be used to encrypt your data within the AppFabric service.

AppFabric for security encrypts data by default. AppFabric for security can use an AWS owned key created and managed by AppFabric on your behalf or a customer managed key that you create and manage in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). AWS owned keys are a collection of AWS KMS keys that an AWS service owns and manages for use in multiple AWS accounts. Customer managed keys are AWS KMS keys in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage. For more information about AWS owned keys and customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and AWS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

If you want to use a customer managed key to encrypt your data, such as authorization tokens, within AppFabric for security, you can create one with [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/). For more information about the permissions policy that grants access to your customer managed key in AWS KMS, see the [Key policy](data-protection.md#key-policy) section of this guide.
