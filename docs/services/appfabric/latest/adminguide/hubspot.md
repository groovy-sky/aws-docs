# Configure HubSpot for AppFabric
<a name="hubspot"></a>

HubSpot is a customer platform with all the software, integrations, and resources you need to connect your marketing, sales, content management, and customer service. HubSpot's connected platform enables you to grow your business faster by focusing on what matters most: your customers.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from HubSpot, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for HubSpot
<a name="hubspot-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from HubSpot.

### Prerequisites
<a name="hubspot-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from HubSpot to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have an account with the Enterprise subscription in HubSpot to access access audit logs. For more information about HubSpot subscriptions, see [Manage your HubSpot subscription](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account/manage-your-hubspot-subscription) on the HubSpot Knowledge Base.
+ You must have a developer account and an app associated with the account.
+ You should be a **super admin** to install apps in your HubSpot account or have App Marketplace Access permission plus the user permissions to accepts the scopes the app is requesting.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="hubspot-rate-limit"></a>

HubSpot imposes rate limits on the HubSpot API. For more information about the HubSpot API rate limits, including limits for apps using OAuth, see [Rate Limits](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/usage-details#rate-limits) on the HubSpot website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing HubSpot API applications exceed HubSpot's limits, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="hubspot-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your HubSpot account
<a name="hubspot-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with HubSpot. To find the information required to authorize HubSpot with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="hubspot-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with HubSpot using OAuth. To create an OAuth application in HubSpot, use the following steps:

1. Follow the instructions in the [ Create a public app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app) section in the HubSpot guide on the HubSpot website.

1. From the **Auth** tab, add the three scopes listed in [Required scopes](#hubspot-required-scopes).

1. Use a redirect URL with the following format in **Redirect URL**.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, {{<region>}} is the code for the AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

1. Choose **Create app**.

### Required scopes
<a name="hubspot-required-scopes"></a>

You must add the following scopes to your HubSpot OAuth application:
+ `settings.users.read`
+ `crm.objects.owners.read`
+ `account-info.security.read`

### App authorizations
<a name="hubspot-app-authorizations"></a>

#### Tenant ID
<a name="hubspot-tenant-id"></a>

Enter an ID that identifies this unique HubSpot organization. For example, enter your HubSpot account ID.

#### Tenant name
<a name="hubspot-tenant-name"></a>

Enter a name that identifies this unique HubSpot organization. AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions created from the app authorization.

#### Client ID
<a name="hubspot-client-id"></a>

AppFabric will request a client ID. To find your client ID in HubSpot, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [HubSpot log-in page](https://app.hubspot.com/login) and sign in using your developer account credentials.

1. From the **Apps** menu, choose your app.

1. From the **Auth** tab, look for the **Client ID** value.

#### Client secret
<a name="hubspot-client-secret"></a>

AppFabric will request a client secret. To find your client secret in HubSpot, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [HubSpot log-in page](https://app.hubspot.com/login) and sign in using your developer account credentials.

1. From the **Apps** menu, choose your app.

1. From the **Auth** tab, look for the **Client secret** value.

#### Approve authorization
<a name="hubspot-approve-authorization"></a>

After creating the app authorization in AppFabric, you will receive a pop-up window from HubSpot to approve the authorization. Sign in to your account using your enterprise account credentials (not your developer account) to approve the AppFabric authorization. Choose **allow**.
