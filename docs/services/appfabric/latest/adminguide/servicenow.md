# Configure ServiceNow for AppFabric
<a name="servicenow"></a>

ServiceNow is a leading provider of cloud-based services that automate enterprise IT operations. ServiceNow’s ITOM gives enterprises complete visibility and control of their entire IT environment – including virtualized and cloud infrastructure. It simplifies service mapping, delivery and assurance, consolidating IT service and infrastructure data into a single system of record. It also automates and streamlines key processes — including event, incident, problem, configuration and change management.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from ServiceNow, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for ServiceNow
<a name="servicenow-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from ServiceNow.

### Prerequisites
<a name="servicenow-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from ServiceNow to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You can use AppFabric with any ServiceNow plan type.
+ You must have a user with the Administrator role in your ServiceNow account.
+ You must have a ServiceNow instance.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="servicenow-rate-limits"></a>

ServiceNow imposes rate limits on the ServiceNow API. For more information about the ServiceNow API rate limits, see [Inbound REST API rate limiting](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/inbound-REST-API-rate-limiting.html) on the ServiceNow website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing ServiceNow API applications exceed the limits, audit logs appearing in AppFabric may be delayed.

## Data delay considerations
<a name="servicenow-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your ServiceNow account
<a name="servicenow-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with ServiceNow. Use the following steps to find the information required to authorize ServiceNow with AppFabric.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="servicenow-create-oauth"></a>

The Now Platform supports OAuth 2.0 - Authorization Grant type for public clients to generate an access token.

1. Register your OAuth application. This requires the following three steps. For more information on completing these steps, see the [Register your application with ServiceNow](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0725643) on the *ServiceNow website*.

   1. Register the app and make sure the **Auth Scope** has access to the **Table API**, with a **REST API PATH** of **now/table**, and an **HTTP Method** of **GET** as shown in the following example.
![OAuth app configuration in ServiceNow.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/latest/adminguide/images/servicenow-oauth-config.png)

   1. Generate an authorization code.

   1. Generate a bearer token using the authorization code.

1. Use a redirect URL with the following format.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, {{<region>}} is the code for the AWS Region in which you configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

### App authorizations
<a name="servicenow-app-authorizations"></a>

#### Tenant ID
<a name="servicenow-tenant-id"></a>

AppFabric will request a tenant ID. The tenant ID in AppFabric is your instance name. You can find your tenant ID in the address bar of your browser. For example, `{{example}}` is the tenant ID in the following URL `https://{{example}}.service-now.com`.

#### Tenant name
<a name="servicenow-tenant-name"></a>

Enter a name that identifies this unique ServiceNow organization. AppFabric uses the tenant’s name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions created from the app authorization.

#### Client ID
<a name="servicenow-client-id"></a>

AppFabric will request a client ID. Use the following steps to find your client ID in ServiceNow.

1. Navigate to the ServiceNow console.

1. Choose **System OAuth**, and then choose the **Application Registry** tab.

1. Choose your application.

1. Enter the client ID from your OAuth client into the **Client ID** field in AppFabric.
