# Configure Box for AppFabric
<a name="box"></a>

Box is the leading Content Cloud, a single platform that empowers organizations to manage the entire content lifecycle, work securely from anywhere, and integrate across best-of-breed apps.

You can use AWS AppFabric to receive audit logs and user data from Box, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for the Box
<a name="box-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Box.

### Prerequisites
<a name="box-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Box to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ To access the audit logs, you need to have an active paid subscription to [Business, Business Plus, Enterprise, or Enterprise Plus](https://www.box.com/pricing) plans.
+ You must have a user with the [Admin Privileges](https://developer.box.com/guides/events/enterprise-events/for-enterprise/).
+ You must have [2-factor authentication](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043697154-Two-Factor-Authentication-Set-Up-for-Your-Account) enabled on your Box account for viewing and copying the application's client secret from the configuration tab.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="box-rate-limits"></a>

Box imposes rate limits on the Box API. For more information about the Box API [rate limits](https://developer.box.com/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/rate-limits/#per-api-rate-limits), see Rate limits on the Box Developers Guide website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Box applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="box-data-delay"></a>

You may see up to 30-minute delay in an audit event to get delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this may be customizable on an account level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).
