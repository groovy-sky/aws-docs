# Configure Azure Monitor for AppFabric
<a name="azure-monitor"></a>

Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring solution for collecting, analyzing, and responding to monitoring data from your cloud and on-premises environments. You can use Azure Monitor to maximize the availability and performance of your applications and services. It helps you understand how your applications are performing and allows you to manually and programmatically respond to system events.

Azure Monitor collects and aggregates the data from every layer and component of your system across multiple Azure and non-Azure subscriptions and tenants. It stores it in a common data platform for consumption by a common set of tools that can correlate, analyze, visualize, and/or respond to the data. You can also integrate other Microsoft and non-Microsoft tools. The Azure Monitor activity log is a platform log that provides insight into subscription-level events. The activity log includes information like when a resource is modified or a virtual machine is started.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from Azure Monitor, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Azure Monitor
<a name="azure-monitor-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric is capable of receiving user information and audit logs from the following Azure Monitor services:
+ Azure Monitor
+ API Management
+ Microsoft Sentinel
+ Security Center

### Prerequisites
<a name="azure-monitor-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Azure Monitor to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You need to have a Microsoft Azure account with either a free trial or pay-as-you-go subscription.
+ At least one subscription is required to fetch the events within that subscription.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="azure-monitor-rate-limits"></a>

Azure Monitor imposes rate limits to the security principal (user or application) making the requests and the subscription ID or tenant ID. For more information about the Azure Monitor API rate limits, see [Understand how Azure Resource Manager throttles requests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling) on the *Azure Monitor Developer website*.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="azure-monitor-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Azure Monitor account
<a name="azure-monitor-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Azure Monitor. To find the information required to authorize Azure Monitor with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="azure-monitor-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with Azure Monitor using OAuth2. Complete the following steps to create an OAuth2 application in Azure Monitor:

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in.

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. Choose **App Registrations**.

1. Choose on **New Registration**.

1. Enter a name for the client such as Azure Monitor OAuth Client. This will be the name of the registered application.

1. Verify the **Supported account types** is set to **Single Tenant**.

1. For the **Redirect URI**, select **Web** as the platform and add a redirect URI. Use the following format for the redirect URI:

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In that address, `{{<region>}}` is the code for the AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

   The authentication response will be sent to the provided URI after successfully authenticating the user. Providing this now is optional and it can be changed later, but a value is required for most authentication scenarios.

1. Choose **Register**.

1. In the registered app, choose on **Certificates & secrets** and then **New client secret**.

1. Add a description for the secret.

1. Select the secret expiration duration. You can select any preset duration from the drop-down or set a custom duration.

1. Choose **Add**. Client secret values can only be viewed immediately after creation. Be sure to save the secret somewhere safe before leaving the page.

### Required permissions
<a name="azure-monitor-required-permissions"></a>

You must add the following permissions to your OAuth application. To add permissions, follow the instructions in the [Add permissions to access your web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#add-permissions-to-access-your-web-api) section of the *Microsoft Entra Developer Guide*.
+ Microsoft Graph User Access API > User.Read.All (Select Delegated Type)
+ Microsoft Graph User Access API > offline\_access (Select Delegated Type)
+ Azure Service Management Audit Log API > user\_impersonation (Select Delegated Type)

After you’ve added the permissions, to grant admin consent for the permissions, follow the instructions in the [Admin consent button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis#admin-consent-button) section of the *Microsoft Entra Developer Guide*.

### App authorizations
<a name="azure-monitor-app-authorizations"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from your Azure Monitor account. To receive both audit logs and user data from Azure Monitor, you must create two app authorizations, one that is named **Azure Monitor** in the app authorization drop-down list, and another that is named **Azure Monitor Audit Logs** in the app authorization drop-down list. You can use the same tenant ID, client ID and client secret for both app authorizations. To receive audit logs from Azure Monitor you need both the **Azure Monitor** and **Azure Monitor Audit Logs** app authorizations. To use the user access tool alone, only the **Azure Monitor** app authorization is required.

#### Tenant ID
<a name="azure-monitor-tenant-id"></a>

AppFabric will request your tenant ID. Complete the following steps to find your client ID in **Azure Monitor**:

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.

1. In the **App Registrations** section, choose the app that was previously created.

1. In the **Overview** section, copy the tenant ID from the **Directory (tenant) ID** field.

#### Tenant name
<a name="azure-monitor-tenant-name"></a>

Enter a name that identifies this unique Azure Monitor subscription. AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions created from the app authorization.

**Note**
The tenant name should be maximum 2,048 characters consisting of numbers, lower/upper case letters, and the following special characters: period (.), underscore (\_), dash (-) and empty space.

#### Client ID
<a name="azure-monitor-client-id"></a>

AppFabric will request a client ID. Complete the following procedure to find your client ID in Azure Monitor:

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.

1. In the **App Registrations** section, choose the app that was previously created.

1. In the **Overview** section, copy the client ID from the **Application (client) ID** field.

#### Client secret
<a name="azure-monitor-client-secret"></a>

AppFabric will request a client secret. Client secret for the registered OAuth app is what you generated in Step 11 of the OAuth App creation section. If you misplace the client secret generated during the OAuth app creation, repeat the steps 8-11 in the OAuth App creation section to regenerate a new one.

#### App authorization
<a name="azure-monitor-app-authorization"></a>

After creating the app authorization in AppFabric, you will receive a pop-up window from Microsoft Azure to approve the authorization. Sign in to your account from the window and approve the AppFabric authorization by choosing **Allow**.
