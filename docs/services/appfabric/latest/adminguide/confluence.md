# Configure Atlassian Confluence for AppFabric
<a name="confluence"></a>

Create, collaborate, and organize all your work in one place. Confluence is a team workspace where knowledge and collaboration meet. Dynamic pages give your team a place to create, capture, and collaborate on any project or idea. Spaces help your team structure, organize, and share work, so every team member has visibility into institutional knowledge and access to the information they need to do their best work.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to receive audit logs and user data from Confluence, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Atlassian Confluence
<a name="confluence-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving audit logs from Atlassian Confluence.

### Prerequisites
<a name="confluence-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Atlassian Confluence to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ To access the Audit logs, you need to have an standard, premium, or enterprise account. For more information about creating or upgrading to the applicable Confluence plan type, see [Confluence Pricing](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/pricing.html) on the Atlassian website.
+ To access the Audit logs, you need to have Administrator permissions for your account. For more information about roles, see [Give users admin permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/give-users-admin-permissions/) on the Atlassian Support website.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="confluence-rate-limit"></a>

Confluence imposes rate limits on the Atlassian Confluence API. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Atlassian Confluence API applications exceed Atlassian Confluence's limits, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="confluence-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Atlassian Confluence account
<a name="confluence-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Atlassian Confluence. To find the information required to authorize Atlassian Confluence with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="confluence-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with Atlassian Confluence using OAuth. To create an OAuth application in Atlassian Confluence, use the following steps.

1. Navigate to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/).

1. Choose your profile icon in the top-right and choose **Developer console**.

1. Next to **My apps**, choose **Create**, **OAuth 2.0 integration**.

1. Choose **Permissions** in the left navigation pane and choose **Add** next to Confluence API.

1. Under **Classic scopes**, select **Read user** (`read:confluence-user`).

1. Under **Granular scopes**, select **View audit records** (`read:audit-log:confluence`).

1. Choose **Authorization** in the left navigation pane and choose **Add** next to **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)**.

1. Use a redirect URL with the following format in the **Callback URL** text box and choose **Save changes**.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, {{<region>}} is the code for the AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

### Required scopes
<a name="confluence-required-scopes"></a>

You must add one of the following scopes to your Atlassian Confluence OAuth application. For more information about scopes, see [Scopes for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) and Forge apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/) on the Atlassian Developer website. Use the classic scope where available.
