# Troubleshoot AppClients in AppFabric for productivity

The AWS AppFabric for productivity feature is in preview and is subject to change.

This section describes common errors and troubleshooting for AppFabric for productivity.

## Unverified application

App developers that use AppFabric for productivity to enrich their app experiences will go through a
verification process prior to launching their features to end users. All applications start as
unverified and change to verified only when the verification process is complete. This means that
the `starterUserEmails` you used when creating an AppClient will see this
message.

## `Authorize` errors

### ValidationException

You might receive the following exception if any of the API parameters don’t satisfy the
constraints defined in the API specifications.

```nohighlight

ValidationException
HTTP Status Code: 400
```

**Reason 1: When AppClient ID is not specified**

The `app_client_id` is missing in the request parameters. Create the AppClient
if it hasn't yet been created or use your existing `app_client_id` and try again. To
find the AppClient ID, use the [ListAppClient](manage-appclients.md#list_appclients) API
operation.

**Reason 2: When AppFabric doesn’t have access to the**
**customer managed key**

```nohighlight

Message: AppFabric couldn't access the customer managed key configured for AppClient.
```

AppFabric is currently unable to access the customer managed keys, likely due to recent changes in its
permissions. Verify the specified key exists and ensure AppFabric is granted the appropriate access
permissions.

**Reason 3: The redirect URL specified is not valid**

```nohighlight

Message: Redirect url invalid
```

Ensure the redirect URL in your request is correct. It must match one of the redirect URLs
specified when you created or updated the AppClient. To view the list of allowed redirect URLs,
use the [GetAppClient](manage-appclients.md#get_appclient_details) API operation.

## `Token` errors

### TokenException

You might receive the following exception for a few reasons.

```nohighlight

TokenException
HTTP Status Code: 400
```

**Reason 1: When an email that is not valid is**
**specified**

```

Message: Invalid Email used
```

Ensure the email address you’re using matches the one listed for the
`starterUserEmails` attribute when you created the AppClient. If the emails don’t
match, change to the matching email address and try again. To view the email used, use the [GetAppClient](manage-appclients.md#get_appclient_details) API operation.

**Reason 2: For grant\_type as refresh\_token when the token is not**
**specified.**

```

Message: refresh_token must be non-null for Refresh Token Grant-type
```

The refresh token specified in the request is null or empty. Specify an active
`refresh_token` received in [Token](getting-started-appdeveloper-productivity.md#authorize_data_access) API
call response.

### ThrottlingException

You might receive the following exception if the API is being called at rate which is more
than the allowed quota.

```nohighlight

ThrottlingException
HTTP Status Code: 429
```

## `ListActionableInsights`, `ListMeetingInsights`, and `PutFeedback` errors

### ValidationException

You might receive the following exception if any of the API parameters don't satisfy the
constraint defined on the API specifications.

```nohighlight

ValidationException
HTTP Status Code: 400
```

### ThrottlingException

You might receive the following exception if the API is being called at rate which is more
than the allowed quota.
