## AppFabric support for the Jira suite
<a name="jira-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from the Jira suite, with the exception of Jira Align.

### Prerequisites
<a name="jira-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from the Jira suite to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have a Jira Standard Plan or higher. For more information about the capabilities of the Jira plans, see [Jira Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing), [Jira Service Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/pricing), [Jira Work Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/work-management/pricing), and [Jira Product Discovery](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/product-discovery/pricing) pricing pages.
+ You must have a user with the **Organization admin** role in your Jira account. For more information about roles, see [Give users admin permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/user-management/docs/give-users-admin-permissions/) on the Atlassian Support website.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="jira-rate-limits"></a>

The Jira suite imposes rate limits on the Jira API. For more information about the Jira suite API rate limits, see [Rate limiting](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rate-limiting/) on the *Atlassian Developers Guide* website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Jira API applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="jira-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Jira account
<a name="jira-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Jira. To find the information required to authorize Jira with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="jira-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with the Jira suite using OAuth. To create an OAuth application in Jira, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/).

1. Next to **My apps**, choose **Create**, **OAuth 2.0 integration**.

1. Give your app a name and choose **Create**.

1. Navigate to the **Authorization** section and choose **Add** next to OAuth 2.0.

1. Use a URL with the following format in the **Callback URL** field and choose **Save** changes.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, {{<region>}} is the code for the AWS Region in which you configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section, copy your client ID and client secret, and save it to use for the AppFabric app authorization.

### Required scopes
<a name="jira-required-scopes"></a>

You must add the following scopes to your Jira OAuth application’s **Permissions** page:
+ Under Classic Scopes:
  + Jira API > `read:jira-user`
+ Under Granular Scopes:
  + Jira API > `read:audit-log:jira`
  + Jira API > `read:user:jira`

### App authorizations
<a name="jira-app-authorizations"></a>

#### Tenant ID
<a name="jira-tenant-id"></a>

AppFabric will request your tenant ID. The tenant ID in AppFabric is your **Jira instance subdomain**. You can find your **Jira instance subdomain** in your browser’s address bar between **https://** and **.atlassian.net**.

#### Tenant name
<a name="jira-tenant-name"></a>

Enter a name that identifies this unique Jira server. AppFabric uses the tenant name to label the app authorizations and any ingestions created from the app authorization.

#### Client ID
<a name="jira-client-id"></a>

AppFabric will request your client ID. To find your client ID in Jira, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/).

1. Select the OAuth application that you use to connect AppFabric.

1. Enter the client ID from the **Settings** page into the client ID field in AppFabric.

#### Client secret
<a name="jira-client-secret"></a>

AppFabric will request your client secret. The **Client secret** in AppFabric is the **Secret** in Jira. To find your **Secret** in Jira, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [Atlassian Developer Console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/).

1. Select the OAuth application that you use to connect AppFabric.

1. Enter the secret from the **Settings** page into the **Client Secret** field in AppFabric.

#### Approve authorization
<a name="jira-approve-authorization"></a>

After creating the app authorization in AppFabric you will receive a pop-up window from Jira to approve the authorization. To approve the AppFabric authorization, choose **Allow**.
