# Configure Dropbox for AppFabric
<a name="dropbox"></a>

Dropbox helps your organization get better work done faster by bringing your people together - no matter what they’re working on, where they’re working, or what kind of tools they happen to be using. It enables users to accelerate innovation and efficiency by providing a simple, secure way to share content. Dropbox is one place to keep life organized and keep work moving. With more than 700 million registered users across 180 countries, Dropbox is on a mission to design a more enlightened way of working.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from Dropbox, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Dropbox
<a name="dropbox-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Dropbox.

### Prerequisites
<a name="dropbox-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Dropbox to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have a Dropbox Business account. For more information about creating or upgrading to a Dropbox Business account, see [Dropbox Business](https://www.dropbox.com/business) on the Dropbox website.
+ You must have a user with the Team Admin role in your Dropbox account. For more information about roles, see [How to change admin rights for your Dropbox team](https://help.dropbox.com/security/change-admin-rights) on the *Dropbox Help Center* website.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="dropbox-rate-limits"></a>

Dropbox imposes rate limits on the Dropbox API. For more information about the Dropbox API rate limits, see [Rate limits](https://developers.dropbox.com/dbx-performance-guide#api-rate-limits) on the *Dropbox Performance Guide* website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Dropbox API applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="dropbox-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Dropbox account
<a name="dropbox-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Dropbox. To find the information required to authorize Dropbox with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="dropbox-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with Dropbox using OAuth. To create an OAuth application in Dropbox, use the following steps:

1. Choose **Create app** in the Dropbox App Console at [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).

1. On the new application configuration page, choose **Scoped access** for the API.

1. Next, select **Full Dropbox** for the type of access.

1. Name your OAuth application, and then chose **Create app** to complete the initial OAuth application setup.

1. On the application info page, add a redirect URL with the following format in the OAuth2 redirect URIs field.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, `{{<region>}}` is the code for the AWS Region in which you configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

1. Choose **Add**.

1. Copy and save your app key and app secret for use in the AppFabric app authorization.

1. You can leave all other fields on the **Settings** tab with their default values.

### Required scopes
<a name="dropbox-required-scopes"></a>

You must add the following scopes to your Dropbox app using the **Permissions** tab on the app info screen:
+ `account_info.read`
+ `team_data.member`

+ `team_info.read`

Choose **Submit** after you are done.
