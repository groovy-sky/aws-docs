# Configure Smartsheet for AppFabric
<a name="smartsheet"></a>

Smartsheet is a work management platform that helps you align work, people, and technology across your enterprise. Smartsheet offers a robust set of enterprise-grade capabilities to empower everyone to manage projects, automate workflows, and rapidly build solutions at scale, creating an environment for innovation while maintaining security and compliance.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from Smartsheet, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Smartsheet
<a name="smartsheet-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Smartsheet.

### Prerequisites
<a name="smartsheet-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Smartsheet to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have a Smartsheet Business, Enterprise, or Advance account. For more information about creating or upgrading your Smartsheet account, see either [Smartsheet pricing](https://www.smartsheet.com/pricing) or [Smartsheet Advance](https://www.smartsheet.com/pricing/smartsheet-advance) on the Smartsheet website.
+ You must complete the [Smartsheet developer registration](https://developers.smartsheet.com/register/) process.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="smartsheet-rate-limits"></a>

Smartsheet imposes rate limits on the Smartsheet API. For more information about the Smartsheet API rate limits, see [Rate limiting](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/#section/Work-at-Scale/Rate-Limiting) in the *Smartsheet API Reference on the Smartsheet website*.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="smartsheet-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Smartsheet account
<a name="smartsheet-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Smartsheet. To find the information required to authorize Smartsheet with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="smartsheet-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with Smartsheet using OAuth. To create an OAuth application in Smartsheet, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the developer tools in your Smartsheet account.

1. Choose **Create New App** from the developer tools screen.

1. Complete all of the input fields on the **Create New App** screen.

1. Use any unique value for **App URL** and **App Contact/support**.

1. Use a redirect URL with the following format as the App redirect URL.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, `{{<region>}}` is the code for the AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

1. Choose **Save**.

1. Copy and save the app client ID and app secret.

### Required scopes
<a name="smartsheet-required-scopes"></a>

Smartsheet does not require you to explicitly add scopes to your OAuth configuration. AppFabric will request the following scopes in the authorization request to your Smartsheet account:
+ `READ_EVENTS`
+ `READ_USERS`

### App authorizations

AppFabric will request your tenant ID. Enter any value that uniquely identifies your Smartsheet account.

#### Client ID
<a name="smartsheet-client-id"></a>

1. Select the OAuth application that you use to connect with AppFabric.

1. Enter the app client ID from the **App Profile** screen into the **Client ID** field in AppFabric.

#### Client secret
<a name="smartsheet-client-secret"></a>
