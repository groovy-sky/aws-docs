# Configure 1Password for AppFabric
<a name="1password"></a>

1Password is a password manager that helps you create, store, and use strong passwords for all your online accounts. It also protects your data with encryption, alerts you about breaches, and lets you share passwords.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from 1Password, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for 1Password
<a name="1password-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from 1Password.

### Prerequisites
<a name="1password-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from 1Password to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have an active paid 1Password Business or Enterprise subscription plan. For more information, see [1Password Enterprise](https://1password.com/business-pricing) on the 1Password website.
+ You must have an administrator role or team owner in the 1Password account. For more information, see [Groups](https://support.1password.com/groups/) in the 1Password support website.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="1password-rate-limits"></a>

The 1Password AuditLog Events API limits requests to 600 per minute and up to 30,000 per hour. Exceeding these limits returns an error. For more information, see [1Password API Rate limits](https://developer.1password.com/docs/events-api/reference/#rate-limits) in the *1Password Events API reference*.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="1password-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).
