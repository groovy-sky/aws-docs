# ActionableInsights

The AWS AppFabric for productivity feature is in preview and is subject to change.

Contains a summary of important and suitable actions for a user based on emails,
calendar invites, messages, and tasks from their app portfolio. Users can see
proactive insights from across their applications to help them best orient their
day. These insights provide justification on why a user should care about the
insight summary along with references, such as embedded links, to individual apps
and artifacts that generated the insight.

ParameterDescription

**insightId**

The unique id for the generated insight.

**insightContent**

This returns a summary of the insight and embedded links to
artifacts used to generate the insight.

This would be an HTML content containing embedded links
( `<a>` tags).

**insightTitle**

The title of the generated insight.

**createdAt**

When the insight was generated.

**actions**

A list of actions recommend for the generated insight.

The action object contains the following parameters:

- `actionId` — The unique id for the
generated action.

- `actionIconUrl` — The icon URL for
the app that the action is suggested to be executed
in.

- `actionTitle` — The title of the
generated action.

- `actionUrl` — The unique URL for the
end user to view and execute the action in AppFabric’s
user portal.

For executing actions, ISV apps will re-direct users
to AppFabric user portal (pop up screen) using this
URL.

- `actionExecutionStatus` — An enum
indicating the status of the action.

The possible values are: `EXECUTED |
                                                  NOT_EXECUTED`
