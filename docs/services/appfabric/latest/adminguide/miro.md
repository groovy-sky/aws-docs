<a name="miro"></a>

Miro is an online workspace for innovation that enables distributed teams of any size to build the next big thing. The platform’s infinite canvas enables teams to lead engaging workshops and meetings, design products, brainstorm ideas, and more. Miro, co-headquartered in San Francisco and Amsterdam, serves more than 50M users worldwide, including 99% of the Fortune 100. Miro was founded in 2011 and currently has more than 1,500 employees in 12 hubs around the world. To learn more, visit [Miro](https://miro.com).

Miro includes a full suite of collaborative capabilities designed for innovation including diagramming, wireframing, real-time data visualization, workshop facilitation, and built-in support for agile practices, workshops, and interactive presentations. Miro recently announced Miro AI which extends Miro’s capabilities, with AI-driven mapping and diagramming, clustering and summarization, and content generation. Miro enables organizations to reduce the number of standalone tools, reducing information fragmentation and cost.

You can use AWS AppFabric for security to audit logs and user data from Miro, normalize the data into Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) format, and output the data to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or an Amazon Data Firehose stream.

## AppFabric support for Miro
<a name="miro-appfabric-support"></a>

AppFabric supports receiving user information and audit logs from Miro.

### Prerequisites
<a name="miro-prerequisites"></a>

To use AppFabric to transfer audit logs from Miro to supported destinations, you must meet the following requirements:
+ You must have a Miro Enterprise Plan. For more information about the Miro plan types, see the [Miro pricing](https://miro.com/pricing/) page on the Miro website.
+ You must have a user with the Company Admin role in your Miro account. For more information about roles, see the *Company level* section of [Roles in Miro](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017571194-Roles-in-Miro#Company_level) on the Miro Help Center website.
+ You must have an Enterprise Developer team in your Miro account. For information about creating developer teams, see [Enterprise Developer teams](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/4766759572114) on the Miro Help Center website.

### Rate limit considerations
<a name="miro-rate-limit"></a>

Miro imposes rate limits on the Miro API. For more information about the Miro API rate limits, see [Rate Limiting](https://developers.miro.com/docs/rate-limiting) in the *Miro Developers Guide* on the Miro website. If the combination of AppFabric and your existing Miro API applications exceed the limit, audit logs appearing in AppFabric might be delayed.

### Data delay considerations
<a name="miro-data-delay"></a>

You might see up to a 30-minute delay for an audit event to be delivered to your destination. This is due to delay in audit events made available by the application as well as due to precautions taken to reduce data loss. However, this might be customizable at an account-level. For assistance, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

## Connecting AppFabric to your Miro account
<a name="miro-appfabric-connecting"></a>

After you create your app bundle within the AppFabric service, you must authorize AppFabric with Miro. To find the information required to authorize Miro with AppFabric, use the following steps.

### Create an OAuth application
<a name="miro-create-oauth-application"></a>

AppFabric integrates with Miro using OAuth. To create an OAuth application in Miro, use the following steps:

1. To create an OAuth application, follow the instructions in the [Creating and installing apps](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/4766759572114#Creating_and_installing_apps) section of the *Enterprise Developer teams* article on the Miro Help Center website.

1. On the app creation dialog, select the **Expire user authorization token** check box after you select a developer team on the enterprise organization.
**Note**
You must do this *before* creating the app because you can't change this option after you create the app.

1. On the app page, enter a URL with the following format in the **Redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 section**.

   ```
   https://{{<region>}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2
   ```

   In this URL, {{<region>}} is the code for the AWS Region in which you’ve configured your AppFabric app bundle. For example, the code for the US East (N. Virginia) Region is `us-east-1`. For that Region, the redirect URL is `https://{{us-east-1}}.console.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/oauth2`.

1. Copy and save your client ID and client secret to use in the AppFabric app authorization.

### Required scopes
<a name="miro-required-scopes"></a>

You must add the following scopes on the `Permissions` section of your Miro OAuth app page:
+ `auditlogs:read`
+ `organizations:read`
