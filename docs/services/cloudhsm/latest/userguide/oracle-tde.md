# Oracle database transparent data encryption (TDE) with AWS CloudHSM

Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is used to encrypt database files. Using TDE, database software encrypts data before storing it on disk.
The data in the database's table columns or tablespaces are encrypted with a table key or tablespace key. Some versions of Oracle's database software offer TDE.
In Oracle TDE, these keys are encrypted with a TDE master encryption key. You can achieve greater security by storing the TDE master encryption key in the HSMs in your AWS CloudHSM cluster.

![Store the Oracle TDE master encryption key in AWS CloudHSM.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/images/tde-master-key-in-hsm.png)

In this solution, you use Oracle Database installed on an Amazon EC2 instance. Oracle Database
integrates with the [AWS CloudHSM software library for PKCS #11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/pkcs11-library.html) to
store the TDE master key in the HSMs in your cluster.

###### Important

-
We recommend installing Oracle Database on an Amazon EC2 instance.

Complete the following steps to accomplish Oracle TDE integration with AWS CloudHSM.

- [Step 1. Set up the prerequisites](#oracle-tde-prerequisites)

- [Step 2: Update the Oracle database configuration](#oracle-tde-configure-database-and-generate-master-key)

- [Step 3: Generate the Oracle TDE master encryption key](#oracle-tde-generate-master-key)

## Step 1. Set up the prerequisites

To accomplish Oracle TDE integration with AWS CloudHSM, you need the following:

- An active AWS CloudHSM cluster with at least one HSM.

- An Amazon EC2 instance running the Amazon Linux operating system with the following software installed:

- The AWS CloudHSM client and command line tools.

- The AWS CloudHSM software library for PKCS #11.

- Oracle Database. AWS CloudHSM supports Oracle TDE integration. Client SDK 5.6 and higher support Oracle TDE for Oracle Database 19c.
Client SDK 3 supports Oracle TDE for Oracle Database versions 11g and 12c.

- A cryptographic user (CU) to own and manage the TDE master encryption key on the HSMs in your cluster.

Complete the following steps to set up all of the prerequisites.

###### To set up the prerequisites for Oracle TDE integration with AWS CloudHSM

1. Complete the steps in [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/getting-started.html). After
    you do so, you'll have an active cluster with one HSM. You will also have an Amazon EC2 instance running the
    Amazon Linux operating system. The AWS CloudHSM client and command line tools will also be installed and configured.

2. (Optional) Add more HSMs to your cluster. For more information, see
    [Adding an HSM to an AWS CloudHSM cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/add-hsm.html).

3. Connect to your Amazon EC2 client instance and do the following:
1. [Install the AWS CloudHSM software library for PKCS #11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/pkcs11-library-install.html).

2. Install Oracle Database. For more information, see the
       [Oracle Database documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database).
       Client SDK 5.6 and higher support Oracle TDE for Oracle Database 19c.
       Client SDK 3 supports Oracle TDE for Oracle Database versions 11g and 12c.

3. Use the cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util command line tool to create a cryptographic user (CU) on
       your cluster. For more information about creating a CU, see [How to Manage HSM Users with CMU](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/create-users-cmu.html) and [HSM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/manage-hsm-users.html).

## Step 2: Update the Oracle database configuration

To update the Oracle Database configuration to use an HSM in your cluster as the
_external security module_, complete the following steps. For information about
external security modules, see
[Introduction to Transparent Data Encryption](https://docs.oracle.com/database/122/ASOAG/introduction-to-transparent-data-encryption.htm) in the _Oracle Database Advanced Security Guide_.

###### To update the Oracle configuration

1. Connect to your Amazon EC2 client instance. This is the instance where you installed Oracle Database.

2. Make a backup copy of the file named `sqlnet.ora`. For the location
    of this file, see the Oracle documentation.

3. Use a text editor to edit the file named `sqlnet.ora`. Add the
    following line. If an existing line in the file begins with
    `encryption_wallet_location`, replace the existing line with the following
    one.

```nohighlight

encryption_wallet_location=(source=(method=hsm))
```

Save the file.

4. Run the following command to create the directory where Oracle Database expects to
    find the library file for the AWS CloudHSM PKCS #11 software library.

```nohighlight

sudo mkdir -p /opt/oracle/extapi/64/hsm
```

5. Run the following command to copy the AWS CloudHSM software library for PKCS #11 file to the
    directory that you created in the previous step.

```nohighlight

sudo cp /opt/cloudhsm/lib/libcloudhsm_pkcs11.so /opt/oracle/extapi/64/hsm/
```

###### Note

The `/opt/oracle/extapi/64/hsm` directory must contain only one library
file. Remove any other files that exist in that directory.

6. Run the following command to change the ownership of the `/opt/oracle`
    directory and everything inside it.

```nohighlight

sudo chown -R oracle:dba /opt/oracle
```

7. Start the Oracle Database.

## Step 3: Generate the Oracle TDE master encryption key

To generate the Oracle TDE master key on the HSMs in your cluster, complete the steps in
the following procedure.

###### To generate the master key

1. Use the following command to open Oracle SQL\*Plus. When prompted,
    type the system password that you set when you installed Oracle Database.

```nohighlight

sqlplus / as sysdba
```

###### Note

For Client SDK 3, you must set the `CLOUDHSM_IGNORE_CKA_MODIFIABLE_FALSE` environment
variable each time you generate a master key. This variable is only needed for master
key generation. For more information, see "Issue: Oracle sets the PCKS #11 attribute
`CKA_MODIFIABLE` during master key generation, but the HSM does not support
it" in [Known Issues for Integrating Third-Party\
Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/ki-third-party.html).

2. Run the SQL statement that creates the master encryption key, as shown in the following
    examples. Use the statement that corresponds to your version of Oracle Database. Replace
    `<CU user name>` with the user name of the cryptographic user
    (CU). Replace `<password>` with the CU password.

###### Important

Run the following command only once. Each time the command is run, it creates a new
master encryption key.

   - For Oracle Database version 11, run the following SQL statement.

     ```nohighlight

     SQL> alter system set encryption key identified by "<CU user name>:<password>";
     ```

   - For Oracle Database version 12 and version 19c, run the following SQL statement.

     ```nohighlight

     SQL> administer key management set key identified by "<CU user name>:<password>";
     ```

If the response is `System altered` or `keystore altered`, then you
successfully generated and set the master key for Oracle TDE.

3. (Optional) Run the following command to verify the status of the _Oracle wallet_.

```nohighlight

SQL> select * from v$encryption_wallet;
```

If the wallet is not open, use one of the following commands to open it. Replace
    `<CU user name>` with the name of the cryptographic user (CU). Replace
    `<password>` with the CU password.

   - For Oracle 11, run the following command to open the wallet.

     ```nohighlight

     SQL> alter system set encryption wallet open identified by "<CU user name>:<password>";
     ```

     To manually close the wallet, run the following command.

     ```nohighlight

     SQL> alter system set encryption wallet close identified by "<CU user name>:<password>";
     ```

   - For Oracle 12 and Oracle 19c, run the following command to open the wallet.

     ```nohighlight

     SQL> administer key management set keystore open identified by "<CU user name>:<password>";
     ```

     To manually close the wallet, run the following command.

     ```nohighlight

     SQL> administer key management set keystore close identified by "<CU user name>:<password>";
     ```
