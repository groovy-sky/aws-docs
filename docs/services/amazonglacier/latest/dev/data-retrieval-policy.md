**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Amazon Glacier Data Retrieval Policies

With Amazon Glacier data retrieval policies, you can easily set data retrieval quotas and manage
the data retrieval activities across your AWS account in each AWS Region. For more
information about Amazon Glacier data retrieval charges, see [Amazon Glacier pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/glacier/pricing).

###### Important

A data retrieval policy applies only to Standard retrievals and manages retrieval requests
made directly to Amazon Glacier.

For more information about the Amazon Glacier storage classes, see [Storage classes for archiving\
objects](../../../s3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.md#sc-glacier) and [Transitioning\
objects](../../../s3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

## Choosing an Amazon Glacier Data Retrieval Policy

You can choose from three types of Amazon Glacier data retrieval policies: No Retrieval Limit,
Free Tier Only, and Max Retrieval Rate.

No Retrieval Limit is the default data retrieval policy that's used for retrievals. If
you use the No Retrieval Limit policy, no retrieval quota is set, and all valid data
retrieval requests are accepted.

By using a Free Tier Only policy, you can keep your retrievals within your daily AWS Free
Tier allowance and not incur any data retrieval costs. If you want to retrieve more data
than is in your AWS Free Tier allowance, you can use a Max Retrieval Rate policy to
set a bytes-per-hour retrieval-rate quota. The Max Retrieval Rate policy ensures that
the peak retrieval rate from all retrieval jobs across your account in an AWS Region
does not exceed the bytes-per-hour quota that you set.

With both the Free Tier Only and Max Retrieval Rate policies, data retrieval requests that
exceed the retrieval quotas that you specified are not accepted. If you use a Free Tier
Only policy, Amazon Glacier synchronously rejects retrieval requests that exceed your AWS
Free Tier allowance. If you use a Max Retrieval Rate policy, Amazon Glacier rejects retrieval
requests that cause the peak retrieval rate of the in-progress jobs to exceed the
bytes-per-hour quota set by the policy. These policies help you simplify data retrieval
cost management.

The following are some useful facts about data retrieval policies:

- Data retrieval policy settings do not change the 3- to 5-hour period that it takes to
retrieve data from Amazon Glacier by using Standard retrievals.

- Setting a new data retrieval policy does not affect previously accepted retrieval jobs
that are already in progress.

- If a retrieval job request is rejected because of a data retrieval policy, you are not
charged for the job or the request.

- You can set one data retrieval policy for each AWS Region, which will govern all data
retrieval activities in the AWS Region under your account. A data retrieval
policy is specific to a particular AWS Region because data retrieval costs
vary across AWS Regions. For more information, see [Amazon Glacier\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/glacier/pricing).

### Free Tier Only Policy

You can set a data retrieval policy to Free Tier Only to ensure that your retrievals always
stay within your AWS Free Tier allowance, so that you don't incur data retrieval
charges. If a retrieval request is rejected, you receive an error message stating
that the request has been denied by the current data retrieval policy.

You can set the data retrieval policy to Free Tier Only on a per-Region basis. After the
policy is set, you cannot retrieve more data in a day than your prorated daily AWS
Free Tier retrieval allowance for that AWS Region. You also do not incur data
retrieval fees.

You can also switch to a Free Tier Only policy after you have incurred data retrieval
charges within a month. In that case, the Free Tier Only policy takes effect for new
retrieval requests, but does not affect past requests. You will be billed for the
previously incurred charges.

### Max Retrieval Rate Policy

You can set your data retrieval policy to Max Retrieval Rate to control the peak retrieval
rate by specifying a data retrieval quota that has a bytes-per-hour maximum. When
you set the data retrieval policy to Max Retrieval Rate, a new retrieval request is
rejected if it would cause the peak retrieval rate of the in-progress jobs to exceed
the bytes-per-hour quota that's specified by the policy. If a retrieval job request
is rejected, you receive an error message stating that the request has been denied
by the current data retrieval policy.

Setting your data retrieval policy to the Max Retrieval Rate policy can affect how much of
your AWS Free Tier allowance that you can use in a day. For example, suppose you
set Max Retrieval Rate to 1 MB per hour. This is less than the AWS Free Tier
policy rate. To ensure that you make good use of the daily AWS Free Tier
allowance, you can first set your policy to Free Tier Only, and then switch to the
Max Retrieval Rate policy later if you need to. For more information about how your
retrieval allowance is calculated, go to [Amazon Glacier FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/faqs).

### No Retrieval Limit Policy

If your data retrieval policy is set to No Retrieval Limit, all valid data retrieval
requests are accepted and your data retrieval costs will vary based on your usage.

## Using the Amazon Glacier Console to Set Up a Data Retrieval Policy

###### To create a data retrieval policy by using the Amazon Glacier console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Glacier console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/glacier/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glacier/home).

2. Under **Select a Region**, choose an AWS Region from the dropdown menu.
    You can configure a data retrieval policy for each AWS Region.

3. In the left navigation pane, choose **Data retrieval settings**.

4. Choose **Edit**. The **Edit data retrieval policies**
    page appears.

5. Under **Data retrieval policies**, choose a policy.

You can select one of the three data retrieval policies: **No retrieval**
**limit**, **Free Tier only**, or **Specify**
**a max retrieval rate**.

- If you choose **No retrieval limit**, all valid data retrieval requests
are accepted.

- If you choose **Free Tier only**, data retrieval requests that exceed
the AWS Free Tier are not accepted.

- If you choose **Specify a max retrieval rate**, data retrieval requests
are rejected if they would cause the peak retrieval rate of the
in-progress jobs to exceed the max retrieval rate that you specify. You
must specify a gigabytes (GB) per hour value in the
**GB/hour** box under **Max retrieval**
**rate**. When you enter a value for
**GB/hour**, the console calculates an estimated
cost for you.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

## Using the Amazon Glacier API to Set Up a Data Retrieval Policy

You can view and set a data retrieval policy by using the Amazon Glacier REST API or by using the
AWS SDKs.

### Using the Amazon Glacier REST API to Set Up a Data Retrieval Policy

You can view and set a data retrieval policy by using the Amazon Glacier REST API. You can view
an existing data retrieval policy by using the [Get Data Retrieval Policy (GET policy)](api-getdataretrievalpolicy.md) operation. You set a data retrieval policy by using the [Set Data Retrieval Policy (PUT policy)](api-setdataretrievalpolicy.md) operation.

When using the `PUT` policy operation, you select the data retrieval policy type
by setting the JSON `Strategy` field value to `BytesPerHour`,
`FreeTier`, or `None`. `BytesPerHour` is
equivalent to choosing **Specify a max retrieval rate** in the
console, `FreeTier` to choosing **Free Tier only**, and
`None` to choosing **No retrieval limit**.

When you use the [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](api-initiate-job-post.md) operation to initiate a data retrieval
job that will exceed the maximum retrieval rate set in your data retrieval policy,
the `Initiate Job` operation stops and throws an exception.

### Using the AWS SDKs to Set Up a Data Retrieval Policy

AWS provides SDKs for you to develop applications for Amazon Glacier. These SDKs provide
libraries that map to the underlying REST API and provide objects that enable you to
easily construct requests and process responses. For more information, see [Using the AWS SDKs with Amazon Glacier](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk.md).
