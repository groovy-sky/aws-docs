**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Get Vault Notifications (GET notification-configuration)

## Description

This operation retrieves the `notification-configuration` subresource set on the
vault (see [Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration)](api-vault-notifications-put.md). If notification configuration for a
vault is not set, the operation returns a `404 Not Found` error. For more
information about vault notifications, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon Glacier](configuring-notifications.md).

## Requests

To retrieve the notification configuration information, send a `GET` request to
the URI of a vault's `notification-configuration` subresource.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /AccountId/vaults/VaultName/notification-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

## Examples

The following example demonstrates how to retrieve the notification configuration for a
vault.

### Example Request

In this example, a `GET` request is sent to the
`notification-configuration` subresource of a vault.

```nohighlight

GET /-/vaults/examplevault/notification-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
x-amz-Date: 20170210T120000Z
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20141123/us-west-2/glacier/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-amz-glacier-version,Signature=9257c16da6b25a715ce900a5b45b03da0447acf430195dcb540091b12966f2a2

### Example Response

A successful response shows the audit logging configuration document in the body of the
response in JSON format. In this example, the configuration shows that notifications
for two events ( `ArchiveRetrievalCompleted` and
`InventoryRetrievalCompleted`) are sent to the Amazon SNS topic
`arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:012345678901:mytopic`.
