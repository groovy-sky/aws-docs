title: "Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration)"
---

**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/).

# Set Vault Notification Configuration (PUT notification-configuration)
<a name="api-vault-notifications-put"></a>

## Description
<a name="api-vault-notifications-put-description"></a>

Retrieving an archive and a vault inventory are asynchronous operations in Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) for which you must first initiate a job and wait for the job to complete before you can download the job output. You can configure a vault to post a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when these jobs complete. You can use this operation to set notification configuration on the vault. For more information, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon Glacier](configuring-notifications.md).

To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the `notification-configuration` subresource of the vault. A notification configuration is specific to a vault; therefore, it is also referred to as a vault subresource. The request should include a JSON document that provides an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic and the events for which you want Amazon Glacier to send notifications to the topic.

You can configure a vault to publish a notification for the following vault events:

+ **`ArchiveRetrievalCompleted`—** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is completed ([Initiate Job (POST jobs)](api-initiate-job-post.md)). The status of the completed job can be `Succeeded` or `Failed`. The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from [Describe Job (GET JobID)](api-describe-job-get.md).
+ **`InventoryRetrievalCompleted`—** This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed ([Initiate Job (POST jobs)](api-initiate-job-post.md)). The status of the completed job can be `Succeeded` or `Failed`. The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as returned from [Describe Job (GET JobID)](api-describe-job-get.md).

Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to publish notifications to the topic.

## Requests
<a name="api-vault-notifications-put-requests"></a>

To set notification configuration on your vault, send a PUT request to the URI of the vault's `notification-configuration` subresource. You specify the configuration in the request body. The configuration includes the Amazon SNS topic name and an array of events that trigger notification to each topic.

### Syntax
<a name="api-vault-notifications-put-requests-syntax"></a>

```
 1. PUT /{{AccountId}}/vaults/{{VaultName}}/notification-configuration HTTP/1.1
 2. Host: glacier.{{Region}}.amazonaws.com
 3. Date: {{Date}}
 4. Authorization: {{SignatureValue}}
 5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
 6.
 7. {
 8.    "SNSTopic": {{String}},
 9.    "Events":[{{String}}, ...]
10. }
```

**Note**
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
