**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Use `UploadMultipartPart` with an AWS SDK or CLI

The following code examples show how to use `UploadMultipartPart`.

CLI

**AWS CLI**

The following command uploads the first 1 MiB (1024 x 1024 bytes) part of an archive:

```nohighlight

aws glacier upload-multipart-part --body part1 --range 'bytes 0-1048575/*' --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --upload-id 19gaRezEXAMPLES6Ry5YYdqthHOC_kGRCT03L9yetr220UmPtBYKk-OssZtLqyFu7sY1_lR7vgFuJV6NtcV5zpsJ

```

Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when performing operations, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

The body parameter takes a path to a part file on the local filesystem. The range parameter takes an HTTP content range indicating the bytes that the part occupies in the completed archive. The upload ID is returned by the `aws glacier initiate-multipart-upload` command and can also be obtained by using `aws glacier list-multipart-uploads`.

For more information on multipart uploads to Amazon Glacier using the AWS CLI, see Using Amazon Glacier in the _AWS CLI User Guide_.

[AWS Code\
Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascript/example_code/glacier).

Create a multipart upload of 1 megabyte chunks of a Buffer object.

```javascript

// Create a new service object and some supporting variables
var glacier = new AWS.Glacier({ apiVersion: "2012-06-01" }),
  vaultName = "YOUR_VAULT_NAME",
  buffer = new Buffer(2.5 * 1024 * 1024), // 2.5MB buffer
  partSize = 1024 * 1024, // 1MB chunks,
  numPartsLeft = Math.ceil(buffer.length / partSize),
  startTime = new Date(),
  params = { vaultName: vaultName, partSize: partSize.toString() };

// Compute the complete SHA-256 tree hash so we can pass it
// to completeMultipartUpload request at the end
var treeHash = glacier.computeChecksums(buffer).treeHash;

// Initiate the multipart upload
console.log("Initiating upload to", vaultName);
// Call Glacier to initiate the upload.
glacier.initiateMultipartUpload(params, function (mpErr, multipart) {
  if (mpErr) {
    console.log("Error!", mpErr.stack);
    return;
  }
  console.log("Got upload ID", multipart.uploadId);

  // Grab each partSize chunk and upload it as a part
  for (var i = 0; i < buffer.length; i += partSize) {
    var end = Math.min(i + partSize, buffer.length),
      partParams = {
        vaultName: vaultName,
        uploadId: multipart.uploadId,
        range: "bytes " + i + "-" + (end - 1) + "/*",
        body: buffer.slice(i, end),
      };

    // Send a single part
    console.log("Uploading part", i, "=", partParams.range);
    glacier.uploadMultipartPart(partParams, function (multiErr, mData) {
      if (multiErr) return;
      console.log("Completed part", this.request.params.range);
      if (--numPartsLeft > 0) return; // complete only when all parts uploaded

      var doneParams = {
        vaultName: vaultName,
        uploadId: multipart.uploadId,
        archiveSize: buffer.length.toString(),
        checksum: treeHash, // the computed tree hash
      };

      console.log("Completing upload...");
      glacier.completeMultipartUpload(doneParams, function (err, data) {
        if (err) {
          console.log("An error occurred while uploading the archive");
          console.log(err);
        } else {
          var delta = (new Date() - startTime) / 1000;
          console.log("Completed upload in", delta, "seconds");
          console.log("Archive ID:", data.archiveId);
          console.log("Checksum:  ", data.checksum);
        }
      });
    });
  }
});
