title: "Step 1: Before You Begin with Amazon Glacier"
---

**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/).

# Step 1: Before You Begin with Amazon Glacier
<a name="getting-started-before-you-begin"></a>

Before you can start with this exercise, you must sign up for an AWS account (if you don't already have one), and then download one of the AWS SDKs. See the following sections for instructions.

**Topics**
+ [Sign up for an AWS account](#sign-up-for-aws)
+ [Download the Appropriate AWS SDK](#getting-started-download-sdk)

## Sign up for an AWS account
<a name="sign-up-for-aws"></a>

To get started with AWS, you need an AWS account. For information about creating an AWS account, see [Getting started with an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/getting-started.html) in the *AWS Account Management Reference Guide*.

## Download the Appropriate AWS SDK
<a name="getting-started-download-sdk"></a>

To try the getting started exercise, you must decide which programming language you want to use, and then download the appropriate AWS SDK for your development platform.

The getting started exercise provides examples in Java and C\#.

### Downloading the AWS SDK for Java
<a name="getting-started-download-sdk-java"></a>

To test the Java examples in this developer guide, you need the AWS SDK for Java. You have the following download options:
+ If you are using Eclipse, you can download and install the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse by using the update site [http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/](http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/). For more information, see [AWS Toolkit for Eclipse](http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/).
+ If you are using any other IDE to create your application, download the [AWS SDK for Java](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava).

### Downloading the AWS SDK for .NET
<a name="getting-started-download-sdk-dotnet"></a>

To test the C\# examples in this developer guide, you need the AWS SDK for .NET. You have the following download options:
+ If you are using Visual Studio, you can install both the AWS SDK for .NET and the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio. The toolkit provides AWS Explorer for Visual Studio and project templates that you can use for development. To download the AWS SDK for .NET, go to [http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/). By default, the installation script installs both the AWS SDK and the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio. To learn more about the toolkit, see the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitVS/latest/UserGuide/).
+ If you are using any other IDE to create your application, you can use the same link provided in the preceding step and install only the AWS SDK for .NET.
