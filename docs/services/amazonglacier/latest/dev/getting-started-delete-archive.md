**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Step 5: Delete an Archive from a Vault in Amazon Glacier

In this step, you'll delete the sample archive that you uploaded in [Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon Glacier](getting-started-upload-archive.md).

###### Important

You cannot delete an archive by using the Amazon Glacier console. Any archive operation, such as
upload, download, or deletion, requires you to use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or write
code. To upload data, such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either
use the AWS CLI or write code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly
or by using the AWS SDKs.

To install the AWS CLI, see [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli).
For more information about using Amazon Glacier with the AWS CLI, see [AWS CLI\
Reference for Amazon Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/glacier/index.html). For examples of using the AWS CLI to upload
archives to Amazon Glacier, see [Using\
Amazon Glacier with the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-using-glacier.html).

Delete the sample archive by following one of these SDKs or the AWS CLI:
