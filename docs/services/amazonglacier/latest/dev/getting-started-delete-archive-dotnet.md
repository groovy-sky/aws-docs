**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Delete an Archive from a Vault in Amazon Glacier by Using the AWS SDK for .NET

The following C# code example uses the high-level API of the AWS SDK for .NET to delete the
archive that you uploaded in the previous step. In the code example, note the
following:

- The example creates an instance of the
`ArchiveTransferManager` class for the specified
Amazon Glacier Region endpoint.

- The code example uses the US West (Oregon) Region ( `us-west-2`).

- The example uses the `Delete` API operation of the
`ArchiveTransferManager` class that's provided as
part of the high-level API of the AWS SDK for .NET.

For step-by-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Code Examples](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-dotnet). You must update the code as shown with the
archive ID of the file that you uploaded in [Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon Glacier](getting-started-upload-archive.md).

###### Example— Deleting an Archive by Using the High-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

```

using System;
using Amazon.Glacier;
using Amazon.Glacier.Transfer;
using Amazon.Runtime;

namespace glacier.amazon.com.docsamples
{
  class ArchiveDeleteHighLevel_GettingStarted
  {
    static string vaultName = "examplevault";
    static string archiveId = "*** Provide archive ID ***";

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      try
      {
        var manager = new ArchiveTransferManager(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USWest2);
        manager.DeleteArchive(vaultName, archiveId);
      }
      catch (AmazonGlacierException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
      catch (AmazonServiceException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
      catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
      Console.WriteLine("To continue, press Enter");
      Console.ReadKey();
    }
  }
}
```
