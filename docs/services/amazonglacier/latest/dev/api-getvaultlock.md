title: "Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy)"

**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/).

# Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy)
<a name="api-GetVaultLock"></a>

## Description
<a name="api-GetVaultLock-description"></a>

This operation retrieves the following attributes from the `lock-policy` subresource set on the specified vault:
+ The vault lock policy set on the vault.
+ The state of the vault lock, which is either `InProgess` or `Locked`.
+ When the lock ID expires. The lock ID is used to complete the vault locking process.
+ When the vault lock was initiated and put into the `InProgress` state.

A vault lock is put into the `InProgress` state by calling [Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy)](api-InitiateVaultLock.md). A vault lock is put into the `Locked` state by calling [Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId)](api-CompleteVaultLock.md). You can stop the vault locking process by calling [Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy)](api-AbortVaultLock.md). For more information about the vault locking process, see [Amazon Glacier Vault Lock](vault-lock.md).

If there is no vault lock policy set on the vault, the operation returns a `404 Not found` error. For more information about vault lock policies, see [Vault Lock Policies](vault-lock-policy.md).

## Requests
<a name="api-GetVaultLock-requests"></a>

To return the current vault lock policy and other attributes, send an HTTP `GET` request to the URI of the vault's `lock-policy` subresource as shown in the following syntax example.

### Syntax
<a name="api-GetVaultLock-requests-syntax"></a>

```
1. GET /{{AccountId}}/vaults/{{vaultName}}/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.{{Region}}.amazonaws.com
3. Date: {{Date}}
4. Authorization: {{SignatureValue}}
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

**Note**
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

## Examples
<a name="api-GetVaultLock-examples"></a>

The following example demonstrates how to get a vault lock policy.

### Example Request
<a name="api-GetVaultLock-example-request"></a>

In this example, a `GET` request is sent to the URI of a vault's `lock-policy` subresource.

```
1. GET /-/vaults/examplevault/lock-policy HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
3. x-amz-Date: 20170210T120000Z
4. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
5. Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20141123/us-west-2/glacier/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-amz-glacier-version,Signature=9257c16da6b25a715ce900a5b45b03da0447acf430195dcb540091b12966f2a2
```

### Example Response
<a name="api-GetVaultLock-example-response"></a>

If the request was successful, Amazon Glacier returns the vault access policy as a JSON string in the body of the response. The returned JSON string uses "\\" as an escape character, as shown in the [Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy)](api-InitiateVaultLock.md) example request. However, the following example shows the returned JSON string without escape characters for readability.
