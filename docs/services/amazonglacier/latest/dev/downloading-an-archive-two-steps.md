**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Retrieving Amazon Glacier Archives

Retrieving an archive from Amazon Glacier is an asynchronous operation in which you first initiate
a job, and then download the output after the job is completed. To initiate an archive
retrieval job, you use the [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html) REST API operation or the equivalent in the
AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs.

- [Ranged Archive Retrievals](#downloading-an-archive-range)

Retrieving an archive from Amazon Glacier is a two-step process. The following is an overview of this process.

###### To retrieve an archive

1. Initiate an archive retrieval job.

1. Get the ID of the archive that you want to retrieve. You can get the archive ID from an
       inventory of the vault. You can get the archive ID with the REST API,
       AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. For more information, see [Downloading a Vault Inventory in Amazon Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-inventory.html).

2. Initiate a job that requests Amazon Glacier to prepare an entire archive or a portion of the
       archive for subsequent download by using the [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html) operation.

When you initiate a job, Amazon Glacier returns a job ID in the response and runs the job
asynchronously. (You cannot download the job output until after the job is
completed, as described in Step 2.)

###### Important

For Standard retrievals only, a data retrieval policy can cause your `Initiate
							Job` request to fail with a `PolicyEnforcedException`
exception. For more information about data retrieval policies, see
[Amazon Glacier Data Retrieval Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/data-retrieval-policy.html). For more information about the
`PolicyEnforcedException` exception, see [Error Responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-error-responses.html).

When required, you can restore large segments of the data stored in Amazon Glacier. For more
information about restoring data from the Amazon Glacier storage classes, see [Storage Classes for\
Archiving Objects](../../../s3/latest/userguide/storage-class-intro.md#sc-glacier) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

2. After the job is completed, download the bytes by using the [Get Job Output (GET output)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-job-output-get.html) operation.

You can download all bytes or specify a byte range to download only a portion
    of the job output. For larger output, downloading the output in chunks helps in
    the event of a download failure, such as a network failure. If you get job
    output in a single request and there is a network failure, you have to restart
    downloading the output from the beginning. However, if you download the output
    in chunks, in the event of any failure, you need only restart the download of
    the smaller portion and not the entire output.

Amazon Glacier must complete a job before you can get its output. After completion, a job does not expire for at least 24 hours, which means that you can download the output within the 24-hour period after the job is completed. The restore can expire any time after 24 hours from the completion of the job. To determine if your job is complete,
check its status by using one of the following options:

- **Wait for a job-completion notification** – You can
specify an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which Amazon Glacier can post a notification
after the job is completed. Amazon Glacier sends a notification only after it
completes the job.

You can specify an Amazon SNS topic for a job when you initiate the job. In addition to
specifying an Amazon SNS topic in your job request, if your vault has notifications
set for archive retrieval events, then Amazon Glacier also publishes a notification
to that SNS topic. For more information, see [Configuring Vault Notifications in Amazon Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/configuring-notifications.html).

- **Request job information explicitly** – You can also
use the Amazon Glacier `Describe Job` API operation ( [Describe Job (GET JobID)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-describe-job-get.html)) to
periodically poll for job information. However, we recommend using Amazon SNS
notifications.

###### Note

The information that you get by using an Amazon SNS notification is the same as what you get by
calling the `Describe Job` API operation.

## Archive Retrieval Options

When initiating a job to retrieve an archive, you can specify one of the following
retrieval options, based on your access time and cost requirements. For information
about retrieval pricing, see [Amazon Glacier Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/glacier/pricing).

- **Expedited** – Expedited retrievals allow you to
quickly access your data that's stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
storage class or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier when
occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all
but the largest archives (more than 250 MB), data accessed by using
Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes.
Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited
retrievals is available when you need it. For more information, see [Provisioned Capacity](#api-downloading-an-archive-two-steps-retrieval-expedited-capacity).

- **Standard** – Standard retrievals
allow you to access any of your archives within several hours. Standard
retrievals are typically completed within 3–5 hours. Standard is the default option for
retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option.

- **Bulk** – Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost
Amazon Glacier retrieval option, which you can use to retrieve large amounts,
even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals are
typically completed within 5–12 hours.

The following table summarizes the archive retrieval options. For information about
pricing, see [Amazon Glacier pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/glacier/pricing).

To make an `Expedited`, `Standard`, or `Bulk`
retrieval, set the `Tier` request element in the [RestoreObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPOSTrestore.html)
REST API operation request to the option that you want, or the equivalent in the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS SDKs. If you purchased provisioned capacity, all Expedited
retrievals are automatically served through your provisioned capacity.

### Provisioned Capacity

Provisioned capacity helps ensure that your retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is
available when you need it. Each unit of capacity provides that at least three
Expedited retrievals can be performed every 5 minutes and provides up to 150
megabytes per second (MBps) of retrieval throughput.

If your workload requires highly reliable and predictable access to a subset of your data
in minutes, we recommend that you purchase provisioned retrieval capacity.
Without provisioned capacity, Expedited retrievals are typically accepted,
except for rare situations of unusually high demand. However, if you require
access to Expedited retrievals under all circumstances, you must purchase
provisioned retrieval capacity.

#### Purchasing Provisioned Capacity

You can purchase provisioned capacity units by using the Amazon Glacier console, the [Purchase Provisioned Capacity (POST provisioned-capacity)](api-purchaseprovisionedcapacity.md) REST API operation,
the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI. For provisioned capacity pricing information,
see [Amazon Glacier\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/glacier/pricing).

A provisioned capacity unit lasts for one month, starting at the date and time of
purchase.

If the start date is on the 31st day of a month, the expiration date is
the last day of the next month. For example, if the start date is August 31,
the expiration date is September 30. If the start date is January 31, the
expiration date is February 28.

###### To purchase provisioned capacity by using the Amazon Glacier console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Glacier console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/glacier/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glacier/home).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Data retrieval settings**.

3. Under **Provisioned capacity units (PCUs)**, choose **Purchase**
**PCU**. The **Purchase PCU** dialog box
    appears.

4. If you want to purchase provisioned capacity, enter `confirm` in
    the **To confirm purchase** box.

5. Choose **Purchase PCU**.

## Ranged Archive Retrievals

When you retrieve an archive from Amazon Glacier, you can optionally specify a range,
or portion, of the archive to retrieve. The default is to retrieve the whole
archive. Specifying a range of bytes can be helpful when you want to do the
following:

- Manage your data downloads – Amazon Glacier allows
retrieved data to be downloaded for 24 hours after the retrieval request is
completed. Therefore, you might want to retrieve only portions of the
archive so that you can manage the schedule of downloads within the given
download window.

- Retrieve a targeted part of a large archive – For
example, suppose you have previously aggregated many files and uploaded them
as a single archive, and now you want to retrieve a few of the files. In
this case, you can specify a range of the archive that contains the files
that you are interested in by using one retrieval request. Or, you can
initiate multiple retrieval requests, each with a range for one or more
files.

When initiating a retrieval job using range retrievals, you must provide a range that is
megabyte aligned. In other words, the byte range can start at zero (the beginning of
your archive), or at any 1-MB interval thereafter (1 MB, 2 MB, 3 MB, and so on).

The end of the range can either be the end of your archive or any 1 MB interval greater
than the beginning of your range. Furthermore, if you want to get checksum values
when you download the data (after the retrieval job is completed), the range that
you request in the job initiation must also be tree-hash aligned. You can use
checksums to help ensure that your data was not corrupted during transmission. For
more information about megabyte alignment and tree-hash alignment, see [Receiving Checksums When Downloading Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations-range.html).
