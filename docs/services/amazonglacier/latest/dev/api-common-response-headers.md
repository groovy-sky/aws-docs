**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Common Response Headers

The following table describes response headers that are common to most API responses.

Name  Description `Content-Length`

The length in bytes of the response body.

Type: String

`Date`

The date and time Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) responded, for example,
`Wed, 10 Feb 2017 12:00:00 GMT`. The format of the date must be one of
the full date formats specified by [RFC\
2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616), section 3.3. Note that `Date` returned may
drift slightly from other dates, so for example, the date returned from
an [Upload Archive (POST archive)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html)
request may not match the date shown for the archive in an inventory
list for the vault.

Type: String

`x-amzn-RequestId`

A value created by Amazon Glacier that uniquely identifies your request. In
the event that you have a problem with Amazon Glacier, AWS can use this
value to troubleshoot the problem. It is recommended that you log these
values.

Type: String

`x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` ​

The SHA256 tree-hash checksum of the archive or inventory body. For
more information about calculating this checksum, see [Computing Checksums](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).
