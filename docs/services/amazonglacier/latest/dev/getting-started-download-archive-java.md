**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Download an Archive from a Vault in Amazon Glacier by Using the AWS SDK for Java

The following Java code example uses the high-level API of the AWS SDK for Java to download the
archive that you uploaded in the previous step. In the code example, note the
following:

- The example creates an instance of the `AmazonGlacierClient` class.

- The code uses the US West (Oregon) Region ( `us-west-2`) to match the location
where you created the vault in [Step 2: Create a Vault in Amazon Glacier](getting-started-create-vault.md).

- The example uses the `download` API operation of the
`ArchiveTransferManager` class from the high-level API of the
AWS SDK for Java. The example creates an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, and an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
queue that is subscribed to that topic. If you created an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) admin
user as instructed in [Step 1: Before You Begin with Amazon Glacier](getting-started-before-you-begin.md), your user has the necessary
IAM permissions for the creation and use of the Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS
queue.

For step-by-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Java Examples for Amazon Glacier Using Eclipse](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-java.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java). You must update the code as shown with the archive ID of
the file that you uploaded in [Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon Glacier](getting-started-upload-archive.md).

        snsClient = new AmazonSNSClient(credentials);

        glacierClient.setEndpoint("glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com");

        snsClient.setEndpoint("sns.us-west-2.amazonaws.com");

        try {
            ArchiveTransferManager atm = new ArchiveTransferManager(glacierClient, sqsClient, snsClient);

            atm.download(vaultName, archiveId, new File(downloadFilePath));

        } catch (Exception e)
        {
            System.err.println(e);
        }
    }
}
