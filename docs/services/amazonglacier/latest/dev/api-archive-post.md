title: "Upload Archive (POST archive)"
---

**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/).

# Upload Archive (POST archive)
<a name="api-archive-post"></a>

## Description
<a name="api-archive-post-description"></a>

This operation adds an archive to a vault. For a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. In response, Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) returns the archive ID in the `x-amz-archive-id` header of the response. You should save the archive ID returned so that you can access the archive later.

You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](checksum-calculations.md).

**Note**
The SHA256 tree hash is only required for the Upload Archive (POST archive) action when using the API. It is not required when using the AWS CLI.

When uploading an archive, you can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. Amazon Glacier returns the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list.

Except for the optional archive description, Amazon Glacier does not support any additional metadata for the archives. The archive ID is an opaque sequence of characters from which you cannot infer any meaning about the archive. So you might maintain metadata about the archives on the client-side. For more information, see [Working with Archives in Amazon Glacier](working-with-archives.md).

Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.

## Requests
<a name="api-archive-post-requests"></a>

To upload an archive, you use the HTTP `POST` method and scope the request to the `archives` subresource of the vault in which you want to save the archive. The request must include the archive payload size, checksum (SHA256 tree hash), and can optionally include a description of the archive.

### Syntax
<a name="api-archive-post-requests-syntax"></a>

```
 1. POST /{{AccountId}}/vaults/{{VaultName}}/archives
 2. Host: glacier.{{Region}}.amazonaws.com
 3. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
 4. Date: {{Date}}
 5. Authorization: {{SignatureValue}}
 6. x-amz-archive-description: {{Description}}
 7. x-amz-sha256-tree-hash: {{SHA256 tree hash}}
 8. x-amz-content-sha256: {{SHA256 linear hash}}
 9. Content-Length: {{Length}}
10.
11. <Request body.>
```

**Note**
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

### Request Parameters
<a name="api-archive-post-requests-parameters"></a>

This implementation of the operation does not use request parameters.

### Request Headers
<a name="api-archive-post-requests-headers"></a>

This operation uses the following request headers, in addition to the request headers that are common to all operations. For more information about the common request headers, see [Common Request Headers](api-common-request-headers.md).

|  Name  |  Description  |  Required  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content-Length  | The size of the object, in bytes. For more information, go to [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html\#sec14.13](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13). <br />Type: Number<br />Default: None<br />Constraints: None |  Yes  |
| x-amz-archive-description  | The optional description of the archive you are uploading. It can be a plain language description or some identifier you choose to assign. The description need not be unique across archives. When you retrieve a vault inventory (see [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](api-initiate-job-post.md)), it includes this description for each of the archives it returns in response.<br />Type: String<br />Default: None<br />Constraints: The description must be less than or equal to 1,024 characters. The allowable characters are 7-bit ASCII without control codes, specifically ASCII values 32—126 decimal or 0x20—0x7E hexadecimal. |  No  |
| x-amz-content-sha256  | The SHA256 checksum (a linear hash) of the payload. This is not the same value as you specify in the `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` header.<br />Type: String<br />Default: None<br />Constraints: None |  Yes  |
|  x-amz-sha256-tree-hash  | The user-computed checksum, SHA256 tree hash, of the payload. For information on computing the SHA256 tree hash, see [Computing Checksums](checksum-calculations.md). If Amazon Glacier computes a different checksum of the payload, it will reject the request.<br />Type: String<br />Default: None<br />Constraints: None |  Yes |
