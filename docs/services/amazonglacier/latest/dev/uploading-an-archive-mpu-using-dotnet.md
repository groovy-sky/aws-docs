**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Uploading Large Archives Using the AWS SDK for .NET

Both the [high-level and low-level APIs](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk.md) provided by the Amazon SDK for .NET provide a method to upload large archives in parts (see [Uploading an Archive in Amazon Glacier](uploading-an-archive.md)).

- The high-level API provides a method that you can use to upload archives of
any size. Depending on the file you are uploading, the method either uploads
archive in a single operation or uses the multipart upload support in Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) to upload the archive in parts.

- The low-level API maps close to the underlying REST implementation.
Accordingly, it provides a method to upload smaller archives in one operation
and a group of methods that support multipart upload for larger archives. This
section explains uploading large archives in parts using the low-level
API.

For more information about the high-level and low-level APIs, see [Using the AWS SDK for .NET with Amazon Glacier](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md).

## Uploading Large Archives in Parts Using the High-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

You use the same methods of the high-level API to upload small or large archives. Based on
the archive size, the high-level API methods decide whether to upload the archive in a
single operation or use the multipart upload API provided by Amazon Glacier. For more
information, see [Uploading an Archive Using the High-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET](uploading-an-archive-single-op-using-dotnet.md#uploading-an-archive-single-op-highlevel-using-dotnet).

## Uploading Large Archives in Parts Using the Low-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

For granular control of the upload, you can use the low-level API, where you can configure the
request and process the response. The following are the steps to upload large archives
in parts using the AWS SDK for .NET.

1. Create an instance of the `AmazonGlacierClient` class (the client).

You need to specify an AWS Region where you want to save the archive. All operations
    you perform using this client apply to that AWS Region.

2. Initiate multipart upload by calling the `InitiateMultipartUpload`
    method.

You need to provide the vault name to which you want to upload the archive,
    the part size you want to use to upload archive parts, and an optional description.
    You provide this information by creating an instance of the
    `InitiateMultipartUploadRequest` class. In response, Amazon Glacier returns an upload ID.

3. Upload parts by calling the `UploadMultipartPart` method.

For each part you upload, You need to provide the vault name, the byte range in
    the final assembled archive that will be uploaded in this part, the checksum of the
    part data, and the upload ID.

4. Complete the multipart upload by calling the `CompleteMultipartUpload`
    method.

You need to provide the upload ID, the checksum of the entire archive,
    the archive size (combined size of all parts you uploaded), and the vault name.
    Amazon Glacier constructs the archive from the uploaded parts and returns an
    archive ID.

### Example: Uploading a Large Archive in Parts Using the Amazon SDK for .NET

The following C# code example uses the AWS SDK for .NET to upload an archive to a vault
( `examplevault`). For step-by-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Code Examples](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-dotnet). You need to
update the code as shown with the name of a file you want to upload.
