**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId)

## Description

This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from
the `InProgress` state to the `Locked` state, which causes the vault
lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the `InProgress`
state by calling [Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy)](api-initiatevaultlock.md). You can obtain the state of the vault lock by
calling [Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy)](api-getvaultlock.md). For more
information about the vault locking process, see [Amazon Glacier Vault Lock](vault-lock.md).

This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in
the `Locked` state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used
to lock the vault.

If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the
`Locked` state, the operation returns an `AccessDeniedException`
error. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the
`InProgress` state, the operation throws an `InvalidParameter`
error.

## Requests

To complete the vault locking process, send an HTTP `POST` request to the URI
of the vault's `lock-policy` subresource with a valid lock ID.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

POST /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/lock-policy/lockId HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
Content-Length: Length
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01

```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

The `lockId` value is the lock ID obtained from a [Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy)](api-initiatevaultlock.md)
request.
