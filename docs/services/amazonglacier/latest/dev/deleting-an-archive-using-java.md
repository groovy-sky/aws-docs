**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Deleting an Archive in Amazon Glacier Using the AWS SDK for Java

The following are the steps to delete an archive using the AWS SDK for Java low-level
API.

1. Create an instance of the `AmazonGlacierClient` class (the client).

You need to specify an AWS Region where the archive you want to delete is
    stored. All operations you perform using this client apply to that AWS Region.

2. Provide request information by creating an instance of the
    `DeleteArchiveRequest` class.

You need to provide an archive ID, a vault name, and your account ID. If you
    don't provide an account ID, then account ID associated with the credentials you
    provide to sign the request is assumed. For more information, see [Using the AWS SDK for Java with Amazon Glacier](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-java.md).

3. Run the `deleteArchive` method by providing the request object as a
    parameter.

The following Java code snippet illustrates the preceding steps.

```

AmazonGlacierClient client;

DeleteArchiveRequest request = new DeleteArchiveRequest()
    .withVaultName("*** provide a vault name ***")
    .withArchiveId("*** provide an archive ID ***");

client.deleteArchive(request);
```

###### Note

For information about the underlying REST API, see [Delete Archive (DELETE archive)](api-archive-delete.md).

## Example: Deleting an Archive Using the AWS SDK for Java

The following Java code example uses the AWS SDK for Java to delete an archive.
For step-by-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Java Examples for Amazon Glacier Using Eclipse](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-java.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java). You need to update the code as shown with a vault
name and the archive ID of the archive you want to delete.

###### Example

```

import java.io.IOException;

import com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider;
import com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacierClient;
import com.amazonaws.services.glacier.model.DeleteArchiveRequest;

public class ArchiveDelete {

    public static String vaultName = "*** provide vault name ****";
    public static String archiveId = "*** provide archive ID***";
    public static AmazonGlacierClient client;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

    	ProfileCredentialsProvider credentials = new ProfileCredentialsProvider();

        client = new AmazonGlacierClient(credentials);
        client.setEndpoint("https://glacier.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/");

        try {

            // Delete the archive.
            client.deleteArchive(new DeleteArchiveRequest()
                .withVaultName(vaultName)
                .withArchiveId(archiveId));

            System.out.println("Deleted archive successfully.");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Archive not deleted.");
            System.err.println(e);
        }
    }
}

```
