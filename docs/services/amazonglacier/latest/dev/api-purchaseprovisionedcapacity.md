**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Purchase Provisioned Capacity (POST provisioned-capacity)

This operation purchases a provisioned capacity unit for an AWS account.

A provisioned capacity unit lasts for one month starting at the date and time of purchase,
which is the start date. The unit expires on the expiration date, which is exactly one month
after the start date to the nearest second.

If the start date is on the 31st day of a month, the expiration date is the last day of the
next month. For example, if the start date is August 31, the expiration date is September 30.
If the start date is January 31, the expiration date is February 28.

Provisioned capacity helps ensure that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals is
available when you need it. Each unit of capacity ensures that at least three expedited
retrievals can be performed every five minutes and provides up to 150 MB/s of retrieval
throughput. For more information about provisioned capacity, see [Archive Retrieval Options](downloading-an-archive-two-steps.md#api-downloading-an-archive-two-steps-retrieval-options).

###### Note

There is a limit of two provisioned capacity units per AWS account.

## Requests

To purchase provisioned capacity unit for an AWS account send an HTTP `POST`
request to the provisioned-capacity URI.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

POST /AccountId/provisioned-capacity HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
Content-Length: Length
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01

```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
