**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon Glacier by Using the AWS SDK for .NET

The following C# code example uses the high-level API of the AWS SDK for .NET to upload a sample
archive to the vault. In the code example, note the following:

- The example creates an instance of the `ArchiveTransferManager`
class for the specified Amazon Glacier Region endpoint.

- The code example uses the US West (Oregon) Region ( `us-west-2`).

- The example uses the `Upload` API operation of the
`ArchiveTransferManager` class to upload your archive. For small
archives, this operation uploads the archive directly to Amazon Glacier. For larger
archives, this operation uses the multipart upload API operation in Amazon Glacier to
split the upload into multiple parts for better error recovery, if any errors are
encountered while streaming the data to Amazon Glacier.

For step-by-step instructions on how to run the following example, see [Running Code Examples](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-dot-net.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-dotnet). You must
update the code as shown with the name of your vault and the name of the archive file to
upload.

###### Note

Amazon Glacier keeps an inventory of all the archives in your vaults. When you upload the
archive in the following example, the archive will not appear in a vault in the
management console until the vault inventory has been updated. This update usually
happens once a day.

###### Example— Uploading an Archive by Using the High-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET

```

using System;
using Amazon.Glacier;
using Amazon.Glacier.Transfer;
using Amazon.Runtime;

namespace glacier.amazon.com.docsamples
{
    class ArchiveUploadHighLevel_GettingStarted
    {
        static string vaultName = "examplevault";
        static string archiveToUpload = "*** Provide file name (with full path) to upload ***";

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                var manager = new ArchiveTransferManager(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USWest2);
                // Upload an archive.
                string archiveId = manager.Upload(vaultName, "getting started archive test", archiveToUpload).ArchiveId;
                Console.WriteLine("Copy and save the following Archive ID for the next step.");
                Console.WriteLine("Archive ID: {0}", archiveId);
                Console.WriteLine("To continue, press Enter");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
            catch (AmazonGlacierException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
            catch (AmazonServiceException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
            catch (Exception e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); }
            Console.WriteLine("To continue, press Enter");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
