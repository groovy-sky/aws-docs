**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Delete an Archive from a Vault in Amazon Glacier by Using the AWS SDK for Java

The following code example uses the AWS SDK for Java to delete the archive. In the code, note
the following:

- The `DeleteArchiveRequest` object describes the delete request, including the
vault name where the archive is located and the archive ID.

- The `deleteArchive` API operation sends the request to Amazon Glacier to delete the
archive.

- The example uses the US West (Oregon) Region ( `us-west-2`).

For step-by-step instructions on how to run this example, see [Running Java Examples for Amazon Glacier Using Eclipse](../../../../reference/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-aws-sdk-for-java.md#setting-up-and-testing-sdk-java). You must update the code as shown with the archive ID of
the file that you uploaded in [Step 3: Upload an Archive to a Vault in Amazon Glacier](getting-started-upload-archive.md).

###### Example— Deleting an Archive by Using the AWS SDK for Java

```

import java.io.IOException;

import com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider;
import com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacierClient;
import com.amazonaws.services.glacier.model.DeleteArchiveRequest;

public class AmazonGlacierDeleteArchive_GettingStarted {

    public static String vaultName = "examplevault";
    public static String archiveId = "*** provide archive ID***";
    public static AmazonGlacierClient client;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

    	ProfileCredentialsProvider credentials = new ProfileCredentialsProvider();

        client = new AmazonGlacierClient(credentials);
        client.setEndpoint("https://glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/");

        try {

            // Delete the archive.
            client.deleteArchive(new DeleteArchiveRequest()
                .withVaultName(vaultName)
                .withArchiveId(archiveId));

            System.out.println("Deleted archive successfully.");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Archive not deleted.");
            System.err.println(e);
        }
    }
}

```
