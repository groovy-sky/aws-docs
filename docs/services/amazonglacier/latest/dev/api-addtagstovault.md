**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Add Tags To Vault (POST tags add)

This operation adds the specified tags to a vault. Each tag is composed of a key and a
value. Each vault can have up to 50 tags. If your request would cause the tag limit for the
vault to be exceeded, the operation throws the `LimitExceededException`
error.

If a tag already exists on the vault under a specified key, the existing key value will be
overwritten. For more information about tags, see [Tagging Amazon Glacier Resources](tagging.md).

## Request Syntax

To add tags to a vault, send an HTTP POST request to the tags URI as shown in the
following syntax example.

```nohighlight

POST /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/tags?operation=add HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
Content-Length: Length
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01

{
   "Tags":
      {
         "string": "string",
         "string": "string"
      }
}
```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
If you specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.
