**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# List Parts (GET uploadID)

## Description

This multipart upload operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in a
specific multipart upload identified by an upload ID. For information about multipart
upload, see [Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload)](uploading-archive-mpu.md).

You can make this request at any time during an in-progress multipart upload before
you complete the multipart upload.
Amazon Glacier returns the part list sorted by range you specified in each part upload. If you
send a List Parts request after completing the multipart upload, Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) returns
an error.

The List Parts operation supports pagination. You should always check the
`Marker` field in the response body for a marker at which to continue the
list. if there are no more items the `marker` field is `null`. If
the `marker` is not null, to fetch the next set of parts you sent another
List Parts request with the `marker` request parameter set to the marker
value Amazon Glacier returned in response to your previous List Parts request.

You can also limit the number of parts returned in the response by specifying the
`limit` parameter in the request.

## Requests

### Syntax

To list the parts of an in-progress multipart upload, you send a `GET` request
to the URI of the multipart upload ID resource. The multipart upload ID is returned
when you initiate a multipart upload ( [Initiate Multipart Upload (POST multipart-uploads)](api-multipart-initiate-upload.md)). You may optionally specify
`marker` and `limit` parameters.

```nohighlight

GET /AccountId/vaults/VaultName/multipart-uploads/uploadID HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

### Request Parameters

Name  Description  Required `limit`

The maximum number of parts to be returned. The default limit is 50. The number of
parts returned might be fewer than the specified limit, but the
number of returned parts never exceeds the limit.

Type: String

Constraints: Minimum integer value of `1`. Maximum integer value of
`50`.

No `marker`

An opaque string used for pagination. `marker` specifies the part at which
the listing of parts should begin. Get the `marker`
value from the response of a previous List Parts response. You
need only include the `marker` if you are continuing
the pagination of results started in a previous List Parts
request.

Type: String

Constraints: None

No

### Response Headers

This operation uses only response headers that are common to most responses. For information about common response headers, see
[Common Response Headers](api-common-response-headers.md).

### Response Body

The response body contains the following JSON fields.

**ArchiveDescription**

The description of the archive that was specified in the Initiate Multipart Upload
request. This field is `null` if no archive description was
specified in the Initiate Multipart Upload operation.

_Type_: String

**CreationDate**

The UTC time that the multipart upload was initiated.

_Type_: String. A string representation in the ISO 8601 date format, for example `2013-03-20T17:03:43.221Z`.

**Marker**

An opaque string that represents where to continue pagination of the results. You use
the `marker` in a new List Parts request to obtain more jobs
in the list. If there are no more parts, this value is
`null`.

_Type_: String

**MultipartUploadId**

The ID of the upload to which the parts are associated.

_Type_: String

**PartSizeInBytes**

The part size in bytes. This is the same value that you specified in
the Initiate Multipart Upload request.

_Type_: Number

**Parts**

A list of the part sizes of the multipart upload. Each object in the array contains a
`RangeBytes` and `sha256-tree-hash` name/value
pair.

_Type_: Array

**RangeInBytes**

The byte range of a part, inclusive of the upper value of the range.

_Type_: String

**SHA256TreeHash**

The SHA256 tree hash value that Amazon Glacier calculated for the part. This field is never
`null`.

_Type_: String

**VaultARN**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault to which the multipart
upload was initiated.

_Type_: String

### Errors

exceptions and error messages, see [Error Responses](api-error-responses.md).

## Examples

### Example: List Parts of a Multipart Upload

The following example lists all the parts of an upload. The example sends an HTTP
`GET` request to the URI of the specific multipart upload ID of an
in-progress multipart upload and returns up to 1,000 parts.

#### Example Request

```

#### Example Response

In the response, Amazon Glacier returns a list of uploaded parts associated with the specified
multipart upload ID. In this example, there are only two parts. The returned
`Marker` field is `null` indicating that there are no
more parts of the multipart upload.

### Example: List Parts of a Multipart Upload (Specify the Marker and the Limit Request Parameters)

The following example demonstrates how to use pagination to get a limited number of
results. The example sends an HTTP `GET` request to the URI of the
specific multipart upload ID of an in-progress multipart upload to return one part.
A starting `marker` parameter specifies at which part to start the part
list. You can get the `marker` value from the response of a previous
request for a part list. Furthermore, in this example, the `limit`
parameter is set to 1 and returns one part. Note that the `Marker` field
is not `null`, indicating that there is at least one more part to obtain.
