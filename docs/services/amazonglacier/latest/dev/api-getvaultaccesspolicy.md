title: "Get Vault Access Policy (GET access-policy)"
---

**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/).

# Get Vault Access Policy (GET access-policy)
<a name="api-GetVaultAccessPolicy"></a>

## Description
<a name="api-GetVaultAccessPolicy-description"></a>

This operation retrieves the `access-policy` subresource set on the vault—for more information on setting this subresource, see [Set Vault Access Policy (PUT access-policy)](api-SetVaultAccessPolicy.md). If there is no access policy set on the vault, the operation returns a `404 Not found` error. For more information about vault access policies, see [Vault Access Policies](vault-access-policy.md).

## Requests
<a name="api-GetVaultAccessPolicy-requests"></a>

To return the current vault access policy, send an HTTP `GET` request to the URI of the vault's `access-policy` subresource.

### Syntax
<a name="api-GetVaultAccessPolicy-requests-syntax"></a>

```
1. GET /{{AccountId}}/vaults/{{vaultName}}/access-policy HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.{{Region}}.amazonaws.com
3. Date: {{Date}}
4. Authorization: {{SignatureValue}}
5. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

**Note**
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

### Example Request
<a name="api-GetVaultAccessPolicy-example-request"></a>

In this example, a `GET` request is sent to the URI of a vault's `access-policy` subresource.

```
1. GET /-/vaults/examplevault/access-policy HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
3. x-amz-Date: 20170210T120000Z
4. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
5. Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20141123/us-west-2/glacier/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-amz-glacier-version,Signature=9257c16da6b25a715ce900a5b45b03da0447acf430195dcb540091b12966f2a2
