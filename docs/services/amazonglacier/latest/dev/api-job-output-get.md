title: "Get Job Output (GET output)"
---

**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3/).

# Get Job Output (GET output)
<a name="api-job-output-get"></a>

## Description
<a name="api-job-output-get-description"></a>

This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using [Initiate Job (POST jobs)](api-initiate-job-post.md). Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory.

You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output by specifying a byte range. For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in the headers from the **Get Job Output** response.

For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a range of `bytes=0-1048575`, you should verify your download size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier). The expected size is also returned in the headers from the **Get Job Output** response.

In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. To ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the checksum on the client, verify that the values match, and verify that the size is what you expected.

A job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Amazon Glacier completes the job. That is, you can download the job output within the 24-hour period after Amazon Glacier completes the job.

## Requests
<a name="api-job-output-get-requests"></a>

### Syntax
<a name="api-job-output-get-requests-syntax"></a>

To retrieve a job output, you send the HTTP `GET` request to the URI of the `output` of the specific job.

```
1. GET /{{AccountId}}/vaults/{{VaultName}}/jobs/{{JobID}}/output HTTP/1.1
2. Host: glacier.{{Region}}.amazonaws.com
3. Date: {{Date}}
4. Authorization: {{SignatureValue}}
5. Range: {{ByteRangeToRetrieve}}
6. x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

**Note**
The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single '`-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

### Request Parameters
<a name="api-job-output-get-requests-parameters"></a>

This operation does not use request parameters.

### Request Headers
<a name="api-job-output-get-requests-headers"></a>

This operation uses the following request headers, in addition to the request headers that are common to all operations. For more information about the common request headers, see [Common Request Headers](api-common-request-headers.md).

|  Name  |  Description  |  Required  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Range  | The range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you want to download the first 1,048,576 bytes, specify the range as `bytes=0-1048575`. For more information, go to [Range Header Field Definition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35). The range is relative to any range specified in the Initiate Job request. By default, this operation downloads the entire output. <br />If the job output is large, then you can use the `Range` request header to retrieve a portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB job output you want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of data at a time, a total of eight Get Job Output requests. You will use the following process to download the job output:1. Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate byte range using the `Range` header. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.<br />2. Along with the data, the response will include a checksum of the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client and compare it with the checksum you received in the response to ensure you received all the expected data.<br />3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range.<br />4. After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to find the checksum of the entire output. Using the [Describe Job (GET JobID)](api-describe-job-get.md) operation, obtain job information of the job that provided you the output. The response includes the checksum of the entire archive stored in Amazon Glacier. You compare this value with the checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire archive content with no errors.<br />Type: String<br />Default: None<br />Constraints: None |  No  |

### Request Body
<a name="api-job-output-get-requests-elements"></a>

This operation does not have a request body.

## Responses
<a name="api-job-output-get-responses"></a>

### Syntax
<a name="api-job-output-get-response-syntax"></a>

For a retrieval request that returns all of the job data, the job output response returns a `200 OK` response code. When partial content is requested, for example, if you specified the `Range` header in the request, then the response code `206 Partial Content` is returned.

```
1. HTTP/1.1 200 OK
2. x-amzn-RequestId: x-amzn-RequestId
3. Date: Date
4. Content-Type: ContentType
5. Content-Length: Length
6. x-amz-sha256-tree-hash: ChecksumComputedByAmazonGlacier
7.
8. [Body containing job output.]
```

### Response Headers
<a name="api-job-output-get-responses-headers"></a>

|  Header  |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Range  | The range of bytes returned by Amazon Glacier. If only partial output is downloaded, the response provides the range of bytes Amazon Glacier returned. <br />For example, `bytes 0-1048575/8388608` returns the first 1 MB from 8 MB.<br />For more information about the `Content-Range` header, go to [Content-Range Header Field Definition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16).<br />Type: String |
| Content-Type  | The Content-Type depends on whether the job output is an archive or a vault inventory. <br /> +  For archive data, the Content-Type is `application/octet-stream`.  <br />+  For vault inventory, if you requested CSV format when you initiated the job, the Content-Type is `text/csv`. Otherwise, by default, vault inventory is returned as JSON, and the Content-Type is `application/json`. <br />Type: String |
| x-amz-sha256-tree-hash​ | The checksum of the data in the response. This header is returned only when retrieving the output for an archive retrieval job. Furthermore, this header appears when the retrieved data range requested in the Initiate Job request is tree hash aligned and the range to download in the Get Job Output is also tree hash aligned. For more information about tree hash aligned ranges, see [Receiving Checksums When Downloading Data](checksum-calculations-range.md). <br />For example, if in your Initiate Job request you specified a tree hash aligned range to retrieve (which includes the whole archive), then you will receive the checksum of the data you download under the following conditions:<br /> +  You get the entire range of the retrieved data. <br />+  You request a byte range of the retrieved data that has a size of a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2 and that starts and ends on a multiple of the size of the requested range. For example, if you have 3.1 MB of retrieved data and you specify a range to return that starts at 1 MB and ends at 2 MB, then the `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` is returned as a response header.  <br />+  You request a range to return of the retrieved data that goes to the end of the data, and the start of the range is a multiple of the size of the range to retrieve rounded up to the next power of two but not smaller than one megabyte (1024 KB). For example, if you have 3.1 MB of retrieved data and you specify a range that starts at 2 MB and ends at 3.1 MB (the end of the data), then the `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` is returned as a response header. <br />Type: String |

### Response Body
<a name="api-job-output-get-responses-elements"></a>

Amazon Glacier returns the job output in the response body. Depending on the job type, the output can be the archive contents or the vault inventory. In case of a vault inventory, by default the inventory list is returned as the following JSON body.

```
 1. {
 2.  "VaultARN": String,
 3.  "InventoryDate": String,
 4.  "ArchiveList": [
 5.       {"ArchiveId": String,
 6.        "ArchiveDescription": String,
 7.        "CreationDate": String,
 8.        "Size": Number,
 9.        "SHA256TreeHash": String
10.       },
11.       ...
12.     ]
13. }
```

If you requested the comma-separated values (CSV) output format when you initiated the vault inventory job, then the vault inventory is returned in CSV format in the body. The CSV format has five columns "ArchiveId", "ArchiveDescription", "CreationDate", "Size", and "SHA256TreeHash" with the same definitions as the corresponding JSON fields.

**Note**
In the returned CSV format, fields may be returned with the whole field enclosed in double-quotes. Fields that contain a comma or double-quotes are always returned enclosed in double-quotes. For example, `my archive description,1` is returned as `"my archive description,1"`. Double-quote characters that are within returned double-quote enclosed fields are *escaped* by preceding them with a backslash character. For example, `my archive description,1"2` is returned as `"my archive description,1\"2"` and `my archive description,1\"2` is returned as `"my archive description,1\\"2"`. The backslash character is not escaped.

The JSON response body contains the following JSON fields.

**ArchiveDescription**
The description of an archive.
*Type*: String

**ArchiveId**
The ID of an archive.
*Type*: String

**ArchiveList**
An array of archive metadata. Each object in the array represents metadata for one archive contained in the vault.
*Type*: Array

**CreationDate**
The UTC date and time the archive was created.
*Type*: A string representation in the ISO 8601 date format, for example `2013-03-20T17:03:43.221Z`.

**InventoryDate**
The UTC date and time of the last inventory for the vault that was completed after changes to the vault. Even though Amazon Glacier prepares a vault inventory once a day, the inventory date is only updated if there have been archive additions or deletions to the vault since the last inventory.
*Type*: A string representation in the ISO 8601 date format, for example `2013-03-20T17:03:43.221Z`.

**SHA256TreeHash**
The tree hash of the archive.
*Type*: String

**Size**
The size in bytes of the archive.
*Type*: Number

**VaultARN**
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) resource from which the archive retrieval was requested.
*Type*: String
