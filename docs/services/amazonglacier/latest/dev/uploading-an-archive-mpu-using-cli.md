**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Uploading Large Archives by Using the AWS CLI

You can upload an archive in Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). To
improve the upload experience for larger archives, Amazon Glacier provides several API operations
to support multipart uploads. By using these API operations, you can upload archives in
parts. These parts can be uploaded independently, in any order, and in parallel. If a part
upload fails, you need to upload only that part again, not the entire archive. You can use
multipart uploads for archives from 1 byte to about 40,000 gibibytes (GiB) in size.

For more information about Amazon Glacier multipart uploads, see [Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload)](uploading-archive-mpu.md).

- [Example: Uploading Large Archives in Parts by Using the AWS CLI](#Uploading-Archives-mpu-CLI-Implementation)

## (Prerequisite) Setting Up the AWS CLI

1. Download and configure the AWS CLI. For instructions, see the following topics in the
    _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_:

[Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/installing.md)

[Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.md)

2. Verify your AWS CLI setup by entering the following commands at the command prompt. These
    commands don't provide credentials explicitly, so the credentials of the default
    profile are used.

- Try using the help command.

```

aws help
```

- To get a list of Amazon Glacier vaults on the configured account, use the `list-vaults` command. Replace `123456789012` with your AWS account ID.

```cmd

aws glacier list-vaults --account-id 123456789012
```

- To see the current configuration data for the AWS CLI, use the `aws
  							configure list` command.

```

aws configure list
```

## (Prerequisite) Install Python

To complete a multipart upload, you must calculate the SHA256 tree hash of the archive
that you're uploading. Doing so is different than calculating the SHA256 tree hash of
the file that you want to upload. To calculate the SHA256 tree hash of the archive that
you're uploading, you can use Java, C# (with .NET), or
Python. In this example, you will use Python. For
instructions on using Java or C#, see [Computing Checksums](checksum-calculations.md).

For more information about installing Python, see [Install or update Python](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html) in the _Boto3 Developer_
_Guide_.

## (Prerequisite) Create an Amazon Glacier Vault

To use the following example, you must have at least one Amazon Glacier vault created. For more
information about creating vaults, see [Creating a Vault in Amazon Glacier](creating-vaults.md).

## Example: Uploading Large Archives in Parts by Using the AWS CLI

In this example, you will create a file and use multipart upload API operations to
upload this file, in parts, to Amazon Glacier.

###### Important

Before starting this procedure, make sure that you've performed all of the
prerequisite steps. To upload an archive, you must have a vault created, the
AWS CLI configured, and be prepared to use Java, C#, or
Python to calculate a SHA256 tree hash.

The following procedure uses the `initiate-multipart-upload`,
`upload-multipart-part`, and `complete-multipart-upload`
AWS CLI commands.

For more detailed information about each of these commands, see [initiate-multipart-upload](../../../cli/latest/reference/glacier/initiate-multipart-upload.md), [upload-multipart-part](../../../cli/latest/reference/glacier/upload-multipart-part.md), and [complete-multipart-upload](../../../cli/latest/reference/glacier/complete-multipart-upload.md) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

1. Use the [initiate-multipart-upload](../../../cli/latest/reference/glacier/initiate-multipart-upload.md) command to create a
    multipart upload resource. In your request, specify the part size in number of
    bytes. Each part that you upload, except the last part, will be this size. You
    don't need to know the overall archive size when initiating an upload. However,
    you will need the total size, in bytes, of each part when completing the upload
    on the final step.

In the following command, replace the values for the `--vault-name`
    and `--account-ID` parameters with your own information. This command
    specifies that you will upload an archive with a part size of 1 mebibyte (MiB)
    (1024 x 1024 bytes) per file. Replace this `--part-size` parameter
    value if needed.

```nohighlight

aws glacier initiate-multipart-upload --vault-name awsexamplevault --part-size 1048576 --account-id 123456789012
```

Expected output:

```nohighlight

{
"location": "/123456789012/vaults/awsexamplevault/multipart-uploads/uploadId",
"uploadId": "uploadId"
}
```

When finished, the command will output the multipart upload resource's upload
    ID and location in Amazon Glacier. You will use this upload ID in subsequent
    steps.

2. For this example, you can use the following commands to create a 4.4 MiB file,
    split it into 1 MiB chunks, and upload each chunk. To upload your own files, you
    can follow a similar procedure of splitting your data into chunks and uploading
    each part.

###### Linux or macOS

The following command creates a 4.4 MiB file, named
    `file_to_upload`, on Linux or macOS.

```nohighlight

mkfile -n 9000b file_to_upload
```

###### Windows

The following command creates a 4.4 MiB file, named
    `file_to_upload`, on Windows.

```nohighlight

fsutil file createnew file_to_upload 4608000
```

3. Next, you will split this file into 1 MiB chunks.

```nohighlight

split -b 1048576 file_to_upload chunk
```

You now have the following five chunks. The first four are 1 MiB, and the last
    is approximately 400 kibibytes (KiB).

```

chunkaa
chunkab
chunkac
chunkad
chunkae
```

4. Use the [upload-multipart-part](../../../cli/latest/reference/glacier/upload-multipart-part.md) command to upload a part
    of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload
    them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart
    upload.

In the following command, replace the values for the
    `--vault-name`, `--account-ID`, and
    `--upload-id` parameters. The upload ID must match the ID given as output of the
    `initiate-multipart-upload` command. The `--range` parameter
    specifies that you will upload a part with a size of 1 MiB (1024 x 1024 bytes).
    This size must match what you specified in the
    `initiate-multipart-upload` command. Adjust this size value if
    needed. The `--body` parameter specifies the name of the part that
    you're uploading.

```nohighlight

aws glacier upload-multipart-part --body chunkaa --range='bytes 0-1048575/*' --vault-name awsexamplevault --account-id 123456789012 --upload-id upload_ID
```

If successful, the command will produce output that contains the checksum for
    the uploaded part.

5. Run the `upload-multipart-part` command again to upload the
    remaining parts of your multipart upload. Update the `--range` and
    `–-body` parameter values for each command to match the part that
    you're uploading.

```nohighlight

aws glacier upload-multipart-part --body chunkab --range='bytes 1048576-2097151/*' --vault-name awsexamplevault --account-id 123456789012 --upload-id upload_ID
```

```nohighlight

aws glacier upload-multipart-part --body chunkac --range='bytes 2097152-3145727/*' --vault-name awsexamplevault --account-id 123456789012 --upload-id upload_ID
```

```nohighlight

aws glacier upload-multipart-part --body chunkad --range='bytes 3145728-4194303/*' --vault-name awsexamplevault --account-id 123456789012 --upload-id upload_ID
```

```nohighlight

aws glacier upload-multipart-part --body chunkae --range='bytes 4194304-4607999/*' --vault-name awsexamplevault --account-id 123456789012 --upload-id upload_ID
```

###### Note

The final command's `--range` parameter value is smaller
because the final part of our upload is less than 1 MiB. If successful, each
command will produce output that contains the checksum for each uploaded
part.

6. Next, you will assemble the archive and finish the upload. You must include
    the total size and SHA256 tree hash of the archive.

To calculate the SHA256 tree hash of the archive, you can use
    Java, C#, or Python. In this example, you will
    use Python. For instructions on using Java or C#,
    see [Computing Checksums](checksum-calculations.md).

Create the Python file `checksum.py` and
    insert the following code. If needed, replace the name of the original
    file.

```nohighlight

from botocore.utils import calculate_tree_hash

checksum = calculate_tree_hash(open('file_to_upload', 'rb'))
print(checksum)
```

7. Run `checksum.py` to calculate the SHA256 tree hash. The
    following hash may not match your output.

```bash

$ python3 checksum.py
$ 3d760edb291bfc9d90d35809243de092aea4c47b308290ad12d084f69988ae0c
```

8. Use the [complete-multipart-upload](../../../cli/latest/reference/glacier/complete-multipart-upload.md) command to finish the
    archive upload. Replace the values for the `--vault-name`,
    `--account-ID`, `--upload-ID`, and
    `--checksum` parameters. The `--archive` parameter
    value specifies the total size, in bytes, of the archive. This value must be the
    sum of all the sizes of the individual parts that you uploaded. Replace this
    value if needed.

```nohighlight

aws glacier complete-multipart-upload --archive-size 4608000 --vault-name awsexamplevault --account-id 123456789012 --upload-id upload_ID --checksum checksum
```

When finished, the command will output the archive's ID, checksum, and
    location in Amazon Glacier.
