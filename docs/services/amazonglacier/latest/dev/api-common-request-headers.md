**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Common Request Headers

Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier) REST requests include headers that contain basic information about the request. The
following table describes headers that can be used by all Amazon Glacier REST
requests.

Header NameDescriptionRequired`Authorization`

The header that is required to sign requests. Amazon Glacier requires Signature Version 4.
For more information, see [Signing Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-signing-requests.html).

Type: String

Yes`Content-Length`

The length of the request body (without the headers).

Type: String

Condition: Required only for the [Upload Archive (POST archive)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html) API.

Conditional`Date`

The date that can be used to create the signature contained in the
`Authorization` header. If the `Date` header
is to be used for signing it must be specified in the ISO 8601 basic
format. In this case, the `x-amz-date` header is not needed.
Note that when `x-amz-date` is present, it always overrides
the value of the `Date` header.

If the Date header is not used for signing, it can be one of the full
date formats specified by [RFC\
2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616), section 3.3. For example, the following date/time
`Wed, 10 Feb 2017 12:00:00 GMT` is a valid date/time header for use with
Amazon Glacier.

If you are using the `Date` header for signing, then it
must be in the ISO 8601 basic `YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'` format.

Type: String

Condition: If `Date` is specified but is not in ISO 8601 basic format, then
you must also include the `x-amz-date` header. If
`Date` is specified in ISO 8601 basic format, then this
is sufficient for signing requests and you do not need the
`x-amz-date` header. For more information, see [Handling Dates in Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-date-handling.html) in the
_Amazon Web Services Glossary_.

Conditional `Host`

This header specifies the service endpoint to which you send your requests. The value
must be of the form
" `glacier.region.amazonaws.com`",
where `region` is replaced with an AWS Region designation such as
`us-west-2`.

Type: String

Yes`x-amz-content-sha256`

The computed SHA256 checksum of an entire payload that is uploaded with either [Upload Archive (POST archive)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html) or [Upload Part (PUT uploadID)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-upload-part.html). This header
is not the same as the `x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` header,
though, for some small payloads the values are the same. When
`x-amz-content-sha256` is required, both
`x-amz-content-sha256` and
`x-amz-sha256-tree-hash` must be specified.

Type: String

Condition: Required for streaming API, [Upload Archive (POST archive)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html) and [Upload Part (PUT uploadID)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-upload-part.html).

Conditional`x-amz-date`

The date used to create the signature in the Authorization header. The format must be
ISO 8601 basic in the `YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'` format. For
example, the following date/time `20170210T120000Z` is a valid
`x-amz-date` for use with Amazon Glacier.

Type: String

Condition: `x-amz-date` is optional for all requests; it can be used to
override the date used for signing requests. If the `Date`
header is specified in the ISO 8601 basic format, then
`x-amz-date` is not needed. When `x-amz-date`
is present, it always overrides the value of the `Date`
header. For more information, see [Handling Dates in Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-date-handling.html) in the
_Amazon Web Services Glossary_.

Conditional`x-amz-glacier-version`

The Amazon Glacier API version to use. The current version is `2012-06-01`.

Type: String

Yes`x-amz-sha256-tree-hash`

The computed SHA256 tree-hash checksum for an uploaded archive ( [Upload Archive (POST archive)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html)) or
archive part ( [Upload Part (PUT uploadID)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-upload-part.html)). For more information about
calculating this checksum, see [Computing Checksums](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html).

Type: String

Default: None

Condition: Required for [Upload Archive (POST archive)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html)
and [Upload Part (PUT uploadID)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-upload-part.html).
