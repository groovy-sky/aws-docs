**This page is only for existing customers of the Amazon Glacier service using Vaults and the original REST API from 2012.**

If you're looking for archival storage solutions, we recommend using the Amazon Glacier storage classes in Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. To learn more about these storage options, see [Amazon Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier).

Amazon Glacier (original standalone vault-based service) is no longer accepting new customers. Amazon Glacier is a standalone service with its own APIs that stores data in vaults and is distinct from Amazon S3 and the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes. Your existing data will remain secure and accessible in Amazon Glacier indefinitely. No migration is required. For low-cost, long-term archival storage, AWS recommends the [Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier), which deliver a superior customer experience with S3 bucket-based APIs, full AWS Region availability, lower costs, and AWS service integration. If you want enhanced capabilities, consider migrating to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes by using our [AWS Solutions Guidance for transferring data from Amazon Glacier vaults to Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/data-transfer-from-amazon-s3-glacier-vaults-to-amazon-s3).

# Delete Vault Access Policy (DELETE access-policy)

## Description

This operation deletes the access policy associated with the specified vault. The
operation is eventually consistent—that is, it might take some time for Amazon Glacier (Amazon Glacier)
to completely remove the access policy, and you might still see the effect of the policy
for a short time after you send the delete request.

This operation is idempotent. You can invoke delete multiple times, even if there is
no policy associated with the vault. For more information about vault access policies,
see [Vault Access Policies](vault-access-policy.md).

## Requests

To delete the current vault access policy, send an HTTP `DELETE` request to
the URI of the vault's `access-policy` subresource.

### Syntax

```nohighlight

DELETE /AccountId/vaults/vaultName/access-policy HTTP/1.1
Host: glacier.Region.amazonaws.com
Date: Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
x-amz-glacier-version: 2012-06-01
```

###### Note

The `AccountId` value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a single ' `-`' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

`access-policy` subresource of the vault named
`examplevault`.

```nohighlight

Host: glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
x-amz-Date: 20170210T120000Z
Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20141123/us-west-2/glacier/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-amz-glacier-version,Signature=9257c16da6b25a715ce900a5b45b03da0447acf430195dcb540091b12966f2a2
