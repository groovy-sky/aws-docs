# Transition to using Instance Metadata Service Version 2

If you want to configure your instances to only accept Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) calls,
we recommend that you use the following tools and transition path.

###### Topics

- [Tools for transitioning to IMDSv2](#tools-for-transitioning-to-imdsv2)

- [Recommended path to requiring IMDSv2](#recommended-path-for-requiring-imdsv2)

## Tools for transitioning to IMDSv2

The following tools can help you identify, monitor, and manage the transition of your
software from IMDSv1 to IMDSv2. For the instructions on how to use
these tools, see [Recommended path to requiring IMDSv2](#recommended-path-for-requiring-imdsv2).

**AWS software**

The latest versions of the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs support IMDSv2. To use
IMDSv2, update your EC2 instances to use the latest versions.
For the minimum AWS SDK versions that support IMDSv2, see
[Use a supported AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html#use-a-supported-sdk-version-for-imdsv2).

All Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2023 software packages support IMDSv2. Amazon Linux 2023
disables IMDSv1 by default.

**IMDS Packet Analyzer**

IMDS Packet Analyzer is an open-source tool that identifies and logs IMDSv1
calls during your instance’s boot phase and runtime operations. By
analyzing these logs, you can precisely identify the software making
IMDSv1 calls on your instances and determine what needs to be
updated to support IMDSv2 only on your instances. You can run
IMDS Packet Analyzer from a command line or install it as a service. For
more information, see [AWS\
ImdsPacketAnalyzer](https://github.com/aws/aws-imds-packet-analyzer) on _GitHub_.

**CloudWatch**

CloudWatch provides the following two metrics for monitoring your instances:

`MetadataNoToken` – IMDSv2 uses token-backed sessions, while
IMDSv1 does not. The `MetadataNoToken` metric tracks
the number of calls to the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) that are using
IMDSv1. By tracking this metric to zero, you can determine if
and when all of your software has been upgraded to use
IMDSv2.

`MetadataNoTokenRejected` – After you've disabled IMDSv1, you
can use the `MetadataNoTokenRejected` metric to track the
number of times an IMDSv1 call was attempted and rejected. By
tracking this metric, you can ascertain whether your software needs to
be updated to use IMDSv2.

For each EC2 instance, these metrics are mutually exclusive. When IMDSv1 is
enabled ( `httpTokens = optional`), only
`MetadataNoToken` emits. When IMDSv1 is disabled
( `httpTokens = required`), only
`MetadataNoTokenRejected` emits. For when to use these
metrics, see [Recommended path to requiring IMDSv2](#recommended-path-for-requiring-imdsv2).

For more information, see [Instance metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html#ec2-cloudwatch-metrics).

**Launch APIs**

**New instances:** Use the [RunInstances](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-runinstances.md) API to
launch new instances that require the use of IMDSv2. For more
information, see [Configure instance metadata options for new instances](configuring-imds-new-instances.md).

**Existing instances:** Use the [ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions.html) API to require the use of
IMDSv2 on existing instances. For more information, see [Modify instance metadata options for existing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-existing-instances.html).

**New instances launched by Auto Scaling groups:** To require the
use of IMDSv2 on all new instances launched by Auto Scaling groups, your
Auto Scaling groups can use either a launch template or a launch configuration.
When you [create a launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-launch-template.html) or [create a launch configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html), you must configure the
`MetadataOptions` parameters to require the use of
IMDSv2. The Auto Scaling group launches new instances using the new
launch template or launch configuration, but existing instances are not
affected.

**Existing instances in an Auto Scaling group:** Use the [ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions.html) API to require the use of
IMDSv2 on existing instances, or terminate the instances and the
Auto Scaling group will launch new replacement instances with the instance
metadata options settings that are defined in the new launch template or
launch configuration.

**AMIs**

AMIs configured with the `ImdsSupport` parameter set to
`v2.0` will launch instances that require IMDSv2
by default. Amazon Linux 2023 is configured with `ImdsSupport =
								v2.0`.

**New AMIs:** Use the [register-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-image.html)
CLI command to set the `ImdsSupport` parameter to
`v2.0` when creating a new AMI.

**Existing AMIs:** Use the [modify-image-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-image-attribute.html) CLI command to set the
`ImdsSupport` parameter to `v2.0` when
modifying an existing AMI.

For more information, see [Configure the AMI](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#configure-IMDS-new-instances-ami-configuration).

**Account-level controls**

You can configure default values for all the instance metadata options at the account
level. The default values are automatically applied when you launch an
instance. For more information. see [Set IMDSv2 as the default for the account](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#set-imdsv2-account-defaults).

You can also enforce the requirement to use IMDSv2 at the account level. When
IMDSv2 enforcement is enabled:

- **New instances:** Instances configured to launch with
IMDSv1 enabled will fail to launch

- **Existing instances with IMDSv1 disabled:**
Attempts to enable IMDSv1 on existing instances will be
prevented.

- **Existing instances with IMDSv1 enabled:**
Existing instances with IMDSv1 already enabled will not
be affected.

For more information, see [Enforce IMDSv2 at the account level](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#enforce-imdsv2-at-the-account-level).

**IAM policies and SCPs**

You can use an IAM policy or AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP)
to control users as follows:

- Can't launch an instance using the [RunInstances](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-runinstances.md) API unless the instance is
configured to use IMDSv2.

- Can't modify an existing instance using the [ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions.html) API to re-enable
IMDSv1.

The IAM policy or SCP must contain the following IAM condition
keys:

- `ec2:MetadataHttpEndpoint`

- `ec2:MetadataHttpPutResponseHopLimit`

- `ec2:MetadataHttpTokens`

If a parameter in the API or CLI call doesn't match the state specified in the policy
that contains the condition key, the API or CLI call fails with an
`UnauthorizedOperation` response.

Furthermore, you can choose an additional layer of protection to enforce the change
from IMDSv1 to IMDSv2. At the access management layer
with respect to the APIs called via EC2 Role credentials, you can use a
condition key in either IAM policies or AWS Organizations service control
policies (SCPs). Specifically, by using the condition key
`ec2:RoleDelivery` with a value of `2.0` in
your IAM policies, API calls made with EC2 Role credentials obtained
from IMDSv1 will receive an `UnauthorizedOperation`
response. The same thing can be achieved more broadly with that
condition required by an SCP. This ensures that credentials delivered
via IMDSv1 cannot actually be used to call APIs because any API
calls not matching the specified condition will receive an
`UnauthorizedOperation` error.

For example IAM policies, see [Work with instance metadata](examplepolicies-ec2.md#iam-example-instance-metadata). For more
information on SCPs, see [Service control policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

**Declarative Policies**

Use Declarative Policies (a feature of AWS Organizations) to centrally set IMDS account
defaults, including IMDSv2 enforcement, across your
organization. For an example policy, see the **Instance**
**Metadata** tab in the [Supported declarative policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative_syntax.html#declarative-policy-examples) section in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

## Recommended path to requiring IMDSv2

###### Using the above tools, we recommend the following path for transitioning to  IMDSv2:

- [Step 1: Identify instances with IMDSv2=optional and audit IMDSv1 usage](#path-step-1)

- [Step 2: Update software to IMDSv2](#path-step-2)

- [Step 3: Require IMDSv2 on instances](#path-step-3)

- [Step 4: Set IMDSv2=required as the default](#path-step-4)

- [Step 5: Enforce instances to require IMDSv2](#path-step-5)

### Step 1: Identify instances with IMDSv2=optional and audit IMDSv1 usage

To assess your IMDSv2 migration scope, identify instances that are configured to
allow either IMDSv1 or IMDSv2, and audit IMDSv1
calls.

1. **Identify instances that are configured to allow either**
**IMDSv1 or IMDSv2:**
Amazon EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. To see only the instances that are configured to allow IMDSv1 or IMDSv2, add the
    filter **IMDSv2 =**
**optional**.

4. Alternatively, to see whether IMDSv2 is **optional** or
    **required** for all instances,
    open the **Preferences** window
    (gear icon), toggle on **IMDSv2**,
    and choose **Confirm**. This adds
    the **IMDSv2** column to the
    **Instances** table.

AWS CLI

Use the [describe-instances](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) command and filter by
`metadata-options.http-tokens = optional`, as
follows:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=metadata-options.http-tokens,Values=optional" --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId]" --output text
```

2. **Audit IMDSv1 calls on each instance:**

Use the CloudWatch metric `MetadataNoToken`. This metric shows
    the number of IMDSv1 calls to the IMDS on your instances. For
    more information, see [Instance metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html#ec2-cloudwatch-metrics).

3. **Identify software on your instances making IMDSv1**
**calls:**

Use the open source [IMDS\
    Packet Analyzer](https://github.com/aws/aws-imds-packet-analyzer) to identify and log IMDSv1 calls
    during your instance’s boot phase and runtime operations. Use this
    information to identify the software to update to get your instances
    ready to use IMDSv2 only. You can run IMDS Packet Analyzer from
    a command line or install it as a service.

### Step 2: Update software to IMDSv2

Update all SDKs, CLIs, and software that use Role credentials on your instances to
IMDSv2-compatible versions. For more information about updating the CLI,
see [Installing or\
updating to the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

### Step 3: Require IMDSv2 on instances

After confirming zero IMDSv1 calls through the `MetadataNoToken`
metric, configure your existing instances to require IMDSv2. Also,
configure all new instances to require IMDSv2. In other words, disable
IMDSv1 on all existing and new instances.

1. **Configure existing instances to require**
**IMDSv2:**
Amazon EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select your instance.

4. Choose **Actions**,
    **Instance settings**,
    **Modify instance metadata**
**options**.

5. For **IMDSv2**, choose
    **Required**.

6. Choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

Use the [modify-instance-metadata-options](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) CLI command to specify
that only IMDSv2 is to be used.

###### Note

You can modify this setting on running instances. The change takes effect immediately
without needing an instance restart.

For more information, see [Require the use of IMDSv2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-existing-instances.html#modify-require-IMDSv2).

2. **Monitor for issues after disabling**
**IMDSv1:**

1. Track the number of times an IMDSv1 call was attempted and rejected with the
    `MetadataNoTokenRejected` CloudWatch metric.

2. If the `MetadataNoTokenRejected` metric records
    IMDSv1 calls on an instance that is experiencing
    software issues, this indicates that the software requires
    updating to use IMDSv2.

3. **Configure new instances to require**
**IMDSv2:**
Amazon EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Follow the steps to [launch an\
    instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md).

3. Expand **Advanced details**, and for **Metadata**
**version**, choose **V2 only**
**(token required)**.

4. In the **Summary panel**, review your instance configuration, and
    then choose **Launch**
**instance**.

For more information, see [Configure the instance at launch](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#configure-IMDS-new-instances-instance-settings).

AWS CLI

AWS CLI: Use the [run-instances](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command and specify that IMDSv2
is required.

### Step 4: Set IMDSv2=required as the default

You can set IMDSv2=required as the default configuration at either the account or
organization level. This ensures that all newly launched instances are
automatically configured to require IMDSv2.

1. **Set account-level default:**
Amazon EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Dashboard**.

3. On the **Account attributes**
    card, under **Settings**,
    choose **Data protection and**
**security**.

4. Under **IMDS defaults**, choose
    **Manage**.

5. For **Instance metadata service**, choose
    **Enabled**.

6. For **Metadata version**, choose
    to **V2 only (token**
**required)**.

7. Choose **Update**.

AWS CLI

Use the [modify-instance-metadata-defaults](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-defaults.html) CLI command and
specify `--http-tokens required` and
`--http-put-response-hop-limit
											2`.

For more information, see [Set IMDSv2 as the default for the account](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#set-imdsv2-account-defaults).

2. **Alternatively, set organization-level default using a Declarative**
**Policy:**

Use a Declarative Policy to set the organization default for IMDSv2 to
    required. For an example policy, see the **Instance**
**Metadata** tab in the [Supported declarative policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative_syntax.html#declarative-policy-examples) section in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

### Step 5: Enforce instances to require IMDSv2

Once you’ve confirmed that there is no dependency on IMDSv1 on any of your
instances, we recommend that you enforce IMDSv2 on all new
instances.

Use one of the following options to enforce IMDSv2:

1. **Enforce IMDSv2 with an account property**

You can enforce the use of IMDSv2 at the account level for each AWS Region.
    When enforced, instances can only launch if they're configured to
    require IMDSv2. This enforcement applies regardless of how the
    instance or AMI is configured. For more information, see [Enforce IMDSv2 at the account level](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#enforce-imdsv2-at-the-account-level). To apply this
    setting at an organization level, set a Declarative Policy. For an
    example policy, see the **Instance Metadata** tab in
    the [Supported declarative policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative_syntax.html#declarative-policy-examples) section in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

To prevent a reversal of enforcement, you should use an IAM policy to prevent access to
    the [ModifyInstanceMetadataDefaults](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataDefaults.html) API. For more information,
    see [Use an IAM policy](configuring-imds-new-instances.md#configure-IMDS-new-instances-iam-policy).

###### Note

This setting does not change the IMDS version of existing
instances, but blocks enabling IMDSv1 on existing instances
that currently have IMDSv1 disabled.

###### Warning

If IMDSv2 enforcement is enabled and `httpTokens` is not set to
`required` in either the instance configuration at
launch, the account settings, or the AMI configuration, the instance
launch will fail. For troubleshooting information, see [Launching an IMDSv1-enabled instance fails](troubleshooting-launch.md#launching-an-imdsv1-enabled-instance-fails).

2. **Alternatively, enforce IMDSv2 by using the following IAM**
**or SCP condition keys:**

- `ec2:MetadataHttpTokens`

- `ec2:MetadataHttpPutResponseHopLimit`

- `ec2:MetadataHttpEndpoint`

These condition keys control the use of the [RunInstances](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-runinstances.md) and the [ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions.html) APIs and corresponding CLIs. If a
policy is created, and a parameter in the API call does not match the state
specified in the policy using the condition key, the API or CLI call fails with
an `UnauthorizedOperation` response.

For example IAM policies, see [Work with instance metadata](examplepolicies-ec2.md#iam-example-instance-metadata).
