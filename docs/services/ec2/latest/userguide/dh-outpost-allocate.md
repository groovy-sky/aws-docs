# Allocate an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host on AWS Outposts

You allocate and use Dedicated Hosts on Outposts in the same way that would with Dedicated Hosts in an
AWS Region.

###### Prerequisites

Create a subnet on the Outpost. For more information, see [Create a\
subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/launch-instance.html#create-subnet) in the _AWS Outposts User Guide_.

**To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost, use one of the following**
**methods:**

Console

###### To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost using the AWS Outposts console

1. Open the AWS Outposts console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/outposts/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/outposts/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Outposts**.
    Select the Outpost and then choose **Actions**,
    **Allocate Dedicated Host**.

3. Configure the Dedicated Host as needed. For more information, see [Allocate an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host for use in your account](dedicated-hosts-allocating.md).

###### Note

**Availability Zone** and
**Outpost ARN** should be pre-populated
with the Availability Zone and ARN of the selected
Outpost.

4. Choose **Allocate**.

###### To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost using the Amazon EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**, and
    then choose **Allocate Dedicated Host**.

3. For **Availability Zone**, select the
    Availability Zone associated with the Outpost.

4. For **Outpost ARN**, enter the ARN of the
    Outpost.

5. To target specific hardware assets on the Outpost, for
    **Target specific hardware assets on**
**Outpost**, select **Enable**. For
    each hardware asset to target, choose **Add asset**
**ID**, and then enter the ID of the hardware
    asset.

###### Note

The value that you specify for
**Quantity** must be equal to the
number of asset IDs that you specify. For example, if you
specify 3 asset IDs, then Quantity must also be 3.

6. Configure the remaining Dedicated Host settings as needed. For more
    information, see [Allocate an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host for use in your account](dedicated-hosts-allocating.md).

7. Choose **Allocate**.

AWS CLI

###### To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost

Use the [allocate-hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.html) command. For
`--availability-zone`, specify the Availability Zone
associated with the Outpost. For `--outpost-arn`, specify
the ARN of the Outpost. Optionally, for `--asset-ids`,
specify the IDs of the Outpost hardware assets to target.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 allocate-hosts \
    --availability-zone "us-east-1a" \
    --outpost-arn "arn:aws:outposts:us-east-1a:111122223333:outpost/op-4fe3dc21baEXAMPLE" \
    --asset-ids asset_id \
    --instance-family "m5" \
    --auto-placement "off" \
    --quantity 1
```

PowerShell

###### To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost

Use the [New-EC2Host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Host.html) cmdlet. Specify the Availability Zone
associated with the Outpost. Optionally, for `-AssetId`,
specify the IDs of the Outpost hardware assets to target.

```powershell

New-EC2Host `
    -AvailabilityZone "us-east-1a" `
    -OutpostArn "arn:aws:outposts:us-east-1a:111122223333:outpost/op-4fe3dc21baEXAMPLE" `
    -AssetId asset_id `
    -InstanceFamily "m5" `
    -AutoPlacement "off" `
    -Quantity 1
```

###### To launch an instance onto a Dedicated Host on an Outpost

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**. Select the Dedicated Host
    that you allocated in the previous step and choose
    **Actions**, **Launch instance onto**
**host**.

3. Configure the instance as needed and then launch the instance. For more
    information, see [Launch Amazon EC2 instances on an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host](launching-dedicated-hosts-instances.md).
