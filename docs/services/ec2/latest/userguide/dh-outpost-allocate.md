# Allocate an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host on AWS Outposts
<a name="dh-outpost-allocate"></a>

You allocate and use Dedicated Hosts on Outposts in the same way that would with Dedicated Hosts in an AWS Region.

**Prerequisites**
Create a subnet on the Outpost. For more information, see [Create a subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/launch-instance.html#create-subnet) in the *AWS Outposts User Guide*.

**To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost, use one of the following methods:**

------
#### [ Console ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost using the AWS Outposts console**

1. Open the AWS Outposts console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/outposts/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/outposts/home).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Outposts**. Select the Outpost and then choose **Actions**, **Allocate Dedicated Host**.

1. Configure the Dedicated Host as needed. For more information, see [Allocate an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host for use in your account](dedicated-hosts-allocating.md).
**Note**
**Availability Zone** and **Outpost ARN** should be pre-populated with the Availability Zone and ARN of the selected Outpost.

1. Choose **Allocate**.

**To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**, and then choose **Allocate Dedicated Host**.

1. For **Availability Zone**, select the Availability Zone associated with the Outpost.

1. For **Outpost ARN**, enter the ARN of the Outpost.

1. To target specific hardware assets on the Outpost, for **Target specific hardware assets on Outpost**, select **Enable**. For each hardware asset to target, choose **Add asset ID**, and then enter the ID of the hardware asset.
**Note**
The value that you specify for **Quantity** must be equal to the number of asset IDs that you specify. For example, if you specify 3 asset IDs, then Quantity must also be 3.

1. Configure the remaining Dedicated Host settings as needed. For more information, see [Allocate an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host for use in your account](dedicated-hosts-allocating.md).

1. Choose **Allocate**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost**
Use the [allocate-hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.html) command. For `--availability-zone`, specify the Availability Zone associated with the Outpost. For `--outpost-arn`, specify the ARN of the Outpost. Optionally, for `--asset-ids`, specify the IDs of the Outpost hardware assets to target.

```
aws ec2 allocate-hosts \
    --availability-zone "{{us-east-1a}}" \
    --outpost-arn "{{arn:aws:outposts:us-east-1a:111122223333:outpost/op-4fe3dc21baEXAMPLE}}" \
    --asset-ids {{asset_id}} \
    --instance-family "{{m5}}" \
    --auto-placement "{{off}}" \
    --quantity 1
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host on an Outpost**
Use the [New-EC2Host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Host.html) cmdlet. Specify the Availability Zone associated with the Outpost. Optionally, for `-AssetId`, specify the IDs of the Outpost hardware assets to target.

```
New-EC2Host `
    -AvailabilityZone "{{us-east-1a}}" `
    -OutpostArn "{{arn:aws:outposts:us-east-1a:111122223333:outpost/op-4fe3dc21baEXAMPLE}}" `
    -AssetId {{asset_id}} `
    -InstanceFamily "{{m5}}" `
    -AutoPlacement "{{off}}" `
    -Quantity 1
```

------

**To launch an instance onto a Dedicated Host on an Outpost**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**. Select the Dedicated Host that you allocated in the previous step and choose **Actions**, **Launch instance onto host**.

1. Configure the instance as needed and then launch the instance. For more information, see [Launch Amazon EC2 instances on an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host](launching-dedicated-hosts-instances.md).
