# Replace the root volume for an Amazon EC2 instance without stopping it
<a name="replace-root"></a>

Amazon EC2 enables you to replace the root Amazon EBS volume for a running instance while retaining the following:
+ Data stored on instance store volumes — Instance store volumes remain attached to the instance after the root volume has been restored.
+ Data stored on data (non-root) Amazon EBS volumes — Non-root Amazon EBS volumes remain attached to the instance after the root volume has been restored.
+ Network configuration — All network interfaces remain attached to the instance and they retain their IP addresses, identifiers, and attachment IDs. When the instance becomes available, all pending network traffic is flushed. Additionally, the instance remains on the same physical host, so it retains its public and private IP addresses and DNS name.
+ IAM policies — IAM profiles and policies (such as tag-based policies) that are associated with the instance are retained and enforced.

## How root volume replacement works
<a name="replace-root-how"></a>

When you replace the root volume for an instance, we create *root volume replacement task*. The original root volume is detached from the instance, and the new root volume is attached to the instance in its place. The instance's block device mapping is updated to reflect the ID of the replacement root volume.

When you replace the root volume for an instance, you must specify the source for the new volume. The following are the possible options.

### Restore a root volume to its original state
<a name="replace-launchstate"></a>

This option replaces the current root volume with a volume that is based on the snapshot that was used to create it.

**Considerations for using the launch state**
The replacement root volume gets the same type, size, and delete on termination attributes as the original root volume.

### Replace the root volume using a snapshot
<a name="replace-snapshot"></a>

This option replaces the current root volume with a replacement volume that is based on the snapshot that you specify. For example, a specific snapshot that you previously created from this root volume. This is useful if you need to recover from issues caused by corruption of the root volume or network configuration errors in the guest operating system.

The replacement root volume gets the same type, size, and delete on termination attributes as the original root volume.

**Considerations for using a snapshot**
+ You can only use snapshots that were created directly from the instance's current or previous root volumes.
+ You can't use snapshot copies created from snapshots that were taken from the root volume.
+ After successfully replacing the root volume, you can still use snapshots taken from the original root volume to replace the new (replacement) root volume.

### Replace the root volume using an AMI
<a name="replace-ami"></a>

This option replaces the current root volume using an AMI that you specify. This is useful if you need to perform operating system and application patching or upgrades. The AMI must have the same product code, billing information, architecture type, and virtualization type as the instance.

If the instance is enabled for ENA or sriov-net, then you must use an AMI that supports those features. If the instance is not enabled for ENA or sriov-net, then you can either select an AMI that doesn't include support for those features, or you can automatically add support if you select an AMI that supports ENA or sriov-net.

If the instance is enabled for NitroTPM, then you must use an AMI that has NitroTPM enabled. NitroTPM support is not enabled if the instance was not configured for it, regardless of the AMI that you select.

You can select an AMI with a different boot mode than that of the instance, as long as the instance supports the boot mode of the AMI. If the instance does not support the boot mode, the request fails. If the instance supports the boot mode, the new boot mode is propagated to the instance and its UEFI data is updated accordingly. If you manually modified the boot order or added a private UEFI Secure Boot key to load private kernel modules, the changes are lost during root volume replacement.

The replacement root volume gets the same volume type and delete on termination attribute as the original root volume. The size of the replacement root volume is the larger of the AMI root volume block device mapping size and the current root volume size.

After the root volume replacement task completes, the following new and updated information is reflected when you describe the instance using the console, AWS CLI or AWS SDKs:
+ New AMI ID
+ New volume ID for the root volume
+ Updated boot mode configuration (if changed by the AMI)
+ Updated NitroTPM configuration (if enabled by the AMI)
+ Updated ENA configuration (if enabled by the AMI)
+ Updated sriov-net configuration (if enabled by the AMI)

The new AMI ID is also reflected in the instance metadata.

**Considerations for using an AMI:**
+ If you use an AMI that has multiple block device mappings, only the root volume of the AMI is used. The other (non-root) volumes are ignored.
+ You can only use this feature if you have permissions to the AMI and its associated root volume snapshot. You cannot use this feature with AWS Marketplace AMIs.
+ You can only use an AMI without a product code only if the instance does not have a product code.
+ The size of the replacement root volume is the larger of the AMI root volume block device mapping size and the current root volume size.
+ The instance identity documents for the instance are automatically updated.
+ If the instance supports NitroTPM, the NitroTPM data for the instance is reset and new keys are generated.

### Replace the root volume using an existing Amazon EBS volume
<a name="replace-volume"></a>

Unlike the snapshot and AMI options, which create a new volume, this option replaces the current root volume with an existing Amazon EBS volume that you have already configured. This is useful for stateful workloads, such as databases, where you want to prepare metadata or software on the root volume before you attach it to the instance.

Before you use this option, you must create and prepare the replacement Amazon EBS volume. You can prepare it by attaching it to an instance as a data volume, copying the required data to it, and then detaching it. The volume must be in the same Availability Zone as the instance.

The replacement root volume retains the size, type, and other attributes that you configured when you created and prepared it. The delete on termination attribute of the original root volume does not transfer to the replacement root volume.

**Considerations for using an existing Amazon EBS volume**
+ The replacement volume must be in the same Availability Zone as the instance.
+ The replacement volume must not be attached to any instance at the time of the request.
+ The replacement volume must be in the `available` state.
+ If the replacement volume does not meet these requirements, the root volume replacement request fails.
+ You can use this option with AWS Marketplace instances, but both the marketplace product codes and the billing codes on the replacement volume must match those on the instance.
+ If the original root volume is encrypted, the replacement volume must also be encrypted. You can move from an unencrypted volume to an encrypted one, but not from encrypted to unencrypted. When the replacement volume is encrypted, your IAM principal must have the AWS KMS permissions required to detach the original volume. You must also have the permissions to attach and decrypt the replacement volume. These are the same permissions needed to attach an encrypted volume.

You can choose whether to keep the original root volume after the root volume replacement process has completed. If you choose delete the original root volume after the replacement process completes, the original root volume is automatically deleted and becomes unrecoverable. If you choose to keep the original root volume after the process completes, the volume remains provisioned in your account; you must manually delete the volume when you no longer need it.

The root volume replacement task transitions through the following states:
+ `pending` — The replacement volume is being created.
+ `in-progress` — The original volume is being detached and the replacement volume is being attached.
+ `succeeded` — The replacement volume has been successfully attached to the instance and the instance is available.
+ `failing` — The replacement task is in the process of failing.
+ `failed` — The replacement task has failed, but the root volume is still attached.
+ `failing-detached` — The replacement task is in the process of failing and the instance might not have a root volume attached.
+ `failed-detached` — The replacement task has failed and the instance doesn't have a root volume attached.

If the root volume replacement task fails, the instance is rebooted and the original root volume remains attached to the instance.

## Considerations
<a name="replace-root-considerations"></a>

Before you begin, consider the following.

**Requirements**
+ The instance must be in the `running` state.
+ The instance is automatically rebooted during the process. The contents of the memory (RAM) is erased during the reboot. No manual reboots are required.
+ You can't replace the root volume if it is an instance store volume. Only instances with Amazon EBS root volumes are supported.
+ You can replace the root volume for all virtualized instance types and EC2 Mac bare metal instances. No other bare metal instance types are supported.
+ When using a snapshot, you can only use snapshots that you created directly from the instance's current or previous root volumes.
+ If your account is enabled for Amazon EBS encryption by default in the current Region, the replacement root volume created by the root volume replacement task is always encrypted, regardless of the encryption status of the specified snapshot or the root volume of the specified AMI.

## Replace a root volume
<a name="replace"></a>

When you replace the root volume for an instance, a *root volume replacement task* is created. You can use the root volume replacement task to monitor the progress and outcome of the replacement process.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To replace the root volume**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select the instance for which to replace the root volume and choose **Actions**, **Monitor and troubleshoot**, **Replace root volume**.
**Note**
The **Replace root volume** action is disabled if the selected instance is not in the `running` state.

1. For **Restore**, choose one of the following options:
   + **Launch state** – Restore the replacement root volume from the snapshot that was used to create the current root volume.
   + **Snapshot** – Restore the replacement root volume to the snapshot that you specify. For **Snapshot**, select the snapshot to use.
   + **Image** – Restore the replacement root volume using the AMI that you specify. For **Image**, select the AMI to use.

1. (Optional) For **Volume initialization rate**, you can specify the Amazon EBS Provisioned Rate for Volume Initialization (volume initialization rate), in MiB/s, at which the snapshot blocks are to be downloaded from Amazon S3 to the volume. For more information, see [ Use an Amazon EBS Provisioned Rate for Volume Initialization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/initalize-volume.html#volume-initialization-rate). To use the default initialization rate or fast snapshot restore (if it is enabled for the selected snapshot), don't specify a rate.

1. (Optional) To delete the root volume that you are replacing, select **Delete replaced root volume**.

1. Choose **Create replacement task**.

1. To monitor the replacement task, choose the **Storage** tab for the instance and expand **Recent root volume replacement tasks**.

#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To restore the replacement root volume to the launch state**
Use the [ create-replace-root-volume-task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-replace-root-volume-task.html) command. For `--instance-id`, specify the ID of the instance for which to replace the root volume. Omit the `--snapshot-id` and `--image-id` parameters. To delete the original root volume after it has been replaced, include `--delete-replaced-root-volume` and specify `true`. To specify the volume initialization rate at which the snapshot blocks are downloaded from Amazon S3 to the volume, for `--volume-initialization-rate`, specify a value between `100` and `300` MiB/s.

```
aws ec2 create-replace-root-volume-task \
--instance-id {{i-1234567890abcdef0}} \
--delete-replaced-root-volume \
--volume-initialization-rate {{150}}
```

**To restore the replacement root volume to a specific snapshot**
Use the [create-replace-root-volume-task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-replace-root-volume-task.html) command. For `--instance-id`, specify the ID of the instance for which to replace the root volume. For `--snapshot-id`, specify the ID of the snapshot to use. To delete the original root volume after it has been replaced, include `--delete-replaced-root-volume` and specify `true`. To specify the volume initialization rate at which the snapshot blocks are downloaded from Amazon S3 to the volume, for `--volume-initialization-rate`, specify a value between `100` and `300` MiB/s.

```
aws ec2 create-replace-root-volume-task \
--instance-id {{i-1234567890abcdef0}} \
--snapshot-id {{snap-9876543210abcdef0}} \
--delete-replaced-root-volume \
--volume-initialization-rate {{150}}
```

**To restore the replacement root volume using an AMI**
Use the [ create-replace-root-volume-task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-replace-root-volume-task.html) command. For `--instance-id`, specify the ID of the instance for which to replace the root volume. For `--image-id`, specify the ID of the AMI to use. To delete the original root volume after it has been replaced, include `--delete-replaced-root-volume` and specify `true`. To specify the volume initialization rate at which the snapshot blocks are downloaded from Amazon S3 to the volume, for `--volume-initialization-rate`, specify a value between `100` and `300` MiB/s.
