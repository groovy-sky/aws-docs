# Status checks for Amazon EC2 instances
<a name="monitoring-system-instance-status-check"></a>

With status checks, you can quickly determine whether there are problems that might prevent your instances from running your applications. Amazon EC2 provides four types of status checks: system, instance, attached EBS, and application. System, instance, and attached EBS status checks are managed by Amazon EC2 and run automatically on every instance. Application status checks are opt-in and monitor the HTTP or HTTPS responses of applications running on your instances. You can view the results of all status checks in the Amazon EC2 console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs.

Status checks are performed every minute, returning a pass or a fail status. If all checks pass, the overall status of the instance is **OK**. If one or more checks fail, the overall status is **impaired**. System, instance, and attached EBS status checks are managed by Amazon EC2 and cannot be disabled or deleted. Application status checks are opt-in; you create, associate, and manage them yourself.

When a status check fails, the corresponding CloudWatch metric for status checks is incremented. For more information, see [Status check metrics](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md#status-check-metrics). You can use these metrics to create CloudWatch alarms that are triggered based on the result of the status checks. For example, you can create an alarm to warn you if status checks fail on a specific instance. For more information, see [Create CloudWatch alarms for Amazon EC2 instances that fail status checks](creating_status_check_alarms.md).

You can also create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance and automatically recovers the instance if it becomes impaired due to an underlying issue. For more information, see [Automatic instance recovery](ec2-instance-recover.md).

## Types of status checks
<a name="types-of-instance-status-checks"></a>

There are four types of status checks.
+ [System status checks](#system-status-checks)
+ [Instance status checks](#instance-status-checks)
+ [Attached EBS status checks](#attached-ebs-status-checks)
+ [Application status checks](#application-status-checks-summary)

### System status checks
<a name="system-status-checks"></a>

System status checks monitor the AWS systems on which your instance runs. These checks detect underlying problems with your instance that require AWS involvement to repair. When a system status check fails, you can choose to wait for AWS to fix the issue, or you can resolve it yourself. For instances backed by Amazon EBS, you can stop and start the instance yourself, which in most cases results in the instance being migrated to a new host. For instances backed by instance store (supported only for Linux instances), you can terminate and replace the instance. Note that instance store volumes are ephemeral and all data is lost when the instance is stopped.

The following are examples of problems that can cause system status checks to fail:
+ Loss of network connectivity
+ Loss of system power
+ Software issues on the physical host
+ Hardware issues on the physical host that impact network reachability

If a system status check fails, we increment the [StatusCheckFailed\_System](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md#status-check-metrics) metric.

**Bare metal instances**
If you perform a restart on a bare metal instance, the system status check might temporarily return a fail status. When the instance becomes available, the system status check should return a pass status.

### Instance status checks
<a name="instance-status-checks"></a>

Instance status checks monitor the software and network connectivity of your individual instance. Amazon EC2 checks the health of the instance by sending an address resolution protocol (ARP) request to the network interface (NIC). These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair. When an instance status check fails, you typically must address the problem yourself (for example, by rebooting the instance or by making instance configuration changes).

**Note**
Recent Linux distributions that use `systemd-networkd` for network configuration might report on health checks differently from earlier distributions. During the boot process, this type of network can start earlier and potentially finish before other startup tasks that can also affect instance health. Status checks that depend on network availability can report a healthy status before other tasks complete.

The following are examples of problems that can cause instance status checks to fail:
+ Failed system status checks
+ Incorrect networking or startup configuration
+ Exhausted memory
+ Corrupted file system
+ Incompatible kernel
+ During a reboot, an instance status check can report a failure until the instance becomes available again.

If an instance status check fails, we increment the [StatusCheckFailed\_Instance](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md#status-check-metrics) metric.

**Bare metal instances**
If you perform a restart on a bare metal instance, the instance status check might temporarily return a fail status. When the instance becomes available, the instance status check should return a pass status.

### Attached EBS status checks
<a name="attached-ebs-status-checks"></a>

Attached EBS status checks monitor if the Amazon EBS volumes attached to an instance are reachable and able to complete I/O operations. The `StatusCheckFailed_AttachedEBS` metric is a binary value that indicates impairment if one or more of the EBS volumes attached to the instance are unable to complete I/O operations. These status checks detect underlying issues with the compute or Amazon EBS infrastructure. When the attached EBS status check metric fails, you can either wait for AWS to resolve the issue, or you can take actions, such as replacing the affected volumes or stopping and restarting the instance.

The following are examples of issues that can cause attached EBS status checks to fail:
+ Hardware or software issues on the storage subsystems underlying the EBS volumes
+ Hardware issues on the physical host that impact reachability of the EBS volumes
+ Connectivity issues between the instance and EBS volumes

You can use the `StatusCheckFailed_AttachedEBS` metric to help improve the resilience of your workload. You can use this metric to create Amazon CloudWatch alarms that are triggered based on the result of the status check. For example, you could fail over to a secondary instance or Availability Zone when you detect a prolonged impact. Alternatively, you can monitor the I/O performance of each attached volume using EBS CloudWatch metrics to detect and replace the impaired volume. If the EBS status check indicates an impairment and your workload isn't driving I/O to attached EBS volumes, stop and start the instance to move it to a new host. This can resolve underlying host issues that are impacting the reachability of the EBS volumes. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/using_cloudwatch_ebs.html).

You can also configure your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups to detect attached EBS status check failures, and then replace the affected instance with a new one. For more information, see [ Monitor and replace Auto Scaling instances with impaired Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/monitor-and-replace-instances-with-impaired-ebs-volumes.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

**Note**
The attached EBS status check metric is available only for Nitro instances.

### Application status checks
<a name="application-status-checks-summary"></a>

Use application status checks to monitor the network reachability and availability of applications running on your Amazon EC2 instances. With application status checks, you can monitor HTTP and HTTPS responses at the application level. Application status checks run only on instances you associate them with.

You configure each application status check to request an HTTP path on your application endpoint and define the response codes that indicate a healthy response.

You can suppress application status checks during application restarts or deployments to avoid false-positive failures during expected downtime. For more information, see [Handling deployment, in-place patching, and replacements](application-status-checks.md#asc-handling-deployment-and-patching).

The following are examples of problems that can cause application status checks to fail:
+ Application process crashed or stopped responding
+ Application returned an HTTP response code indicating an internal application service error or other problem
+ Application port not reachable
+ A software or underlying hardware issue has caused your instance to fail and become unresponsive

If an application status check fails, we increment the `StatusCheckFailed_Application` metric.

For information about configuring application status checks, see [Application status checks](application-status-checks.md).
