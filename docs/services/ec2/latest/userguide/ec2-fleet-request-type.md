# EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet request types

The request type for an EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet determines whether the request is synchronous or
asynchronous, and whether it is a one-time request for the desired target capacity or an
ongoing effort to maintain the capacity over time. When configuring your fleet, you must
specify the request type.

Both EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet offer two request types: `request` and
`maintain`. In addition, EC2 Fleet offers a third request type called
`instant`.

###### Fleet request types

`instant` (EC2 Fleet only)

If you configure the request type as `instant`, EC2 Fleet places a
synchronous one-time request for your desired capacity. In the API response,
it returns the instances that launched and provides errors for those
instances that could not be launched. For more information, see [Configure an EC2 Fleet of type instant](instant-fleet.md).

`request`

If you configure the request type as `request`, the fleet places an
asynchronous one-time request for your desired capacity. If capacity
diminishes due to Spot interruptions, the fleet does not attempt to
replenish Spot Instances, nor does it submit requests in alternative Spot capacity
pools if capacity is unavailable. When creating a Spot Fleet of type
`request` using the console, clear the **Maintain**
**target capacity** checkbox.

`maintain` (default)

If you configure the request type as `maintain`, the fleet places an
asynchronous request for your desired capacity, and maintains it by
automatically replenishing any interrupted Spot Instances. When creating a Spot Fleet of
type `maintain` using the console, select the **Maintain**
**target capacity** checkbox
