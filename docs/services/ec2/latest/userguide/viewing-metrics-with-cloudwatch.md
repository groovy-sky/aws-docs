# CloudWatch metrics that are available for your instances

Amazon EC2 sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or an API to list
the metrics that Amazon EC2 sends to CloudWatch. By default, each data point covers the 5 minutes that
follow the start time of activity for the instance. If you've enabled detailed monitoring,
each data point covers the next minute of activity from the start time. Note that for the
Minimum, Maximum, and Average statistics, the minimum granularity for the metrics that EC2
provides is 1 minute.

For information about how to view the available metrics using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI, see [View available metrics](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/viewing-metrics-with-cloudwatch.md)
in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

For information about getting the statistics for these metrics, see [Statistics for CloudWatch metrics for your instances](monitoring-get-statistics.md).

## Instance metrics

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following instance metrics.

MetricDescriptionUnitMeaningful statistics`CPUUtilization`

The percentage of physical CPU time that Amazon EC2 uses to run the EC2 instance,
which includes time spent to run both the user code and the Amazon EC2 code.

At a very high level, `CPUUtilization` is the sum of guest
`CPUUtilization` and hypervisor `CPUUtilization`.

Tools in your operating system can show a different percentage than CloudWatch due
to factors such as legacy device simulation, configuration of non-legacy devices,
interrupt-heavy workloads, live migration, and live update.

Percent

`DiskReadOps`

Completed read operations from all instance store volumes available to the instance in a specified period of time.

To calculate the average I/O operations per second (IOPS) for the period, divide the total operations in the period
by the number of seconds in that period.

If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported.

`DiskWriteOps`

Completed write operations to all instance store volumes available to the instance in a specified period of time.

To calculate the average I/O operations per second (IOPS) for the period, divide the total operations in the period
by the number of seconds in that period.

If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported.

`DiskReadBytes`

Bytes read from all instance store volumes available to the instance.

This metric is used to determine the volume of the data the application reads from the hard disk of the
instance. This can be used to determine the speed of the application.

The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. If you
are using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find
Bytes/second. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring, divide it by 60. You can
also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME` to find the bytes
per second. For example, if you have graphed `DiskReadBytes` in CloudWatch as
`m1`, the metric math formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns
the metric in bytes/second. For more information about `DIFF_TIME` and
other metric math functions, see [Use metric\
math](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported.

`DiskWriteBytes`

Bytes written to all instance store volumes available to the instance.

This metric is used to determine the volume of the data the application writes onto the hard disk of the
instance. This can be used to determine the speed of the application.

The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. If you
are using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find
Bytes/second. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring, divide it by 60. You can
also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME` to find the bytes
per second. For example, if you have graphed `DiskWriteBytes` in CloudWatch
as `m1`, the metric math formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))`
returns the metric in bytes/second. For more information about
`DIFF_TIME` and other metric math functions, see [Use metric\
math](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported.

`MetadataNoToken`

The number of times the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) was successfully accessed using a
method that does not use a token.

This metric is used to determine if there are any processes accessing instance
metadata that are using Instance Metadata Service Version 1 (IMDSv1), which does not use a
token. If all requests use token-backed sessions, i.e., Instance Metadata Service Version 2
(IMDSv2), the value is 0. For more information, see [Transition to using Instance Metadata Service Version 2](instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2.md).

Count

- Sum

- Percentiles

`MetadataNoTokenRejected`

The number of times an IMDSv1 call was attempted after IMDSv1
was disabled.

If this metric appears, it indicates that an IMDSv1 call was attempted
and rejected. You can either re-enable IMDSv1 or make sure all of your
calls use IMDSv2. For more information, see [Transition to using Instance Metadata Service Version 2](instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2.md).

Count

`NetworkIn`

The number of bytes received by the instance on all network interfaces. This
metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to a
single instance.

The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. If you
are using basic (5-minute) monitoring and the statistic is Sum, you can divide
this number by 300 to find Bytes/second. If you have detailed (1-minute)
monitoring and the statistic is Sum, divide it by 60.

## Accelerator metrics

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following accelerator metric for your
[accelerated computing instances](../instancetypes/ac.md). Only supported on a subset of accelerated
computing instance types.

## CPU credit metrics

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following CPU credit metrics for your
[burstable performance instances](burstable-performance-instances.md).

MetricDescriptionUnitMeaningful statistics`CPUCreditUsage`

The number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU
utilization. One CPU credit equals one vCPU running at 100%
utilization for one minute or an equivalent combination of vCPUs,
utilization, and time (for example, one vCPU running at 50%
utilization for two minutes or two vCPUs running at 25% utilization
for two minutes).

CPU credit metrics are available at a 5-minute frequency only. If you specify
a period greater than five minutes, use the `Sum` statistic instead of
the `Average` statistic.

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

- Sum

- Average

- Minimum

- Maximum

`CPUCreditBalance`

The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has
accrued since it was launched or started. For T2 Standard, the
`CPUCreditBalance` also includes the number of launch
credits that have been accrued.

Credits are accrued in the credit balance after they are earned, and
removed from the credit balance when they are spent. The credit balance
has a maximum limit, determined by the instance size. After the limit is
reached, any new credits that are earned are discarded. For T2 Standard,
launch credits do not count towards the limit.

The credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` are available for the
instance to spend to burst beyond its baseline CPU utilization.

When an instance is running, credits in the `CPUCreditBalance`
do not expire. When a T3 or T3a instance stops, the
`CPUCreditBalance` value persists for seven days.
Thereafter, all accrued credits are lost. When a T2 instance stops, the
`CPUCreditBalance` value does not persist, and all accrued
credits are lost.

CPU credit metrics are available at a 5-minute frequency only.

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

- Sum

- Average

- Minimum

- Maximum

`CPUSurplusCreditBalance`

The number of surplus credits that have been spent by an
`unlimited` instance when its `CPUCreditBalance` value is
zero.

The `CPUSurplusCreditBalance` value is paid down by earned CPU
credits. If the number of surplus credits exceeds the maximum number of
credits that the instance can earn in a 24-hour period, the spent surplus
credits above the maximum incur an additional charge.

CPU credit metrics are available at a 5-minute frequency only.

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

- Sum

- Average

- Minimum

- Maximum

`CPUSurplusCreditsCharged`

The number of spent surplus credits that are
not paid down by earned CPU credits, and which thus incur an additional
charge.

Spent surplus credits are charged when any of the following occurs:

- The spent surplus credits exceed the maximum number of credits that
the instance can earn in a 24-hour period. Spent surplus credits
above the maximum are charged at the end of the hour.

- The instance is stopped or terminated.

- The instance is switched from `unlimited` to `standard`.

CPU credit metrics are available at a 5-minute frequency only.

Credits (vCPU-minutes)

- Sum

## Amazon EBS metrics for Nitro-based instances

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes additional Amazon EBS metrics for volumes
that are attached to Nitro-based instances that are not bare metal instances.

MetricDescriptionUnitMeaningful statistics`InstanceEBSIOPSExceededCheck`

EBS IOPS limits for the instance within the last minute. This metric can be either
`0` (IOPS not exceeded) or `1` (IOPS exceeded).

None

- Sum

- Average

- Minimum

- Maximum

`InstanceEBSThroughputExceededCheck`

Reports whether an application attempted to drive throughput that exceeds the maximum
EBS throughput limits for the instance within the last minute. This metric can be either
`0` (throughput not exceeded) or `1` (throughput exceeded).

None

- Sum

- Average

- Minimum

- Maximum

`EBSReadOps`

Completed read operations from all Amazon EBS volumes attached to the
instance in a specified period of time.

To calculate the average read I/O operations per second (Read IOPS) for the
period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that
period. If you are using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can divide this number
by 300 to calculate the Read IOPS. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring,
divide it by 60. You can also use the CloudWatch metric math function
`DIFF_TIME` to find the operations per second. For example, if you
have graphed `EBSReadOps` in CloudWatch as `m1`, the metric math
formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns the metric in operations/second.
For more information about `DIFF_TIME` and other metric math functions,
see [Use metric\
math](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

`EBSWriteOps`

Completed write operations to all EBS
volumes attached to the instance in a specified period of time.

To calculate the average write I/O operations per second (Write IOPS) for the
period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that
period. If you are using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can divide this number
by 300 to calculate the Write IOPS. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring,
divide it by 60. You can also use the CloudWatch metric math function
`DIFF_TIME` to find the operations per second. For example, if you
have graphed `EBSWriteOps` in CloudWatch as `m1`, the metric math
formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns the metric in operations/second.

using basic (5-minute) monitoring, you can divide this number by 300 to find Read
Bytes/second. If you have detailed (1-minute) monitoring, divide it by 60. You can
also use the CloudWatch metric math function `DIFF_TIME` to find the bytes
per second. For example, if you have graphed `EBSReadBytes` in CloudWatch as
`m1`, the metric math formula `m1/(DIFF_TIME(m1))` returns
the metric in bytes/second. For more information about `DIFF_TIME` and

By default, status check metrics are available at a 1-minute frequency at no charge.
For a newly-launched instance, status check metric data is only available after the
instance has completed the initialization state (within a few minutes of the instance
entering the `running` state). For more information about EC2 status checks,
see [Status checks for Amazon EC2 instances](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md).

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes the following status check metrics.

## Traffic mirroring metrics

The `AWS/EC2` namespace includes metrics for mirrored traffic. For more
information, see [Monitor mirrored traffic using Amazon CloudWatch](../../../vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirror-cloudwatch.md) in the
_Amazon VPC Traffic Mirroring Guide_.

## Auto Scaling group metrics

The `AWS/AutoScaling` namespace includes metrics for Auto Scaling groups. For more
information, see [Monitor CloudWatch metrics for your Auto Scaling groups and instances](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-cloudwatch-monitoring.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

## Amazon EC2 metric dimensions

You can use the following dimensions to refine the metrics listed in the previous tables.

DimensionDescription`AutoScalingGroupName`

This dimension filters the data you request for all instances in a specified
capacity group. An _Auto Scaling group_ is a collection of
instances you define if you're using Auto Scaling. This
dimension is available only for Amazon EC2 metrics when the instances are in such an
Auto Scaling group. Available for instances with Detailed or Basic Monitoring enabled.

`ImageId`

This dimension filters the data you request for all instances running this Amazon EC2
Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Available for instances with Detailed Monitoring enabled.

`InstanceId`

This dimension filters the data you request for the identified instance only.
This helps you pinpoint an exact instance from which to monitor data.

`InstanceType`

This dimension filters the data you request for all instances running with
this specified instance type. This helps you categorize your data by the
type of instance running. For example, you might compare data from an m1.small
instance and an m1.large instance to determine which has the better business
value for your application. Available for instances with Detailed Monitoring enabled.

## Amazon EC2 usage metrics

You can use CloudWatch usage metrics to provide visibility into your account's usage of resources. Use these metrics to visualize your
current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards.

Amazon EC2 usage metrics correspond to AWS service quotas. You can configure alarms that
alert you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information about CloudWatch
integration with service quotas, see [AWS usage metrics](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-service-quota-integration.md)
in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

Amazon EC2 publishes the following metrics in the `AWS/Usage` namespace.

MetricDescription

`ResourceCount`

The number of the specified resources running in your account. The resources are defined by the dimensions
associated with the metric.

The most useful statistic for this metric is `MAXIMUM`, which represents the maximum number of resources used
during the 1-minute period.

The following dimensions are used to refine the usage metrics that are published by Amazon EC2.

DimensionDescription`Service`

The name of the AWS service containing the resource. For Amazon EC2 usage metrics, the value for this dimension is `EC2`.

`Type`

The type of entity that is being reported. Currently, the only valid value for Amazon EC2 usage metrics is `Resource`.

`Resource`

The type of resource that is running. Currently, the only valid value for Amazon EC2 usage metrics is `vCPU`, which returns information
on instances that are running.

`Class`

The class of resource being tracked. For Amazon EC2 usage metrics with `vCPU` as the value of the `Resource`
dimension, the valid values are `Standard/OnDemand`, `F/OnDemand`, `G/OnDemand`,
`Inf/OnDemand`, `P/OnDemand`, and `X/OnDemand`.

The values for this dimension define the first letter of the instance types that are reported by the metric. For example,
`Standard/OnDemand` returns information about all running instances with types that start with A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, and Z, and
`G/OnDemand` returns information about all running instances with types that start with G.
