# Verify that an Amazon EC2 instance is enabled for NitroTPM
<a name="verify-nitrotpm-support-on-instance"></a>

You can verify whether an Amazon EC2 instance is enabled for NitroTPM. If NitroTPM support is enabled on the instance, the command returns `"v2.0"`. Otherwise, the `TpmSupport` field is not present in the output.

The Amazon EC2 console does not display the `TpmSupport` field.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To verify whether an instance is enabled for NitroTPM**
Use the [describe-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) command.

```
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --instance-ids {{i-1234567890abcdef0}} \
    --query Reservations[].Instances[].TpmSupport
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To verify whether an instance is enabled for NitroTPM**
Use the [Get-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet.

```
(Get-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId {{i-1234567890abcdef0}}).Instances.TpmSupport
```

## Verify NitroTPM access on your Windows instance
<a name="verify-nitrotpm-support-windows-instance"></a>

**(Windows instances only) To verify whether the NitroTPM is accessible to Windows**

1. [Connect to your EC2 Windows instance](connecting_to_windows_instance.md).

1. On the instance, run the tpm.msc program.

   The **TPM Management on Local Computer** window opens.

1. Check the **TPM Manufacturer Information** field. It contains the manufacturer's name and the version of the NitroTPM on the instance.
