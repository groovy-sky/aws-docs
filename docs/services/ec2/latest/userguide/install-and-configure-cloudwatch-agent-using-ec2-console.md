# Install and configure the CloudWatch agent using the Amazon EC2 console to add additional metrics

Installing and configuring the CloudWatch agent using the Amazon EC2 console is in beta for
Amazon EC2 and is subject to change.

By default, Amazon CloudWatch provides basic metrics, such as `CPUUtilization` and
`NetworkIn`, for monitoring your Amazon EC2 instances. To collect additional metrics,
you can install the CloudWatch agent on your EC2 instances, and then configure the agent to emit
selected metrics. Instead of manually installing and configuring the CloudWatch agent on every EC2
instance, you can use the Amazon EC2 console to do this for you.

You can use the Amazon EC2 console to install the CloudWatch agent on your instances and configure
the agent to emit selected metrics.

Alternatively, to complete this process manually, see [Installing the CloudWatch agent](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/install-cloudwatch-agent-on-ec2-instance.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_. For
more information about the CloudWatch agent, see [Collect metrics, logs, and traces using the CloudWatch agent](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/install-cloudwatch-agent.md).

## Prerequisites

To use Amazon EC2 to install and configure the CloudWatch agent, you must meet the user and
instance prerequisites described in this section.

###### Tip

This feature is not available in all AWS Regions. If the menu item described
in the installation procedure on this page does not exist in the Amazon EC2 console and
you are flexible about where your instances run, try another Region. Otherwise, you
can use the manual directions in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_ to install
and configure the agent.

###### User prerequisites

To use this feature, your IAM console user or role must have the permissions
required for using Amazon EC2 and the following IAM permissions:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:GetParameter",
                "ssm:PutParameter"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/EC2-Custom-Metrics-*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:SendCommand",
                "ssm:ListCommandInvocations",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetInstanceProfile",
                "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Instance prerequisites

- Instance state: `running`

- Supported operating system: Linux

- AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent): Installed. Two notes about SSM Agent:

- SSM Agent is preinstalled on some Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) provided by AWS and
trusted third-parties. For information about the supported AMIs and the
instructions for installing SSM Agent, see [Amazon Machine\
Images (AMIs) with SSM Agent preinstalled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ami-preinstalled-agent.html) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

- If you experience issues with the SSM Agent, see [Troubleshooting SSM Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-ssm-agent.html) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

- IAM permissions for the instance: The following AWS managed policies must be
added to an IAM role that is attached to the instance:

- [AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore.html) – Enables an instance to use Systems
Manager to install and configure the CloudWatch agent.

- [CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy.html) – Enables an instance to use the CloudWatch
agent to write data to CloudWatch.

For information about how to add IAM permissions to your instance, see [Use\
instance profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## How it works

Before you can use the Amazon EC2 console to install and configure the CloudWatch agent, you must
make sure that your IAM user or role, and the instances on which you want to add metrics,
meet certain prerequisites. Then, you can use the Amazon EC2 console to install and configure the
CloudWatch agent on your selected instances.

###### First meet the [prerequisites](\#install-and-configure-cw-agent-prerequisites)

- **You need the required IAM permissions** –
Before you get started, make sure that your console user or role has the required IAM
permissions to use this feature.

- **Instances** – To use the feature, your EC2
instances must be Linux instances, have the SSM Agent installed, have the required IAM
permissions, and be running.

###### Then you can [use the feature](\#install-and-configure-cw-agent-procedure)

1. **Select your instances** – In the Amazon EC2
    console, you select the instances on which to install and configure the CloudWatch agent. You
    then start the process by choosing **Configure CloudWatch agent**.

2. **Validate SSM Agent** – Amazon EC2 checks that the
    SSM Agent is installed and started on each instance. Any instances that fail this check
    are excluded from the process. The SSM Agent is used for performing actions on the
    instance during this process.

3. **Validate IAM permissions** – Amazon EC2 checks that
    each instance has the required IAM permissions for this process. Any instances that fail
    this check are excluded from the process. The IAM permissions enable the CloudWatch agent to
    collect metrics from the instance and integrate with AWS Systems Manager to use the SSM
    Agent.

4. **Validate CloudWatch agent** – Amazon EC2 checks that the
    CloudWatch agent is installed and running on each instance. If any instances fail this check,
    Amazon EC2 offers to install and start the CloudWatch agent for you. The CloudWatch agent will collect
    the selected metrics on each instance once this process is completed.

5. **Select metric configuration** – You select the
    metrics for the CloudWatch agent to emit from your instances. Once selected, Amazon EC2 stores a
    configuration file in Parameter Store, where it remains until the process is completed.
    Amazon EC2 will delete the configuration file from Parameter Store unless the process is
    interrupted. Note that if you don't select a metric, but you previously added it to your
    instance, it will be removed from your instance when this process is completed.

6. **Update CloudWatch agent configuration** – Amazon EC2
    sends the metric configuration to the CloudWatch agent. This is the last step in the process.
    If it succeeds, your instances can emit data for the selected metrics and Amazon EC2 deletes
    the configuration file from Parameter Store.

## Costs

Additional metrics that you add during this process are billed as custom metrics. For
more information about CloudWatch metrics pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

## Install and configure the CloudWatch agent

You can use the Amazon EC2 console to install and configure the CloudWatch agent to add additional
metrics.

###### Note

Every time you perform this procedure, you overwrite the existing CloudWatch agent
configuration. If you don't select a metric that was selected previously, it will be
removed from the instance.

###### To install and configure the CloudWatch agent using the Amazon EC2 console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instances on which to install and configure the CloudWatch agent.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Monitor and troubleshoot**,
    **Configure CloudWatch agent**.

5. For each step in the process, read the console text, and then choose
    **Next**.

6. To complete the process, in the final step, choose
    **Complete**.

###### To update the agent configuration created by the Amazon EC2 console

You can manually customize the configuration that the EC2 console created. For more
information, see [Manually create or edit the CloudWatch agent configuration file](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-details.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.
