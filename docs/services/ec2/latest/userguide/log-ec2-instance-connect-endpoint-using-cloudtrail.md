# Log connections established over EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

You can log resource operations and audit connections established over the
EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint with AWS CloudTrail logs.

For more information about using AWS CloudTrail with Amazon EC2, see [Log Amazon EC2 API calls using AWS CloudTrail](monitor-with-cloudtrail.md).

## Log EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint API calls with AWS CloudTrail

EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint resource operations are logged to CloudTrail as management events. When
the following API calls are made, the activity is recorded as a CloudTrail event in
**Event history**:

- `CreateInstanceConnectEndpoint`

- `DescribeInstanceConnectEndpoints`

- `DeleteInstanceConnectEndpoint`

You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more
information, see [Viewing events\
with CloudTrail Event history](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.md) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

## Use AWS CloudTrail to audit users who connect to an instance using EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

Connection attempts to instances via EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint are logged in CloudTrail in
**Event history**. When a connection to an instance is
initiated through an EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint, the connection is logged as a CloudTrail management
event with the `eventName` of `OpenTunnel`.

You can create Amazon EventBridge rules that route the CloudTrail event to a target. For more
information, see the [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.md).

The following is an example of an `OpenTunnel` management event that
was logged in CloudTrail.
