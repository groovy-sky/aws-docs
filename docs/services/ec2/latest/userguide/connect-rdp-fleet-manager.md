# Connect to your Windows instance using Fleet Manager
<a name="connect-rdp-fleet-manager"></a>

You can use Fleet Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to connect to Windows instances using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and display up to four Windows instances on the same page in the AWS Management Console. You can connect to the first instance in the Fleet Manager Remote Desktop directly from the **Instances** page in the Amazon EC2 console. For more information about Fleet Manager, see [Connect to a managed instance using Remote Desktop](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/fleet-manager-remote-desktop-connections.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*.

You do not need to specifically allow incoming RDP traffic from your IP address if you use Fleet Manager to connect. Fleet Manager handles that for you.

**Prerequisites**
Before attempting to connect to an instance using Fleet Manager, you must set up your environment. For more information, see [Setting up your environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/fleet-manager-remote-desktop-connections.html#rdp-prerequisites) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*.
