# Cancel a Capacity Reservation Fleet
<a name="cancel-crfleet"></a>

When you no longer need a Capacity Reservation Fleet and the capacity it reserves, you can cancel it. When you cancel a Fleet, its status changes to `cancelled` and it can no longer create new Capacity Reservations. Additionally, all of the individual Capacity Reservations in the Fleet are canceled. The instances that were previously running in the reserved capacity continue to run normally in the shared capacity.

#### [ AWS CLI ]
