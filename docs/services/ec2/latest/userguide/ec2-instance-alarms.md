# Manage CloudWatch alarms for your EC2 instances in the Amazon EC2 console

From the **Instances** screen in the Amazon EC2 console, you can manage the
Amazon CloudWatch alarms for your instances. In the **Instances** table, the
**Alarm status** column provides two console controls: a control for
viewing alarms, and another for creating or editing them. The following screenshot indicates
these console controls, numbered **1** ( **View alarms**) and
**2** (a **+** sign for creating or editing an
alarm).
