# Manage Amazon EC2 instances scheduled for maintenance

When AWS must maintain the underlying host for an instance, it schedules the
instance for maintenance. There are two types of maintenance events: network
maintenance and power maintenance.

- During network maintenance, scheduled instances lose network connectivity
for a brief period of time. Normal network connectivity to your instance is
restored after maintenance is complete.

- During power maintenance, scheduled instances are taken offline for a
brief period, and then rebooted. When a reboot is performed, all of your
instance's configuration settings are retained.

After your instance has rebooted (this normally takes a few minutes), verify that
your application is working as expected. At this point, your instance should no
longer have a scheduled event associated with it, or if it does, the description of
the scheduled event begins with **\[Completed\]**. It sometimes takes
up to 1 hour for the instance status description to refresh. Completed maintenance
events are displayed on the Amazon EC2 console dashboard for up to a week.

## Actions you can take

###### Actions you can take for instances with an EBS root volume

When you receive a `system-maintenance` event notification, you
can take one of the following actions:

- **Wait for scheduled maintenance:** You
can wait for the maintenance to occur as scheduled.

- **Perform manual stop and stop:** You can
stop and start the instance, which migrates it to a new host. This is
not the same as rebooting the instance. For more information, see [Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances](stop-start.md).

- **Automate stop and start:** You can
automate an immediate stop and start in response to a scheduled
maintenance event. For more information, see [Running\
operations on EC2 instances automatically in response to events in\
AWS Health](../../../health/latest/ug/automating-instance-actions.md) in the _AWS Health User Guide_.

###### Actions you can take for instances with an instance store root volume

When you receive a `system-maintenance` event notification, you
can take one of the following actions:

- **Wait for scheduled maintenance:** You
can wait for the maintenance to occur as scheduled.

- **Launch a replacement instance:** If you
want to maintain normal operation during the scheduled maintenance
window:

1. Launch a replacement instance from your most recent
    AMI.

2. Migrate all necessary data to the replacement instance before
    the scheduled maintenance window.

3. Terminate the original instance.
