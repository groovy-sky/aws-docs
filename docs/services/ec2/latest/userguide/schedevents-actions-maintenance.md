# Manage Amazon EC2 instances scheduled for maintenance
<a name="schedevents_actions_maintenance"></a>

When AWS must maintain the underlying host for an instance, it schedules the instance for maintenance. There are two types of maintenance events: network maintenance and power maintenance.
+ During network maintenance, scheduled instances lose network connectivity for a brief period of time. Normal network connectivity to your instance is restored after maintenance is complete.
+ During power maintenance, scheduled instances are taken offline for a brief period, and then rebooted. When a reboot is performed, all of your instance's configuration settings are retained.

After your instance has rebooted (this normally takes a few minutes), verify that your application is working as expected. At this point, your instance should no longer have a scheduled event associated with it, or if it does, the description of the scheduled event begins with **[Completed]**. It sometimes takes up to 1 hour for the instance status description to refresh. Completed maintenance events are displayed on the Amazon EC2 console dashboard for up to a week.

## Actions you can take

**Actions you can take for instances with an EBS root volume**

When you receive a `system-maintenance` event notification, you can take one of the following actions:
+ **Wait for scheduled maintenance:** You can wait for the maintenance to occur as scheduled.
+ **Perform manual stop and stop:** You can stop and start the instance, which migrates it to a new host. This is not the same as rebooting the instance. For more information, see [Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances](Stop_Start.md).
+ **Automate stop and start:** You can automate an immediate stop and start in response to a scheduled maintenance event. For more information, see [Running operations on EC2 instances automatically in response to events in AWS Health](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/automating-instance-actions.html) in the *AWS Health User Guide*.

**Actions you can take for instances with an instance store root volume**

When you receive a `system-maintenance` event notification, you can take one of the following actions:
+ **Wait for scheduled maintenance:** You can wait for the maintenance to occur as scheduled.
+ **Launch a replacement instance:** If you want to maintain normal operation during the scheduled maintenance window:

  1. Launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI.

  1. Migrate all necessary data to the replacement instance before the scheduled maintenance window.

  1. Terminate the original instance.
