# Enable or stop using NitroTPM on an Amazon EC2 instance

You can enable an Amazon EC2 instance for NitroTPM only at launch. Once an instance is enabled
for NitroTPM, you can't disable it. If you no longer need to use NitroTPM, you must configure
the operating system to stop using it.

## Launch an instance with NitroTPM enabled

When you launch an instance with the [prerequisites](enable-nitrotpm-prerequisites.md), NitroTPM is automatically enabled on the instance. You can enable
NitroTPM on an instance only at launch. For information about launching an instance, see
[Launch an Amazon EC2 instance](launchingandusinginstances.md).

## Stop using NitroTPM on an instance

After launching an instance with NitroTPM enabled, you can't disable NitroTPM for the
instance. However, you can configure the operating system to stop using NitroTPM by
disabling the TPM 2.0 device driver on the instance by using the following tools:

- For **Linux instances**, use tpm-tools.

- For **Windows instances**, use the TPM management console (tpm.msc).

For more information about disabling the device driver, see the documentation for your operating system.
