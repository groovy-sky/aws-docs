# Prerequisites for BYOIP in Amazon EC2

The onboarding process for BYOIP has two phases, for which you must perform three
steps. These steps correspond to the steps depicted in the following diagram. We include
manual steps in this documentation, but your RIR might offer managed services to help
you with these steps.

###### Tip

The tasks in this section require a Linux terminal and may be performed using Linux,
the [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html), or the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

- [Create a private key and generate an X.509 certificate](#byoip-certificate)

- [Upload the X.509 certificate to the RDAP record in your RIR](#byoip-add-certificate)

- [Create a ROA object in your RIR](#byoip-create-roa-object)

## Overview

###### Preparation phase

\[1\] [Create a private key](#byoip-certificate) and use it to
generate a self-signed X.509 certificate for authentication purposes. This certificate
is only used during the provisioning phase. You can remove the certificate from your
RIR's record after provisioning is complete

**RIR configuration phase**

\[2\] [Upload the self-signed certificate](#byoip-add-certificate) to
your RDAP record comments.

\[3\] [Create a ROA object](#byoip-create-roa-object) in your RIR. The
ROA defines the desired address range, the Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) allowed to
advertise the address range, and an expiration date to register with the Resource Public
Key Infrastructure (RPKI) of your RIR.

###### Note

A ROA is not required for non-publicly advertisable IPv6 address space.

![The 3-step onboarding process for BYOIP.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/byoip-preonboarding.png)

To bring on multiple non-contiguous address ranges, you must repeat this process with
each address range. However, the preparation and RIR configuration steps don't need to
be repeated if splitting a contiguous block across several different AWS Regions.

Bringing on an address range has no effect on any address ranges that you brought on
previously.

## Create a private key and generate an X.509 certificate

Use the following procedure to create a self-signed X.509 certificate and add it
to the RDAP record for your RIR. This key pair is used to authenticate the address
range with the RIR. The **openssl** commands require OpenSSL version
1.0.2 or later.

Copy the following commands and replace only the placeholder values (in colored
italic text).

This procedure follows the best practice of encrypting your private RSA key
and requiring a passphrase to access it.

1. Generate an RSA 2048-bit private key as shown in the following.

```nohighlight

$ openssl genpkey -aes256 -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out private-key.pem
```

The `-aes256` parameter specifies the algorithm used to encrypt
    the private key. The command returns the following output, including prompts
    to set a passphrase:

```nohighlight

......+++
.+++
Enter PEM pass phrase: xxxxxxx
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: xxxxxxx
```

You can inspect the key using the following command:

```nohighlight

$ openssl pkey -in private-key.pem -text
```

This returns a passphrase prompt and the contents of the key, which should
    be similar to the following:

```nohighlight

Enter pass phrase for private-key.pem: xxxxxxx

Keep your private key in a secure location when it is not in use.

2. Generate an X.509 certificate using the private key created in the
    previous step. In this example, the certificate expires in 365 days, after
    which time it cannot be trusted. Be sure to set the expiration
    appropriately. The certificate must only be valid for the duration of the provisioning process. You can remove the certificate from your RIR's record after provisioning is complete. The `tr -d "\n"` command strips newline characters
    (line breaks) from the output. You need to provide a Common Name when
    prompted, but the other fields can be left blank.

```nohighlight

$ openssl req -new -x509 -key private-key.pem -days 365 | tr -d "\n" > certificate.pem
```

This results in output similar to the following:

```nohighlight

Enter pass phrase for private-key.pem: xxxxxxx
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
   -----
Country Name (2 letter code) []:
State or Province Name (full name) []:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) []:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:example.com
Email Address []:
```

###### Note

The Common Name is not needed for AWS provisioning. It can be any
internal or public domain name.

You can inspect the certificate with the following command:

```nohighlight

$ cat certificate.pem
```

The output should be a long, PEM-encoded string without line breaks,
    prefaced by `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and followed by
    `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`.

## Upload the X.509 certificate to the RDAP record in your RIR

Add the certificate that you previously created to the RDAP record for your RIR.
Be sure to include the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END
                    CERTIFICATE-----` strings before and after the encoded portion. All of
this content must be on a single, long line. The procedure for updating RDAP depends
on your RIR:

- For ARIN, use the [Account Manager\
portal](https://account.arin.net/public/secure/dashboard) to add the certificate in the "Public Comments" section
for the "Network Information" object representing your address range. Do not
add it to the comments section for your organization.

- For RIPE, add the certificate as a new "descr" field to the "inetnum" or
"inet6num" object representing your address range. These can usually be
found in the "My Resources" section of the [RIPE\
Database portal](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/myresources/overview). Do not add it to the comments section for your
organization or the "remarks" field of the above objects.

- For APNIC, add the certificate by editing remarks on the "inetnum" or
"inet6num" record.

You can remove the certificate from your RIR's record after the provisioning stage
below has been completed.

## Create a ROA object in your RIR

Create a ROA object to authorize the Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618 to advertise your
address range, as well as the ASNs that are currently authorized to advertise the
address range. For the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, authorize ASN 8987 instead of 16509
and 14618. You must set the maximum length to the size of the CIDR that you are
bringing in. The most specific IPv4 prefix you can bring is /24. The most specific
IPv6 address range that you can bring is /48 for CIDRs that are publicly
advertisable and /60 for CIDRs that are not publicly advertisable.

###### Important

If you are creating a ROA object for Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM),
when you create the ROAs, for IPv4 CIDRs you must set the maximum length of an
IP address prefix to `/24`. For IPv6 CIDRs, if you are adding them to
an advertisable pool, the maximum length of an IP address prefix must be
`/48`. This ensures that you have full flexibility to divide your
public IP address across AWS Regions. IPAM enforces the maximum length you
set. For more information about BYOIP addresses to IPAM, see [Tutorial: BYOIP address CIDRs to IPAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-byoip-ipam.html) in the
_Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide_.

It might take up to 24 hours for the ROA to become available to Amazon. For more
information, consult your RIR:

- ARIN — [ROA\
Requests](https://www.arin.net/resources/rpki/roarequest.html)

- RIPE — [Managing ROAs](https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/rpki/resource-certification-roa-management)

- APNIC — [Route Management](https://www.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/route-roa-management-guide.pdf)

When you migrate advertisements from an on-premises workload to AWS, you must
create a ROA for your existing ASN before creating the ROAs for Amazon's ASNs.
Otherwise, you might see an impact to your existing routing and
advertisements.

###### Important

For Amazon to advertise and continue advertising your IP address range, your
ROAs with Amazon ASNs must be compliant with the above guidelines. If your ROAs
are invalid or not compliant with the above guidelines, Amazon reserves the right to stop advertising your IP address
range.

###### Note

This step is not required for non-publicly advertisable IPv6 address
space.
