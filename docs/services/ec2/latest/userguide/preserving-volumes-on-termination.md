# Preserve data when an instance is terminated

When an Amazon EC2 instance is terminated, you can preserve the data on your instance store
volumes or Amazon EBS volumes. This topic explains how to ensure your data persists beyond
instance termination.

## How instance termination affects root and data volumes

###### Instance store volumes

When an instance is terminated, the instance store volumes are automatically
deleted and the data is lost. To preserve this data beyond the lifetime of the
instance, before terminating the instance, manually copy the data to persistent
storage, such as an Amazon EBS volume, an Amazon S3 bucket, or an Amazon EFS file system. For
more information, see [Storage options for your Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Storage.html).

###### Amazon EBS volumes

When an instance is terminated, the EBS volumes are either deleted or
preserved, depending on the value of the `DeleteOnTermination`
attribute for each volume:

- **Yes** (console) / `true` (CLI) – The
volume is deleted when the instance is terminated.

- **No** (console) / `false` (CLI) – The
volume is preserved when the instance is terminated. Preserved volumes
continue to incur charges.

###### Note

After an instance terminates, you can take a snapshot of the preserved
volume or attach it to another instance. To avoid incurring charges, you
must delete the volume.

## Default deletion behavior for EBS volumes

The default `DeleteOnTermination` value differs depending on the volume
type, whether the volume was attached at launch or after, and the method (console or
CLI) used to attach the volume:

## Check volume persistence settings

The default value at launch for an EBS volume is determined by the
`DeleteOnTermination` attribute set on the AMI. You can change the
value at instance launch, overriding the AMI setting. We recommend that you verify
the default setting for the `DeleteOnTermination` attribute after you
launch an instance.

###### To check if an Amazon EBS volume will be deleted on instance termination

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance.

4. Choose the **Storage** tab.

5. Under **Block devices**, scroll right to check the
    **Delete on termination** column.

- If **Yes**, the volume is deleted when the
instance is terminated.

- If **No**, the volume is not be deleted when the
instance is terminated. Any volumes not deleted continue to incur
charges.

## Change the root volume to persist at launch

You can change the `DeleteOnTermination` attribute of an EBS root
volume when you launch an instance. You can also use the following procedure for a
data volume.

Console

###### To change the root volume of an instance to persist at launch

1. Follow the procedure to [launch an\
    instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md), but don't launch the instance until you've
    completed the following steps to change the root volume to
    persist.

2. On the **Configure storage** pane, choose
    **Advanced**.

3. Under **EBS volumes**, expand the root volume
    information.

4. For **Delete on termination**, choose
    **No**.

5. In the **Summary** panel, review your
    instance configuration, and then choose **Launch**
**instance**. For more information, see [Launch an EC2 instance using the launch instance wizard in the console](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md).

AWS CLI

###### To change the root volume of an instance to persist at launch

Use the [run-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command to change the value of
`DeleteOnTermination` in the block device
mapping.

Add the `--block-device-mappings` option:

```nohighlight

--block-device-mappings file://mapping.json
```

In `mapping.json`, specify the device name, for
example `/dev/sda1` or `/dev/xvda`, and for
`DeleteOnTermination`, specify `false`.

```json

[
  {
    "DeviceName": "device_name",
    "Ebs": {
      "DeleteOnTermination": false
    }
  }
]
```

PowerShell

###### To change the root volume of an instance to persist at launch

Use the [New-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet to change the value of
`DeleteOnTermination` in the block device
mapping.

Add the `-BlockDeviceMapping` option:

```nohighlight

-BlockDeviceMapping $bdm
```

In `bdm`, specify the device name, for example
`/dev/sda1` or `/dev/xvda`, and for
`DeleteOnTermination`, specify `false`.

```powershell

$ebd = New-Object -TypeName Amazon.EC2.Model.EbsBlockDevice
$ebd.DeleteOnTermination = false
$bdm = New-Object -TypeName Amazon.EC2.Model.BlockDeviceMapping
$bdm.DeviceName = "/dev/sda1"
$bdm.Ebs = $ebd
```

## Change the root volume of a running instance to persist

You can change the EBS root volume of a running instance to persist. You can also
use the following procedure for a data volume.

AWS CLI

###### To change the root volume to persist

Use the [modify-instance-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0  \
    --block-device-mappings file://mapping.json
```

In `mapping.json`, specify the device name, for
example `/dev/sda1` or `/dev/xvda`, and for
`--DeleteOnTermination`, specify
`false`.

```json

[
  {
    "DeviceName": "device_name",
    "Ebs": {
      "DeleteOnTermination": false
    }
  }
]
```

PowerShell

###### To change the root volume to persist

Use the [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute.html) cmdlet.

Add the `-BlockDeviceMapping` option:

```nohighlight

-BlockDeviceMapping $bdm
```

In `bdm`, specify the device name, for example
`/dev/sda1` or `/dev/xvda`, and for
`DeleteOnTermination`, specify `false`.

```powershell

$ebd = New-Object -TypeName Amazon.EC2.Model.EbsBlockDevice
$ebd.DeleteOnTermination = false
$bdm = New-Object -TypeName Amazon.EC2.Model.BlockDeviceMapping
$bdm.DeviceName = "/dev/sda1"
$bdm.Ebs = $ebd
```
