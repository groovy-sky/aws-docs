# View the state of a Capacity Reservation

Amazon EC2 constantly monitors the state of your Capacity Reservations.

Due to the [eventual consistency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) model followed by the Amazon EC2 API, after you create a Capacity Reservation,
it can take up to 5 minutes for the state of the Capacity Reservation to reflect that it is `active`.
During this time, the Capacity Reservation might remain in the `pending` state. However, it
might already be available for use, in which case attempts to launch instances into the Capacity Reservation
would succeed.

Console

###### To view your Capacity Reservations

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Capacity Reservations**.

3. Select the Capacity Reservation.

AWS CLI

###### To describe your Capacity Reservations

Use the [describe-capacity-reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-capacity-reservations.html) command.

For example, the following command describes all Capacity Reservations.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-capacity-reservations
```

The following is example output.

```json

    "CapacityReservations": [
        {
            "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE",
