# Install NVIDIA gaming drivers (G7e, G6, G6e, G5, and G4dn instances)
<a name="nvidia-gaming-driver"></a>

These drivers are available to AWS customers only. By downloading them, you agree to use the downloaded software only to develop AMIs for use with the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, NVIDIA L4, NVIDIA L40S, NVIDIA A10G, NVIDIA Tesla T4, or NVIDIA Tesla M60 hardware. You can use the GRID drivers to both create and use AMIs within the AWS environment. Upon installation of the software, you are bound by the terms of the [NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement](https://aws-nvidia-license-agreement.s3.amazonaws.com/NvidiaGridAWSUserLicenseAgreement.DOCX).

**Considerations**
+ G3 instances require AWS provided DNS resolution for GRID licensing to work.
+ [IMDSv2](configuring-instance-metadata-service.md) is only supported with NVIDIA driver version 495.x or greater.

**Prerequisites**
+ (Linux) Verify that the AWS CLI is installed on your instance and configured with default credentials. For more information, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*.
+ Your user or role must have the permissions granted that contains the **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy.

## Windows operating systems
<a name="nvidia-gaming-windows"></a>

Before you install an NVIDIA gaming driver on your instance, you must ensure that the following prerequisites are met in addition to the considerations mentioned for all gaming drivers.
+ If you launch your Windows instance using a custom Windows AMI, the AMI must be a standardized image created with Windows Sysprep to ensure that the gaming driver works. For more information, see [Create an Amazon EC2 AMI using Windows Sysprep](ami-create-win-sysprep.md).
+ Configure default credentials for the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell on your Windows instance. For more information, see [Getting Started with the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-started.html) in the *AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide*.

**To install the NVIDIA gaming driver on your Windows instance**

1. Connect to your Windows instance and open a PowerShell window.

1. Download and install the gaming driver using the following PowerShell commands.

   ```
   $Bucket = "nvidia-gaming"
   $KeyPrefix = "windows/latest"
   $LocalPath = "$home\Desktop\NVIDIA"
   $Objects = Get-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -KeyPrefix $KeyPrefix -Region us-east-1
   foreach ($Object in $Objects) {
   $LocalFileName = $Object.Key
   if ($LocalFileName -ne '' -and $Object.Size -ne 0) {
   $LocalFilePath = Join-Path $LocalPath $LocalFileName
   Copy-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -Key $Object.Key -LocalFile $LocalFilePath -Region us-east-1
   }
   }
   ```

   Multiple versions of the NVIDIA GRID driver are stored in this S3 bucket. You can download all of the available versions in the bucket if you change the value of the `$KeyPrefix` variable from *"windows/latest"* to *"windows"*.

1. Navigate to the desktop and double-click the installation file to launch it (choose the driver version that corresponds to your instance OS version). Follow the instructions to install the driver and reboot your instance as required. To verify that the GPU is working properly, check Device Manager.

1. Use one of the following methods to register the driver.

------
#### [ Version 527.27 or above ]

   Create the following registry key with the 64-bit version of PowerShell, or the Command Prompt window.

   *key*: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\nvlddmkm\Global`

   *name*: vGamingMarketplace

   *type*: DWord

   *value*: 2

**PowerShell**
Run the following PowerShell command to create this registry value. The AWS Tools for PowerShell in AWS Windows AMIs defaults to the 32-bit version and this command fails. Instead, use the 64-bit version of PowerShell included with the operating system.

   ```
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\nvlddmkm\Global" -Name "vGamingMarketplace" -PropertyType "DWord" -Value "2"
   ```

**Command Prompt**
Run the following registry command to create this registry value. You can run it using the Command Prompt window or a 64-bit version of PowerShell.

   ```
   reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\nvlddmkm\Global" /v vGamingMarketplace /t REG_DWORD /d 2
   ```

------
#### [ Earlier versions ]

   Create the following registry key with the 64-bit version of PowerShell, or the Command Prompt window.

   *key*: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global`

   *name*: vGamingMarketplace

   *type*: DWord

   *value*: 2

**PowerShell**
Run the following PowerShell command to create this registry value. The AWS Tools for PowerShell in AWS Windows AMIs defaults to the 32-bit version and this command fails. Instead, use the 64-bit version of PowerShell included with the operating system.

   ```
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global" -Name "vGamingMarketplace" -PropertyType "DWord" -Value "2"
   ```

**Command Prompt**
Run the following registry command to create this registry key with the Command Prompt window. You can also use this command in the 64-bit version of PowerShell.

   ```
   reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global" /v vGamingMarketplace /t REG_DWORD /d 2
   ```

------

1. Run the following command in PowerShell. This downloads the certification file, renames the file `GridSwCert.txt`, and moves the file to the Public Documents folder on your system drive. Typically, the folder path is `C:\Users\Public\Documents`.
   + For version 591.59 or later:

     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://nvidia-gaming.s3.amazonaws.com/GridSwCert-Archive/GridSwCert_2026_03_02.cert" -OutFile "$Env:PUBLIC\Documents\GridSwCert.txt"
     ```
   + For version 576.80 to 581.80:

     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://nvidia-gaming.s3.amazonaws.com/GridSwCert-Archive/GridSwCertWindows_2025_07_01.cert" -OutFile "$Env:PUBLIC\Documents\GridSwCert.txt"
     ```
   + For version 460.39 to 576.72:

     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://nvidia-gaming.s3.amazonaws.com/GridSwCert-Archive/GridSwCertWindows_2024_02_22.cert" -OutFile "$Env:PUBLIC\Documents\GridSwCert.txt"
     ```
   + For version 445.87:

     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://nvidia-gaming.s3.amazonaws.com/GridSwCert-Archive/GridSwCert-Windows_2020_04.cert" -OutFile "$Env:PUBLIC\Documents\GridSwCert.txt"
     ```
   + For earlier versions:

     ```
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://nvidia-gaming.s3.amazonaws.com/GridSwCert-Archive/GridSwCert-Windows_2019_09.cert" -OutFile "$Env:PUBLIC\Documents\GridSwCert.txt"
     ```

   If you receive an error when downloading the file, and you are using Windows Server 2016 or earlier, TLS 1.2 might need to be enabled for your PowerShell terminal. You can enable TLS 1.2 for the current PowerShell session with the following command and then try again:

   ```
   [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
   ```

1. Reboot your instance.

1. Locate the `nvidia-smi.exe` file on the instance.

   ```
   Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -Filter "nvidia-smi.exe"
   ```

   Verify the NVIDIA Gaming license using the following command. Replace {{path}} with the name of the folder in the output from the previous command.

   ```
   C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\{{path}}\nvidia-smi.exe -q
   ```

   The output should be similar to the following.

   ```
   vGPU Software Licensed Product
   Product Name              : NVIDIA Cloud Gaming
   License Status            : Licensed (Expiry: N/A)
   ```
