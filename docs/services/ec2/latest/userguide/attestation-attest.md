# Integrating with AWS KMS
<a name="attestation-attest"></a>

Your instance should have an application that can make AWS KMS API requests with the Attestation Document retrieved from the NitroTPM. When you make a request with an Attestation Document, AWS KMS validates the measurements in the provided Attestation Document against the reference measurements in the KMS key policy. Requests are allowed only if the measurements in the Attestation Document match the reference measurements in the KMS key policy.

When you call the [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html), [DeriveSharedSecret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_DeriveSharedSecret.html), [GenerateDataKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html), [GenerateDataKeyPair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKeyPair.html), or [GenerateRandom](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateRandom.html) API operations with an Attestation Document, these APIs encrypt the plaintext in the response under the public key from the Attestation Document, and return ciphertext instead of plaintext. This ciphertext can be decrypted only by using the matching private key that was generated in the instance.

For more information, see the [ Cryptographic attestation for NitroTPM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-nitro-enclaves.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

**Note**
If you are attesting to a third-party service, you must build your own custom mechanisms for receiving, parsing, and validating Attestation Documents. For more information, see [Validate a NitroTPM Attestation Document](nitrotpm-attestation-document-validate.md).
