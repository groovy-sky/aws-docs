# Reserve compute capacity with EC2 On-Demand Capacity Reservations

Amazon EC2 Capacity Reservations allow you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific
Availability Zone for any duration. If you have strict capacity requirements for current or
future business-critical workloads that require a certain level of long or short-term
capacity assurance, we recommend that you create a Capacity Reservation to help ensure that you always have
access to Amazon EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it.

You can create a Capacity Reservation at any time, and you can choose when it starts. You can request a
Capacity Reservation for immediate use or you can request a Capacity Reservation for a future date.

- If you request a **Capacity Reservation for immediate use**, the Capacity Reservation
becomes available for use immediately and there is no term commitment. You can
modify the Capacity Reservation at any time, and you can cancel it at any time to release the
reserved capacity and to stop incurring charges.

- If you request a **future-dated Capacity Reservation**, you specify
the future date at which you need the Capacity Reservation to become available for use. You must
also specify a commitment duration for which you commit to keeping the requested
capacity in your account after the specified date. At the requested date and time,
the Capacity Reservation becomes available for use and the commitment duration starts. During the
commitment duration, you can't decrease the instance count or commitment duration
below your initial commitment, or cancel the Capacity Reservation. After the commitment duration
elapses, you can modify the Capacity Reservation in any way or cancel it if you no longer need
it.

Capacity Reservations can only be used by instances that match their attributes. By default, Capacity Reservations
automatically match new instances and running instances that have matching attributes
(instance type, platform, Availability Zone, and tenancy). This means that any instance with
matching attributes automatically runs in the Capacity Reservation. However, you can also target a Capacity Reservation for
specific workloads. This allows you to explicitly control which instances are allowed to run
in that reserved capacity. You can also specify that instances will only run in a Capacity Reservation or
Capacity Reservation resource group.

###### Important

Future-dated Capacity Reservations are for helping you launch and cover incremental instances, and not
to cover existing running instances. If you need to cover existing running instances,
use Capacity Reservations that start immediately instead.

All supported Amazon EC2 instances with matching attributes, that is instance type, platform, Availability Zone,
and tenancy, are eligible to run in a Capacity Reservation. The Amazon EC2 instance can be launched by you ( _non-managed instances_) or on
your behalf by an AWS service ( _managed instances_). This is particularly true for _open_ Capacity Reservations, which
automatically match with any running instances that have matching attributes. For example,
managed instances launched on your behalf by the following services are eligible to run in
Capacity Reservations that you create and manage.

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

- Amazon ECS

- Amazon EKS

- Amazon EMR

- Amazon SageMaker AI

- AWS Batch

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- AWS ParallelCluster

- AWS Parallel Computing Service (AWS PCS)

## Differences between Capacity Reservations, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans

The following table highlights key differences between Capacity Reservations, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans:

Capacity ReservationsZonal Reserved InstancesRegional Reserved InstancesSavings Plans**Term**

No commitment required for immediate-use Capacity Reservations. They can be
created, modified, and canceled as needed.

With future-dated Capacity Reservations, you specify a commitment duration for
which you commit to keeping the capacity in your account. After the
commitment duration elapses, you can cancel the Capacity Reservation at any
time.

## Supported platforms

You must create the Capacity Reservation with the correct platform to ensure that it properly matches
with your instances. Capacity Reservations support the following values for
`platform`:

- Linux/UNIX

- Linux with SQL Server Standard

- Linux with SQL Server Web

- Linux with SQL Server Enterprise

- SUSE Linux

- Red Hat Enterprise
Linux

- RHEL with SQL Server Standard

- RHEL with SQL Server Enterprise

- RHEL with SQL Server Web

- RHEL with HA

- RHEL with HA and SQL Server Standard

- RHEL with HA and SQL Server Enterprise

- Ubuntu Pro

- Windows

- Windows with SQL Server

- Windows with SQL Server Web

- Windows with SQL Server Standard

- Windows with SQL Server Enterprise

To ensure that an instance runs in a specific Capacity Reservation, the platform of the Capacity Reservation must
match the platform of the AMI used to launch the instance. For Linux AMIs, it is
important to check whether the AMI platform uses the general value
**Linux/UNIX** or a more specific value like **SUSE**
**Linux**.

Console

###### To check the AMI platform

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

3. Select the AMI.

4. On the **Details** tab, note the value of **Platform**
**details**.

AWS CLI

###### To check the AMI platform

Use the [describe-images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html) command and check the value of
`PlatformDetails`.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-images \
    --image-ids ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --query Images[*].PlatformDetails
```

The following is example output.

```json

[
    "Linux/UNIX"
]
```

PowerShell

###### To check the AMI platform

Use the [Get-EC2Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Image.html)
cmdlet and check the value of `PlatformDetails`.

```powershell

Get-EC2Image `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 | `
    Select PlatformDetails
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

PlatformDetails
---------------
Linux/UNIX
```

## Quotas

The number of instances for which you are allowed to reserve capacity is based on your
account's On-Demand Instance quota. You can reserve capacity for as many instances as that quota
allows, minus the number of instances that are already running.

Capacity Reservations in the `assessing`, `scheduled`, `pending` ,
`active`, and `delayed` state count towards your On-Demand Instance
quota.

## Limitations

Before you create Capacity Reservations, take note of the following limitations and
restrictions.

- Active and unused Capacity Reservations count toward your On-Demand Instance limits.

- Capacity Reservations are not transferable from one AWS account to another. However, you can
share Capacity Reservations with other AWS accounts. For more information, see [Shared Capacity Reservations](capacity-reservation-sharing.md).

- Zonal Reserved Instance billing discounts do not apply to Capacity Reservations.

- Capacity Reservations can be created in cluster placement groups. Spread and partition
placement groups are not supported.

- Capacity Reservations can't be used with Dedicated Hosts. Capacity Reservations can be used with Dedicated Instances.

- \[Windows instances\] Capacity Reservations can't be used with Bring Your Own License
(BYOL).

- \[Red Hat instances\] Capacity Reservations can be used with Bring Your Own License
(BYOL).

- Capacity Reservations do not ensure that a hibernated instance can resume after you try to
start it.

- You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for an instance count with a minimum of 32 vCPUs. For
example, if you request a future-dated Capacity Reservation for `m5.xlarge`
instances, you must request at least 8 instances ( _8 \* m5.xlarge = 32_
_vCPUs_).

- You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for instance types in the following series only:
C, G, I, M, R, and T.
