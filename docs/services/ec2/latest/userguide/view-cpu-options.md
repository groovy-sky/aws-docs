# View CPU threads and cores for an Amazon EC2 instance

You can view the CPU options for an existing instance by describing the instance.

Console

###### To view the CPU options for an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Instances**
    and select the instance.

3. On the **Details** tab, under **Host and**
**placement group**, find **Number of**
**vCPUs**.

AWS CLI

###### To view the CPU options for an instance

Use the [describe-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --query Reservations[].Instances[].CpuOptions
```

The following is example output. The `CoreCount` field indicates
the number of cores for the instance. The `ThreadsPerCore` field
indicates the number of threads per core.

```json

[
    {
        "CoreCount": 24,
        "ThreadsPerCore": 2
    },
]
```

PowerShell

###### To view the CPU options for an instance

Use the [Get-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2instance.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

(Get-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId 'i-1234567890abcdef0').Instances.CpuOptions
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

AmdSevSnp CoreCount ThreadsPerCore
--------- --------- --------------
          24        2
```

Alternatively, to view CPU information, you can connect to your instance and use one
of the following system tools:

- Windows `Task Manager` on your Windows instance

- The **lscpu** command on your Linux instance

You can use AWS Config to record, assess, audit, and evaluate configuration changes for
instances, including terminated instances. For more information, see [Getting Started with AWS Config](../../../config/latest/developerguide/getting-started.md) in the
_AWS Config Developer Guide_.
