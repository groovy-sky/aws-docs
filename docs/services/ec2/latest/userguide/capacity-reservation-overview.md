# On-Demand Capacity Reservations and Capacity Blocks for ML

Capacity Reservations allow you to reserve compute capacity for Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone.
There are two types of Capacity Reservations serving different use cases.

###### Types of Capacity Reservations

- [On-Demand Capacity Reservations](ec2-capacity-reservations.md)

- [Capacity Blocks for ML](ec2-capacity-blocks.md)

The following are some common use cases for On-Demand Capacity Reservations:

- **Scaling events** – Create On-Demand Capacity Reservations ahead of
your business-critical events to ensure that you can scale when you need to.

- **Regulatory requirements and disaster recovery** –
Use On-Demand Capacity Reservations to satisfy regulatory requirements for high availability, and reserve
capacity in a different Availability Zone or Region for disaster recovery.

- **Sharing unused capacity** –
Use Interruptible Capacity Reservations to make unused capacity available for other workloads
within your account while maintaining control to reclaim it when needed.

The following are some common use cases for Capacity Blocks for ML:

- **Machine learning (ML) model training and fine-tuning**
– Get uninterrupted access to the GPU instances that you reserved to complete ML
model training and fine-tuning.

- **ML experiments and prototypes** – Run experiments
and build prototypes that require GPU instances for short durations.

###### When to use On-Demand Capacity Reservation

Use On-Demand Capacity Reservations if you have strict capacity requirements, and your current or future
business-critical workloads require capacity assurance. With On-Demand Capacity Reservations, you can ensure that
you'll always have access to the Amazon EC2 capacity you've reserved for as long as you need it.

###### When to use Capacity Blocks for ML

Use Capacity Blocks for ML when you need to ensure that you have uninterrupted access to GPU instances for
a defined period of time starting on a future date. Capacity Blocks are ideal for training and
fine-tuning ML models, short experimentation runs, and handling temporary surges in inference
demand in the future. With Capacity Blocks, you can ensure that you'll have access to GPU resources
on a specific date to run your ML workloads.
