## Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer

Try the following to resolve issues related to connecting to your instance:

- Verify that you're using the correct public DNS hostname. (In the Amazon EC2
console, select the instance and check **Public DNS**
**(IPv4)** in the details pane.) If your instance is in a VPC and
you do not see a public DNS name, you must enable DNS hostnames. For more
information, see [DNS attributes for your\
VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- Verify that your instance has a public IPv4 address. If not, you can
associate an Elastic IP address with your instance. For more information,
see [Elastic IP addresses](elastic-ip-addresses-eip.md).

- To connect to your instance using an IPv6 address, check that your local computer has an
IPv6 address and is configured to use IPv6. For more information, see [Configure\
IPv6 on your instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-migrate-ipv6.html#vpc-migrate-ipv6-dhcpv6) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- Verify that your security group has a rule that allows RDP access
on port 3389.

- If you copied the password but get the error `Your credentials did
  					not work`, try typing them manually when prompted. It's possible
that you missed a character or got an extra white space character when you
copied the password.

- Verify that the instance has passed status checks. For more information,
see [Status checks for Amazon EC2 instances](monitoring-system-instance-status-check.md) and [Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 Linux instances with failed status checks](troubleshootinginstances.md).

- Verify that the route table for the subnet has a route that sends all
traffic destined outside the VPC to the internet gateway for the VPC. For
more information, see [Creating a\
custom route table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html#Add_IGW_Routing) (Internet Gateways) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

- Verify that Windows Firewall, or other firewall software, is not blocking RDP traffic to
the instance. We recommend that you disable Windows Firewall and control access
to your instance using security group rules. Try one of the following options:

- Use [AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP](#AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP) to [disable the Windows Firewall profiles using SSM Agent](#disable-firewall). This option requires that the instance
is configured for AWS Systems Manager.

- Use [AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue](#AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue).

- Stop the instance, detach the root volume, and attach the volume to a
temporary instance as a data volume. Connect to the temporary instance and
bring the volume online. Load the registry hive from the data volume. Under
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicyStandardProfile`,
set `EnableFirewall` to 0. Unload the registry hive and then
bring the volume offline. Detach the volume from the temporary instance
and attach it to the original instance as the root volume. Start the
original instance.

- Verify that Network Level Authentication is disabled on instances that are not part of
an Active Directory domain (use [AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP](#AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP) to [disable NLA](#disable-nla)).

- Verify that the Remote Desktop Service (TermService) Startup Type is Automatic and the
service is started (use [AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP](#AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP) to [enable and start the RDP service](#rdp-auto)).

- Verify that you are connecting to the correct Remote Desktop Protocol port, which by
default is 3389 (use [AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP](#AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP) to [read the current RDP port](#check-rdp) and [change it back to 3389](#restore-3389)).

- Verify that Remote Desktop connections are allowed on your instance (use [AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP](#AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP) to [enable Remote Desktop connections](#allow-rdp)).

- Verify that the password has not expired. If the password has expired,
you can reset it. For more information, see [Reset the Windows administrator password for an Amazon EC2 Windows instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ResettingAdminPassword.html).

- If you attempt to connect using a user that you created on the instance and receive the
error `The user cannot connect to the server due to insufficient access
  							privileges`, verify that you granted the user the right to log on
locally. For more information, see [Grant a Member the Right to Logon Locally](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/ee957044(v%3dws.10)).

- If you attempt more than the maximum allowed concurrent RDP sessions,
your session is terminated with the message `Your Remote Desktop
  							Services session has ended. Another user connected to the remote
  							computer, so your connection was lost.` By default, you are
allowed two concurrent RDP sessions to your instance.

## Error using the macOS RDP client

If you are connecting to a Windows Server instance using the Remote Desktop Connection
client from the Microsoft website, you may get the following error:

```nohighlight

Remote Desktop Connection cannot verify the identity of the computer that you want to connect to.
```

Download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from the Mac App Store and use the app
to connect to your instance.

## RDP displays a black screen instead of the desktop

Try the following to resolve this issue:

- Check the console output for additional information. To get the console
output for your instance using the Amazon EC2 console, select the instance, and
then choose **Actions**, **Monitor and**
**troubleshoot**, **Get system log**.

- Verify that you are running the latest version of your RDP client.

- Try the default settings for the RDP client.

- If you are using Remote Desktop Connection, try starting it with the
`/admin` option as follows.

```nohighlight

mstsc /v:instance /admin
```

- If the server is running a full-screen application, it might have stopped
responding. Use Ctrl+Shift+Esc to start Windows Task Manager, and then close
the application.

- If the server is over-utilized, it might have stopped responding. To
monitor the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, select the instance and then
select the **Monitoring** tab. If you need to change the
instance type to a larger size, see [Amazon EC2 instance type changes](ec2-instance-resize.md).

## Unable to remotely log on to an instance with a user that is not an administrator

If you are not able to remotely log on to a Windows instance with a user that is not an
administrator account, ensure that you have granted the user the right to log on
locally. See [Grant a user or group the right to log on locally to the domain controllers in the\
domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee957044(v=ws.10)).

## Troubleshooting Remote Desktop issues using AWS Systems Manager

You can use AWS Systems Manager to troubleshoot issues connecting to your Windows instance
using RDP.

### AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP

The AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP automation document allows the user to check or
modify common settings on the target instance that can impact Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) connections, such as the **RDP**
**Port**, **Network Layer Authentication**
**(NLA)**, and **Windows Firewall**
profiles. By default, the document reads and outputs the values of these
settings.

The AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP automation document can be used with EC2 instances,
on-premises instances, and virtual machines (VMs) that are enabled for use with
AWS Systems Manager (managed instances). In addition, it can also be used with EC2 instances
for Windows Server that are _not_ enabled for use
with Systems Manager. For information about enabling instances for use with AWS Systems Manager, see
[Managed nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/fleet-manager-managed-nodes.html)
in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

###### To troubleshoot using the AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP document

### AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue

The AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue automation document uses EC2Rescue for Windows Server
to automatically troubleshoot and restore EC2 instance connectivity and RDP
issues. For more information, see [Run the EC2Rescue tool on\
unreachable instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-ec2rescue.html).

The AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue automation document requires a stop and
restart of the instance. Systems Manager Automation stops the instance and creates an
Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Data stored in instance store volumes is lost.
The public IP address changes if you are not using an Elastic IP address.
For more information, see [Run the EC2Rescue tool on\
unreachable instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-ec2rescue.html) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

###### To troubleshoot using the AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue document

1. Open the [Systems Manager\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager).

2. Verify that you are in the same Region as the impaired Amazon EC2
    instance.

3. In the navigation panel, choose **Documents**.

4. Search for and select the `AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue` document,
    and then choose **Execute automation**.

5. In **Execution Mode**, choose **Simple execution**.

6. In the **Input parameters** section, for
    **UnreachableInstanceId**, enter the
    Amazon EC2 instance ID of the unreachable instance.

7. (Optional) For **LogDestination**, enter the Amazon Simple Storage Service
    (Amazon S3) bucket name if you want to collect operating system logs for
    troubleshooting your Amazon EC2 instance. Logs are automatically uploaded to the
    specified bucket.

8. Choose **Execute**.

9. To monitor the execution progress, in **Execution**
**status**, wait for the status to change from **Pending** to **Success**. Expand **Outputs**
    to view the results. To view the output of individual steps, in
    **Executed Steps**, choose the
    **Step ID**.

## Enable Remote Desktop on an EC2 instance with remote registry

If your unreachable instance is not managed by AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, then
you can use remote registry to enable Remote Desktop.

01. From the EC2 console, stop the unreachable instance.

02. Detach the root volume of the unreachable instance and attach it to a reachable instance in
     the same Availability Zone as a storage volume. If you don't have a reachable
     instance in the same Availability Zone, launch one. Note the device name of the root
     volume on the unreachable instance.

03. On the reachable instance, open Disk Management. You can do so by running the following
     command in the Command Prompt window.

    ```nohighlight

    diskmgmt.msc
    ```

04. Right click the newly attached volume that came from the unreachable instance, and then choose
     **Online**.

05. Open the Windows Registry Editor. You can do so by running the following command in the
     Command Prompt window.

    ```nohighlight

    regedit
    ```

06. In Registry Editor, choose **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**, then select
     **File**, **Load Hive**.

07. Select the drive of the attached volume, navigate to `\Windows\System32\config\`,
     select `SYSTEM`, and then choose **Open**.

08. For **Key Name**, enter a unique name for the hive and choose
     **OK**.

09. Back up the registry hive before making any changes to the registry.

    1. In the Registry Editor console tree, select the hive that you loaded: **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**\ `your-key-name`.

    2. Choose **File**, **Export**.

    3. In the Export Registry File dialog box, choose the location to which you want to save the backup copy, and then type a name for the backup file in the **File name** field.

    4. Choose **Save**.
10. In Registry Editor, navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\your key
                            name\ControlSet001\Control\Terminal Server`, and then,
     in the details pane, double-click **fDenyTSConnections**.

11. In the **Edit DWORD** value box, enter `0` in the **Value data** field.

12. Choose **OK**.

    ###### Note

    If the value in the **Value data** field is `1`, then the instance
    will deny remote desktop connections. A value of `0` allows remote
    desktop connections.

13. In Registry Editor, choose
     **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**\ `your-key-name`,
     then select **File**, **Unload Hive**.

14. Close Registry Editor and Disk Management.

15. From the EC2 console, detach the volume from the reachable instance and then reattach it to
     the unreachable instance. When attaching the volume to the unreachable instance,
     enter the device name that you saved earlier in the **device**
     field.

16. Restart the unreachable instance.

## I've lost my private key. How can I connect to my Windows instance?

When you connect to a newly-launched Windows instance, you decrypt the password for the
Administrator account using the private key for the key pair that you specified when you
launched the instance.

If you lose the Administrator password and you no longer have the private key, you must
reset the password or create a new instance. For more information, see [Reset the Windows administrator password for an Amazon EC2 Windows instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ResettingAdminPassword.html). For steps
to reset the password using an Systems Manager document, see [Reset passwords and\
SSH keys on EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-ec2reset.html) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.
