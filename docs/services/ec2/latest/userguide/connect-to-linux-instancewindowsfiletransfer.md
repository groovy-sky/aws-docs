# Transfer files to a Windows instance using RDP
<a name="connect-to-linux-instanceWindowsFileTransfer"></a>

You can work with your Windows instance in the same way that you would work with any Windows server. For example, you can transfer files between a Windows instance and your local computer using the local file sharing feature of the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) software. You can access local files on hard disk drives, DVD drives, portable media drives, and mapped network drives.

To access your local files from your Windows instances, you must enable the local file sharing feature by mapping the remote session drive to your local drive. The steps are slightly different depending on whether your local computer operating system is Windows or macOS X.

For more information about the prerequisites to connect using RDP, see [Prerequisites](connect-rdp.md#rdp-prereqs).
