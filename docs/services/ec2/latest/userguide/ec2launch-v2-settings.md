This section contains information about how to configure settings for EC2Launch v2.

###### Topics include:

- [Change settings using the EC2Launch v2 settings dialog box](#ec2launch-v2-ui)

- [Configure EC2Launch v2 using the CLI](#ec2launch-v2-cli)

- [EC2Launch v2 task configuration](#ec2launch-v2-task-configuration)

- [EC2Launch v2 and Sysprep](#ec2launch-v2-sysprep)

## Change settings using the EC2Launch v2 settings dialog box

The following procedure describes how to use the EC2Launch v2 settings dialog box
to enable or disable settings.

###### Note

If you improperly configure custom tasks in the agent-config.yml file, and
you attempt to open the Amazon EC2Launch settings dialog box, you will
receive an error. For example schema, see [Example: agent-config.yml](#ec2launch-v2-example-agent-config).

1. Launch and connect to your Windows instance.

2. From the Start menu, choose **All Programs**, and then
    navigate to **EC2Launch settings**. Before you choose
    **Shutdown with Sysprep** or **Shutdown without**
**Sysprep**, make sure that you save any changes that you want
    to apply when you run the shutdown.

3. On the **General** tab of the **EC2Launch**
**settings** dialog box, you can enable or disable the following
    settings.
1. **Set Computer Name**

      If this setting is enabled (it is disabled by default), the
       current host name is compared to the desired host name at each boot.
       If the host names do not match, the host name is reset, and the
       system then optionally reboots to pick up the new host name. If a
       custom host name is not specified, it is generated using the
       hexadecimal-formatted private IPv4 address, for example,
       `ip-AC1F4E6`. To prevent your existing host name from
       being modified, do not enable this setting.

2. **Extend Boot Volume**

      This setting dynamically extends `Disk 0`/ `Volume 0` to include
       any unpartitioned space. This can be useful when the instance is
       booted from a root volume that has a custom size.

3. **Set Administrator Account**

      When enabled, you can set the username and password attributes for
       the administrator account that is created on your local machine. If
       this feature is not enabled, an administrator account is not created
       on the system following Sysprep. Provide a password in
       `adminPassword` only if
       `adminPasswordtype` is `Specify`.

      The password types are defined as follows:
      1. `Random`

         EC2Launch generates a password and encrypts it using the
          user's key. The system disables this setting after the
          instance is launched so that this password persists if the
          instance is rebooted or stopped and started.

      2. `Specify`

         EC2Launch
          uses the password that you specify in
          `adminPassword`. If the password does not
          meet the system requirements, EC2Launch generates a random
          password instead. The password is stored in
          `agent-config.yml` as clear text and is
          deleted after Sysprep sets the administrator password.
          EC2Launch encrypts the password using the user's key.

      3. `Do not set`

         EC2Launch uses the password that you specify in the
          unattend.xml file. If you don't specify a password in
          unattend.xml, the administrator account is disabled.
4. **Start SSM Service**

      When selected, the Systems Manager service is enabled to start
       following Sysprep. EC2Launch v2 performs all of the tasks described
       [earlier](ec2launch-v2.md#ec2launch-v2-tasks), and the SSM
       Agent processes requests for Systems Manager capabilities, such as
       Run Command and State Manager.

      You can use Run Command to upgrade your
       existing instances to use the latest version of the EC2Launch v2 service
       and SSM Agent. For more information, see [Update SSM Agent using Run Command](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/run-command-tutorial-update-software.md) in the
       _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

5. **Optimize ENA**

      When selected, ENA settings are configured to ensure that ENA
       Receive Side Scaling and Receive Queue Depth settings are optimized
       for AWS. For more information, see [Configure Receive side scaling CPU affinity](enhanced-networking-os.md#windows-rss-cpu-affinity).

6. **Enable SSH**

      This setting enables OpenSSH for later Windows versions to allow
       for remote system administration.

7. **Enable Jumbo Frames**

      Select to enable Jumbo Frames. Jumbo Frames can have unintended
       effects on your network communications, so ensure you understand how
       Jumbo Frames will impact your system before enabling. For more
       information about Jumbo Frames, see [Jumbo frames (9001 MTU)](network-mtu.md#jumbo_frame_instances).

8. **Prepare for Imaging**

      Select whether you want your EC2 instance to shut down with or
       without Sysprep. When you want to run Sysprep with EC2Launch v2, choose
       **Shutdown with Sysprep**.
4. On the **DNS Suffix** tab, you can select whether you
    want to add a DNS suffix list for DNS resolution of servers running in EC2,
    without providing the fully qualified domain name. DNS suffixes can contain
    the variables `$REGION` and `$AZ`. Only suffixes that
    do not already exist will be added to the list.

![EC2 Launch settings application.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2launchv2-dns.png)

5. On the **Wallpaper** tab, you can configure your instance
    wallpaper with a background image, and specify instance details for the
    wallpaper to display. Amazon EC2 generates the details each time you log
    in.

You can configure your wallpaper with the following controls.

- **Display instance details on wallpaper**
– This checkbox activates or deactivates instance detail
display on the wallpaper.

- **Image path (.jpg)** – Specify the path
to the image to use as the wallpaper background.

- **Select attributes to display on wallpaper**
– Select the check boxes for the instance details that you
want to appear on the wallpaper. Clear the check boxes for
previously selected instance details that you want to remove from
the wallpaper.

- **Display Instance Tags on wallpaper** –
Select one of the following settings to display instance tags on the
wallpaper:

- **None** – Don't display any
instance tags on the wallpaper.

- **Show all** – Display all
instance tags on the wallpaper.

- **Show filtered** – Display
specified instance tags on the wallpaper. When you select
this setting, you can add instance tags that you want to
display on your wallpaper in the **Instance tag**
**filter** box.

###### Note

You must enable tags in metadata to show tags on the wallpaper. For more
information about instance tags and metadata, see
[View tags for your EC2 instances using instance metadata](work-with-tags-in-imds.md).

![EC2 Launch settings Wallpaper tab.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2launchv2-wallpaper-02.png)

6. On the **Volumes** tab, select whether you want to
    initialize the volumes that are attached to the instance. Enabling sets
    drive letters for any additional volumes and extends them to use available
    space. If you select **All**, all of the storage volumes
    are initialized. If you select **Devices**, only devices
    that are specified in the list are initialized. You must enter the device
    for each device to be initialized. Use the devices listed on the EC2
    console, for example, `xvdb` or `/dev/nvme0n1`. The
    dropdown list displays the storage volumes that are attached to the
    instance. To enter a device that is not attached to the instance, enter it
    in the text field.

**Name**, **Letter**, and
    **Partition** are optional fields. If no value is
    specified for **Partition**, storage volumes larger than 2
    TB are initialized with the `gpt` partition type, and those
    smaller than 2 TB are initialized with the `mbr` partition type.
    If devices are configured, and a non-NTFS device either contains a partition
    table, or the first 4 KB of the disk contain data, then the disk is skipped
    and the action logged.

## Configure EC2Launch v2 using the CLI

You can use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to configure your EC2Launch settings
and manage the service. The following section contains descriptions and usage
information for the CLI commands that you can use to manage EC2Launch v2.

###### Commands

- [collect-logs](#ec2launch-v2-collect-logs)

- [get-agent-config](#ec2launch-v2-get-agent-config)

- [list-volumes](#ec2launch-v2-list-volumes)

- [reset](#ec2launch-v2-reset)

- [run](#ec2launch-v2-run)

- [status](#ec2launch-v2-settings-status)

- [sysprep](#ec2launch-v2-settings-sysprep)

- [validate](#ec2launch-v2-validate)

- [version](#ec2launch-v2-version)

- [wallpaper](#ec2launch-v2-wallpaper)

### collect-logs

Collects log files for EC2Launch, zips the files, and places them in a
specified directory.

**Example**

```nohighlight

ec2launch collect-logs -o C:\Mylogs.zip
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch collect-logs [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `collect-logs`

`-o`, `--output string`

path to zipped output log files

### get-agent-config

Prints `agent-config.yml` in the format specified (JSON or YAML).
If no format is specified, `agent-config.yml` is printed in the
format previously specified.

**Example**

```nohighlight

ec2launch get-agent-config -f json
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch get-agent-config [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `get-agent-config`

`-f`, `--format string`

output format of `agent-config` file: `json`,
`yaml`

### list-volumes

Lists all of the storage volumes attached to the instance, including ephemeral
and EBS volumes.

**Example**

```nohighlight

ec2launch list-volumes
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch list-volumes`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `list-volumes`

### reset

The main goal of this task is to reset the agent for the next time that it
runs. To do that, the **reset** command deletes all of the agent
state data for EC2Launch v2 from the local `EC2Launch` directory
(see [EC2Launch v2 directory structure](ec2launch-v2.md#ec2launch-v2-directory)). Reset optionally deletes the
service and Sysprep logs.

Script behavior depends on what mode the agent runs the scripts in – inline,
or detached.

Inline (default)

The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts one at a time ( `detach: false`).
This is the default setting.

###### Note

When your inline script issues a **reset** or
**sysprep** command, it runs immediately and resets the
agent. The current task finishes, then the agent shuts down without
running any further tasks.

For example, if the task that issues the command would have been followed
by a `startSsm` task (included by default after user data runs), the
task doesn't run and the Systems Manager service never starts.

Detached

The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts concurrently with other tasks
( `detach: true`).

###### Note

When your detached script issues a **reset** or
**sysprep** command, those commands wait for the agent
to finish before they run. Tasks after the executeScript will still run.

**Example**

```nohighlight

ec2launch reset -c
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch reset [flags]`

**Flags**

`-c`, `--clean`

cleans instance logs before `reset`

`-h`, `--help`

help for `reset`

### run

Runs EC2Launch v2.

**Example**

```nohighlight

ec2launch run
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch run [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `run`

### status

Gets the status of the EC2Launch v2 agent. Optionally blocks the process until the
agent is finished. The process exit code determines the agent state:

- `0` –the agent ran and was successful.

- `1` – the agent ran and failed.

- `2` – the agent is still running.

- `3` – the agent is in an unknown state. The agent
state is not running or stopped.

- `4` – an error occurred when attempting to retrieve
the agent state.

- `5` – the agent is not running and the status of the
last known run is unknown. This could mean one of the following:

- both the `state.json` and
`previous-state.json` are deleted.

- the `previous-state.json` is corrupted.

This is the agent state after running the [reset](#ec2launch-v2-reset) command.

**Example:**

```nohighlight

ec2launch status -b
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch status [flags]`

**Flags**

`-b`, `--block`

blocks the process until the agent finishes running

`-h`, `--help`

help for `status`

### sysprep

The main goal of this task is to reset the agent for the next time that it
runs. To do that, the **sysprep** command resets the agent state,
updates the `unattend.xml` file, disables RDP, and runs
Sysprep.

Script behavior depends on what mode the agent runs the scripts in – inline,
or detached.

Inline (default)

The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts one at a time ( `detach: false`).
This is the default setting.

###### Note

When your inline script issues a **reset** or
**sysprep** command, it runs immediately and resets the
agent. The current task finishes, then the agent shuts down without
running any further tasks.

For example, if the task that issues the command would have been followed
by a `startSsm` task (included by default after user data runs), the
task doesn't run and the Systems Manager service never starts.

Detached

The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts concurrently with other tasks
( `detach: true`).

###### Note

When your detached script issues a **reset** or
**sysprep** command, those commands wait for the agent
to finish before they run. Tasks after the executeScript will still run.

**Example:**

```nohighlight

ec2launch sysprep
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch sysprep [flags]`

**Flags**

`-c`, `--clean`

cleans instance logs before `sysprep`

`-h`, `--help`

help for Sysprep

`-s`, `--shutdown`

shuts down the instance after `sysprep`

### validate

Validates the `agent-config` file
`C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2Launch\config\agent-config.yml`.

**Example**

```nohighlight

ec2launch validate
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch validate [flags]`

**Flags**

-h ` `, `--help`

help for `validate`

### version

Gets the executable version.

**Example**

```nohighlight

ec2launch version
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch version [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `version`

### wallpaper

Sets new wallpaper to the wallpaper path that is provided (.jpg file), and
displays the selected instance details.

#### Syntax

```powershell

ec2launch wallpaper ^
--path="C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2Launch\wallpaper\Ec2Wallpaper.jpg" ^
--all-tags ^
--attributes=hostName,instanceId,privateIpAddress,publicIpAddress,ipv6Address,instanceSize,availabilityZone,architecture
```

#### Inputs

###### Parameters

**--allowed-tags \[ `tag-name-1`,**

## EC2Launch v2 task configuration

This section includes the configuration schema, tasks, details, and examples for
`agent-config.yml` and user data.

###### Tasks and examples

- [Schema: agent-config.yml](#ec2launch-v2-schema-agent-config)

- [Configure EC2Launch v2 user data scripts that run during launch or reboot](#ec2launch-v2-schema-user-data)

### Schema: `agent-config.yml`

The structure of the `agent-config.yml` file is shown below. Note
that a task cannot be repeated in the same stage. For task properties, see the
task descriptions that follow.

#### Document structure: agent-config.yml

**JSON**

```JSON

{
	"version": "1.1",
	"config": [
		{
			"stage": "string",
			"tasks": [
				{
					"task": "string",
					"inputs": {
						...
					}
				},
				...
			]
		},
		...
	]
}
```

**YAML**

```yaml

  - task: string
	inputs:
	  ...
  ...
...
```

#### Example: `agent-config.yml`

The following example shows settings for the `agent-config.yml`
configuration file.

```yaml

  - task: setDnsSuffix
    inputs:
      suffixes:
      - $REGION.ec2-utilities.amazonaws.com
  - task: setAdminAccount
    inputs:
      password:
        type: random
  - task: setWallpaper
    inputs:
      path: C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2Launch\wallpaper\Ec2Wallpaper.jpg
      attributes:
      - hostName
      - instanceId
      - privateIpAddress
      - publicIpAddress
      - instanceSize
      - availabilityZone
      - architecture
- stage: postReady
  tasks:
  - task: startSsm
```

### Configure EC2Launch v2 user data scripts that run during launch or reboot

The following JSON and YAML examples show the document structure for user
data. Amazon EC2 parses each task named in the `tasks` array that you
specify in the document. Each task has its own set of properties and
requirements. For details, see the [Task definitions for EC2Launch v2 startup tasks](ec2launch-v2-task-definitions.md).

###### Note

A task must only appear once in the user data tasks array.

#### Document structure: user data

**JSON**

```JSON

{
	"version": "1.1",
	"tasks": [
		{
			"task": "string",
			"inputs": {
				...
			},
		},
		...
	]
}
```

**YAML**

```yaml

version: 1.1
tasks:
- task: string
  inputs:
    ...
...
```

#### Example: user data

For more information about user data, see [How Amazon EC2 handles user data for Windows instances](user-data.md#ec2-windows-user-data).

The following YAML document example shows a PowerShell script that
EC2Launch v2 runs as user data to create a file.

```yaml

version: 1.1
tasks:
- task: executeScript
  inputs:
  - frequency: always
    type: powershell
    runAs: localSystem
    content: |-
      New-Item -Path 'C:\PowerShellTest.txt' -ItemType File
```

You can use an XML format for the user data that's compatible with
previous versions of the launch agent. EC2Launch v2 runs the script as an
`executeScript` task in the `UserData` stage. To
conform with EC2Launch v1 and EC2Config behavior, the user data script runs as
an attached/inline process by default.

You can add optional tags to customize how your script runs. For example,
to run the user data script when the instance reboots in addition to one
time when the instance launches, you can use the following tag:

`<persist>true</persist>`

**Example:**

```ps

<powershell>
  $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
  New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<persist>true</persist>
```

You can specify one or more PowerShell arguments with the
`<powershellArguments>` tag. If no arguments are
passed, EC2Launch v2 adds the following argument by default:
`-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

**Example:**

```ps

<powershell>
  $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
  New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<powershellArguments>-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -NoProfile -NonInteractive</powershellArguments>
```

To run an XML user data script as a detached process, add the following
tag to your user data.

`<detach>true</detach>`

**Example:**

```ps

<powershell>
  $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
  New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<detach>true</detach>
```

###### Note

The detach tag is not supported on previous launch agents.

#### Change log: user data

The following table lists changes for user data, and cross-references them
to the EC2Launch v2 agent version that applies.

User data versionDetailsIntroduced in1.1

- User data tasks run before the
`PostReady` stage in the agent config
file.

- Runs user data before starting the Systems Manager Agent
(same behavior as EC2Launch v1 and
EC2Config).\*

EC2Launch v2 version 2.0.12451.0

- Will be deprecated.

- User data tasks run after the
`PostReady` stage in the agent config
file. This is not backwards compatible with
EC2Launch v1.

- Impacted by a race condition between Systems Manager
Agent start and user data tasks.

EC2Launch v2 version 2.0.0

\\* When used with the default `agent-config.yml`
file.

## EC2Launch v2 exit codes and reboots

You can use EC2Launch v2 to define how exit codes are handled by your scripts. By
default, the exit code of the last command that is run in a script is reported as
the exit code for the entire script. For example, if a script includes three
commands and the first command fails but the following ones succeed, the run status
is reported as `success` because the final command succeeded.

If you want a script to reboot an instance, then you must specify `exit
					3010` in your script, even when the reboot is the last step in your
script. `exit 3010` instructs EC2Launch v2 to reboot the instance and call
the script again until it returns an exit code that is not `3010`, or
until the maximum reboot count has been reached. EC2Launch v2 permits a maximum of 5
reboots per task. If you attempt to reboot an instance from a script by using a
different mechanism, such as `Restart-Computer`, then the script run
status will be inconsistent. For example, it may get stuck in a restart loop or not
perform the restart.

If you are using an XML user data format that is compatible with older agents, the
user data may run more times than you intend it to. For more information, see [Service runs user data more than once](ec2launchv2-troubleshooting.md#ec2launchv2-troubleshooting-user-data-more-than-once) in the
Troubleshooting section.

## EC2Launch v2 and Sysprep

The EC2Launch v2 service runs Sysprep, a Microsoft tool that enables you to create a
customized Windows AMI that can be reused. When EC2Launch v2 calls Sysprep, it uses the
files in `%ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2Launch` to determine which operations
to perform. You can edit these files indirectly using the **EC2Launch**
**settings** dialog box, or directly using a YAML editor or a text
editor. However, there are some advanced settings that aren't available in the
**EC2Launch settings** dialog box, so you must edit those
entries directly.

If you create an AMI from an instance after updating its settings, the new
settings are applied to any instance that's launched from the new AMI. For
information about creating an AMI, see [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).
