## Change settings using the EC2Launch v2 settings dialog box
<a name="ec2launch-v2-ui"></a>

The following procedure describes how to use the EC2Launch v2 settings dialog box to enable or disable settings.
**Note**
If you improperly configure custom tasks in the agent-config.yml file, and you attempt to open the Amazon EC2Launch settings dialog box, you will receive an error. For example schema, see [Example: `agent-config.yml`](#ec2launch-v2-example-agent-config).

1. Launch and connect to your Windows instance.

1. From the Start menu, choose **All Programs**, and then navigate to **EC2Launch settings**. Before you choose **Shutdown with Sysprep** or **Shutdown without Sysprep**, make sure that you save any changes that you want to apply when you run the shutdown.
![EC2 Launch settings application.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2launchv2-settings.png)

1. On the **General** tab of the **EC2Launch settings** dialog box, you can enable or disable the following settings.

   1. **Set Computer Name**

      If this setting is enabled (it is disabled by default), the current host name is compared to the desired host name at each boot. If the host names do not match, the host name is reset, and the system then optionally reboots to pick up the new host name. If a custom host name is not specified, it is generated using the hexadecimal-formatted private IPv4 address, for example, `ip-AC1F4E6`. To prevent your existing host name from being modified, do not enable this setting.

   1. **Extend Boot Volume**

      This setting dynamically extends `Disk 0`/`Volume 0` to include any unpartitioned space. This can be useful when the instance is booted from a root volume that has a custom size.

   1. **Set Administrator Account**

      When enabled, you can set the username and password attributes for the administrator account that is created on your local machine. If this feature is not enabled, an administrator account is not created on the system following Sysprep. Provide a password in `adminPassword` only if `adminPasswordtype` is `Specify`.

      The password types are defined as follows:

      1. `Random`

         EC2Launch generates a password and encrypts it using the user's key. The system disables this setting after the instance is launched so that this password persists if the instance is rebooted or stopped and started.

      1. `Specify`

         EC2Launch uses the password that you specify in `adminPassword`. If the password does not meet the system requirements, EC2Launch generates a random password instead. The password is stored in `agent-config.yml` as clear text and is deleted after Sysprep sets the administrator password. EC2Launch encrypts the password using the user's key.

      1. `Do not set`

         EC2Launch uses the password that you specify in the unattend.xml file. If you don't specify a password in unattend.xml, the administrator account is disabled.

   1. **Start SSM Service**

      When selected, the Systems Manager service is enabled to start following Sysprep. EC2Launch v2 performs all of the tasks described [earlier](ec2launch-v2.md#ec2launch-v2-tasks), and the SSM Agent processes requests for Systems Manager capabilities, such as Run Command and State Manager.

      You can use Run Command to upgrade your existing instances to use the latest version of the EC2Launch v2 service and SSM Agent. For more information, see [Update SSM Agent using Run Command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/run-command-tutorial-update-software.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*.

   1. **Optimize ENA**

      When selected, ENA settings are configured to ensure that ENA Receive Side Scaling and Receive Queue Depth settings are optimized for AWS. For more information, see [Configure Receive side scaling CPU affinity](enhanced-networking-os.md#windows-rss-cpu-affinity).

   1. **Enable SSH**

      This setting enables OpenSSH for later Windows versions to allow for remote system administration.

   1. **Enable Jumbo Frames**

      Select to enable Jumbo Frames. Jumbo Frames can have unintended effects on your network communications, so ensure you understand how Jumbo Frames will impact your system before enabling. For more information about Jumbo Frames, see [Jumbo frames (9001 MTU)](network_mtu.md#jumbo_frame_instances).

   1. **Prepare for Imaging**

      Select whether you want your EC2 instance to shut down with or without Sysprep. When you want to run Sysprep with EC2Launch v2, choose **Shutdown with Sysprep**.

1. On the **DNS Suffix** tab, you can select whether you want to add a DNS suffix list for DNS resolution of servers running in EC2, without providing the fully qualified domain name. DNS suffixes can contain the variables `$REGION` and `$AZ`. Only suffixes that do not already exist will be added to the list.
![EC2 Launch settings application.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2launchv2-dns.png)

1. On the **Wallpaper** tab, you can configure your instance wallpaper with a background image, and specify instance details for the wallpaper to display. Amazon EC2 generates the details each time you log in.

   You can configure your wallpaper with the following controls.
   + **Display instance details on wallpaper** – This checkbox activates or deactivates instance detail display on the wallpaper.
   + **Image path (.jpg)** – Specify the path to the image to use as the wallpaper background.
   + **Select attributes to display on wallpaper** – Select the check boxes for the instance details that you want to appear on the wallpaper. Clear the check boxes for previously selected instance details that you want to remove from the wallpaper.
   + **Display Instance Tags on wallpaper** – Select one of the following settings to display instance tags on the wallpaper:
     + **None** – Don't display any instance tags on the wallpaper.
     + **Show all** – Display all instance tags on the wallpaper.
     + **Show filtered** – Display specified instance tags on the wallpaper. When you select this setting, you can add instance tags that you want to display on your wallpaper in the **Instance tag filter** box.
**Note**
You must enable tags in metadata to show tags on the wallpaper. For more information about instance tags and metadata, see [View tags for your EC2 instances using instance metadata](work-with-tags-in-IMDS.md).
![EC2 Launch settings Wallpaper tab.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2launchv2-wallpaper-02.png)

1. On the **Volumes** tab, select whether you want to initialize the volumes that are attached to the instance. Enabling sets drive letters for any additional volumes and extends them to use available space. If you select **All**, all of the storage volumes are initialized. If you select **Devices**, only devices that are specified in the list are initialized. You must enter the device for each device to be initialized. Use the devices listed on the EC2 console, for example, `xvdb` or `/dev/nvme0n1`. The dropdown list displays the storage volumes that are attached to the instance. To enter a device that is not attached to the instance, enter it in the text field.

   **Name**, **Letter**, and **Partition** are optional fields. If no value is specified for **Partition**, storage volumes larger than 2 TB are initialized with the `gpt` partition type, and those smaller than 2 TB are initialized with the `mbr` partition type. If devices are configured, and a non-NTFS device either contains a partition table, or the first 4 KB of the disk contain data, then the disk is skipped and the action logged.

## Configure EC2Launch v2 using the CLI
<a name="ec2launch-v2-cli"></a>

You can use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to configure your EC2Launch settings and manage the service. The following section contains descriptions and usage information for the CLI commands that you can use to manage EC2Launch v2.

**Topics**
+ [collect-logs](#ec2launch-v2-collect-logs)
+ [get-agent-config](#ec2launch-v2-get-agent-config)
+ [list-volumes](#ec2launch-v2-list-volumes)

### collect-logs
<a name="ec2launch-v2-collect-logs"></a>

Collects log files for EC2Launch, zips the files, and places them in a specified directory.

**Example**

```
ec2launch collect-logs -o C:\Mylogs.zip
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch collect-logs [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `collect-logs`

`-o`, `--output string`

path to zipped output log files

### get-agent-config
<a name="ec2launch-v2-get-agent-config"></a>

Prints `agent-config.yml` in the format specified (JSON or YAML). If no format is specified, `agent-config.yml` is printed in the format previously specified.

**Example**

```
ec2launch get-agent-config -f json
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch get-agent-config [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `get-agent-config`

`-f`, `--format string`

output format of `agent-config` file: `json`, `yaml`

### list-volumes
<a name="ec2launch-v2-list-volumes"></a>

Lists all of the storage volumes attached to the instance, including ephemeral and EBS volumes.

**Example**

```
ec2launch list-volumes
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch list-volumes`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `list-volumes`

### reset
<a name="ec2launch-v2-reset"></a>

The main goal of this task is to reset the agent for the next time that it runs. To do that, the **reset** command deletes all of the agent state data for EC2Launch v2 from the local `EC2Launch` directory (see [EC2Launch v2 directory structure](ec2launch-v2.md#ec2launch-v2-directory)). Reset optionally deletes the service and Sysprep logs.

Script behavior depends on what mode the agent runs the scripts in – inline, or detached.

Inline (default)
The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts one at a time (`detach: false`). This is the default setting.
When your inline script issues a **reset** or **sysprep** command, it runs immediately and resets the agent. The current task finishes, then the agent shuts down without running any further tasks.
For example, if the task that issues the command would have been followed by a `startSsm` task (included by default after user data runs), the task doesn't run and the Systems Manager service never starts.

Detached
The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts concurrently with other tasks (`detach: true`).
When your detached script issues a **reset** or **sysprep** command, those commands wait for the agent to finish before they run. Tasks after the executeScript will still run.

**Example**

```
ec2launch reset -c
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch reset [flags]`

**Flags**

`-c`, `--clean`

cleans instance logs before `reset`

`-h`, `--help`

help for `reset`

### run
<a name="ec2launch-v2-run"></a>

Runs EC2Launch v2.

**Example**

```
ec2launch run
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch run [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `run`

### status
<a name="ec2launch-v2-settings-status"></a>

Gets the status of the EC2Launch v2 agent. Optionally blocks the process until the agent is finished. The process exit code determines the agent state:
+ `0` –the agent ran and was successful.
+ `1` – the agent ran and failed.
+ `2` – the agent is still running.
+ `3` – the agent is in an unknown state. The agent state is not running or stopped.
+ `4` – an error occurred when attempting to retrieve the agent state.
+ `5` – the agent is not running and the status of the last known run is unknown. This could mean one of the following:
  + both the `state.json` and `previous-state.json` are deleted.
  + the `previous-state.json` is corrupted.

  This is the agent state after running the [`reset`](#ec2launch-v2-reset) command.

**Example:**

```
ec2launch status -b
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch status [flags]`

**Flags**

`-b`,`--block`

blocks the process until the agent finishes running

`-h`,`--help`

help for `status`

### sysprep
<a name="ec2launch-v2-settings-sysprep"></a>

The main goal of this task is to reset the agent for the next time that it runs. To do that, the **sysprep** command resets the agent state, updates the `unattend.xml` file, disables RDP, and runs Sysprep.

Script behavior depends on what mode the agent runs the scripts in – inline, or detached.

Inline (default)
The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts one at a time (`detach: false`). This is the default setting.
When your inline script issues a **reset** or **sysprep** command, it runs immediately and resets the agent. The current task finishes, then the agent shuts down without running any further tasks.
For example, if the task that issues the command would have been followed by a `startSsm` task (included by default after user data runs), the task doesn't run and the Systems Manager service never starts.

Detached
The EC2Launch v2 agent runs scripts concurrently with other tasks (`detach: true`).
When your detached script issues a **reset** or **sysprep** command, those commands wait for the agent to finish before they run. Tasks after the executeScript will still run.

**Example:**

```
ec2launch sysprep
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch sysprep [flags]`

**Flags**

`-c`,`--clean`

cleans instance logs before `sysprep`

`-h`,`--help`

help for Sysprep

`-s`,`--shutdown`

shuts down the instance after `sysprep`

### validate
<a name="ec2launch-v2-validate"></a>

Validates the `agent-config` file `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2Launch\config\agent-config.yml`.

**Example**

```
ec2launch validate
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch validate [flags]`

**Flags**

-h` `, `--help`

help for `validate`

### version
<a name="ec2launch-v2-version"></a>

Gets the executable version.

**Example**

```
ec2launch version
```

**Usage**

`ec2launch version [flags]`

**Flags**

`-h`, `--help`

help for `version`

### wallpaper
<a name="ec2launch-v2-wallpaper"></a>

Sets new wallpaper to the wallpaper path that is provided (.jpg file), and displays the selected instance details.

#### Syntax

### Configure EC2Launch v2 user data scripts that run during launch or reboot
<a name="ec2launch-v2-schema-user-data"></a>

The following JSON and YAML examples show the document structure for user data. Amazon EC2 parses each task named in the `tasks` array that you specify in the document. Each task has its own set of properties and requirements. For details, see the [Task definitions for EC2Launch v2 startup tasks](ec2launch-v2-task-definitions.md).

**Note**
A task must only appear once in the user data tasks array.

#### Document structure: user data
<a name="ec2launch-v2-schema-user-data-doc-structure"></a>

**JSON**

```
{
	"version": "1.1",
	"tasks": [
		{
			"task": "string",
			"inputs": {
				...
			},
		},
		...
	]
}
```

**YAML**

```
version: 1.1
tasks:
- task: string
  inputs:
    ...
...
```

#### Example: user data
<a name="ec2launch-v2-example-user-data"></a>

For more information about user data, see [How Amazon EC2 handles user data for Windows instances](user-data.md#ec2-windows-user-data).

The following YAML document example shows a PowerShell script that EC2Launch v2 runs as user data to create a file.

```
version: 1.1
tasks:
- task: executeScript
  inputs:
  - frequency: always
    type: powershell
    runAs: localSystem
    content: |-
      New-Item -Path 'C:\PowerShellTest.txt' -ItemType File
```

You can use an XML format for the user data that's compatible with previous versions of the launch agent. EC2Launch v2 runs the script as an `executeScript` task in the `UserData` stage. To conform with EC2Launch v1 and EC2Config behavior, the user data script runs as an attached/inline process by default.

You can add optional tags to customize how your script runs. For example, to run the user data script when the instance reboots in addition to one time when the instance launches, you can use the following tag:

`<persist>true</persist>`

**Example:**

```
<powershell>
  $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
  New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<persist>true</persist>
```

You can specify one or more PowerShell arguments with the `<powershellArguments>` tag. If no arguments are passed, EC2Launch v2 adds the following argument by default: `-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

**Example:**

```
<powershell>
  $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
  New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<powershellArguments>-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -NoProfile -NonInteractive</powershellArguments>
```

To run an XML user data script as a detached process, add the following tag to your user data.

`<detach>true</detach>`

**Example:**

```
<powershell>
  $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
  New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<detach>true</detach>
```

**Note**
The detach tag is not supported on previous launch agents.

#### Change log: user data
<a name="ec2launch-v2-versions-user-data"></a>

The following table lists changes for user data, and cross-references them to the EC2Launch v2 agent version that applies.

| User data version | Details | Introduced in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | [See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2launch-v2-settings.html) | EC2Launch v2 version 2.0.1245 |
| 1.0 | [See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2launch-v2-settings.html) | EC2Launch v2 version 2.0.0 |

\* When used with the default `agent-config.yml` file.

## EC2Launch v2 exit codes and reboots
<a name="ec2launch-v2-exit-codes-reboots"></a>

You can use EC2Launch v2 to define how exit codes are handled by your scripts. By default, the exit code of the last command that is run in a script is reported as the exit code for the entire script. For example, if a script includes three commands and the first command fails but the following ones succeed, the run status is reported as `success` because the final command succeeded.

If you want a script to reboot an instance, then you must specify `exit 3010` in your script, even when the reboot is the last step in your script. `exit 3010` instructs EC2Launch v2 to reboot the instance and call the script again until it returns an exit code that is not `3010`, or until the maximum reboot count has been reached. EC2Launch v2 permits a maximum of 5 reboots per task. If you attempt to reboot an instance from a script by using a different mechanism, such as `Restart-Computer`, then the script run status will be inconsistent. For example, it may get stuck in a restart loop or not perform the restart.

If you are using an XML user data format that is compatible with older agents, the user data may run more times than you intend it to. For more information, see [Service runs user data more than once](ec2launchv2-troubleshooting.md#ec2launchv2-troubleshooting-user-data-more-than-once) in the Troubleshooting section.

## EC2Launch v2 and Sysprep
<a name="ec2launch-v2-sysprep"></a>

The EC2Launch v2 service runs Sysprep, a Microsoft tool that enables you to create a customized Windows AMI that can be reused. When EC2Launch v2 calls Sysprep, it uses the files in `%ProgramData%\Amazon\EC2Launch` to determine which operations to perform. You can edit these files indirectly using the **EC2Launch settings** dialog box, or directly using a YAML editor or a text editor. However, there are some advanced settings that aren't available in the **EC2Launch settings** dialog box, so you must edit those entries directly.

If you create an AMI from an instance after updating its settings, the new settings are applied to any instance that's launched from the new AMI. For information about creating an AMI, see [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).
