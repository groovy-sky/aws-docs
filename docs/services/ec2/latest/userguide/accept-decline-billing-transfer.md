# Accept or reject billing of a shared EC2 Capacity Reservation
<a name="accept-decline-billing-transfer"></a>

If you receive a billing assignment request for a Capacity Reservation that is shared with you, you can either accept or reject it. The request remains in the `pending` state until it is accepted or rejected.

If you accept the request, it enters the `accepted` state, and billing of any available, or *unused*, capacity of that Capacity Reservation is assigned to your account from that point onward. After you accept a request, only the Capacity Reservation owner can revoke billing from your account.

If you reject the request, it enters the `rejected` state, and billing of the available capacity of the Capacity Reservation remains assigned to the Capacity Reservation owner.

Requests expire if they are not accepted or rejected within 12 hours. If a request expires, billing of any unused capacity of the Capacity Reservation remains assigned to the Capacity Reservation owner.

When a request is accepted or rejected, an Amazon EventBridge event is sent to the Capacity Reservation owner's account. When a request expires, an Amazon EventBridge event is sent to the Capacity Reservation owner and the consumer account. For more information, see [Monitor billing assignment requests for shared Capacity Reservations](billing-ownership-events.md).
