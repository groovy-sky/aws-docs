# Enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface

For [Xen-based instances](instance-types.md#instance-hypervisor-type), the Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface provides enhanced
networking capabilities. The interface uses the Intel `ixgbevf` driver.

The following tabs show how to verify the network adapter driver that's installed for your
instance operating system.

Linux

###### Linux network interface driver

Use the following command to verify that the module is being used on a
particular interface, substituting the interface name that you want to check. If
you are using a single interface (default), this is `eth0`. If the
operating system supports [predictable network names](#predictable-network-names-sriov), this could be a name like
`ens5`.

In the following example, the `ixgbevf` module is
not loaded, because the listed driver is `vif`.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ ethtool -i eth0
driver: vif
version:
firmware-version:
bus-info: vif-0
supports-statistics: yes
supports-test: no
supports-eeprom-access: no
supports-register-dump: no
supports-priv-flags: no
```

In this example, the `ixgbevf` module is loaded.
This instance has enhanced networking properly configured.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ ethtool -i eth0
driver: ixgbevf
version: 4.0.3
firmware-version: N/A
bus-info: 0000:00:03.0
supports-statistics: yes
supports-test: yes
supports-eeprom-access: no
supports-register-dump: yes
supports-priv-flags: no
```

Windows

###### Windows network adapter

To verify that the driver is installed, connect to your instance and open
Device Manager. You should see `Intel(R) 82599 Virtual Function`
listed under **Network adapters**.

- [Troubleshoot connectivity issues](#enhanced-networking-troubleshooting)

## Prepare your instance for enhanced networking

To prepare for enhanced networking using the Intel 82599 VF interface, set up your
instance as follows:

- Verify that the instance type is one of the following: C3, C4, D2, I2, M4
(excluding `m4.16xlarge`), and R3.

- Ensure that the instance has internet connectivity.

- If you have important data on the instance that you want to preserve, you
should back that data up now by creating an AMI from your instance. Updating
kernels and kernel modules, as well as enabling the
`sriovNetSupport` attribute, might render incompatible
instances or operating systems unreachable. If you have a recent backup,
your data will still be retained if this happens.

- Linux instances –
Launch the instance from an HVM AMI using Linux kernel version of 2.6.32
or later. The latest Amazon Linux HVM AMIs have the modules required for enhanced
networking installed and have the required attributes set. Therefore, if you
launch an Amazon EBS–backed, enhanced networking–supported instance
using a current Amazon Linux HVM AMI, enhanced networking is already enabled for
your instance.

###### Warning

Enhanced networking is supported only for HVM instances. Enabling
enhanced networking with a PV instance can make it unreachable. Setting
this attribute without the proper module or module version can also make
your instance unreachable.

- Windows instances –
Launch the instance from a 64-bit HVM AMI. You can't enable enhanced
networking on Windows Server 2008. Enhanced networking is already enabled
for Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 and later AMIs. Windows
Server 2012 R2 includes Intel driver 1.0.15.3 and we recommend that you
upgrade that driver to the latest version using the Pnputil.exe utility.

- Use [AWS CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) from the AWS Management Console, or install and configure the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) or the
[AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide) on any computer you choose,
preferably your local desktop or laptop. For more information, see [Access Amazon EC2](concepts.md#access-ec2) or the
[AWS CloudShell User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html). Enhanced networking
cannot be managed from the Amazon EC2 console.

## Test whether enhanced networking is enabled

Verify that the `sriovNetSupport` attribute is set on the instance or the image.

AWS CLI

###### To check the instance attribute (sriovNetSupport)

Use the following [describe-instance-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-attribute.html) command. If the attribute is set,
the value is `simple`.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --attribute sriovNetSupport
```

###### To check the image attribute (sriovNetSupport)

Use the following [describe-images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html) command. If the attribute is set,
the value is `simple`.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-images \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --query "Images[].SriovNetSupport"
```

PowerShell

###### To check the instance attribute (sriovNetSupport)

Use the [Get-EC2InstanceAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2InstanceAttribute.html) cmdlet. If the attribute is set,
the value is `simple`.

```powershell

Get-EC2InstanceAttribute `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Attribute sriovNetSupport
```

###### To check the image attribute (sriovNetSupport)

Use the following [describe-images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html) command. If the attribute is set,
the value is `simple`.

```powershell

(Get-EC2Image -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890).SriovNetSupport
```

## Enable enhanced networking on your instance

The procedure that you use depends on the operating system of the instance.

###### Warning

There is no way to disable the enhanced networking attribute after you've
enabled it.

The latest Amazon Linux HVM AMIs have the `ixgbevf` module
required for enhanced networking installed and have the required
`sriovNetSupport` attribute set. Therefore, if you launch an instance
type using a current Amazon Linux HVM AMI, enhanced networking is already enabled for your
instance. For more information, see [Test whether enhanced networking is enabled](#test-enhanced-networking).

If you launched your instance using an older Amazon Linux AMI and it does not
have enhanced networking enabled already, use the following procedure to enable
enhanced networking.

###### To enable enhanced networking

1. Connect to your instance.

2. From the instance, run the following command to update your instance with
    the newest kernel and kernel modules, including
    `ixgbevf`:

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum update
```

3. From your local computer, reboot your instance using the Amazon EC2 console or
    one of the following commands: [reboot-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/reboot-instances.html) (AWS CLI) or [Restart-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Restart-EC2Instance.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

4. Connect to your instance again and verify that the
    `ixgbevf` module is installed and at the minimum
    recommended version using the **modinfo ixgbevf** command
    from [Test whether enhanced networking is enabled](#test-enhanced-networking).

5. \[EBS-backed instance\] From your local
    computer, stop the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or one of the following
    commands: [stop-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.html) (AWS CLI) or [Stop-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2Instance.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

\[Instance store-backed instance\] You can't stop the instance to
    modify the attribute. Instead, skip to the next procedure.

6. From your local computer, enable the enhanced networking attribute using
    one of the following commands:
AWS CLI

Use the [modify-instance-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.html) command as follows.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
       --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
       --sriov-net-support simple
```

PowerShell

Use the [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute.html) cmdlet as follows.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute `
       -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
       -SriovNetSupport "simple"
```

7. (Optional) Create an AMI from the instance, as described in
    [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).
    The AMI inherits the enhanced networking attribute from the instance. Therefore,
    you can use this AMI to launch another instance with enhanced networking enabled
    by default.

8. From your local computer, start the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or
    one of the following commands: [start-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.html) (AWS CLI) or [Start-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Start-EC2Instance.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

9. Connect to your instance and verify that the `ixgbevf`
    module is installed and loaded on your network interface using the
    **ethtool -i eth `n`** command
    from [Test whether enhanced networking is enabled](#test-enhanced-networking).

###### To enable enhanced networking (instance store-backed instances)

Follow the previous procedure until the step where you stop the instance.
Create a new AMI as described in [Create an Amazon S3-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-instance-store.md), making sure to enable the
enhanced networking attribute when you register the AMI.

AWS CLI

Use the [register-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-image.html) command as follows.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 register-image --sriov-net-support simple ...
```

PowerShell

Use [Register-EC2Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Register-EC2Image.html) as follows.

```nohighlight

Register-EC2Image -SriovNetSupport "simple" ...
```

Before you begin, [check if enhanced\
networking is already enabled](#test-enhanced-networking) on your instance.

The Quick Start Ubuntu HVM AMIs include the necessary drivers for enhanced
networking. If you have a version of `ixgbevf` earlier than
2.16.4, you can install the `linux-aws` kernel package to get the
latest enhanced networking drivers.

The following procedure provides the general steps for compiling the
`ixgbevf` module on an Ubuntu instance.

###### To install the `linux-aws` kernel package

1. Connect to your instance.

2. Update the package cache and packages.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y linux-aws
```

###### Important

If during the update process, you are prompted to install
`grub`, use `/dev/xvda` to
install `grub`, and then choose to keep the current
version of `/boot/grub/menu.lst`.

Before you begin, [check if enhanced\
networking is already enabled](#test-enhanced-networking) on your instance. The latest Quick Start
HVM AMIs include the necessary drivers for enhanced networking, therefore you do not
need to perform additional steps.

The following procedure provides the general steps if you need to enable enhanced
networking with the Intel 82599 VF interface on a Linux distribution other than Amazon Linux
or Ubuntu. For more information, such as detailed syntax for commands, file
locations, or package and tool support, see the specific documentation for your
Linux distribution.

###### To enable enhanced networking on Linux

01. Connect to your instance.

02. Download the source for the `ixgbevf` module on your
     instance from Sourceforge at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/e1000/files/ixgbevf%20stable/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/e1000/files/ixgbevf%20stable).

    Versions of `ixgbevf` earlier than 2.16.4, including
     version 2.14.2, do not build properly on some Linux distributions, including
     certain versions of Ubuntu.

03. Compile and install the `ixgbevf` module on your
     instance.

    ###### Warning

    If you compile the `ixgbevf` module for your
    current kernel and then upgrade your kernel without rebuilding the
    driver for the new kernel, your system might revert to the
    distribution-specific `ixgbevf` module at the next
    reboot. This could make your system unreachable if the
    distribution-specific version is incompatible with enhanced
    networking.

04. Run the **sudo depmod** command to update module
     dependencies.

05. Update `initramfs` on your instance to ensure that the
     new module loads at boot time.

06. Determine if your system uses predictable network interface names by
     default. Systems that use **systemd** or
     **udev** versions 197 or greater can rename Ethernet
     devices and they do not guarantee that a single network interface will be
     named `eth0`. This behavior can cause problems connecting to your
     instance. For more information and to see other configuration options, see
     [Predictable Network Interface Names](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames) on the freedesktop.org
     website.
    1. You can check the **systemd** or
        **udev** versions on RPM-based systems with the
        following command:

       ```nohighlight

       [ec2-user ~]$ rpm -qa | grep -e '^systemd-[0-9]\+\|^udev-[0-9]\+'
       				systemd-208-11.el7_0.2.x86_64
       ```

       In the above Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 example, the
        **systemd** version is 208, so predictable
        network interface names must be disabled.

    2. Disable predictable network interface names by adding the
        `net.ifnames=0` option to the
        `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` line in
        `/etc/default/grub`.

       ```nohighlight

       [ec2-user ~]$ sudo sed -i '/^GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX/s/\"$/\ net\.ifnames\=0\"/' /etc/default/grub
       ```

    3. Rebuild the grub configuration file.

       ```nohighlight

       [ec2-user ~]$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
       ```
07. \[EBS-backed instance\] From your local computer, stop the instance using
     the Amazon EC2 console or one of the following commands: [stop-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.html)
     (AWS CLI) or [Stop-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2Instance.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

    \[Instance store-backed instance\] You can't stop the instance to modify the
     attribute. Instead, skip to the next procedure.

08. From your local computer, enable the enhanced networking attribute using
     one of the following commands:
    AWS CLI

    Use the [modify-instance-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.html) command as follows.

    ```nohighlight

    aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
        --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 -\
        -sriov-net-support simple
    ```

    PowerShell

    Use the [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute.html) cmdlet as follows.

    ```powershell

    Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute `
        -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
        -SriovNetSupport "simple"
    ```

09. (Optional) Create an AMI from the instance, as described in [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md). The AMI
     inherits the enhanced networking attribute from the instance. Therefore, you
     can use this AMI to launch another instance with enhanced networking enabled
     by default.

    If your instance operating system contains an
     `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules` file,
     you must delete it before creating the AMI. This file contains the MAC
     address for the Ethernet adapter of the original instance. If another
     instance boots with this file, the operating system will be unable to
     find the device and `eth0` might fail, causing boot issues.
     This file is regenerated at the next boot cycle, and any instances
     launched from the AMI create their own version of the file.

10. From your local computer, start the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or
     one of the following commands: [start-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.html) (AWS CLI) or [Start-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Start-EC2Instance.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

11. (Optional) Connect to your instance and verify that the module is
     installed.

###### To enable enhanced networking (instance store–backed instances)

Follow the previous procedure until the step where you stop the instance.
Create a new AMI as described in [Create an Amazon S3-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-instance-store.md), making sure to enable the
enhanced networking attribute when you register the AMI.

AWS CLI

Use the [register-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-image.html) command as follows.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 register-image --sriov-net-support simple ...
```

PowerShell

Use [Register-EC2Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Register-EC2Image.html) as follows.

```nohighlight

Register-EC2Image -SriovNetSupport "simple" ...
```

If you launched your instance and it does not have enhanced
networking enabled already, you must download and install the required network
adapter driver on your instance, and then set the `sriovNetSupport`
instance attribute to activate enhanced networking. You can only enable this
attribute on supported instance types. For more information, see [Enhanced networking on Amazon EC2 instances](enhanced-networking.md).

###### Important

To view the latest driver updates in the Windows AMIs, see
[Windows AMI version history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/windows-ami-reference/ec2-windows-ami-version-history.html) in the _AWS Windows AMI Reference_.

###### To enable enhanced networking

1. Connect to your instance and log in as the local administrator.

2. \[Windows Server 2016 and later\] Run the following EC2 Launch PowerShell
    script to configure the instance after the driver is installed.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts\InitializeInstance.ps1 -Schedule
```

###### Important

The administrator password will reset when you enable the initialize
instance EC2 Launch script. You can modify the configuration file to
disable the administrator password reset by specifying it in the
settings for the initialization tasks.

3. From the instance, download the Intel network adapter driver for your operating system:

```

6. (Optional) Create an AMI from the instance, as described in
    [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).
    The AMI inherits the enhanced networking attribute from the instance. Therefore,
    you can use this AMI to launch another instance with enhanced networking enabled
    by default.

7. From your local computer, start the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or
    one of the following commands: [start-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.html) (AWS CLI) or [Start-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Start-EC2Instance.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

## Troubleshoot connectivity issues

If you lose connectivity while enabling enhanced networking, the
`ixgbevf` module might be incompatible with the kernel. Try
installing the version of the `ixgbevf` module included with the
distribution of Linux for your instance.

If you enable enhanced networking for a PV instance or AMI, this can make your
instance unreachable.
