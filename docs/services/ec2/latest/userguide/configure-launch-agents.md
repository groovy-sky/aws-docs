# Windows launch agents on Amazon EC2 Windows instances
<a name="configure-launch-agents"></a>

Each AWS Windows AMI includes a Windows launch agent that's pre-configured with default settings. Launch agents perform tasks during instance startup and run if an instance is stopped and later started, or restarted. For information about a specific agent, see the detail pages in the following list.

For more information about AWS Windows AMIs, see the [AWS Windows AMI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/windows-ami-reference/windows-amis.html).
