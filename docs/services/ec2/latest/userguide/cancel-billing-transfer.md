# Cancel or revoke billing assignment requests for shared EC2 Capacity Reservations

Only the Capacity Reservation owner can cancel a `pending` billing assignment
request. If a pending request is cancelled, it enters the `cancelled`
state and billing of any available, or _unused_, capacity of
the Capacity Reservation remains assigned to Capacity Reservation owner.

After a request is `accepted`, only the Capacity Reservation owner can revoke
billing from the assigned account. If billing is revoked, the request enters the
`revoked` state and billing of any available capacity of the Capacity Reservation
is reassigned to Capacity Reservation owner.

When a request is cancelled or revoked, Amazon EventBridge events are sent to the
Capacity Reservation owner and specified consumer account. For more information, see [Monitor billing assignment requests for shared Capacity Reservations](billing-ownership-events.md).
