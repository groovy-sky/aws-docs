# Device names for volumes on Amazon EC2 instances

When you attach a volume to your instance, you include a device name for the volume. This
device name is used by Amazon EC2. The block device driver for the instance assigns the actual
volume name when mounting the volume, and the name assigned can be different from the name
that Amazon EC2 uses.

The number of volumes that your instance can support is determined by the operating system.
For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume limits for Amazon EC2 instances](volume-limits.md).

## Available device names

There are two types of virtualization available for Linux instances:
paravirtual (PV) and hardware virtual machine (HVM). The virtualization type of an
instance is determined by the AMI used to launch the instance. All instance types
support HVM AMIs. Some previous generation instance types support PV AMIs. Be sure to
note the virtualization type of your AMI because the recommended and available device
names that you can use depend on the virtualization type of your instance. For more
information, see [Virtualization types](componentsamis.md#virtualization_types).

The following table lists the available device names that you can specify in a block
device mapping or when attaching an EBS volume.

\\* The device names that you specify for NVMe EBS volumes in a
block device mapping are renamed using NVMe device names ( `/dev/nvme[0-26]n1`).
The block device driver can assign NVMe device names in a different order
than you specified for the volumes in the block device mapping.

AWS Windows AMIs use one of the following sets of drivers to permit access to
virtualized hardware:

- AWS PV: [Paravirtual drivers for Windows instances](xen-drivers-overview.md)

- AWS NVMe: [AWS NVMe drivers](aws-nvme-drivers.md)

## Device name considerations

Keep the following in mind when selecting a device name:

- The ending portion of device names that you use shouldn't overlap as it can
cause issues when you start your instance. For example, avoid using combinations
such as `/dev/xvdf` and `xvdf` for volumes attached to the
same instance.

- Although you can attach your EBS volumes using the device names used to attach
instance store volumes, we strongly recommend that you don't because the
behavior can be unpredictable.

- The number of NVMe instance store volumes for an instance depends on the size
of the instance. NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and
assigned an NVMe device name (Linux instances) or a Windows drive letter (Windows
instances).

- (Windows instances) AWS Windows AMIs come with additional software that prepares an instance when
it first boots up. This is either the EC2Config service (Windows AMIs prior to
Windows Server 2016) or EC2Launch (Windows Server 2016 and later). After the
devices have been mapped to drives, they are initialized and mounted. The root
drive is initialized and mounted as `C:\`. By default, when an EBS
volume is attached to a Windows instance, it can show up as any drive letter
on the instance. You can change the settings to set the drive letters of the
volumes per your specifications. For instance store volumes, the default depends
on the driver. AWS PV drivers and Citrix PV drivers assign instance store
volumes drive letters going from Z: to A:. Red Hat drivers assign instance store
volumes drive letters going from D: to Z:. For more information, see
[Windows launch agents on Amazon EC2 Windows instances](configure-launch-agents.md), and
[How volumes are attached and mapped for Amazon EC2 Windows instances](ec2-windows-volumes.md).

- (Linux instances) Depending on the block device driver of the kernel, the device could be
attached with a different name than you specified. For example, if you specify a
device name of `/dev/sdh`, your device could be renamed
`/dev/xvdh` or `/dev/hdh`. In most
cases, the trailing letter remains the same. In some versions of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (and its variants, such as CentOS), the trailing letter could
change ( `/dev/sda` could become
`/dev/xvde`). In these cases, the trailing letter of each
device name is incremented the same number of times. For example, if
`/dev/sdb` is renamed `/dev/xvdf`,
then `/dev/sdc` is renamed `/dev/xvdg`.
Amazon Linux creates a symbolic link for the name you specified to the renamed device.
Other operating systems could behave differently.

- (Linux instances) HVM AMIs do not support the use of trailing numbers on device
names, except for `/dev/sda1`, which is reserved for the root volume,
and `/dev/sda2`. While using `/dev/sda2` is possible, we
do not recommend using this device mapping with HVM instances.

- (Linux instances) When using PV AMIs, you cannot attach volumes that share the same device letters both with
and without trailing digits. For example, if you attach a volume as `/dev/sdc` and
another volume as `/dev/sdc1`, only `/dev/sdc` is visible to the instance.
To use trailing digits in device names, you must use trailing digits on all device names that
share the same base letters (such as `/dev/sdc1`, `/dev/sdc2`,
`/dev/sdc3`).

- (Linux instances) Some custom kernels might have restrictions that limit use to
`/dev/sd[f-p]` or `/dev/sd[f-p][1-6]`.
If you're having trouble using `/dev/sd[q-z]` or
`/dev/sd[q-z][1-6]`, try switching to
`/dev/sd[f-p]` or
`/dev/sd[f-p][1-6]`.

Before you specify the device name that you've selected, verify that it is available.
Otherwise, you'll get an error that the device name is already in use. To view the disk
devices and their mount points, use the **lsblk** command (Linux instances),
or the Disk Management utility or the **diskpart** command (Windows
instances).
