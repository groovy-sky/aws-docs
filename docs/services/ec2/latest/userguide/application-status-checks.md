# Application status checks
<a name="application-status-checks"></a>

Application status checks help you monitor the performance and health of your applications running on Amazon EC2. With application status checks, you can detect and respond to application health impairments by monitoring your applications through configurable paths and ports. For example, you can use application status checks to confirm that your web server is listening on its expected port and accepting new connections.

Application status checks monitor the HTTP and HTTPS responses of your applications at configurable paths and ports. They run every 60 seconds and integrate with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, so you can automate replacement of instances whose applications are impaired.

## How application status checks work
<a name="how-application-status-checks-work"></a>

Application status checks send HTTP or HTTPS requests to an endpoint listening at a network port on your instance every 60 seconds. AWS compares the response code against the status code matcher you configured. The check is marked impaired after a number of consecutive failed requests, and healthy again after a number of consecutive successful requests. Both counts default to 2 and are configurable. For more information, see [Evaluation thresholds](#asc-config-evaluation).

**Note**
Application status checks send the health check request over HTTP/2.
The HTTPS protocol check does not validate the server certificate.

During a reboot, application status checks report a failure until the instance becomes available again because the application cannot respond to health check requests while the operating system is restarting.

### Network architecture
<a name="asc-network-architecture"></a>

Application status checks originate from the Amazon EC2 application status checks service. To reach your instances, AWS creates a managed elastic network interface (ENI) in your VPC. AWS creates one ENI per combination of source subnet and security group that has associated instances. AWS creates the managed ENI when an application status check first requires that combination, and removes it when no remaining application status check requires it. The managed ENI does not count against your instance ENI limit, but does count against the *Network interfaces per Region* quota for your account, which is enforced per Availability Zone. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).

By default, Amazon EC2 hides these managed network interfaces from the console and API list operations for accounts that did not have managed resources before this setting became available. To change their visibility, see [Managed resource visibility settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-ec2-managed-instances.html#managed-resource-visibility-settings).

AWS creates one managed network interface for each combination of source subnet and security group among your associated instances. The number of managed interfaces grows with the number of distinct subnet and security group combinations your monitored instances use. Consolidating monitored instances into fewer subnet and security group combinations reduces the number of managed interfaces. For example, 200 instances spread across 2 subnets that all use a single security group produce 2 managed interfaces. The same 200 instances using 3 security groups across those 2 subnets produce up to 6 managed interfaces. Each interface corresponds to one subnet and security group combination.

Application status checks reach your instances from a private vantage point within your VPC. The scope describes where the check originates, not a property of your instance's IP address. AWS creates the managed ENI in a subnet within your VPC and reaches the instance over the private network path.

With AWS managed network paths, health check traffic originates from AWS managed Amazon EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone as the target instance (or the parent Availability Zone for Local Zone targets). The traffic travels over the AWS internal network and does not traverse the public internet. For more information, see [Amazon VPC FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/) on the Amazon Web Services website.

With customer-managed network paths, you choose the source subnets, so you can run checks from a different Availability Zone than the target. For more information, see [Cross-Availability Zone monitoring](#asc-cross-az).

### AWS managed and customer-managed network paths
<a name="asc-onboarding-modes"></a>

Application status checks support two onboarding modes that determine who selects the source subnets and security groups for the health check ENI and the destination subnets and security groups for the target instances.

AWS managed network paths
AWS selects the source subnets and security groups for the health check ENI and the destination subnets and security groups for the target instances.

Customer-managed network paths
You specify the source subnets and security groups for the health check ENI and the destination subnets and security groups for the target instances.
Use customer-managed network paths when you need to control which subnets and security groups health check traffic originates from, such as when your VPC has strict network segmentation, firewall rules, or compliance requirements that restrict which sources can reach your application endpoints.

You choose the mode by including or omitting the `--health-check-paths` parameter in the create command. If you omit the `--health-check-paths` parameter, AWS selects source and destination subnets and security groups (AWS managed network paths). If you include the `--health-check-paths` parameter, you manage them (customer-managed network paths).

### IP version
<a name="asc-ipv4-ipv6"></a>

Each application status check is associated with a single IP version (IPv4 or IPv6). To monitor an instance over both IPv4 and IPv6, create two separate application status checks and associate both with the instance.

Checks reach your instance from within your VPC for both IPv4 and IPv6.

### Check status values
<a name="asc-check-status-values"></a>

Each individual check reports one of the following statuses:
+ `passed`: the check completed successfully
+ `failed`: the check failed. The response includes the HTTP status code returned by your application. For interpretation and remediation guidance, see [Troubleshooting](#asc-troubleshooting).
+ `initializing`: the check has not yet completed its first evaluation
+ `insufficient-data`: the check did not receive enough data to determine a result
+ `not-applicable`: the check is not associated with the instance

The overall application status reported for the instance aggregates all individual check results. The overall status is one of the following:
+ `ok`: all checks passed
+ `impaired`: one or more checks failed
+ `initializing`: one or more checks have not yet completed their first evaluation
+ `insufficient-data`: one or more checks report insufficient data
+ `not-applicable`: all associated application status checks are excluded from aggregation
+ `suppressed`: application status check evaluation is suppressed for the instance

### Aggregation
<a name="asc-aggregation"></a>

You can mark each application status check as included in or excluded from the overall status for the instance. By default, a check is `included`.

`included`
The check contributes to the overall status for the instance and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses it.

`excluded`
The check reports its individual status but does not contribute to the overall status for the instance and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not use it. Use this setting to validate a new check in production without affecting the overall status or triggering Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replacements. This is the recommended workflow when adding a check to an existing production workload; see [Testing a new application status check](#asc-testing-a-new-check).

## Get started with application status checks
<a name="get-started-application-status-checks"></a>

**Prerequisites**
Before you create an application status check, make sure you have the following:
+ A VPC with the instances you want to monitor.
+ An application endpoint on each instance that can respond to HTTP or HTTPS requests on the port and HTTP path you will configure.
+ A security group on each destination instance that allows inbound traffic on the check port from the source security group used by the application status check. See [Security and permissions](#asc-security-and-permissions).

**Step 1: Configure your application**
Configure your application endpoint to respond to HTTP or HTTPS requests on the port and HTTP path you will specify when you create the check. Return a response code included in your status code matcher to indicate the application is healthy.

Make sure the destination instance's security group allows inbound traffic on the check port from the source security group used by the application status check. For managed network paths, AWS provides the source security group at check creation. For customer-managed network paths, you specify the source security group when you create the check.

**Step 2: Create a check definition**
Use the AWS CLI to create an application status check.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose **Application status checks**.

1. Choose **Create application status check**.

1. Under **Health check logic**, configure the following:
   + **Protocol**: choose **HTTP** or **HTTPS**.
   + **Port**: enter the port on which your application listens.
   + **Path** (optional): enter the HTTP path to request, for example `/healthcheck`.
   + **IP version**: choose **IPv4** or **IPv6**.
   + **Device index**: the network interface device index to check. Default is `0`.

1. Under **Controls and thresholds**, set the **Timeout**, and optionally the **Status code matcher**, **Failure threshold**, **Success threshold**, and **Initialization grace period**. The check interval is fixed at 60 seconds.

1. Under **Aggregation**, choose **Included** for the check to contribute to the overall application status and drive Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, or **Excluded** to report the check without affecting the overall status.

1. Under **Health check paths**, keep **Do not specify network paths (recommended/default)** to let Amazon EC2 place the health check network interfaces in your instance's subnets, or choose **Specify network paths (advanced)** to define the source subnet, security group, and destinations yourself.

1. (Optional) Add a **Name tag** and other **Tags**.

1. Choose **Create application status check**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

To use AWS managed network paths, omit the `--health-check-paths` parameter and let AWS select source and destination subnets and security groups.

```
aws ec2 create-application-status-check \
        --protocol https \
        --port 443 \
        --path "/health" \
        --status-code-matcher "200"
```

To use customer-managed network paths, include the `--health-check-paths` parameter. Each health check path contains a source (subnet and security group for the health check ENI) and one or more destinations (subnet and security group for the target instances).

```
aws ec2 create-application-status-check \
        --protocol https \
        --port 443 \
        --path "/health" \
        --status-code-matcher "200" \
        --health-check-paths '[{"Source":{"SubnetId":"subnet-111","SecurityGroupId":"sg-aaa"},"Destinations":[{"SubnetId":"subnet-222","SecurityGroupId":"sg-bbb"}]}]'
```

------

**Step 3: Associate the check with instances**
Associate the check with the instances you want to monitor, either by instance ID or by tag.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. In the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose **Application status checks**, and select the check.

1. Choose **Manage status check associations**, then choose **Manage associations by resource ID** or **Manage associations by tags**.

1. To associate with all instances in an Auto Scaling group, choose **Manage associations by tags** and enter `aws:autoscaling:groupName` as the tag key and your Auto Scaling group name as the value.

1. Choose **Associate**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

By instance ID:

```
aws ec2 associate-application-status-check \
        --application-status-check-id asc-1234567890abcdef0 \
        --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

By tag:

```
aws ec2 associate-application-status-check \
        --application-status-check-id asc-1234567890abcdef0 \
        --target-tag-associations Key=Environment,Value=production
```

To associate with all instances in an Auto Scaling group, use the `aws:autoscaling:groupName` system tag:

```
aws ec2 associate-application-status-check \
        --application-status-check-id asc-1234567890abcdef0 \
        --target-tag-associations Key=aws:autoscaling:groupName,Value={{my-asg}}
```

------

Associate and disassociate operations return per-instance success and failure results. If some instances cannot be associated (for example, because the check is already associated), those instances appear in the unsuccessful results with a reason.

**Step 4: View results**
View the per-instance application health status.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select the instance, and then choose the **Status and alarms** tab.

1. Under **Application status checks**, review the overall status and each associated check's individual status.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

```
aws ec2 describe-application-status \
        --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

The response includes the overall application status and, for each associated check, the check status and, for failed checks, the HTTP status code returned by your application.

Example response:

```
{
        "ApplicationStatuses": [
            {
                "InstanceId": "i-0123456789abcdef0",
                "ApplicationStatus": {
                    "Status": "ok",
                    "Details": [
                        {
                            "ApplicationStatusCheckId": "asc-1234567890abcdef0",
                            "Status": "passed",
                            "Reason": {
                                "Code": "ResponseCodeMatched",
                                "StatusCode": 200,
                                "Protocol": "HTTP"
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
```

To view check definitions (not per-instance status), use [describe-application-status-checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-application-status-checks.html). This command returns the configuration of your application status checks, including protocol, port, HTTP path, and status code matcher settings.

------

## Configuration options
<a name="asc-configuration-options"></a>

Application status checks accept several configuration parameters. This section explains the parameters where the behavior isn't self-evident from the parameter name. For the complete list of parameters and validation rules, see [CreateApplicationStatusCheck](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateApplicationStatusCheck.html) and [AssociateApplicationStatusCheck](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_AssociateApplicationStatusCheck.html) in the *Amazon EC2 API Reference*.

### Evaluation thresholds
<a name="asc-config-evaluation"></a>

`FailureThreshold`
The number of consecutive failed requests before the check is marked impaired. Default: 2.

`SuccessThreshold`
The number of consecutive successful requests before the check is marked healthy again. Default: 2.

`Timeout`
The number of seconds to wait for a response before the request is recorded as failed. Enforced as a forced timeout; if your application does not respond within this window, the request is recorded as a failure regardless of eventual response. Default: 6. Valid range: 1-30.

### Startup grace period
<a name="asc-config-startup-grace"></a>

`InitializationGracePeriodSeconds`
The number of seconds to wait after an instance launches before AWS starts evaluating the check. Use this parameter to give applications time to start listening before checks begin. If the grace period is too short, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling might replace new instances before their application is ready. Default: 300. Valid range: 1 to 600.

### IP scope
<a name="asc-config-ip-scope"></a>

`IpScope`
Application status checks use `private` scope; the check runs from within your VPC. For IPv4, this corresponds to the instance's private IP address. For IPv6, AWS does not classify the address as public or private; the check accepts any IPv6 address and evaluates it from within your VPC.

### Device index
<a name="asc-config-device-index"></a>

`DeviceIndex`
The index of the network device on your instance that AWS evaluates for the health check. Change this when your instance's primary network device is not the one you want checked. Default: 0.

Aggregation, IP version, and health check paths (source and destination subnets and security groups) are covered in their own sections earlier on this page.

## Default settings
<a name="asc-default-settings"></a>

With AWS managed network paths, application status checks use the following defaults.

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Check interval | 60 seconds (fixed; not configurable) |
| Failure threshold | 2 consecutive failures |
| Success threshold | 2 consecutive successes |
| Timeout | 6 seconds |
| Status code matcher | 200 |
| HTTP path | / |
| IP version | ipv4 |
| IP scope | private |
| Device index | 0 |
| Initialization grace period | 300 seconds |
| Aggregation | included |
| Source subnets and security groups | Managed by AWS |

## Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling integration
<a name="asc-auto-scaling-integration"></a>

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically terminates and replaces instances whose overall application status reports `impaired`, as long as the check is included in aggregation. No Auto Scaling group configuration is required beyond associating the application status check with the instances in the group.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the overall status for the instance, not individual check status. Checks marked `excluded` do not drive Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling actions. Checks in the `suppressed` state do not drive Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling actions.

Use the `InitializationGracePeriodSeconds` parameter on the check to allow new instances time to start up before application status checks begin. If the grace period is too short, new instances might be terminated and replaced by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling before their application is ready to serve traffic.

The check's `InitializationGracePeriodSeconds` sets how long after an instance launches before the check starts evaluating the application. Set it to cover your application's startup time, so the check does not report `impaired` while the application is still starting up. The Auto Scaling group's health check grace period is separate. It sets how long after an instance enters service before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates it for a failed health check.

For more information about how Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses health checks, see [Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html) and [Use application status checks with an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/use-application-status-checks-auto-scaling-group.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

## Handling deployment, in-place patching, and replacements
<a name="asc-handling-deployment-and-patching"></a>

Deployments, in-place patching, and other maintenance operations can temporarily stop or restart your application. During that time, application status checks report a failure because the application cannot respond to health check requests. If your instances are in an Auto Scaling group with application status checks included in aggregation, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling might terminate and replace these instances even though the disruption is expected.

### Option A: Suppress the check
<a name="asc-option-a-suppress"></a>

Use suppression for bounded maintenance windows where you know the duration. Suppression is enforced at the instance level. You specify a duration, or omit it to suppress the check until you disable the suppression.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

```
aws ec2 enable-application-status-check-suppression \
        --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0 \
        --duration-seconds 3600
```

The response returns, for each instance, when suppression started and when it will end. Partial success is possible; some instances may fail to be suppressed and appear in the response with a reason.

To resume checks before the suppression window expires:

```
aws ec2 disable-application-status-check-suppression \
        --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

------

While suppressed, the overall application status for the instance reports `suppressed`. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not act on `suppressed` instances.

### Option B: Exclude the check from aggregation
<a name="asc-option-b-exclude"></a>

If you want the check to keep evaluating and reporting its individual status but not affect the overall status or trigger Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling actions, set the check's aggregation setting to `excluded`. This is useful for longer-lived scenarios such as rolling out a new check version or validating a change without risking replacement, and for cases where you want telemetry to continue without operational impact.

For more information, see [Aggregation](#asc-aggregation).

### Option C: Disassociate the check
<a name="asc-option-c-disassociate"></a>

Use disassociation for longer-lived or indefinite removal.

```
aws ec2 disassociate-application-status-check \
        --application-status-check-id asc-1234567890abcdef0 \
        --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```

If you associated by tag, remove the tag from the instance to disassociate. After disassociation, the overall application status for the instance reports `not-applicable`.

### Deployment guidance
<a name="asc-deployment-guidance"></a>

Deployments are the most common maintenance scenario that requires suppression. Use suppression when your deployment tool has a pre-deployment hook and a post-deployment hook so that you can suppress the check before the deployment starts and disable suppression after the deployment completes.

The general pattern is:

1. In the pre-deployment hook, call [enable-application-status-check-suppression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/enable-application-status-check-suppression.html) for the instance, with a duration that covers the expected deployment window.

1. Perform the deployment.

1. In the post-deployment hook, call [disable-application-status-check-suppression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/disable-application-status-check-suppression.html) for the instance.

If your deployment tool does not have hooks, drive suppression from the CI/CD pipeline that invokes the deployment.

## Testing a new application status check
<a name="asc-testing-a-new-check"></a>

You can validate a new application status check in production before it starts contributing to your instance-level monitoring. Set the aggregation setting to `excluded` when you create the check, then confirm it reports the expected status and HTTP response codes. When you're ready, change the setting to `included` so the check contributes to the overall status for the instance and integrates with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

1. Create the check with the aggregation setting set to `excluded`.

   ```
   aws ec2 create-application-status-check \
           --protocol https \
           --port 443 \
           --path "/health" \
           --status-code-matcher "200" \
           --aggregation excluded
   ```

1. Associate the check with a test instance or a subset of your production fleet.

1. Wait for at least two check intervals (approximately two minutes) to allow the check to complete an initial evaluation.

1. Use [describe-application-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-application-status.html) to verify the check is reporting the expected status and HTTP response code.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-application-status \
           --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
   ```

1. If the check reports as expected, update the aggregation setting to `included` to make the check contribute to the overall status for the instance and drive Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling actions.

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-application-status-check \
           --application-status-check-id asc-1234567890abcdef0 \
           --aggregation included
   ```

## Advanced networking
<a name="asc-advanced-networking"></a>

Application status checks originate from a managed ENI in the source subnet and security group you specify (or that AWS selects for you). For workloads that require higher availability than a single-source configuration provides, or for workloads that run in Local Zones or Outposts, consider the following patterns.

### Cross-Availability Zone monitoring
<a name="asc-cross-az"></a>

For Availability Zone redundancy, you can run health checks from more than one Availability Zone. With customer-managed network paths, you define health check paths whose sources are in two different Availability Zones that reach the same destination instances, using the `--health-check-paths` parameter. Monitoring from two Availability Zones keeps health reporting for your instances continuous even if one Availability Zone becomes unavailable.

The following example creates a check with two health check paths whose sources are in different Availability Zones, both reaching the same destination instances.

```
aws ec2 create-application-status-check \
        --protocol https \
        --port 443 \
        --path "/health" \
        --status-code-matcher "200" \
        --health-check-paths '[{"Source":{"SubnetId":"subnet-source-az1","SecurityGroupId":"sg-healthcheck"},"Destinations":[{"SubnetId":"subnet-app-az1","SecurityGroupId":"sg-app"}]},{"Source":{"SubnetId":"subnet-source-az2","SecurityGroupId":"sg-healthcheck"},"Destinations":[{"SubnetId":"subnet-app-az2","SecurityGroupId":"sg-app"}]}]'
```

### Local Zones
<a name="asc-local-zones"></a>

For instances running in AWS Local Zones, the managed elastic network interface (ENI) resides in the parent AWS Region, not in the Local Zone. Health check traffic between the parent Region and your Local Zone instances traverses the Local Zone service link, which may incur additional data transfer charges.

## Best practices
<a name="asc-best-practices"></a>
+ **Design your health endpoint to reflect the health of the application running on that instance.** When your endpoint returns health based on the application itself, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces only the instances that are genuinely impaired. If the endpoint's response also depends on a shared resource such as a database or a downstream service, a problem with that resource can fail the check across many instances at once. This can trigger a fleet-wide replacement. For guidance on writing health check endpoints, see [Implementing health checks](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/implementing-health-checks/) in the Amazon Builders' Library.
+ **Protect against correlated failures.** An included check drives Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replacement. A check that fails across many instances at once can trigger a wave of replacements. Set an instance maintenance policy on your Auto Scaling group to limit how many instances are replaced at the same time. For more information, see [Instance maintenance policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.html) in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
+ **Alarm on the count of impaired instances.** Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm on the `StatusCheckFailed_Application` metric across your fleet. A sudden rise across many instances indicates a shared dependency rather than individual instance faults, and gives you time to respond before replacements cascade. For more information, see [Monitor application status checks](#asc-monitoring).
+ **Stay within your network interface quota.** Application status checks create managed network interfaces that count against the *Network interfaces per Region* quota. AWS enforces this quota per Availability Zone. Monitor your usage so a growing fleet does not reach the quota. If it does, AWS cannot create new interfaces. For related quota alarm guidance, see [Quotas](#asc-quotas).
+ **Treat status check permissions as change-controlled.** The IAM actions that create, modify, delete, associate, disassociate, and suppress application status checks can affect instance availability. These actions determine what drives Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replacement. Treat actions such as `ec2:CreateApplicationStatusCheck`, `ec2:AssociateApplicationStatusCheck`, `ec2:ModifyApplicationStatusCheck`, and `ec2:EnableApplicationStatusCheckSuppression` as change-controlled rather than granting them as part of general Amazon EC2 access. For the full list of actions, see the Amazon EC2 API Reference.

## Troubleshooting
<a name="asc-troubleshooting"></a>

When an application status check reports impaired but you expect your application to be healthy, verify each of the following:

1. *Instance reachability.* Confirm that the instance's Instance and System status checks are `ok`.

1. *Security group inbound rule.* The destination instance's security group must allow inbound traffic on the check port from the source security group used by the application status check. For AWS managed network paths, AWS provides the source security group; for customer-managed network paths, use the security group you specified as the source.

1. *Host firewall.* Any host-level firewall (iptables, Windows Firewall, third-party host firewall) on the instance must allow inbound traffic on the check port.

1. *Application endpoint.* The application must be listening on the port and path you configured. Confirm with a local request from the instance (`curl http://localhost:PORT/PATH`).

1. *Protocol mismatch.* If the check is configured as HTTPS but the endpoint serves HTTP only (or vice versa), all calls will fail.

1. *Status code matcher.* Confirm that your application's actual response code is included in the status code matcher you configured.

1. *Network path.* If you configured customer-managed network paths, confirm the source subnet and security group have connectivity to the destination subnet. Use [VPC Reachability Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.html) to trace the network path.

1. *Available ENI quota.* AWS creates a managed elastic network interface (ENI) in your account for each source subnet and security group combination. Confirm your account has not reached its *Network interfaces per Region* quota, which is enforced per Availability Zone. If your account has reached this quota, AWS cannot create the managed ENI and the check cannot run. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).

### Reason codes
<a name="asc-troubleshoot-reason-codes"></a>

The [describe-application-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-application-status.html) response includes a reason for each check. The reason contains the HTTP status code returned by your application (as a number), along with the protocol used for the check. A check is marked `passed` if the returned status code is included in your status code matcher, and `failed` otherwise.

The reason also includes a reason code and, for HTTP-level results, the protocol and the returned HTTP status code. The reason contains the following fields:

`Code`
The reason code for the application status check result. One of the following values:
+ `ResponseCodeMatched`: the HTTP status code returned by the health check matched the configured `StatusCodeMatcher`.
+ `ResponseCodeMismatch`: the HTTP status code returned by the health check did not match the configured `StatusCodeMatcher`.
+ `ConnectionTimeout`: the connection to the target timed out.
+ `ResponseTimeout`: the health check timed out while waiting for a response from the target.
+ `ConnectionRefused`: the target refused the health check connection.
+ `ConnectionReset`: the health check connection was reset before a response was received.
For `ResponseCodeMatched` and `ResponseCodeMismatch`, the `StatusCode` field contains the returned HTTP status code and the `Protocol` field contains the protocol used for the health check. For connection errors, such as `ConnectionTimeout`, `ResponseTimeout`, `ConnectionRefused`, and `ConnectionReset`, the `StatusCode` and `Protocol` fields are not present.

`Protocol`
The protocol used for the health check. One of `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.

`StatusCode`
The HTTP status code returned by the health check.

Use the returned HTTP status code to identify why a check failed. Some common examples:

| HTTP status code | Typical meaning | Common remediation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `200` | Application returned a successful response. | None. This is typically a healthy status. |
| `301`, `302` | Application returned a redirect. Health check calls do not follow redirects. | Point the health check path at the destination of the redirect, or add the redirect code to your status code matcher if you consider it healthy. |
| `401`, `403` | The application requires authentication or denied access to the health check path. | Configure the health check path to be unauthenticated, or serve health checks on a path that does not require credentials. |
| `404` | The configured health check path was not found on the application. | Confirm the path matches a route your application serves. |
| `500` | Application returned an internal server error. | Investigate application logs on the instance. |
| `502`, `503`, `504` | Application is reachable but reports upstream or capacity issues. | Investigate application health, dependencies, and capacity. If your application returns these codes during startup, increase `InitializationGracePeriodSeconds`. |

For the complete `ApplicationStatusReason` structure, see [ApplicationStatusReason](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ApplicationStatusReason.html) in the *Amazon EC2 API Reference*.

### Common mistakes
<a name="asc-troubleshoot-common-mistakes"></a>
+ The security group does not allow inbound traffic from the health check source on the check port.
+ The application is bound to `127.0.0.1` and not listening on the network interface.
+ The health check path returns a redirect (301, 302) rather than a success response, and the status code matcher does not include the redirect code.
+ The check is configured for HTTPS but the application only serves HTTP, or vice versa.
+ The application takes longer to start than the `InitializationGracePeriodSeconds` value, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces the instance before it is ready.

## Monitor application status checks
<a name="asc-monitoring"></a>

You can monitor application status checks in three ways:
+ **Amazon CloudWatch**. The `StatusCheckFailed_Application` metric reflects the overall application status for the instance and can drive alarms. The metric is aggregated per instance across associated checks whose aggregation setting is `included`. CloudWatch also publishes a per-check metric for each associated check, named `StatusCheckFailed_Application_{{application-status-check-id}}`.
+ **[describe-instance-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-status.html)**. Returns the overall application status alongside your instance's other status information.
+ **[describe-application-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-application-status.html)**. Returns detailed per-instance results, including each associated check's individual status and the HTTP status code returned by your application.

Use the CloudWatch metric for alarm-driven automation. Use `describe-instance-status` when you already query it for instance status. Use `describe-application-status` for detailed per-check visibility.

## Security and permissions
<a name="asc-security-and-permissions"></a>

AWS creates and manages the network interfaces used for application status checks through a service-linked role. No IAM setup is required for the service to create these ENIs. The service-linked role uses the [`EC2ApplicationStatusChecksServiceRolePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/EC2ApplicationStatusChecksServiceRolePolicy.html) AWS managed policy.

To create, associate, describe, delete, and suppress application status checks yourself, your IAM user or role needs the corresponding Amazon EC2 permissions. See the *Amazon EC2 API Reference* for the full list of actions.

Your instance's security group must allow inbound traffic from the health check source security group on the port you configured. With AWS managed network paths, AWS provides the source security group; with customer-managed network paths, use the security group you specified as the source.

## Pricing
<a name="asc-pricing"></a>

Application status checks are billed on the following components:
+ An hourly charge of $0.01 for each managed elastic network interface (ENI), per Availability Zone.
+ Standard Amazon CloudWatch pricing applies to application status check metrics.

## Quotas
<a name="asc-quotas"></a>

Application status checks are subject to AWS service quotas. For the quota names, default values, and descriptions, see [Amazon EC2 endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ec2-service.html) in the *AWS General Reference*.

In addition to the AWS service quotas that affect the managed network interfaces, application status checks have the following service quotas. You can view your usage and request increases from the Service Quotas console.

In these quotas, a *target* is a single instance that one health check monitors. If more than one health check monitors an instance, each instance and health check pairing counts as a separate target. An *association* is a single tag rule or a single instance ID that you associate with a health check. Each rule or instance ID counts as one association, regardless of how many instances it resolves to.

| Quota | Default | Adjustable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health checks per account | 50 | Yes, automatically |
| Associations per health check | 50 | Yes, automatically |
| Associations per account | 200 | Yes, automatically |
| Targets per account | 5,000 | Yes, by request |

Most quota increases are approved automatically. An increase to *Targets per account* requires a request and manual approval.

**Important**
If the number of targets in your account exceeds the *Targets per account* quota, the targets over the limit are not monitored and do not report an application status. To avoid gaps in monitoring, keep your target count within the quota or request an increase.

We recommend that you create a Amazon CloudWatch alarm on your application status checks quota usage so that you are notified before you reach a quota. Service Quotas publishes usage metrics to the `AWS/Usage` namespace in CloudWatch, which you can use to create the alarm.
