# Grant permissions to attach an IAM role to an instance

The identities in your AWS account, such as IAM users, must have specific
permissions to launch an Amazon EC2 instance with an IAM role, attach an IAM role
to an instance, replace the IAM role for an instance, or detach an IAM role
from an instance. You must grant permission to use the following API actions
as required:

- `iam:PassRole`

- `ec2:AssociateIamInstanceProfile`

- `ec2:DisassociateIamInstanceProfile`

- `ec2:ReplaceIamInstanceProfileAssociation`

###### Note

If you specify the resource for `iam:PassRole` as `*`,
this would grant access to pass any of your IAM roles to an instance. To follow
the best practice of [least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege), specify the ARNs of specific IAM roles with
`iam:PassRole`, as shown in the example policy below.

###### Example policy for programmatic access

The following IAM policy grants permissions to launch instances with
an IAM role, attach an IAM role to an instance, or replace the IAM
role for an instance using the AWS CLI or the Amazon EC2 API.

  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "ec2:RunInstances",
         "ec2:AssociateIamInstanceProfile",
         "ec2:DisassociateIamInstanceProfile",
         "ec2:ReplaceIamInstanceProfileAssociation"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:PassRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DevTeam*"
    }
  ]
}

```

###### Additional requirement for console access

To grant permissions to complete the same tasks using the Amazon EC2 console,
you must also include the `iam:ListInstanceProfiles` API action.
