# Protect an Amazon EC2 AMI from deregistration

You can turn on _deregistration protection_ on an AMI to
prevent accidental or malicious deletion. When you turn on deregistration protection, the AMI
can’t be deregistered by any user, regardless of their IAM permissions. If you want to
deregister the AMI, you must first turn off the deregistration protection on it.

When you turn on deregistration protection on an AMI, you have the option to include a
24-hour cooldown period. This cooldown period is the time during which deregistration
protection remains in effect after you turn it off. During this cooldown period, the AMI can’t
be deregistered. When the cooldown period ends, the AMI can be deregistered.

Deregistration protection is turned off by default on all existing and new AMIs.

## Turn on deregistration protection

Use the following procedures to turn on deregistration protection.

## Turn off deregistration protection

Use the following procedures to turn off deregistration protection.

If you chose to include a 24-hour cooldown period when you turned on deregistration
protection for the AMI, then, when you turn off deregistration protection, you won’t

during which deregistration protection remains in effect even after you turn it off.
During this cooldown period, the AMI can’t be deregistered. After the cooldown period
ends, the AMI can be deregistered.
