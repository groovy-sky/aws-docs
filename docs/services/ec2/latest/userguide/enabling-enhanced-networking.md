# Enable enhanced networking on your instance

The procedure that you use depends on the operating system of the instance.

The AMIs for Amazon Linux include the kernel driver required for
enhanced networking with ENA installed and have ENA support enabled. Therefore, if
you launch an instance with an HVM version of Amazon Linux on a supported instance type,
enhanced networking is already enabled for your instance. For more information, see
[Test whether enhanced networking is enabled](test-enhanced-networking-ena.md).

The latest Ubuntu HVM AMIs include the kernel driver required for enhanced networking
with ENA installed and have ENA support enabled. Therefore, if you launch an
instance with the latest Ubuntu HVM AMI on a supported instance type, enhanced
networking is already enabled for your instance. For more information, see [Test whether enhanced networking is enabled](test-enhanced-networking-ena.md).

If you launched your instance using an older AMI and it does not have enhanced
networking enabled already, you can install the `linux-aws`
kernel package to get the latest enhanced networking drivers and update the required
attribute.

###### To install the `linux-aws` kernel package (Ubuntu 16.04 or later)

Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 ship with the Ubuntu custom kernel ( `linux-aws` kernel
package). To use a different kernel, contact [Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support).

###### To install the `linux-aws` kernel package (Ubuntu Trusty 14.04)

1. Connect to your instance.

2. Update the package cache and packages.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y linux-aws
```

###### Important

If during the update process you are prompted to install
`grub`, use `/dev/xvda` to
install `grub` onto, and then choose to keep the
current version of `/boot/grub/menu.lst`.

3. \[EBS-backed instance\] From your local computer, stop the instance using
    the Amazon EC2 console or one of the following commands: [stop-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.md) (AWS CLI) or [Stop-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/stop-ec2instance.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

\[Instance store-backed instance\] You can't stop the instance to modify the
    attribute. Instead, proceed to this procedure: [To enable enhanced networking on Ubuntu (instance store-backed instances)](#enhanced-networking-ena-instance-store-ubuntu).

4. From your local computer, enable the enhanced networking attribute using
    one of the following commands:

- [modify-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.md)
(AWS CLI)

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --ena-support
```

- [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2instanceattribute.md)
(Tools for Windows PowerShell)

```nohighlight

Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 -EnaSupport $true
```

5. (Optional) Create an AMI from the instance, as described in [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md). The
    AMI inherits the enhanced networking `enaSupport` attribute from
    the instance. Therefore, you can use this AMI to launch another instance
    with enhanced networking enabled by default.

6. From your local computer, start the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or
    one of the following commands: [start-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.md) (AWS CLI) or [Start-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/start-ec2instance.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

###### To enable enhanced networking on Ubuntu (instance store-backed instances)

Follow the previous procedure until the step where you stop the instance.
Create a new AMI as described in [Create an Amazon S3-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-instance-store.md), making sure to enable the
enhanced networking attribute when you register the AMI.

- [register-image](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-image.md) (AWS CLI)

```nohighlight

aws ec2 register-image --ena-support ...
```

- [Register-EC2Image](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/register-ec2image.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

```nohighlight

Register-EC2Image -EnaSupport $true ...
```

The latest AMIs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and
CentOS include the kernel driver required for enhanced networking with ENA and have ENA
support enabled. Therefore, if you launch an instance with the latest AMI on a
supported instance type, enhanced networking is already enabled for your instance.
For more information, see [Test whether enhanced networking is enabled](test-enhanced-networking-ena.md).

The following procedure provides the general steps for enabling enhanced
networking on a Linux distribution other than Amazon Linux AMI or Ubuntu. For more
information, such as detailed syntax for commands, file locations, or package and
tool support, see the documentation for your Linux distribution.

###### To enable enhanced networking on Linux

01. Connect to your instance.

02. Clone the source code for the `ena` kernel driver on your
     instance from GitHub at [https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers).
     (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 and later include ENA 2.02 by default,
     so you are not required to download and compile the ENA driver. For SUSE
     Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 and later, you should file a request to add
     the driver version you want to the stock kernel).

    ```nohighlight

    git clone https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers
    ```

03. Compile and install the `ena` kernel driver on your instance.
     These steps depend on the Linux distribution. For more information about
     compiling the kernel driver on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see [How do I\
     install the latest ENS driver for enhanced network support on an Amazon EC2 instance\
     that runs RHEL?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/install-ena-driver-rhel-ec2)

04. Run the **sudo depmod** command to update kernel driver
     dependencies.

05. Update `initramfs` on your instance to ensure that the
     new kernel driver loads at boot time. For example, if your distribution supports
     **dracut**, you can use the following command.

    ```nohighlight

    dracut -f -v
    ```

06. Determine if your system uses predictable network interface names by
     default. Systems that use **systemd** or
     **udev** versions 197 or greater can rename Ethernet
     devices and they do not guarantee that a single network interface will be
     named `eth0`. This behavior can cause problems connecting to your
     instance. For more information and to see other configuration options, see
     [Predictable Network Interface Names](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames) on the freedesktop.org
     website.
    1. You can check the **systemd** or
        **udev** versions on RPM-based systems with the
        following command.

       ```nohighlight

       rpm -qa | grep -e '^systemd-[0-9]\+\|^udev-[0-9]\+'
       systemd-208-11.el7_0.2.x86_64
       ```

       In the above Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 example, the
        **systemd** version is 208, so predictable
        network interface names must be disabled.

    2. Disable predictable network interface names by adding the
        `net.ifnames=0` option to the
        `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` line in
        `/etc/default/grub`.

       ```nohighlight

       sudo sed -i '/^GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX/s/\"$/\ net\.ifnames\=0\"/' /etc/default/grub
       ```

    3. Rebuild the grub configuration file.

       ```nohighlight

       sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
       ```
07. \[EBS-backed instance\] From your local computer, stop the instance using
     the Amazon EC2 console or one of the following commands: [stop-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.md) (AWS CLI), [Stop-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/stop-ec2instance.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

    \[Instance store-backed instance\] You can't stop the instance to modify the
     attribute. Instead, proceed to this procedure: [To enable enhanced networking on Linux (instance store–backed instances)](#other-linux-enhanced-networking-ena-instance-store).

08. From your local computer, enable the enhanced networking
     `enaSupport` attribute using one of the following
     commands:

- [modify-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.md)
(AWS CLI)

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --ena-support
```

- [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2instanceattribute.md)
(Tools for Windows PowerShell)

```nohighlight

Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 -EnaSupport $true
```

09. (Optional) Create an AMI from the instance, as described in [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md). The AMI
     inherits the enhanced networking `enaSupport` attribute from the
     instance. Therefore, you can use this AMI to launch another instance with
     enhanced networking enabled by default.

    If your instance operating system contains an
     `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules` file,
     you must delete it before creating the AMI. This file contains the MAC
     address for the Ethernet adapter of the original instance. If another
     instance boots with this file, the operating system will be unable to
     find the device and `eth0` might fail, causing boot issues.
     This file is regenerated at the next boot cycle, and any instances
     launched from the AMI create their own version of the file.

10. From your local computer, start the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or
     one of the following commands: [start-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.md) (AWS CLI) or [Start-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/start-ec2instance.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

11. (Optional) Connect to your instance and verify that the kernel driver is
     installed.

    If you are unable to connect to your instance after enabling
     enhanced networking, see [Troubleshoot the ENA kernel driver on Linux](troubleshooting-ena.md).

###### To enable enhanced networking on Linux (instance store–backed instances)

Follow the previous procedure until the step where you stop the instance.
Create a new AMI as described in [Create an Amazon S3-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-instance-store.md), making sure to enable the
enhanced networking attribute when you register the AMI.

- [register-image](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-image.md) (AWS CLI)

```nohighlight

aws ec2 register-image --ena-support ...
```

- [Register-EC2Image](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/register-ec2image.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

```nohighlight

Register-EC2Image -EnaSupport ...
```

This method is for testing and feedback purposes only. It is not intended for use
with production deployments. For production deployments, see [Ubuntu](#enhanced-networking-ena-ubuntu).

###### Important

Using DKMS voids the support agreement for your subscription. It should not be
used for production deployments.

###### To enable enhanced networking with ENA on Ubuntu (EBS-backed instances)

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 in [Ubuntu](#enhanced-networking-ena-ubuntu).

2. Install the `build-essential` packages to compile the
    kernel driver and the `dkms` package so that your
    `ena` kernel driver is rebuilt every time your kernel is
    updated.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential dkms
```

3. Clone the source for the `ena` kernel driver on your instance
    from GitHub at [https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers).

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ git clone https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers
```

4. Move the `amzn-drivers` package to the
    `/usr/src/` directory so DKMS can find it and build
    it for each kernel update. Append the version number (you can find the
    current version number in the release notes) of the source code to the
    directory name. For example, version `1.0.0` is shown in
    the following example.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo mv amzn-drivers /usr/src/amzn-drivers-1.0.0
```

5. Create the DKMS configuration file with the following values, substituting
    your version of `ena`.

Create the file.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo touch /usr/src/amzn-drivers-1.0.0/dkms.conf
```

Edit the file and add the following values.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo vim /usr/src/amzn-drivers-1.0.0/dkms.conf
PACKAGE_NAME="ena"
PACKAGE_VERSION="1.0.0"
CLEAN="make -C kernel/linux/ena clean"
MAKE="make -C kernel/linux/ena/ BUILD_KERNEL=${kernelver}"
BUILT_MODULE_NAME[0]="ena"
BUILT_MODULE_LOCATION="kernel/linux/ena"
DEST_MODULE_LOCATION[0]="/updates"
DEST_MODULE_NAME[0]="ena"
AUTOINSTALL="yes"
```

6. Add, build, and install the `ena` kernel driver on your
    instance using DKMS.

Add the kernel driver to DKMS.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo dkms add -m amzn-drivers -v 1.0.0
```

Build the kernel driver using the **dkms** command.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo dkms build -m amzn-drivers -v 1.0.0
```

Install the kernel driver using **dkms**.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo dkms install -m amzn-drivers -v 1.0.0
```

7. Rebuild `initramfs` so the correct kernel driver is loaded at
    boot time.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
```

8. Verify that the `ena` kernel driver is installed using the
    modinfo ena command from [Test whether enhanced networking is enabled](test-enhanced-networking-ena.md).

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ modinfo ena

```

9. Continue with Step 3 in [Ubuntu](#enhanced-networking-ena-ubuntu).

If you launched your instance and it does not have enhanced networking enabled
already, you must download and install the required network adapter driver on your
instance, and then set the `enaSupport` instance attribute to activate
enhanced networking.

###### To enable enhanced networking

1. Connect to your instance and log in as the local administrator.

2. \[Windows Server 2016 and 2019 only\] Run the following EC2Launch
    PowerShell script to configure the instance after the driver is
    installed.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts\InitializeInstance.ps1 -Schedule
```

3. From the instance, install the driver as follows:
1. [Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/ENA/Latest/AwsEnaNetworkDriver.zip) the latest driver to the instance.

2. Extract the zip archive.

3. Install the driver by running the `install.ps1`
       PowerShell script.

      ###### Note

      If you get an execution policy error, set the policy to
      `Unrestricted` (by default it is set to
      `Restricted` or `RemoteSigned`). In a
      command line, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy
      								Unrestricted`, and then run the
      `install.ps1` PowerShell script
      again.
4. From your local computer, stop the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or one
    of the following commands: [stop-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.md) (AWS CLI) or [Stop-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/stop-ec2instance.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

5. Enable ENA support on your instance as follows:
1. From your local computer, check the EC2 instance ENA support
       attribute on your instance by running one of the following commands.
       If the attribute is not enabled, the output will be "\[\]" or blank.
       `EnaSupport` is set to `false` by
       default.

- [describe-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.md)
(AWS CLI)

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 --query "Reservations[].Instances[].EnaSupport"
```

- [Get-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2instance.md)
(Tools for Windows PowerShell)

```nohighlight

(Get-EC2Instance -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0).Instances.EnaSupport
```

2. To enable ENA support, run one of the following commands:

- [modify-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.md)
(AWS CLI)

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --ena-support
```

- [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2instanceattribute.md)
(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

```nohighlight

Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 -EnaSupport $true
```

If you encounter problems when you restart the instance, you can
also disable ENA support using one of the following commands:

- [modify-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.md)
(AWS CLI)

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --no-ena-support
```

- [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2instanceattribute.md)
(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

```nohighlight

Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 -EnaSupport $false
```

3. Verify that the attribute has been set to `true` using
       **describe-instances** or
       **Get-EC2Instance** as shown previously. You
       should now see the following output:

      ```nohighlight

      [
      	true
      ]
      ```
6. From your local computer, start the instance using the Amazon EC2 console or
    one of the following commands: [start-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.md) (AWS CLI) or [Start-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/start-ec2instance.md) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell).

7. On the instance, validate that the ENA driver is installed and enabled as
    follows:
1. Right-click the network icon and choose **Open Network and**
      **Sharing Center**.

2. Choose the Ethernet adapter (for example, **Ethernet**
      **2**).

3. Choose **Details**. For **Network**
      **Connection Details**, check that
       **Description** is **Amazon Elastic**
      **Network Adapter**.
8. (Optional) Create an AMI from the instance. The AMI inherits the
    `enaSupport` attribute from the instance. Therefore, you can
    use this AMI to launch another instance with ENA enabled by default.
