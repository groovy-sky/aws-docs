# Create custom event windows for scheduled events that affect your Amazon EC2 instances

You can define custom event windows that recur weekly for scheduled events that
reboot, stop, or terminate your Amazon EC2 instances. You can associate one or more
instances with an event window. If a scheduled event for those instances is planned,
AWS will schedule the events within the associated event window.

You can use event windows to maximize workload availability by specifying event
windows that occur during off-peak periods for your workload. You can also align the
event windows with your internal maintenance schedules.

You define an event window by specifying a set of time ranges. The minimum time
range is 2 hours. The combined time ranges must total at least 4 hours.

You can associate one or more instances with an event window by using either
instance IDs or instance tags. You can also associate Dedicated Hosts with an event window by
using the host ID.

###### Warning

Event windows are applicable only for scheduled events that stop, reboot, or
terminate instances.

Event windows are not applicable for:

- Expedited scheduled events and network maintenance events.

- Unscheduled maintenance such as [automatic instance recovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-recover.html) and unplanned reboots.

###### Work with event windows

- [Considerations](#event-windows-considerations)

- [Create an event window](#create-event-windows)

- [Associate a target with an event window](#associate-target-event-window)

- [Disassociate a target from an event window](#disassociate-target-event-window)

- [Modify an event window](#modify-event-windows)

- [Delete an event window](#delete-event-windows)

## Considerations

- All event window times are in UTC.

- An event window can contain multiple time ranges. While each
individual range must be at least 2 hours, the total duration across all
ranges must be at least 4 hours.

- Only one target type (instance ID, Dedicated Host ID, or instance tag) can be
associated with an event window.

- A target (instance ID, Dedicated Host ID, or instance tag) can only be
associated with one event window.

- A maximum of 100 instance IDs, or 50 Dedicated Host IDs, or 50 instance tags can
be associated with an event window. The instance tags can be associated
with any number of instances.

- A maximum of 200 event windows can be created per AWS Region.

- Multiple instances that are associated with event windows can
potentially have scheduled events occur at the same
time.

- If AWS has already scheduled an event, modifying an event window
won't change the time of the scheduled event. If the event has a
deadline date, you can [reschedule the\
event](reschedule-event.md).

- You can stop and start an instance before the scheduled event. This
migrates the instance to a new host and clears the event.

## Create an event window

You can create one or more event windows. For each event window, you specify
one or more blocks of time. For example, you can create an event window with
blocks of time that occur every day at 4 AM for 2 hours. Or you can create an
event window with blocks of time that occur on Sundays from 2 AM to 4 AM and on
Wednesdays from 3 AM to 5 AM.

Event windows recur weekly until you delete them.

Console

###### To create an event window

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Events**.

3. Choose **Actions**, **Manage**
**event windows**.

4. Choose **Create instance event**
**window**.

5. For **Event window name**, enter a
    descriptive name for the event window.

6. For **Event window schedule**, choose to
    specify the blocks of time in the event window by using the
    cron schedule builder or by specifying time ranges.

- If you choose **Cron schedule**
**builder**, specify the following:

1. For **Days (UTC)**, specify
    the days of the week on which the event window
    occurs.

2. For **Start time (UTC)**,
    specify the time when the event window
    begins.

3. For **Duration**, specify
    the duration of the blocks of time in the event
    window. The minimum duration per block of time is
    2 hours. The minimum duration of the event window
    must equal or exceed 4 hours in total. All times
    are in UTC.

- If you choose **Time ranges**,
choose **Add new time range** and
specify the start day and time and the end day and
time. Repeat for each time range. The minimum
duration per time range is 2 hours. The minimum
duration for all time ranges combined must equal or
exceed 4 hours in total.

7. (Optional) For **Target details**,
    associate one or more instances with the event window. Use
    instance IDs or instance tags to associate instances. Use
    host IDs to associate Dedicated Hosts. When these targets
    are scheduled for maintenance, the event will occur during
    this event window.

Note that you can create the event window without
    associating a target with the window. Later, you can modify
    the window to associate one or more targets.

8. (Optional) For **Event window tags**,
    choose **Add tag**, and enter the key and
    value for the tag. Repeat for each tag.

9. Choose **Create event window**.

AWS CLI

###### To create an event window with a time range

Use the [create-instance-event-window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-instance-event-window.html) command.

## Modify an event window

You can modify all of the fields of an event window except its ID. For
example, when daylight savings begin, you might want to modify the event window
schedule. For existing event windows, you might want to add or remove
targets.

You can modify either a time range or a cron expression when
modifying the event window, but not both.
