# Service-linked role for EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

Amazon EC2 uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [service-linked\
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-service-linked-role). A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked
directly to Amazon EC2. Service-linked roles are predefined by Amazon EC2 and include all the
permissions that Amazon EC2 requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. For more
information, see [Service-linked\
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.
