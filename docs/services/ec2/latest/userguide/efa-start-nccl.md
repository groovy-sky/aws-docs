# Get started with EFA and NCCL for ML workloads on Amazon EC2
<a name="efa-start-nccl"></a>

The NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) is a library of standard collective communication routines for multiple GPUs across a single node or multiple nodes. NCCL can be used together with EFA, Libfabric, and MPI to support various machine learning workloads. For more information, see the [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) website.

**Requirements**
+ Only accelerated computing P series instance types are supported. For more information, see [ Amazon EC2 accelerated computing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ac.html#ac-sizes).
+ Only Amazon Linux 2023, Ubuntu 24.04, and Ubuntu 22.04 base AMIs are supported.
+ Only NCCL 2.4.2 and later is supported with EFA.

For more information about running machine learning workloads with EFA and NCCL using an AWS Deep Learning AMIs, see [ Using EFA on the DLAMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-efa-using.html) in the *AWS Deep Learning AMIs Developer Guide*.

## Step 1: Prepare an EFA-enabled security group
<a name="nccl-start-base-setup"></a>

An EFA requires a security group that allows all inbound and outbound traffic to and from the security group itself. The following procedure creates a security group that allows all inbound and outbound traffic to and from itself, and that allows inbound SSH traffic from any IPv4 address for SSH connectivity.

**Important**
This security group is intended for testing purposes only. For your production environments, we recommend that you create an inbound SSH rule that allows traffic only from the IP address from which you are connecting, such as the IP address of your computer, or a range of IP addresses in your local network.

For other scenarios, see [Security group rules for different use cases](security-group-rules-reference.md).

**To create an EFA-enabled security group**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups** and then choose **Create security group**.

1. In the **Create security group** window, do the following:

   1. For **Security group name**, enter a descriptive name for the security group, such as `EFA-enabled security group`.

   1. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a brief description of the security group.

   1. For **VPC**, select the VPC into which you intend to launch your EFA-enabled instances.

   1. Choose **Create security group**.

1. Select the security group that you created, and on the **Details** tab, copy the **Security group ID**.

1. With the security group still selected, choose **Actions**, **Edit inbound rules**, and then do the following:

   1. Choose **Add rule**.

   1. For **Type**, choose **All traffic**.

   1. For **Source type**, choose **Custom** and paste the security group ID that you copied into the field.

   1. Choose **Add rule**.

   1. For **Type**, choose **SSH**.

   1. For **Source type**, choose **Anywhere-IPv4**.

   1. Choose **Save rules**.

1. With the security group still selected, choose **Actions**, **Edit outbound rules**, and then do the following:

   1. Choose **Add rule**.

   1. For **Type**, choose **All traffic**.

   1. For **Destination type**, choose **Custom** and paste the security group ID that you copied into the field.

   1. Choose **Save rules**.

## Step 2: Launch a temporary instance
<a name="nccl-start-base-temp"></a>

Launch a temporary instance that you can use to install and configure the EFA software components. You use this instance to create an EFA-enabled AMI from which you can launch your EFA-enabled instances.

**To launch a temporary instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**, and then choose **Launch Instances** to open the new launch instance wizard.

1. (*Optional*) In the **Name and tags** section, provide a name for the instance, such as `EFA-instance`. The name is assigned to the instance as a resource tag (`Name={{EFA-instance}}`).

1. In the **Application and OS Images** section, select an AMI for one of the supported operating systems.

1. In the **Instance type** section, select a supported instance type.

1. In the **Key pair** section, select the key pair to use for the instance.

1. In the **Network settings** section, choose **Edit**, and then do the following:

   1. For **Subnet**, choose the subnet in which to launch the instance.
**Important**
You must select a subnet. If you do not select a subnet, you can't enable the instance for EFA.

   1. For **Firewall (security groups)**, choose **Select existing security group**, and then select the security group that you created in the previous step.

   1. Expand the **Advanced network configuration** section.

      For **Network interface 1**, select **Network card index = 0**, **Device index = 0**, and **Interface type = EFA with ENA**.

      (*Optional*) If you are using a multi-card instance type, such as `p4d.24xlarge` or `p5.48xlarge`, for each additional network interface required, choose **Add network interface**, for **Network card index** select the next unused index, and then select **Device index = 1** and **Interface type = EFA with ENA** or **EFA-only**.

1. In the **Storage** section, configure the volumes as needed.
**Note**
You must provision an additional 10 to 20 GiB of storage for the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit. If you do not provision enough storage, you will receive an `insufficient disk space` error when attempting to install the Nvidia drivers and CUDA toolkit.

1. In the **Summary** panel on the right, choose **Launch instance**.

## Step 3: Install Nvidia GPU drivers, Nvidia CUDA toolkit, and cuDNN
<a name="nccl-start-base-drivers"></a>

------
#### [ Amazon Linux 2023 ]

**To install the Nvidia GPU drivers, Nvidia CUDA toolkit, and cuDNN**

1. To ensure that all of your software packages are up to date, perform a quick software update on your instance.

   ```
   $ sudo yum upgrade -y && sudo reboot
   ```

   After the instance has rebooted, reconnect to it.

1. Install the utilities that are needed to install the Nvidia GPU drivers and the Nvidia CUDA toolkit.

   ```
   $ sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' -y
   ```

1. Disable the `nouveau` open source drivers.

   1. Install the required utilities and the kernel headers package for the version of the kernel that you are currently running.

      ```
      $ sudo yum install -y wget kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r)
      ```

   1. Add `nouveau` to the `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf `deny list file.

      ```
      $ cat << EOF | sudo tee --append /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
      blacklist vga16fb
      blacklist nouveau
      blacklist rivafb
      blacklist nvidiafb
      blacklist rivatv
      EOF
      ```

   1. Append `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rdblacklist=nouveau"` to the `grub` file and rebuild the Grub configuration.

      ```
      $ echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rdblacklist=nouveau"' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/grub \

   ```

1. Reboot the instance and reconnect to it.

1. (`p4d.24xlarge` and `p5.48xlarge` only) Start the Nvidia Fabric Manager service, and ensure that it starts automatically when the instance starts. Nvidia Fabric Manager is required for NV Switch Management.

   ```
   $ sudo systemctl enable nvidia-fabricmanager && sudo systemctl start nvidia-fabricmanager
   ```

1. Ensure that the CUDA paths are set each time that the instance starts.
   + For *bash* shells, add the following statements to `/home/{{username}}/.bashrc` and `/home/{{username}}/.bash_profile`.

     ```
     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```

     ```

1. Reboot the instance and reconnect to it.

1. (`p4d.24xlarge` and `p5.48xlarge` only) Install the Nvidia Fabric Manager.

   1. You must install the version of the Nvidia Fabric Manager that matches the version of the Nvidia kernel module that you installed in the previous step.

      Run the following command to determine the version of the Nvidia kernel module.

      ```
      $ cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version | grep "Kernel Module"
      ```

      The following is example output.

      ```
      NVRM version: NVIDIA UNIX x86_64 Kernel Module  450.42.01  Tue Jun 15 21:26:37 UTC 2021
      ```

      In the example above, major version `450` of the kernel module was installed. This means that you need to install Nvidia Fabric Manager version `450`.

   1. Install the Nvidia Fabric Manager. Run the following command and specify the major version identified in the previous step.

      ```
      $ sudo apt install -o Dpkg::Options::='--force-overwrite' nvidia-fabricmanager-{{major_version_number}}
      ```

      For example, if major version `450` of the kernel module was installed, use the following command to install the matching version of Nvidia Fabric Manager.

      ```
      $ sudo apt install -o Dpkg::Options::='--force-overwrite' nvidia-fabricmanager-450
      ```

   1. Start the service, and ensure that it starts automatically when the instance starts. Nvidia Fabric Manager is required for NV Switch Management.

      ```
      $ sudo systemctl start nvidia-fabricmanager && sudo systemctl enable nvidia-fabricmanager
      ```

1. Ensure that the CUDA paths are set each time that the instance starts.
   + For *bash* shells, add the following statements to `/home/{{username}}/.bashrc` and `/home/{{username}}/.bash_profile`.

     ```
     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```
   + For *tcsh* shells, add the following statements to `/home/{{username}}/.cshrc`.

     ```
     setenv PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```

1. To confirm that the Nvidia GPU drivers are functional, run the following command.

   ```
   $ nvidia-smi -q | head
   ```

   The command should return information about the Nvidia GPUs, Nvidia GPU drivers, and Nvidia CUDA toolkit.

   && sudo dpkg -i gdrcopy_2.4-1_amd64.*.deb
   ```

------

## Step 5: Install the EFA software
<a name="nccl-start-base-enable"></a>

Install the EFA-enabled kernel, EFA drivers, Libfabric, aws-ofi-nccl plugin, and Open MPI stack that is required to support EFA on your instance.

**To install the EFA software**

1. Connect to the instance you launched. For more information, see [Connect to your Linux instance using SSH](connect-to-linux-instance.md).

1. Download the EFA software installation files. The software installation files are packaged into a compressed tarball (`.tar.gz`) file. To download the latest *stable* version, use the following command.

   You can also get the latest version by replacing the version number with `latest` in the preceding command.

   ```
   $ curl -O https://efa-installer.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer-1.49.0.tar.gz
   ```

1. (*Optional*) Verify the authenticity and integrity of the EFA tarball (`.tar.gz`) file.

   We recommend that you do this to verify the identity of the software publisher and to check that the file has not been altered or corrupted since it was published. If you do not want to verify the tarball file, skip this step.
**Note**
Alternatively, if you prefer to verify the tarball file by using an MD5 or SHA256 checksum instead, see [Verify the EFA installer using a checksum](efa-verify.md).

   1. Download the public GPG key and import it into your keyring.

      ```
      $ wget https://efa-installer.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer.key && gpg --import aws-efa-installer.key
      ```

      The command should return a key value. Make a note of the key value, because you need it in the next step.

   1. Verify the GPG key's fingerprint. Run the following command and specify the key value from the previous step.

      ```
      $ gpg --fingerprint {{key_value}}
      ```

      The command should return a fingerprint that is identical to `4E90 91BC BB97 A96B 26B1 5E59 A054 80B1 DD2D 3CCC`. If the fingerprint does not match, don't run the EFA installation script, and contact Support.

   1. Download the signature file and verify the signature of the EFA tarball file.

      ```
      $ wget https://efa-installer.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer-1.49.0.tar.gz.sig && gpg --verify ./aws-efa-installer-1.49.0.tar.gz.sig
      ```

      The following shows example output.

      ```
      gpg: Signature made Wed 29 Jul 2020 12:50:13 AM UTC using RSA key ID DD2D3CCC
      gpg: Good signature from "Amazon EC2 EFA <ec2-efa-maintainers@amazon.com>"
      gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
      gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
      Primary key fingerprint: 4E90 91BC BB97 A96B 26B1  5E59 A054 80B1 DD2D 3CCC
      ```

      If the result includes `Good signature`, and the fingerprint matches the fingerprint returned in the previous step, proceed to the next step. If not, don't run the EFA installation script, and contact Support.

1. Extract the files from the compressed `.tar.gz` file and navigate into the extracted directory.

   ```
   $ tar -xf aws-efa-installer-1.49.0.tar.gz && cd aws-efa-installer
   ```

1. (*Optional*) Verify individual package signatures during installation.

   Starting with EFA installer 1.48.0, the installer includes GPG-signed individual RPM and DEB packages. To verify the authenticity and integrity of each individual package during installation, use the `--check-signatures` flag. When you enable this flag, the installer verifies all package signatures first, and only proceeds with installation if every package passes verification. If any package fails verification, the installer exits immediately without installing anything.

   1. Download the GPG public key.

      ```
      $ wget https://efa-installer.amazonaws.com/aws-efa-installer.key
      ```

   1. Export the key path. Then, in the next step, append `--check-signatures` to the installation command and use `sudo -E` instead of `sudo` to preserve the environment variable.

      ```
      $ export EFA_INSTALLER_KEY=$(pwd)/aws-efa-installer.key
      ```

   On RPM-based systems (Amazon Linux, RHEL, Rocky Linux, and SUSE), the installer verifies each RPM using `rpm --checksig`. On DEB-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian), the installer verifies each DEB using GPG signature verification.

   If verification of any package fails, the installation immediately aborts, protecting your system against broken or malicious packages.
**Note**
The `--check-signatures` flag is optional. Without it, the installer does not perform individual signature verification.

1. Run the EFA software installation script.
**Note**
If you completed the previous optional step to set up package signature verification, append `--check-signatures` to the installation command and use `sudo -E` instead of `sudo`. For example: `sudo -E ./efa_installer.sh -y --mpi=openmpi4 --check-signatures`.
**Note**
From EFA 1.30.0, both Open MPI 4.1 and Open MPI 5 are installed by default. Unless you need Open MPI 5, we recommend that you install only Open MPI 4.1. The following command installs Open MPI 4.1 only. If you want to install Open MPI 4.1 and Open MPI 5, remove `--mpi=openmpi4`.

   ```
   $ sudo ./efa_installer.sh -y --mpi=openmpi4
   ```

   **Libfabric** is installed in the `/opt/amazon/efa` directory. The **aws-ofi-nccl plugin** is installed in the `/opt/amazon/ofi-nccl` directory. **Open MPI** is installed in the `/opt/amazon/openmpi` directory.

1. If the EFA installer prompts you to reboot the instance, do so and then reconnect to the instance. Otherwise, log out of the instance and then log back in to complete the installation.

1. Confirm that the EFA software components were successfully installed.

   ```
   $ fi_info -p efa -t FI_EP_RDM
   ```

   The command should return information about the Libfabric EFA interfaces. The following example shows the command output.
   + `p3dn.24xlarge` with single network interface

## Step 6: Install NCCL
<a name="nccl-start-base-nccl"></a>

Install NCCL. For more information about NCCL, see the [NCCL repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl).

**To install NCCL**

1. Navigate to the `/opt` directory.

   ```
   $ cd /opt
   ```

1. Clone the official NCCL repository to the instance and navigate into the local cloned repository.

   ```
   $ sudo git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl.git -b v2.23.4-1 && cd nccl
   ```

1. Build and install NCCL and specify the CUDA installation directory.

   ```
   $ sudo make -j src.build CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
   ```

## Step 7: Install the NCCL tests
<a name="nccl-start-base-tests"></a>

Install the NCCL tests. The NCCL tests enable you to confirm that NCCL is properly installed and that it is operating as expected. For more information about the NCCL tests, see the [nccl-tests repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests).

**To install the NCCL tests**

1. Navigate to your home directory.

   ```
   $ cd $HOME
   ```

1. Clone the official nccl-tests repository to the instance and navigate into the local cloned repository.

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests.git && cd nccl-tests
   ```

1. Add the Libfabric directory to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.
   + Amazon Linux 2023

     ```
     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={{/opt/amazon/efa/lib64}}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```
   + Ubuntu 24.04 and Ubuntu 22.04

     ```
     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={{/opt/amazon/efa/lib}}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```

1. Install the NCCL tests and specify the MPI, NCCL, and CUDA installation directories.

   ```
   $ make MPI=1 MPI_HOME={{/opt/amazon/openmpi}} NCCL_HOME={{/opt/nccl/build}} CUDA_HOME={{/usr/local/cuda}}
   ```

## Step 8: Test your EFA and NCCL configuration
<a name="nccl-start-base-test"></a>

Run a test to ensure that your temporary instance is properly configured for EFA and NCCL.

**To test your EFA and NCCL configuration**

1. Create a host file that specifies the hosts on which to run the tests. The following command creates a host file named `my-hosts` that includes a reference to the instance itself.

------
#### [ IMDSv2 ]

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \
   && curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4 >> my-hosts
   ```

------
#### [ IMDSv1 ]

   ```
   [ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4 >> my-hosts
   ```

------

1. Run the test and specify the host file (`--hostfile`) and the number of GPUs to use (`-n`). The following command runs the `all_reduce_perf` test on 8 GPUs on the instance itself, and specifies the following environment variables.
   + `FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA=1`—(`p4d.24xlarge` only) uses the device's RDMA functionality for one-sided and two-sided transfer.
   + `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`—enables detailed debugging output. You can also specify `VERSION` to print only the NCCL version at the start of the test, or `WARN` to receive only error messages.

   For more information about the NCCL test arguments, see the [NCCL Tests README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests/blob/master/README.md) in the official nccl-tests repository.
   + `p3dn.24xlarge`

     ```
     $ /opt/amazon/openmpi/bin/mpirun \
     -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/nccl/build/lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/opt/amazon/efa/lib:/opt/amazon/openmpi/lib:/opt/amazon/ofi-nccl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
     -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO \
     --hostfile my-hosts -n 8 -N 8 \
     --mca pml ^cm --mca btl tcp,self --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0 --bind-to none \
     $HOME/nccl-tests/build/all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 1G -f 2 -g 1 -c 1 -n 100
     ```
   + `p4d.24xlarge` and `p5.48xlarge`

     ```
     $ /opt/amazon/openmpi/bin/mpirun \
     -x FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA=1 \
     -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/nccl/build/lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/opt/amazon/efa/lib:/opt/amazon/openmpi/lib:/opt/amazon/ofi-nccl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
     -x NCCL_DEBUG=INFO \
     --hostfile my-hosts -n 8 -N 8 \
     --mca pml ^cm --mca btl tcp,self --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0 --bind-to none \
     $HOME/nccl-tests/build/all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 1G -f 2 -g 1 -c 1 -n 100
     ```

1. You can confirm that EFA is active as the underlying provider for NCCL when the `NCCL_DEBUG` log is printed.

   ```
   ip-192-168-2-54:14:14 [0] NCCL INFO NET/OFI Selected Provider is efa*
   ```

   The following additional information is displayed when using a `p4d.24xlarge` instance.

   ```
   ip-192-168-2-54:14:14 [0] NCCL INFO NET/OFI Running on P4d platform, Setting NCCL_TOPO_FILE environment variable to /home/ec2-user/install/plugin/share/aws-ofi-nccl/xml/p4d-24xl-topo.xml
   ```

## Step 9: Install your machine learning applications
<a name="nccl-start-base-app"></a>

Install the machine learning applications on the temporary instance. The installation procedure varies depending on the specific machine learning application. For more information about installing software on your Linux instance, see [Manage OS updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2023/ug/managing-repos-os-updates.html) in the *Amazon Linux 2023 User Guide*.

**Note**
Refer to your machine learning application’s documentation for installation instructions.

## Step 10: Create an EFA and NCCL-enabled AMI
<a name="nccl-start-base-ami"></a>

After you have installed the required software components, you create an AMI that you can reuse to launch your EFA-enabled instances.

**To create an AMI from your temporary instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select the temporary instance that you created and choose **Actions**, **Image**, **Create image**.

1. For **Create image**, do the following:

   1. For **Image name**, enter a descriptive name for the AMI.

   1. (Optional) For **Image description**, enter a brief description of the purpose of the AMI.

   1. Choose **Create image**.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

1. Locate the AMI tht you created in the list. Wait for the status to change from `pending` to `available` before continuing to the next step.

## Step 11: Terminate the temporary instance
<a name="nccl-start-base-terminate"></a>

At this point, you no longer need the temporary instance that you launched. You can terminate the instance to stop incurring charges for it.

**To terminate the temporary instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select the temporary instance that you created and then choose **Actions**, **Instance state**, **Terminate instance**.

1. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Terminate**.

## Step 12: Launch EFA and NCCL-enabled instances into a cluster placement group
<a name="nccl-start-base-cluster"></a>

Launch your EFA and NCCL-enabled instances into a cluster placement group using the EFA-enabled AMI and the EFA-enabled security group that you created earlier.

**Note**
It is not an absolute requirement to launch your EFA-enabled instances into a cluster placement group. However, we do recommend running your EFA-enabled instances in a cluster placement group as it launches the instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone.
To ensure that capacity is available as you scale your cluster’s instances, you can create a Capacity Reservation for your cluster placement group. For more information, see [Use Capacity Reservations with placement groups](cr-cpg.md).

------

## Step 13: Enable passwordless SSH
<a name="nccl-start-base-passwordless"></a>

To enable your applications to run across all of the instances in your cluster, you must enable passwordless SSH access from the leader node to the member nodes. The leader node is the instance from which you run your applications. The remaining instances in the cluster are the member nodes.

**To enable passwordless SSH between the instances in the cluster**

1. Select one instance in the cluster as the leader node, and connect to it.

1. Disable `strictHostKeyChecking` and enable `ForwardAgent` on the leader node. Open `~/.ssh/config` using your preferred text editor and add the following.

   ```
   Host *
       ForwardAgent yes
   Host *
       StrictHostKeyChecking no
   ```

1. Generate an RSA key pair.

   ```
   $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   The key pair is created in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory.

1. Change the permissions of the private key on the leader node.

   ```
   $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
   ```

1. Open `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` using your preferred text editor and copy the key.

1. For each member node in the cluster, do the following:

   1. Connect to the instance.

   1. Open `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` using your preferred text editor and add the public key that you copied earlier.

1. To test that the passwordless SSH is functioning as expected, connect to your leader node and run the following command.

   ```
   $ ssh {{member_node_private_ip}}
   ```

   You should connect to the member node without being prompted for a key or password.
