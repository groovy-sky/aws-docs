# Use your BYOIP address range in Amazon EC2

You can view and use the IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges that you've provisioned in your
account. For more information, see [Onboard your address range for use in Amazon EC2](byoip-onboard.md).

## IPv4 address ranges

You can create an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool and use it with
your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers.

To view information about the IPv4 address pools that you've provisioned in your
account, use the following [describe-public-ipv4-pools](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-public-ipv4-pools.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-public-ipv4-pools --region us-east-1
```

To create an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, use the [allocate-address](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-address.md) command.
You can use the `--public-ipv4-pool` option to specify the ID of the
address pool returned by `describe-byoip-cidrs`. Or you can use the
`--address` option to specify an address from the address range that
you provisioned.

## IPv6 address ranges

To view information about the IPv6 address pools that you've provisioned in your
account, use the following [describe-ipv6-pools](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-ipv6-pools.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-ipv6-pools --region us-east-1
```

To create a VPC and specify an IPv6 CIDR from your IPv6 address pool, use the
following [create-vpc](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc.md) command.
To let Amazon choose the IPv6 CIDR from your IPv6 address pool, omit the
`--ipv6-cidr-block` option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --ipv6-cidr-block ipv6-cidr --ipv6-pool pool-id --region us-east-1
```

To associate an IPv6 CIDR block from your IPv6 address pool with a VPC, use the
following [associate-vpc-cidr-block](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-vpc-cidr-block.md) command. To let Amazon choose the IPv6 CIDR
from your IPv6 address pool, omit the `--ipv6-cidr-block` option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 associate-vpc-cidr-block --vpc-id vpc-123456789abc123ab --ipv6-cidr-block ipv6-cidr --ipv6-pool pool-id --region us-east-1
```

To view your VPCs and the associated IPv6 address pool information, use the [describe-vpcs](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs.md) command. To view
information about associated IPv6 CIDR blocks from a specific IPv6 address pool, use
the following [get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-associated-ipv6-pool-cidrs --pool-id pool-id --region us-east-1
```

If you disassociate the IPv6 CIDR block from your VPC, it's released back into
your IPv6 address pool.
