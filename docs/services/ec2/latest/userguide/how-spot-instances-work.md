# How Spot Instances work

To launch a Spot Instance, either you create a _Spot Instance request_, or Amazon EC2 creates a
Spot Instance request on your behalf. The Spot Instance launches when the Spot Instance request is
fulfilled.

You can launch a Spot Instance using several different services. For more information, see [Getting Started with Amazon EC2\
Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/getting-started). In this user guide, we describe the following ways to launch
a Spot Instance using EC2:

- You can create a Spot Instance request by using the [launch instance wizard](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) in the Amazon EC2 console or the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md)
command. For more information, see [Manage your Spot Instances](using-spot-instances-request.md).

- You can create an EC2 Fleet, in which you specify the desired number of Spot Instances.
Amazon EC2 creates a Spot Instance request on your behalf for every Spot Instance that is specified in
the EC2 Fleet. For more information, see [Create an EC2 Fleet](create-ec2-fleet.md).

- You can create a Spot Fleet request, in which you specify the desired number of Spot Instances. Amazon EC2
creates a Spot Instance request on your behalf for every Spot Instance that is specified in the
Spot Fleet request. For more information, see [Create a Spot Fleet](create-spot-fleet.md).

Your Spot Instance launches if there is available capacity. Your Spot Instance runs until you stop or
terminate it, or until Amazon EC2 interrupts it (known as a _Spot Instance interruption_).
Amazon EC2 can stop, terminate, or hibernate a Spot Instance when it interrupts it.

When you use Spot Instances, you must be prepared for interruptions. Amazon EC2 can interrupt your Spot Instance
when the demand for Spot Instances rises or when the supply of Spot Instances decreases. When Amazon EC2
interrupts a Spot Instance, it provides a Spot Instance interruption notice, which gives the instance a
two-minute warning before Amazon EC2 interrupts it. You can't enable termination protection
for Spot Instances. For more information, see [Spot Instance interruptions](spot-interruptions.md).

## Spot Instance request states

A Spot Instance request can be in one of the following states:

- `open` – The request is waiting to be fulfilled.

- `active` – The request is fulfilled and has an associated Spot Instance.

- `failed` – The request has one or more bad
parameters.

- `closed` – The Spot Instance was interrupted or terminated.

- `disabled` – You stopped the Spot Instance.

- `cancelled` – You canceled the request, or the request
expired.

The following illustration represents the transitions between the request states.
Notice that the transitions depend on the request type (one-time or
persistent).

![Spot Instance request states.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/spot_request_states.png)

A one-time Spot Instance request remains active until Amazon EC2 launches the Spot Instance, the request expires,
or you cancel the request. If capacity is not available, your Spot Instance is terminated and
the Spot Instance request is closed.

A persistent Spot Instance request remains active until it expires or you cancel it, even if the
request is fulfilled. If capacity is not available, your Spot Instance is interrupted. After
your instance is interrupted, when capacity becomes available again, the Spot Instance is
started if stopped or resumed if hibernated. You can stop a Spot Instance and start it again
if capacity is available. If the Spot Instance is terminated (irrespective of whether the
Spot Instance is in a stopped or running state), the Spot Instance request is opened again and Amazon EC2
launches a new Spot Instance. For more information, see [Stop a Spot Instance](using-spot-instances-request.md#stopping-a-spot-instance),
[Start a Spot Instance](using-spot-instances-request.md#starting-a-spot-instance), and [Terminate a Spot Instance](using-spot-instances-request.md#terminating-a-spot-instance).

You can track the status of your Spot Instance requests, as well as the status of the Spot Instances
launched, through the status. For more information, see [Get the status of a Spot Instance request](spot-request-status.md).

## Launch Spot Instances in a launch group

Specify a launch group in your Spot Instance request to tell Amazon EC2 to launch a set of Spot Instances only if
it can launch them all. In addition, if the Spot service must terminate one of the
instances in a launch group, it must terminate them all. However, if you terminate
one or more of the instances in a launch group, Amazon EC2 does not terminate the
remaining instances in the launch group.

Although this option can be useful, adding this constraint can decrease the
chances that your Spot Instance request is fulfilled and increase the chances that your Spot Instances
are terminated. For example, your launch group includes instances in multiple
Availability Zones. If capacity in one of these Availability Zones decreases and is
no longer available, then Amazon EC2 terminates all instances for the launch
group.

If you create another successful Spot Instance request that specifies the same (existing)
launch group as an earlier successful request, then the new instances are added to
the launch group. Subsequently, if an instance in this launch group is terminated,
all instances in the launch group are terminated, which includes instances launched
by the first and second requests.

## Launch Spot Instances in an Availability Zone group

Specify an Availability Zone group in your Spot Instance request to tell Amazon EC2 to launch a set of
Spot Instances in the same Availability Zone. Amazon EC2 need not interrupt all instances in an
Availability Zone group at the same time. If Amazon EC2 must interrupt one of the
instances in an Availability Zone group, the others remain running.

Although this option can be useful, adding this constraint can lower the chances
that your Spot Instance request is fulfilled.

If you specify an Availability Zone group but don't specify an Availability Zone
in the Spot Instance request, the result depends on the network you specified.

###### Default VPC

Amazon EC2 uses the Availability Zone for the specified subnet. If you don't
specify a subnet, it selects an Availability Zone and its default subnet, but
not necessarily the lowest-priced zone. If you deleted the default subnet for an
Availability Zone, then you must specify a different subnet.

###### Nondefault VPC

Amazon EC2 uses the Availability Zone for the specified subnet.

## Launch Spot Instances in a VPC

You specify a subnet for your Spot Instances the same way that you specify a subnet for
your On-Demand Instances.

- \[Default VPC\] If you want your Spot Instance launched in a specific low-priced
Availability Zone, you must specify the corresponding subnet in your Spot Instance
request. If you do not specify a subnet, Amazon EC2 selects one for you, and the
Availability Zone for this subnet might not have the lowest Spot
price.

- \[Nondefault VPC\] You must specify the subnet for your Spot Instance.

## Launch burstable performance instances

The T instance types are [burstable\
performance instances](burstable-performance-instances.md). If you launch your Spot Instances using a burstable
performance instance type, and if you plan to use your burstable performance
Spot Instances immediately and for a short duration, with no idle time for accruing CPU credits,
we recommend that you launch them in [Standard mode](burstable-performance-instances-standard-mode.md) to
avoid paying higher costs. If you launch burstable performance Spot Instances in [Unlimited mode](burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode.md) and
burst CPU immediately, you'll spend surplus credits for bursting. If you use the
instance for a short duration, the instance doesn't have time to accrue CPU credits to
pay down the surplus credits, and you are charged for the surplus credits when you
terminate the instance.

Unlimited mode is suitable for burstable performance Spot Instances only if the instance runs long
enough to accrue CPU credits for bursting. Otherwise, paying for surplus credits makes
burstable performance Spot Instances more expensive than using other instances. For more
information, see [When to use unlimited mode versus fixed CPU](burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode-concepts.md#when-to-use-unlimited-mode).

T2 instances, when configured in [Standard mode](burstable-performance-instances-standard-mode.md), get
[launch credits](burstable-performance-instances-standard-mode-concepts.md#launch-credits). T2 instances are the only burstable performance instances that get
launch credits. Launch credits are meant to provide a productive initial launch
experience for T2 instances by providing sufficient compute resources to configure the
instance. Repeated launches of T2 instances to access new launch credits is not
permitted. If you require sustained CPU, you can earn credits (by idling over some
period), use [Unlimited\
mode](burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode.md) for T2 Spot Instances, or use an instance type with dedicated CPU.

## Launch on single-tenant hardware

You can run a Spot Instance on single-tenant hardware. Dedicated Spot Instances are physically
isolated from instances that belong to other AWS accounts. For more information, see
[Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances](dedicated-instance.md) and the
[Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/dedicated-instances).

To run a Dedicated Spot Instance, do one of the following:

- Specify a tenancy of `dedicated` when you create the Spot Instance request.
For more information, see [Manage your Spot Instances](using-spot-instances-request.md).

- Request a Spot Instance in a VPC with an instance tenancy of
`dedicated`. For more information, see [Launch Dedicated Instances into a VPC with default tenancy](dedicatedinstancesintovpc.md).
You can't request a Spot Instance with a tenancy of `default` if you
request it in a VPC with an instance tenancy of
`dedicated`.

All instance families support Dedicated Spot Instances except T instances. For each supported
instance family, only the largest instance size or metal size supports Dedicated
Spot Instances.
