# Create CloudWatch alarms for Amazon EC2 instances that fail status checks
<a name="creating_status_check_alarms"></a>

You can use the [status check metrics](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md#status-check-metrics) to create CloudWatch alarms to notify you when an instance has a failed status check.

Status checks and status check alarms can temporarily enter an *insufficient data* state if there are missing metric data points. Although rare, this can happen when there is an interruption in the metric reporting systems, even when an instance is healthy. We recommend that you treat this state as missing data instead of a status check failure or alarm breach. This is especially important when taking stop, terminate, reboot, or recover actions on the instance in response.

------
#### [ Console ]

This example configures an alarm that sends a notification when an instance fails a status check. You can optionally stop, terminate, or recover the instance.

**To create a status check alarm**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select the instance, choose the **Status Checks** tab, and choose **Actions**, **Create status check alarm**.

1. On the **Manage CloudWatch alarms** page, under **Add or edit alarm**, choose **Create an alarm**.

1. For **Alarm notification**, turn the toggle on to configure Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications. Select an existing Amazon SNS topic or enter a name to create a new topic.

   If you add an email address to the list of recipients or create a new topic, Amazon SNS sends a confirmation email to each new address. Each recipient must choose the confirmation link in the email. Only confirmed addresses receive alert notifications.

1. For **Alarm action**, turn the toggle on to specify an action to take when the alarm is triggered. Select the action.

1. For **Alarm thresholds**, specify the metric and criteria for the alarm.

   You can leave the default settings for **Group samples by** (**Average**) and **Type of data to sample** (**Status check failed:either**), or you can change them to suit your needs.

   For **Consecutive period**, set the number of periods to evaluate and, in **Period**, enter the evaluation period duration before triggering the alarm and sending an email.

1. (Optional) For **Sample metric data**, choose **Add to dashboard**.

1. Choose **Create**.

If you need to change an instance status alarm, you can edit it.

**To edit a status check alarm**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select the instance and choose **Actions**, **Monitoring**, **Manage CloudWatch alarms**.

1. On the **Manage CloudWatch alarms** page, under **Add or edit alarm**, choose **Edit an alarm**.

1. For **Search for alarm**, choose the alarm.

1. When you are finished making changes, choose **Update**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

In the following example, the alarm publishes a notification to an SNS topic when the instance fails either the instance check or system status check for at least two consecutive periods. The CloudWatch metric used is `StatusCheckFailed`.

**To create a status check alarm**

1. Select an existing SNS topic or create a new one. For more information, see [Accessing Amazon SNS in the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-sns.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*.

1. Use the following [list-metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/list-metrics.html) command to view the available Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EC2.

   ```
   aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2
   ```

1. Use the following [put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html) command to create the alarm.

   ```
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
       --alarm-name {{StatusCheckFailed-Alarm-for-i-1234567890abcdef0}} \
       --metric-name StatusCheckFailed \
       --namespace AWS/EC2 \
       --statistic Maximum \
       --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value={{i-1234567890abcdef0}} \
       --unit Count \
       --period 300 \
       --evaluation-periods 2 \
       --threshold 1 \
       --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
       --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:{{us-west-2}}:{{111122223333}}:{{my-sns-topic}}
   ```

   The period is the time frame, in seconds, in which Amazon CloudWatch metrics are collected. This example uses 300, which is 60 seconds multiplied by 5 minutes. The evaluation period is the number of consecutive periods for which the value of the metric must be compared to the threshold. This example uses 2. The alarm actions are the actions to perform when this alarm is triggered.

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To create a status check alarm**
Use the [Write-CWMetricAlarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Write-CWMetricAlarm.html) cmdlet as follows to publish notifications to an SNS topic when the instance fails status checks for at least two consecutive periods.

```
Write-CWMetricAlarm `
    -AlarmName "{{StatusCheckFailed-Alarm-for-i-1234567890abcdef0}}" `
    -MetricName "StatusCheckFailed" `
    -Namespace "AWS/EC2" `
    -Statistic "Maximum" `
    -Dimension @{Name="InstanceId"; Values="{{i-1234567890abcdef0}}"} `
    -Unit "Count" `
    -Period 300 `
    -EvaluationPeriod 2 `
    -Threshold 1 `
    -ComparisonOperator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" `
    -AlarmAction "arn:aws:sns:{{us-west-2}}:{{111122223333}}:{{my-sns-topic}}"
```

The period is the time frame, in seconds, in which Amazon CloudWatch metrics are collected. This example uses 300, which is 60 seconds multiplied by 5 minutes. The evaluation period is the number of consecutive periods for which the value of the metric must be compared to the threshold. This example uses 2. The alarm actions are the actions to perform when this alarm is triggered.
