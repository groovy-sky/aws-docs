# Create CloudWatch alarms for Amazon EC2 instances that fail status checks

You can use the [status check metrics](viewing-metrics-with-cloudwatch.md#status-check-metrics)
to create CloudWatch alarms to notify you when an instance has a failed status
check.

Status checks and status check alarms can temporarily enter an
_insufficient data_ state if there are missing metric
data points. Although rare, this can happen when there is an interruption in the
metric reporting systems, even when an instance is healthy. We recommend that
you treat this state as missing data instead of a status check failure or alarm
breach. This is especially important when taking stop, terminate, reboot, or
recover actions on the instance in response.

Console

This example configures an alarm that sends a notification when an
instance fails a status check. You can optionally stop, terminate, or
recover the instance.

###### To create a status check alarm

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select the instance, choose the **Status**
**Checks** tab, and choose
    **Actions**, **Create status check**
**alarm**.

4. On the **Manage CloudWatch alarms** page,
    under **Add or edit alarm**, choose
    **Create an alarm**.

5. For **Alarm notification**, turn the toggle
    on to configure Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications. Select an
    existing Amazon SNS topic or enter a name to create a new
    topic.

If you add an email address to the list of recipients or
    create a new topic, Amazon SNS sends a confirmation email to each new
    address. Each recipient must choose the confirmation link in the
    email. Only confirmed addresses receive alert
    notifications.

6. For **Alarm action**, turn the toggle on to
    specify an action to take when the alarm is triggered. Select
    the action.

7. For **Alarm thresholds**, specify the metric
    and criteria for the alarm.

You can leave the default settings for **Group samples**
**by** ( **Average**) and
    **Type of data to sample**
    ( **Status check failed:either**), or you
    can change them to suit your needs.

For **Consecutive period**, set the number of
    periods to evaluate and, in **Period**, enter
    the evaluation period duration before triggering the alarm and
    sending an email.

8. (Optional) For **Sample metric data**, choose
    **Add to dashboard**.

9. Choose **Create**.

If you need to change an instance status alarm, you can edit
it.

###### To edit a status check alarm

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select the instance and choose **Actions**,
    **Monitoring**, **Manage CloudWatch**
**alarms**.

4. On the **Manage CloudWatch alarms** page,
    under **Add or edit alarm**, choose
    **Edit an alarm**.

5. For **Search for alarm**, choose the
    alarm.

6. When you are finished making changes, choose
    **Update**.

AWS CLI

In the following example, the alarm publishes a notification to an SNS
topic when the instance fails either the instance check or system status check
for at least two consecutive periods. The CloudWatch metric used is
`StatusCheckFailed`.

###### To create a status check alarm

1. Select an existing SNS topic or create a new one. For more
    information, see [Accessing Amazon SNS in the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-sns.md) in the
    _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

2. Use the following [list-metrics](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/list-metrics.md) command to view the available Amazon CloudWatch
    metrics for Amazon EC2.

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2
```

3. Use the following [put-metric-alarm](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.md) command to create the
    alarm.

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
       --alarm-name StatusCheckFailed-Alarm-for-i-1234567890abcdef0 \
       --metric-name StatusCheckFailed \
       --namespace AWS/EC2 \
       --statistic Maximum \
       --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0 \
       --unit Count \
       --period 300 \
       --evaluation-periods 2 \
       --threshold 1 \
       --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
       --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:111122223333:my-sns-topic
```

The period is the time frame, in seconds, in which Amazon CloudWatch
    metrics are collected. This example uses 300, which is 60
    seconds multiplied by 5 minutes. The evaluation period is the
    number of consecutive periods for which the value of the metric
    must be compared to the threshold. This example uses 2. The
    alarm actions are the actions to perform when this alarm is
    triggered.

PowerShell

###### To create a status check alarm

Use the [Write-CWMetricAlarm](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/write-cwmetricalarm.md)
cmdlet as follows to publish notifications to an SNS topic when
the instance fails status checks for at least two consecutive
periods.

```powershell

Write-CWMetricAlarm `
    -AlarmName "StatusCheckFailed-Alarm-for-i-1234567890abcdef0" `
    -MetricName "StatusCheckFailed" `
    -Namespace "AWS/EC2" `
    -Statistic "Maximum" `
    -Dimension @{Name="InstanceId"; Values="i-1234567890abcdef0"} `
    -Unit "Count" `
    -Period 300 `
    -EvaluationPeriod 2 `
    -Threshold 1 `
    -ComparisonOperator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" `
    -AlarmAction "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:111122223333:my-sns-topic"
```

The period is the time frame, in seconds, in which Amazon CloudWatch
metrics are collected. This example uses 300, which is 60
seconds multiplied by 5 minutes. The evaluation period is the
number of consecutive periods for which the value of the metric
must be compared to the threshold. This example uses 2. The
alarm actions are the actions to perform when this alarm is
triggered.
