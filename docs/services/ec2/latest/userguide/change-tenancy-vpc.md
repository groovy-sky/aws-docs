# Change the instance tenancy of a VPC

You can change the instance tenancy of a virtual private cloud (VPC) from
`dedicated` to `default` after you create it. Modifying the
instance tenancy of a VPC does not affect the tenancy of any existing instances in the
VPC. The next time that you launch an instance in the VPC, it has a tenancy of
`default`, unless you specify otherwise during instance launch.

Alternatively, you can change the tenancy of specific instances. For more information, see
[Change the tenancy of an EC2 instance](dedicated-change-tenancy.md).

###### Limitations

- You can't change the instance tenancy of a VPC from `default` to
`dedicated` after it is created.

- You can't modify the instance tenancy of a VPC using the AWS Management Console.
