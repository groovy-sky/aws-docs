# Secondary IP addresses for your EC2 instances

The first IPv4 address assigned to a network interface is known as the primary IP
address. Secondary IP addresses are additional IPv4 address assigned to a network
interface. For more information, see [Multiple IP addresses](using-instance-addressing.md#multiple-ip-addresses).

You can also assign multiple IPv6 addresses to an instance. For more information, see
[Manage the IPv6 addresses for your EC2 instances](working-with-ipv6-addresses.md).

## Assign secondary IP addresses to an instance

You can assign secondary IP addresses to the network interface for an instance as
you launch the instance, or after the instance is running.

Console

###### To assign a secondary IP address at launch

1. Follow the procedure to [launch an\
    instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md). When you configure [Network Settings](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-network-settings),
    expand **Advanced network**
**configuration**.

2. For **Secondary IP**, choose
    **Automatically assign** and enter the
    number of IP addresses for Amazon EC2 to assign. Alternatively,
    choose **Manually assign** and enter the IPv4
    addresses.

3. Complete the remaining steps to launch the instance.

###### To assign a secondary IP address after launch

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select your instance, and choose **Actions**,
    **Networking**, **Manage IP**
**addresses**.

4. Expand the network interface.

5. To add an IPv4 address, under **IPv4**
**addresses**, choose **Assign new IP**
**address**. Enter an IPv4 address from the range of
    the subnet, or leave the field blank to let Amazon EC2 choose one for
    you.

6. Choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

###### To assign a secondary IP address at launch

Use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command with the
`--secondary-private-ip-addresses` option.

```nohighlight

--secondary-private-ip-addresses 10.251.50.12
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IP address, use the
`--secondary-private-ip-address-count` option instead.
The following example assigns one secondary IP address.

```nohighlight

--secondary-private-ip-address-count 1
```

Alternatively, you can create a network interface. For more
information, see [Create a network interface for your EC2 instance](create-network-interface.md).

###### To assign a secondary IP address after launch

Use the [assign-private-ip-addresses](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/assign-private-ip-addresses.md) command with the
`--private-ip-addresses` option.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface-ids eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --private-ip-addresses 10.251.50.12
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv4 address, use the
`--secondary-private-ip-address-count` parameter instead.
The following example assigns one IPv4 address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface-ids eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --secondary-private-ip-address-count 1
```

PowerShell

###### To assign a secondary IP address at launch

You must create a network interface. For more information, see
[Create a network interface for your EC2 instance](create-network-interface.md).

###### To assign a secondary IP address after launch

Use the [Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/register-ec2privateipaddress.md) cmdlet with the
`-PrivateIpAddress` parameter.

```powershell

Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress `
    -NetworkInterfaceId eni-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -PrivateIpAddress 10.251.50.12
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv4 addresses, use the
`-SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount` parameter instead. The
following example assigns one IPv4 address.

```powershell

Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress `
    -NetworkInterfaceId eni-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount 1
```

## Configure the operating system to use secondary IP addresses

After you assign a secondary IP address to your instance, you must configure the
operating system on your instance to recognize the additional private IPv4
address.

###### Linux instances

- If you are using Amazon Linux, the ec2-net-utils package can take care of this
step for you. It configures additional network interfaces that you attach
while the instance is running, refreshes secondary IPv4 addresses during
DHCP lease renewal, and updates the related routing rules. You can
immediately refresh the list of interfaces by using one of the following
commands, depending on your system:
`sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd` (AL2023) or
`sudo service network restart` (Amazon Linux 2). You can view the
up-to-date list using the following command: `ip addr li`.
If you require manual control over your network configuration, you can
remove the ec2-net-utils package. For more information, see
[Configure your network interface\
using ec2-net-utils](../../../linux/al2/ug/ec2-net-utils.md).

- If you are using another Linux distribution, see the documentation for
your Linux distribution. Search for information about configuring additional
network interfaces and secondary IPv4 addresses. If the instance has two or
more interfaces on the same subnet, search for information about using
routing rules to work around asymmetric routing.

###### Windows instances

For more information, see [Configure secondary private IPv4 addresses for Windows instances](config-windows-multiple-ip.md).

## Unassign a secondary IP address from an instance

If you no longer require a secondary IP address, you can unassign it from the
instance or the network interface. When a secondary private IPv4 address is
unassigned from a network interface, the Elastic IP address (if it exists) is also
disassociated.

Console

###### To unassign a secondary private IPv4 address from an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select an instance, choose **Actions**,
    **Networking**, **Manage IP**
**addresses**.

4. Expand the network interface. For **IPv4**
**addresses**, choose **Unassign**
    for the IPv4 address to unassign.

5. Choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

###### To unassign a secondary private IP address

Use the [unassign-private-ip-addresses](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/unassign-private-ip-addresses.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 unassign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface eni-1234567890abcdef0\
    --private-ip-addresses 10.251.50.12
```

PowerShell

###### To unassign a secondary private IP address

Use the [Unregister-EC2PrivateIpAddress](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/unregister-ec2privateipaddress.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

Unregister-EC2PrivateIpAddress `
    -NetworkInterface eni-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -PrivateIpAddress 10.251.50.12
```
