# Secondary IP addresses for your EC2 instances
<a name="instance-secondary-ip-addresses"></a>

The first IPv4 address assigned to a network interface is known as the primary IP address. Secondary IP addresses are additional IPv4 address assigned to a network interface. For more information, see [Multiple IP addresses](using-instance-addressing.md#multiple-ip-addresses).

You can also assign multiple IPv6 addresses to an instance. For more information, see [Manage the IPv6 addresses for your EC2 instances](working-with-ipv6-addresses.md).

## Assign secondary IP addresses to an instance
<a name="assign-secondary-ip-address"></a>

You can assign secondary IP addresses to the network interface for an instance as you launch the instance, or after the instance is running.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To assign a secondary IP address at launch**

1. Follow the procedure to [launch an instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md). When you configure [Network Settings](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-network-settings), expand **Advanced network configuration**.

1. For **Secondary IP**, choose **Automatically assign** and enter the number of IP addresses for Amazon EC2 to assign. Alternatively, choose **Manually assign** and enter the IPv4 addresses.

1. Complete the remaining steps to launch the instance.

**To assign a secondary IP address after launch**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select your instance, and choose **Actions**, **Networking**, **Manage IP addresses**.

1. Expand the network interface.

1. To add an IPv4 address, under **IPv4 addresses**, choose **Assign new IP address**. Enter an IPv4 address from the range of the subnet, or leave the field blank to let Amazon EC2 choose one for you.

1. Choose **Save**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To assign a secondary IP address at launch**
Use the [run-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command with the `--secondary-private-ip-addresses` option.

```
--secondary-private-ip-addresses {{10.251.50.12}}
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IP address, use the `--secondary-private-ip-address-count` option instead. The following example assigns one secondary IP address.

```
--secondary-private-ip-address-count 1
```

Alternatively, you can create a network interface. For more information, see [Create a network interface for your EC2 instance](create-network-interface.md).

**To assign a secondary IP address after launch**
Use the [assign-private-ip-addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/assign-private-ip-addresses.html) command with the `--private-ip-addresses` option.

```
aws ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface-ids {{eni-1234567890abcdef0}} \
    --private-ip-addresses {{10.251.50.12}}
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv4 address, use the `--secondary-private-ip-address-count` parameter instead. The following example assigns one IPv4 address.

```
aws ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface-ids {{eni-1234567890abcdef0}} \
    --secondary-private-ip-address-count 1
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To assign a secondary IP address at launch**
You must create a network interface. For more information, see [Create a network interface for your EC2 instance](create-network-interface.md).

**To assign a secondary IP address after launch**
Use the [Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress.html) cmdlet with the `-PrivateIpAddress` parameter.

```
Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress `
    -NetworkInterfaceId {{eni-1234567890abcdef0}} `
    -PrivateIpAddress {{10.251.50.12}}
```

To let Amazon EC2 choose the IPv4 addresses, use the `-SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount` parameter instead. The following example assigns one IPv4 address.

```
Register-EC2PrivateIpAddress `
    -NetworkInterfaceId {{eni-1234567890abcdef0}} `
    -SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount 1
```

## Configure the operating system to use secondary IP addresses
<a name="StepTwoConfigOS"></a>

After you assign a secondary IP address to your instance, you must configure the operating system on your instance to recognize the additional private IPv4 address.

**Linux instances**
+ If you are using Amazon Linux, the ec2-net-utils package can take care of this step for you. It configures additional network interfaces that you attach while the instance is running, refreshes secondary IPv4 addresses during DHCP lease renewal, and updates the related routing rules. You can immediately refresh the list of interfaces by using one of the following commands, depending on your system: `sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd` (AL2023) or `sudo service network restart` (Amazon Linux 2). You can view the up-to-date list using the following command: `ip addr li`. If you require manual control over your network configuration, you can remove the ec2-net-utils package. For more information, see [Configure your network interface using ec2-net-utils](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2/ug/ec2-net-utils.html).
+ If you are using another Linux distribution, see the documentation for your Linux distribution. Search for information about configuring additional network interfaces and secondary IPv4 addresses. If the instance has two or more interfaces on the same subnet, search for information about using routing rules to work around asymmetric routing.

**Windows instances**
For more information, see [Configure secondary private IPv4 addresses for Windows instances](config-windows-multiple-ip.md).

## Unassign a secondary IP address from an instance
<a name="unassign-secondary-ip-address"></a>

If you no longer require a secondary IP address, you can unassign it from the instance or the network interface. When a secondary private IPv4 address is unassigned from a network interface, the Elastic IP address (if it exists) is also disassociated.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To unassign a secondary private IPv4 address from an instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select an instance, choose **Actions**, **Networking**, **Manage IP addresses**.

1. Expand the network interface. For **IPv4 addresses**, choose **Unassign** for the IPv4 address to unassign.

1. Choose **Save**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To unassign a secondary private IP address**
Use the [unassign-private-ip-addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/unassign-private-ip-addresses.html) command.

```
aws ec2 unassign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface {{eni-1234567890abcdef0}}\
    --private-ip-addresses {{10.251.50.12}}
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To unassign a secondary private IP address**
Use the [Unregister-EC2PrivateIpAddress](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Unregister-EC2PrivateIpAddress.html) cmdlet.

```
Unregister-EC2PrivateIpAddress `
    -NetworkInterface {{eni-1234567890abcdef0}} `
    -PrivateIpAddress {{10.251.50.12}}
```
