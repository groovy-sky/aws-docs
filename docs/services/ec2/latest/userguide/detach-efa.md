You can detach an EFA from an Amazon EC2 instance and delete it in the same way as any other elastic network interface in Amazon EC2.

To detach an EFA from an instance, you must first stop the instance. You cannot detach an EFA from an instance that is in the running state.

You detach an EFA from an instance in the same way that you detach an elastic network interface from an instance. For more information, see [Detach a network interface](network-interface-attachments.md#detach_eni).
