# State changes for a Spot request

The following diagram shows you the paths that your Spot request can follow throughout its
lifecycle, from submission to termination. Each step is depicted as a node, and the
status code for each node describes the status of the Spot request and Spot Instance.

###### Pending evaluation

As soon as you create a Spot Instance request, it goes into the `pending-evaluation`
state unless one or more request parameters are not valid
( `bad-parameters`).

###### Holding

If one or more request constraints are valid but can't be met yet, or if there is not
enough capacity, the request goes into a holding state waiting for the
constraints to be met. The request options affect the likelihood of the request
being fulfilled. For example, if there is no capacity, your request stays in a
holding state until there is available capacity. If you specify an Availability
Zone group, the request stays in a holding state until the Availability Zone
constraint is met.

In the event of an outage of one of the Availability Zones, there is a chance that
the spare EC2 capacity available for Spot Instance requests in other Availability Zones can
be affected.

###### Pending evaluation/fulfillment-terminal

Your Spot Instance request can go to a `terminal` state if you create a
request that is valid only during a specific time period and this time period
expires before your request reaches the pending fulfillment phase. It might also
happen if you cancel the request, or if a system error occurs.

###### Pending fulfillment

When the constraints you specified (if any) are met, your Spot request goes into the
`pending-fulfillment` state.

At this point, Amazon EC2 is getting ready to provision the instances that you
requested. If the process stops at this point, it is likely to be because it was
canceled by the user before a Spot Instance was launched. It might also be because an
unexpected system error occurred.

###### Fulfilled

When all the specifications for your Spot Instances are met, your Spot request is
fulfilled. Amazon EC2 launches the Spot Instances, which can take a few minutes. If a Spot Instance is
hibernated or stopped when interrupted, it remains in this state until the
request can be fulfilled again or the request is canceled.

Status codeRequest stateInstance state`fulfilled``active``pending` → `running``fulfilled``active``stopped` → `running`

If you stop a Spot Instance, your Spot request goes into the `marked-for-stop` or
`instance-stopped-by-user` state until the Spot Instance can be started again
or the request is cancelled.

Status codeRequest stateInstance state`marked-for-stop``active``stopping``instance-stopped-by-user` ¹
`disabled` or `cancelled` ²
`stopped`

¹ A Spot Instance goes into the `instance-stopped-by-user` state if you stop the instance
or run the shutdown command from the instance. After you've stopped the instance,
you can start it again. On restart, the Spot Instance request returns to the
`pending-evaluation` state and then Amazon EC2 launches a new Spot Instance when
the constraints are met.

² The Spot request state is `disabled` if you stop the Spot Instance but do not cancel
the request. The request state is `cancelled` if your Spot Instance is stopped and
the request expires.

###### Fulfilled-terminal

Your Spot Instances continue to run as long as there is available capacity for your instance type,
and you don't terminate the instance. If Amazon EC2 must terminate your Spot Instances, the
Spot request goes into a terminal state. A request also goes into the terminal
state if you cancel the Spot request or terminate the Spot Instances.

`running` †
`instance-terminated-no-capacity``closed` (one-time), `open` (persistent) `terminated``instance-terminated-launch-group-constraint``closed` (one-time), `open` (persistent)
`terminated`

¹ The request state is `closed` if you terminate the instance but do not
cancel the request. The request state is `cancelled` if you terminate the
instance and cancel the request. Even if you terminate a Spot Instance before you cancel its
request, there might be a delay before Amazon EC2 detects that your Spot Instance was terminated.
In this case, the request state can either be `closed` or
`cancelled`.

† When Amazon EC2 interrupts a Spot Instance if it needs the capacity back _and_ the instance is configured to _terminate_ on interruption, the status is immediately set to
`instance-terminated-no-capacity` (it is not set to
`marked-for-termination`). However, the instance remains in the
`running` state for 2 minutes to reflect the 2-minute period when the
instance receives the Spot Instance interruption notice. After 2 minutes, the instance state
is set to `terminated`.

###### Interruption experiments

You can use AWS Fault Injection Service to initiate a Spot Instance interruption so that you can test how
the applications on your Spot Instances respond. If AWS FIS stops a Spot Instance, your Spot request
enters the `marked-for-stop-by-experiment` state and then the
`instance-stopped-by-experiment` state. If AWS FIS terminates a Spot Instance,
your Spot request enters the `instance-terminated-by-experiment`
state. For more information, see [Initiate a Spot Instance interruption](initiate-a-spot-instance-interruption.md).

###### Persistent requests

When your Spot Instances are terminated (either by you or Amazon EC2), if the Spot request
is a persistent request, it returns to the `pending-evaluation` state
and then Amazon EC2 can launch a new Spot Instance when the constraints are met.
