# Create a Capacity Reservation

You can create a Capacity Reservation at any time to ensure that you have compute capacity available
in a specific Availability Zone. A Capacity Reservation can start immediately, or it can
start at a future date. The capacity becomes available for use only once the Capacity Reservation enters
the `active` state.

###### Note

If you create a Capacity Reservation with `open` instance matching criteria, and you
have running instances with matching attributes at the time the Capacity Reservation becomes active,
those instances automatically run in the reserved capacity. To avoid this, use
`targeted` instance matching criteria. For more information, see
[Instance matching criteria](cr-concepts.md#cr-instance-eligibility).

Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if one of the following is true:

- Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity to fulfill the request. Either try
again at a later time, try a different Availability Zone, or try a smaller
request. If your application is flexible across instance types and sizes, try
different instance attributes.

- The requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance limit for the selected instance
family. Increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the instance family and try again. For
more information, see [On-Demand Instance quotas](ec2-on-demand-instances.md#ec2-on-demand-instances-limits).

## Create a Capacity Reservation for immediate use

You create a Capacity Reservation for immediate use.

Console

###### To create a Capacity Reservation

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Choose **Capacity Reservations**, and then choose
    **Create Capacity Reservation**.

3. Configure the following settings in the **Instance**
**details** section.
1. **Instance Type** — The
       instance type for which to reserve capacity.

2. **Platform** — The operating
       system for your instances. For more information, see
       [Supported platforms](ec2-capacity-reservations.md#capacity-reservations-platforms).

3. **Availability Zone** — The
       Availability Zone in which to reserve the
       capacity.

4. **Tenancy** — The type of
       tenancy to use for the reserved capacity. Choose Default
       to reserve capacity on shared hardware, or Dedicated to
       reserve capacity on hardware that is dedicated to your
       account.

5. ( _Optional_) **Placement**
      **group ARN** — The ARN of the cluster
       placement group in which to create the Capacity Reservation. For more
       information, see [Use Capacity Reservations with cluster placement groups](cr-cpg.md).

6. **Total instance count** — The
       number of instances for which to reserve capacity. If
       you specify a quantity that exceeds your remaining On-Demand Instance
       quota for the selected instance type, the request
       fails.
4. Configure the following settings in the **Reservation**
**details** section:
1. **Capacity Reservation starts** — Choose
       **Immediately**.

2. **Capacity Reservation ends** — Choose one of
       the following options:

- **Manually** — Reserve
the capacity until you explicitly cancel
it.

- **Specific time** —
Cancel the capacity reservation automatically at
the specified date and time.

3. **Instance eligibility** —
       Choose one of the following options:

- **open** — (Default)
The Capacity Reservation matches any instance that has matching
attributes (instance type, platform, Availability
Zone, and tenancy). If you launch an instance with
matching attributes, it is placed into the
reserved capacity automatically.

- **targeted** — The
Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching
attributes (instance type, platform, Availability
Zone, and tenancy), and that explicitly target the
reservation.
5. Choose **Create**.

AWS CLI

###### To create a Capacity Reservation

Use the [create-capacity-reservation](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-capacity-reservation.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
    --availability-zone az_name \
    --instance-type instance_type \
    --instance-count number_of_instances \
    --instance-platform operating_system \
    --instance-match-criteria open|targeted
```

PowerShell

###### To create a Capacity Reservation

Use the [Add-EC2CapacityReservation](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/add-ec2capacityreservation.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

Add-EC2CapacityReservation `
    -AvailabilityZone az_name `
    -InstanceType instance_type `
    -InstanceCount number_of_instances `
    -InstancePlatform operating_system `
    -InstanceMatchCriterion open|targeted
```

## Create a future-dated Capacity Reservation

Request a future-dated Capacity Reservation if you need the reserved capacity to become available
at a future date and time.

After you request a future-dated Capacity Reservation, the request undergoes an assessment to
determine whether it can be supported. For more information, see [Future-dated Capacity Reservation assessment](cr-concepts.md#cr-future-dated-assessment).

###### Considerations

- You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for instance types in the following series:
C, G, I, M, R, and T.

- You can request future-dated Capacity Reservations for an instance count with a minimum of 32 vCPUs. For
example, if you request a future-dated Capacity Reservation for `m5.xlarge`
instances, you must request capacity for at least 8 instances ( _8 \*_
_m5.xlarge = 32 vCPUs_).

- You can request a future-dated Capacity Reservation between 5 and 120 days in advance.
However, we recommend that you request it at least 56 days (8 weeks) in
advance to improve supportability.

- The minimum commitment duration is 14 days.
