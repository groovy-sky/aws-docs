# Create a network interface for your EC2 instance

You can create a network interface for use by your EC2 instances. When you create a network
interface, you specify the subnet for which it is created. You can't move a network
interface to another subnet after it's created. You must attach a network interface to
an instance in the same Availability Zone. You can detach a secondary network interface
from an instance and then attach it to a different instance in the same Availability
Zone. You can't detach a primary network interface from an instance. For more
information, see [Network interface attachments for your EC2 instance](network-interface-attachments.md).

Console

###### To create a network interface

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Network**
    **Interfaces**.

03. Choose **Create network interface**.

04. (Optional) For **Description**, enter a descriptive name.

05. For **Subnet**, select a subnet. The options available in the subsequent steps change depending on the type of subnet you select (IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6)).

06. For **Interface type**, choose one of the following:

- **ENA**: A high-performance network interface designed to handle high throughput and packet-per-second rates for TCP/IP protocols while minimizing CPU usage. This is the default value. For more information about ENA, see [Elastic Network Adapter](enhanced-networking-ena.md).

- **EFA with ENA**: A network interface that supports both ENA and EFA devices for traditional TCP/IP based transport along with SRD based transport. If you choose EFA with ENA, the instance you are attaching it to must [support EFA](efa.md#efa-instance-types). For more information about EFA, see [Elastic Fabric Adapter](efa.md).

- **EFA-only**: A high-performance network interface designed to handle high
throughput, low latency inter-node communication for SRD
based transport while bypassing the operating system stack.
If you choose this option, the instance you are attaching it
to must [support\
EFA](efa.md#efa-instance-types). EFA-only network interfaces do not support
IP addresses. For more information about EFA, see [Elastic Fabric Adapter](efa.md).

07. For **Private IPv4 address**, do one of the following:
    - Choose **Auto-assign** to allow Amazon EC2 to
       select an IPv4 address from the subnet.

    - Choose **Custom** and enter an IPv4 address
       that you select from the subnet.
08. (Subnets with IPv6 addresses only) For **IPv6 address**,
     do one of the following:
    - Choose **None** if you do not want to assign an
       IPv6 address to the network interface.

    - Choose **Auto-assign** to allow Amazon EC2 to
       select an IPv6 address from the subnet.

    - Choose **Custom** and enter an IPv6 address
       that you select from the subnet.
09. (Optional) If you’re creating a network interface in a dual-stack or IPv6-only subnet,
     you have the option to **Assign Primary IPv6**
    **IP**. This assigns a primary IPv6 global unicast
     address (GUA) to the network interface. Assigning a primary IPv6
     address enables you to avoid disrupting traffic to instances or
     ENIs. Choose **Enable** if the instance that
     this ENI will be attached to relies on its IPv6 address not
     changing. AWS will automatically assign an IPv6 address
     associated with the ENI attached to your instance to be the
     primary IPv6 address. Once you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be
     a primary IPv6, you can't disable it. When you enable an IPv6
     GUA address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA will be
     made the primary IPv6 address until the instance is terminated
     or the network interface is detached. If you have multiple IPv6
     addresses associated with an ENI attached to your instance and
     you enable a primary IPv6 address, the first IPv6 GUA address
     associated with the ENI becomes the primary IPv6 address.

10. (Optional) To create an Elastic Fabric Adapter, choose **Elastic Fabric Adapter**,
     **Enable**.

11. (Optional) Under **Advanced settings**, you can optionally set
     IP prefix delegation. For more information, see [Prefix delegation](ec2-prefix-eni.md).

- **Auto-assign** — AWS chooses the prefix
from the IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks for the subnet, and assigns it to
the network interface.

- **Custom** — You specify the prefix from
the IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks for the subnet, and AWS verifies that
the prefix is not already assigned to other resources before assigning
it to the network interface.

12. (Optional) Under **Advanced settings**, for **Idle connection**
    **tracking timeout**, modify the default idle
     connection timeouts. For more information, see
     [Idle connection tracking timeout](security-group-connection-tracking.md#connection-tracking-timeouts).

- **TCP established timeout**: Timeout (in seconds) for idle TCP
connections in an established state.

- Min: `60` seconds

- Max: `432000` seconds

- Default: `350` seconds for [Nitrov6](../instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.md)
instance types, excluding P6e-GB200. And `432000` seconds for other instance types, including P6e-GB200.

- Recommended: Less than `432000` seconds

- **UDP timeout**: Timeout (in seconds) for idle UDP flows that
have seen traffic only in a single direction or a single request-response transaction.

- Min: `30` seconds

- Max: `60` seconds

- Default: `30` seconds

- **UDP stream timeout**: Timeout (in seconds) for idle UDP flows
classified as streams which have seen more than one request-response transaction.

- Min: `60` seconds

- Max: `180` seconds

- Default: `180` seconds

13. For **Security groups**, select one or more security
     groups.

14. (Optional) For each tag, choose **Add new tag** and enter
     a tag key and an optional tag value.

15. Choose **Create network interface**.

```

PowerShell

###### Example 1: To create a network interface with IP addresses chosen by Amazon EC2

Use the [New-EC2NetworkInterface](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2networkinterface.md)
cmdlet. This example creates a network interface with a public IPv4 address
and an IPv6 address chosen by Amazon EC2.

```powershell

New-EC2NetworkInterface `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -Description "my dual-stack network interface" `
    -Ipv6AddresCount 1 `
    -Group sg-1234567890abcdef0
```

###### Example 2: To create a network interface with specific IP addresses

Use the [New-EC2NetworkInterface](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2networkinterface.md)
cmdlet.

```powershell

New-EC2NetworkInterface `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -Description "my dual-stack network interface" `
    -PrivateIpAddress 10.251.50.12 `
    -Ipv6Address $ipv6addr `
    -Group sg-1234567890abcdef0
```

Define the IPv6 addresses as follows.

```powershell

$ipv6addr = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.InstanceIpv6Address
$ipv6addr1.Ipv6Address = "2001:db8::1234:5678:1.2.3.4"
```

###### Example 3: To create a network interface with a count of secondary IP addresses

Use the [New-EC2NetworkInterface](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2networkinterface.md)
cmdlet. In this example, Amazon EC2 chooses both the primary IP address and
the secondary IP addresses.

```powershell

New-EC2NetworkInterface `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -Description "my network interface" `
    -SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount 2 `
    -Group sg-1234567890abcdef0
```

###### Example 4: To create a network interface with a specific secondary IP address

Use the [New-EC2NetworkInterface](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2networkinterface.md)
cmdlet. This example specifies a primary IP address and a secondary IP address.
