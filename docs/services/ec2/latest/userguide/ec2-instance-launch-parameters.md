# Reference for Amazon EC2 instance configuration parameters

The launch instance wizard and launch template in the Amazon EC2 console provide all the
parameters for configuring an Amazon EC2 instance.

Except for the key pair, the launch instance wizard provides a default value for each
parameter. You can accept any or all of the defaults, or configure an instance with your own
values. When creating a launch template, the parameters are optional. If you use a launch
template to launch an instance, the parameters specified in the launch template override the
default values in the launch instance wizard. Any parameter not specified in the launch
template will default to the value provided by the launch instance wizard.

The parameters are grouped in the launch instance wizard and launch template. The
following descriptions are presented according to the parameter groupings in the
console.

###### Parameters for instance configuration

- [Name and tags](#liw-name-and-tags)

- [Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)](#liw-ami)

- [Instance type](#liw-instance-type)

- [Key pair (login)](#liw-key-pair)

- [Network settings](#liw-network-settings)

- [Configure storage](#liw-storage)

- [Advanced details](#liw-advanced-details)

- [Summary](#liw-summary)

## Name and tags

The instance name is a tag, where the key is **Name**, and the value
is the name that you specify. You can tag the instance, volumes, and network interfaces.
For Spot Instances, you can tag the Spot Instance request only. For information about tags, see [Tag your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html).

Specifying an instance name and additional tags is optional.

- For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the instance. If
you don't specify a name, the instance can be identified by its ID, which is
automatically generated when you launch the instance.

- To add additional tags, choose **Add additional tags**.
Choose **Add tag**, and then enter a key and value, and select
the resource type to tag. Choose **Add tag** again for each
additional tag to add.

You can only specify the instance name when launch an instance. You can't name the
instance when you create a launch template, but you can add tags for the resources that
are created when the instance is launched.

## Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) contains the information required to create an instance.
For example, an AMI might contain the software that's required to act as a web server,
such as Linux, Apache, and your website.

You can find a suitable AMI as follows. With each option for finding an AMI, you can
choose **Cancel** (at top right) to return to the launch instance
wizard without choosing an AMI.

**Search bar**

To search through all available AMIs, enter a keyword in the AMI search
bar and then press **Enter**. To select an AMI, choose
**Select**.

**Recents**

The AMIs that you've recently used.

Choose **Recently launched** or **Currently in**
**use**, and then, from **Amazon Machine Image**
**(AMI)**, select an AMI.

**My AMIs**

The private AMIs that you own, or private AMIs that have been shared with
you.

Choose **Owned by me** or **Shared with**
**me**, and then, from **Amazon Machine Image**
**(AMI)**, select an AMI.

**Quick**
**Start**

AMIs are grouped by operating system (OS) to help you get started
quickly.

First select the OS that you need, and then, from **Amazon Machine**
**Image (AMI)**, select an AMI. To select an AMI that can be used
under the AWS Free Tier, make sure that the AMI is marked **Free**
**tier eligible**.

**Browse more AMIs**

Choose **Browse more AMIs** to browse the full AMI
catalog.

- To search through all available AMIs, enter a keyword in the
search bar and then press **Enter**.

- To find an AMI by using a Systems Manager parameter, choose the arrow button
to the right of the search bar, and then choose **Search by**
**Systems Manager parameter**. For more information, see [Reference AMIs using Systems Manager parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-systems-manager-parameter-to-find-AMI.html).

- To search by category, choose **Quickstart**
**AMIs**, **My AMIs**, **AWS Marketplace**
**AMIs**, or **Community AMIs**.

The AWS Marketplace is an online store where you can buy software that runs
on AWS, including AMIs. For more information about launching an
instance from the AWS Marketplace, see [Launch an Amazon EC2 instance from an AWS Marketplace AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launch-marketplace-console.html). In
**Community AMIs**, you can find AMIs that
AWS community members have made available for others to use. AMIs
from Amazon or a verified partner are marked **Verified**
**provider**.

- To filter the list of AMIs, select one or more check boxes under
**Refine results** on the left of the screen.
The filter options are different depending on the selected search
category.

- Check the **Root device type** listed for each
AMI. Notice which AMIs are the type that you need: either
**ebs** (backed by Amazon EBS) or
**instance-store** (backed by instance store).
For more information, see [Root volume type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html#storage-for-the-root-device).

- Check the **Virtualization** type listed for each
AMI. Notice which AMIs are the type that you need: either
**hvm** or **paravirtual**.
For example, some instance types require HVM. For more information
about Linux virtualization types, see [Virtualization types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html#virtualization_types).

- Check the **Boot mode** listed for each AMI.
Notice which AMIs use the boot mode that you need: either
**legacy-bios**, **uefi**, or
**uefi-preferred**. For more information, see
[Instance launch behavior with Amazon EC2 boot modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-boot.html).

- Choose an AMI that meets your needs, and then choose
**Select**.

###### Warning when changing the AMI

When you launch an instance, if you modify the configuration of any volumes or
security groups associated with the selected AMI, and then you choose a different
AMI, a window opens to warn you that some of your current settings will be changed
or removed. You can review the changes to the security groups and volumes.
Furthermore, you can either view which volumes will be added and deleted, or view
only the volumes that will be added. This warning does not appear when creating a
launch template.

## Instance type

The instance type defines the hardware configuration and size of the instance. Larger
instance types have more CPU and memory. For more information, see [Amazon EC2\
instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/instance-types.html).

- **Instance type**: Ensure that the instance type is
compatible with the AMI that you've specified. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html).

**Free Tier** – You can
use instance types that are labeled **Free tier eligible** for
free under the Free Tier. The specific instance types depend on when you created
your AWS account.

If your created your AWS account before July 15, 2025 and
it's less than 12 months old, you can use Amazon EC2 under the Free Tier by
selecting the **t2.micro** instance type, or the
**t3.micro** instance type in Regions where
**t2.micro** is unavailable. Be aware that when you launch
a **t3.micro** instance, it defaults to [Unlimited mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode.html), which might incur
additional charges based on CPU usage.

If you created your AWS account on or after July 15, 2025, you can use
**t3.micro**, **t3.small**,
**t4g.micro**, **t4g.small**,
**c7i-flex.large**, and **m7i-flex.large**
instance types for 6 months or until your credits are used up.

For more information, see [Free Tier benefits before and after July 15, 2025](ec2-free-tier-usage.md#ec2-free-tier-comparison).

- **Compare instance types**: You can compare different
instance types by the following attributes: number of vCPUs, architecture,
amount of memory (GiB), amount of storage (GB), storage type, and network
performance.

- **Get advice**: You can get guidance and suggestions for
instance types from the EC2 instance type finder. For more information, see [Get recommendations from EC2 instance type finder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-ec2-instance-type-recommendations.html).

- (Launch templates only) **Advanced**: To specify instance
attributes and let Amazon EC2 identify the instance types with those attributes,
choose **Advanced**, and then choose **Specify instance**
**type attributes**.

- **Number of vCPUs**: Enter the minimum and maximum
number of vCPUs for your compute requirements. To indicate no limits,
enter a minimum of `0`, and leave the maximum
blank.

- **Amount of memory (MiB)**: Enter the minimum and
maximum amount of memory, in MiB, for your compute requirements. To
indicate no limits, enter a minimum of `0`, and
leave the maximum blank.

- Expand **Optional instance type attributes** and
choose **Add attribute** to express your compute
requirements in more detail. For information about each attribute, see
[InstanceRequirementsRequest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_InstanceRequirementsRequest.html) in the _Amazon EC2 API Reference_.

- **Resulting instance types**: You can preview the
instance types that match the specified attributes. To exclude instance
types, choose **Add attribute**, and from the
**Attribute** list, choose **Excluded**
**instance types**. From the **Attribute**
**value** list, select the instance types to exclude.

## Key pair (login)

For **Key pair name**, choose an existing key pair, or choose
**Create new key pair** to create a new one. For more information,
see [Amazon EC2 key pairs and Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).

###### Important

If you choose the **Proceed without key pair (Not recommended)**
option, you won't be able to connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that
is configured to allow users another way to log in.

## Network settings

The network settings define the [IP addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html),
[security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html), and
[network interfaces](using-eni.md) for your instances. You can use the
default network settings or configure them as needed.

- (Launch instance wizard only) **VPC**: Choose an existing VPC
for your instance. The default VPC for the Region is selected by default. Alternatively,
you can choose a VPC that you created or that was shared with you. For
more information, see [Virtual private clouds for your EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html).

- **Subnet**: Choose a subnet for your instance or choose
**Create new subnet** to create a new subnet using the Amazon VPC
console.

- You can create a subnet in any Availability Zone, Local Zone,
Wavelength Zone, or Outpost Zone for the selected VPC.

- To launch the instance in an IPv6-only subnet, the instance must be a
[Nitro-based instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-hypervisor-type).

- (Launch instance wizard only) **Auto-assign Public IP**:
Enable or disable auto-assignment of public IPv4 addresses. When launching
instances into a default subnet, the default value is **Enable**.
When launching instances into a nondefault subnet the default value is
**Disable**. For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses).

You can't enable this option for nondefault subnets if you add a secondary
network interface. For more information, see [Assign a public IPv4 address at launch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-ip-addresses.html#public-ip-addresses).

- (Launch instance wizard only) **Auto-assign IPv6 IP**:
Enable or disable auto-assignment of IPv6 addresses. For more information,
see [IPv6 addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#ipv6-addressing).

- **Firewall (security groups)**: Choose an existing security group
or create a new one. Ensure that your security group has rules that allow traffic
to and from your instances. All other traffic is ignored.

If you create a new security group, we automatically create an inbound rule
that allows you to connect to your instance from all IP addresses over SSH (Linux instances)
or RDP (Windows instances. You can remove or modify this rule as needed. You can
add rules as needed. For more information, see [Configure security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/changing-security-group.html#add-remove-security-group-rules).

###### Warning

Rules that enable all IP addresses to access your instance over SSH or RDP
are acceptable if you are briefly launching a test instance and will stop or
terminate it after a short time. They are unsafe for production environments.
You should authorize only a specific IP address range to access your instances.

This security group is added to the primary network interface and any secondary
network interfaces. You can select additional security groups for your network
interfaces, but you can't remove the one that you select here.

- **Advanced network configuration** – You can configure
the primary network interface as needed. To add a secondary network interface,
choose **Add network interface**. The number of network interfaces
that you can add depends on the instance type that you selected. Note that this
section is available only if you choose a subnet.

- **Device index**: The device index. The
primary network interface must be assigned to index 0.

- **Network interface**: The network interface. Select
**New interface** to let Amazon EC2 create a new interface,
or select an existing, available network interface. If you select an
existing network interface as the primary network interface, you can't
enable **Auto-assign Public IP** for nondefault subnets.

- **Description**: A description for the new
network interface.

- **Subnet**: The subnet in which to create the new
network interface. The instance is launched in the same subnet as the
primary network interface.

You must choose a subnet for a secondary network interface from the
same Availability Zone as the subnet for the primary network interface.
If you select a subnet from another VPC, the label **Multi-VPC**
appears next to the network interface. This enables you to create
multi-homed instances across VPCs with different networking and
security configurations.

To launch an EC2 instance into an IPv6-only subnet, you must use
a [Nitro-based instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-hypervisor-type). When launching an IPv6-only instance, it is
possible that DHCPv6 might not immediately provide the instance with
the IPv6 DNS name server. During this initial delay, the instance might
not resolve public domains. You can change the configuration file and
re-image your AMI so that the file has the IPv6 DNS name server address
immediately on booting.

- **Security groups**: The security groups to
associate with the network interface. You must choose a security group
from the same VPC as the subnet for the network interface.

- (Launch templates only) **Auto-assign public IP**:
Specify whether your instance receives a public IPv4 address. By
default, instances in a default subnet receive a public IPv4 address and
instances in a nondefault subnet do not. You can select
**Enable** or **Disable** to
override the subnet's default setting. For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses).

- **Primary IP**: A private IPv4 address from the range
of your subnet. Leave blank to let Amazon EC2 choose a private IPv4 address
for you.

- **Secondary IP**: Additional private IPv4 addresses
from the range of your subnet. Choose **Manually**
**assign** and enter an IPv4 address. Choose **Add**
**IP** to add another IPv4 address. Alternatively, choose
**Automatically assign** and enter a value to
indicate the number of IPv4 addresses that Amazon EC2 chooses for you.

- (IPv6-only) **IPv6 IPs**: IPv6 addresses from the
range of the subnet. Choose **Manually assign** and
enter an IPv6 address. Choose **Add IP** to add another
IPv6 address. Alternatively, choose **Automatically**
**assign** and enter a value to indicate the number of IPv6
addresses that Amazon EC2 chooses for you.

- **IPv4 Prefixes**: The IPv4 prefixes for the network
interface. Choose **Manually assign** and enter an IPv4
prefix. Alternatively, choose **Automatically assign**
and enter a value to indicate the number of IPv4 prefixes that Amazon EC2
chooses for you.

- **IPv6 Prefixes**: The IPv6 prefixes for the network
interface. Choose **Manually assign** and enter an IPv6
prefix. Alternatively, choose **Automatically assign**
and enter a value to indicate the number of IPv6 prefixes that Amazon EC2
chooses for you.

- (Dual-stack and IPv6-only) **Assign Primary IPv6 IP**:
If you select a dual-stack or IPv6-only subnet, assign a primary IPv6
address. This helps prevent disruptions to traffic to the instance or
network interface. Enable this option if you rely on the IPv6 address
not changing. You can't remove the primary IPv6 address later on. When
you enable an IPv6 GUA address to be a primary IPv6, the first IPv6 GUA
becomes the primary IPv6 address until the instance is terminated or the
network interface is detached. If you have multiple IPv6 addresses
associated with a network interface and you let Amazon EC2 assign a primary
IPv6 address, the first IPv6 GUA address associated with the network
interface is the primary IPv6 address.

- **Delete on termination**: Indicates whether the
network interface is deleted when the instance is deleted.

- **Interface type**: The network interface
type:

- **ENA**: A high-performance network interface designed to handle high throughput and packet-per-second rates for TCP/IP protocols while minimizing CPU usage. This is the default value. For more information about ENA, see [Elastic Network Adapter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking-ena.html).

- **EFA with ENA**: A network interface that supports both ENA and EFA devices for traditional TCP/IP based transport along with SRD based transport. For more information about EFA, see [Elastic Fabric Adapter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html).

- **EFA-only**: A high-performance network interface designed to handle high
throughput, low latency inter-node communication for SRD based
transport while bypassing the operating system stack. EFA-only
network interfaces do not support IP addresses. For more
information about EFA, see [Elastic Fabric\
Adapter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html).

- **Elastic Fabric Adapter**: Indicates whether the network
interface is an Elastic Fabric Adapter. For more information, see [Elastic Fabric Adapter for AI/ML and HPC workloads on Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html).

- **Network card index**: The index of the network
card. The primary network interface must be assigned to network card
index 0. Some instance types support [multiple network cards](using-eni.md#network-cards).

- **ENA Express**: ENA Express is powered by AWS Scalable Reliable Datagram (SRD) technology.
SRD technology uses a packet spraying mechanism to distribute load and avoid network
congestion. Enabling
ENA Express allows supported instances to communicate using SRD on top
of regular TCP traffic when possible. The launch instance wizard or
launch template does not include ENA Express configuration for the
instance unless you select **Enable** or
**Disable** from the list.

- **ENA Express UDP**: If you've enabled ENA Express,
you can optionally use it for UDP traffic. The launch instance wizard or
launch template does not include ENA Express configuration for the
instance unless you select **Enable** or
**Disable**.

## Configure storage

The AMI you selected includes one or more volumes of storage, including the root
volume. You can specify additional volumes to attach to the instance.

(Launch instance wizard only) You can use the **Simple** or
**Advanced** view. With the **Simple** view, you
specify the size and type of the volume. To specify all volume parameters, choose the
**Advanced** view (at top right of the card).

By using the **Advanced** view, you can configure each volume as
follows:

- **Storage type**: Select Amazon EBS or instance store volumes to
associate with your instance. The volume types available in the list depend on
the instance type that you've chosen. For more information, see [Instance store temporary block storage for EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html) and [Amazon EBS\
volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volumes.html).

- **Device name**: Select from the list of available device
names for the volume.

- **Snapshot**: Select the snapshot from which to restore the
volume. You can search for available shared and public snapshots by entering
text into the **Snapshot** field.

- **Size (GiB)**: For EBS volumes, you can specify a storage
size.

- **Volume type**: For EBS volumes, select a volume type. For
more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md)
in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

- **IOPS**: If you have selected the io1, io2 , or or gp3 volume
type, then you can enter the number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the
volume can support. Required for io1, io2, and gp3 volumes. Not supported for gp2,
st1, sc1, or standard volumes. If you omit this paramater for the launch template,
you must specify a value for it when you launch an instance from the launch
template.

- **Delete on termination**: For Amazon EBS volumes, choose
**Yes** to delete the volume when the instance is
terminated, or choose **No** to keep the volume. For more
information, see [Preserve data when an instance is terminated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/preserving-volumes-on-termination.html).

- **Encrypted**: If the instance type supports EBS encryption,
you can choose **Yes** to enable encryption for the volume. If
you have enabled encryption by default in this Region, encryption is enabled for
you. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

- **KMS key**: If you selected **Yes** for
**Encrypted**, then you must select a customer managed key to use to
encrypt the volume. If you have enabled encryption by default in this Region,
the default customer managed key is selected for you. You can select a different key or
specify the ARN of any customer managed key that you created.

- **Throughput**: If you have selected the `gp3` volume type,
then you can enter the throughput, in MiB/s, that the volume can support.

- **Volume initialization rate**: If you have selected a snapshot,
you can optionally specify the volume initialization rate, in MiB/s, at which the
snapshot blocks are to be downloaded from Amazon S3 to the volume. For more information,
see [Use an Amazon EBS Provisioned Rate for Volume Initialization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/initalize-volume.html#volume-initialization-rate). To use the default
initialization rate or fast snapshot restore (if it is enabled for the selected
snapshot), don't specify a rate.

- **File systems**: Mount an Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx file system to the
instance. For more information about mounting an Amazon EFS file system, see [Use Amazon EFS with Amazon EC2 Linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEFS.html). For more information about

**Enable** to enable the instance for AWS Nitro Enclaves.
For more information, see [What is AWS Nitro\
Enclaves?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html) in the _AWS Nitro Enclaves User_
_Guide_.

- **License configurations**: You can launch instances against
the specified license configuration to track your license usage. For more
information, see [Create a license configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/create-license-configuration.html) in the _AWS_
_License Manager User Guide_.

- **Specify CPU options**: In the launch instance wizard, this
field is only visible if the selected instance type supports specifying CPU
options. Choose **Specify CPU options** to specify a custom
number of vCPUs during launch. Set the number of CPU cores and threads per core.
For more information, see [CPU options for Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-optimize-cpu.html).

- **Metadata accessible**: You can enable or disable access to
the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). For more information, see [Configure instance metadata options for new instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-new-instances.html).

- **Metadata IPv6 endpoint**: You can enable the instance to
use the IMDS IPv6 address `[fd00:ec2::254]` to retrieve
instance metadata. This option is only available if you are launching
[Nitro-based instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#instance-hypervisor-type) into an [IPv6-supported subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html#subnet-ip-address-range) (dual stack or IPv6 only). For more
information about retrieving instance metadata, see [Access instance metadata for an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html).

- **Metadata version**: If you enable access to the
IMDS, you can choose to require the use of Instance Metadata Service Version 2 when requesting
instance metadata. For more information, see [Configure instance metadata options for new instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-new-instances.html).

- **Metadata response hop limit**: If you enable the
IMDS, you can set the allowable number of network hops for the metadata
token. For more information, see [Configure instance metadata options for new instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-new-instances.html).

- **Allow tags in metadata**: If you select **Enable**, the instance will allow access to all of its
tags from its metadata. If no value is specified, then by default, access to the
tags in instance metadata is not allowed. For more information, see [Enable access to tags in instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/work-with-tags-in-IMDS.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS).

- **User data**: You can specify user data to configure an
instance during launch, or to run a configuration script. For more information
about user data for Linux instances, see [Run commands when you launch an EC2 instance with user data input](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html). For more information about user data for
Windows instances, see [How Amazon EC2 handles user data for Windows instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html#ec2-windows-user-data).

## Summary

Use the **Summary** panel to specify the number of instances to
launch, to review your instance configuration, and to launch your instances.

- **Number of instances**: Enter the number of instances to
launch. All of the instances will launch with the same configuration.

###### Tip

To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller
batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances
each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.

- (Optional) If you specify more than one instance, to help ensure that you
maintain the correct number of instances to handle demand on your application,
you can choose **consider EC2 Auto Scaling** to create a launch
template and an Auto Scaling group. Auto Scaling scales the number of instances in the group
according to your specifications. For more information, see the
[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide).

###### Note

If Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling marks an instance that is in an Auto Scaling group as unhealthy, the
instance is automatically scheduled for replacement where it is terminated
and another is launched, and you lose your data on the original instance. An
instance is marked as unhealthy if you stop or reboot the instance, or if
another event marks the instance as unhealthy. For more information, see
[Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

- Review the details of your instance, and make any necessary changes. You can
navigate directly to a section by choosing its link in the
**Summary** panel.

- When you're ready to launch your instance, choose **Launch**
**instance**.
