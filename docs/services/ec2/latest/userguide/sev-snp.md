# AMD SEV-SNP for Amazon EC2 instances

AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (AMD SEV-SNP) is a CPU
feature that provides the following properties:

- **Attestation** – AMD SEV-SNP enables you to
retrieve a signed attestation report that contains a cryptographic measure that can be used
to validate the instance’s state and identity, and that it is running on genuine AMD
hardware. For more information, see [Attest an Amazon EC2 instance with AMD SEV-SNP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snp-attestation.html).

- **Memory encryption** –
Starting with AMD EPYC (Milan), AWS Graviton2, and Intel Xeon Scalable (Ice
Lake) processors, instance memory is always encrypted. Instances that are enabled for
AMD SEV-SNP use an instance-specific key for their memory encryption.

## Concepts and terminology

Before you begin using AMD SEV-SNP, ensure that you are familiar with the following concepts
and terminology.

###### AMD SEV-SNP attestation report

The AMD SEV-SNP attestation report is a document that an instance can request from the CPU.
The AMD SEV-SNP attestation report can be used to validate the state and identity of an instance,
and to verify that it is running in a sanctioned AMD environment. The report includes a launch
measurement, which is a cryptographic hash of the initial boot state of an instance, including
its initial instance memory contents and initial state of the vCPUs. The AMD SEV-SNP attestation
report is signed with a VLEK signature that chains back to an AMD root of trust.

###### VLEK

The Versioned Loaded Endorsement Key (VLEK) is a versioned signing key that is certified
by AMD and used by the AMD CPU to sign the AMD SEV-SNP attestation reports. VLEK signatures
can be validated using certificates provided by AMD.

###### OVMF binary

The Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) is the early-boot code that is used to provide
a UEFI environment for the instance. The early-boot code is run before the code in the AMI
is booted. The OVMF also finds and runs the boot loader provided in the AMI. For more
information, see the [OVMF repository](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/OVMF).

## Requirements

To use AMD SEV-SNP, you must do the following:

- Use one of the following supported instance types:

- **General purpose**: `m6a.large` \| `m6a.xlarge` \| `m6a.2xlarge` \| `m6a.4xlarge` \| `m6a.8xlarge`

- **Compute optimized**: `c6a.large` \| `c6a.xlarge` \| `c6a.2xlarge` \| `c6a.4xlarge` \| `c6a.8xlarge` \| `c6a.12xlarge` \| `c6a.16xlarge`

- **Memory optimized**: `r6a.large` \| `r6a.xlarge` \| `r6a.2xlarge` \| `r6a.4xlarge`

- Launch your instance in a supported AWS Region. Currently, only US East (Ohio)
and Europe (Ireland) are supported.

- Use an AMI with `uefi` or `uefi-preferred` boot mode and an
operating system that supports AMD SEV-SNP. For more information about AMD SEV-SNP support on
your operating system, refer to the respective operating system's documentation. For
AWS, AMD SEV-SNP is supported on AL2023, RHEL 9.3, SLES 15 SP4, and Ubuntu 23.04 and later.

## Considerations

You can only enable AMD SEV-SNP when you launch an instance. When AMD SEV-SNP is enabled
for your instance launch, the following rules apply.

- After it is enabled, AMD SEV-SNP can't be disabled. It remains enabled throughout the
instance lifecycle.

- You can only [change the instance type](ec2-instance-resize.md) to
another instance type that supports AMD SEV-SNP.

- Hibernation and Nitro Enclaves aren't supported.

- Dedicated Hosts aren't supported.

- If the underlying host for your instance is scheduled for maintenance, you'll
receive a scheduled event notification 14 days before the event. You must manually stop or
restart your instance to move it to a new host.

## Pricing

When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance with AMD SEV-SNP enabled, you are charged an additional
hourly usage fee that is equivalent to 10 percent of the [On-Demand hourly rate](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand) of the selected instance type.

This AMD SEV-SNP usage fee is a separate charge to your Amazon EC2 instance usage. Reserved Instances, Savings Plans,
and operating system usage don't impact this fee.

If you configure a Spot Instance to launch with [AMD SEV-SNP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sev-snp.html) enabled,
you are charged an additional hourly usage fee that is equivalent to 10 percent of the
[On-Demand hourly rate](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand) of the
selected instance type. If the allocation strategy uses price as an input, Spot Fleet does not
include this additional fee; only the Spot price is used.
