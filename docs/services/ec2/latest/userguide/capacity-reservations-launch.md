# Launch instances into an existing Capacity Reservation

You can only launch an instance into a Capacity Reservation that:

- Has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone, and
tenancy)

- Has sufficient available capacity

- Is in the `active` state

When you launch an instance, you can specify whether to launch the instance into any
`open` Capacity Reservation, into a specific Capacity Reservation, or into a group of Capacity Reservations.

Alternatively, you can configure the instance to avoid running in a Capacity Reservation, even if you
have an `open` Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes and available capacity.

Launching an instance into a Capacity Reservation reduces its available capacity by the number of
instances launched. For example, if you launch three instances, the available capacity
of the Capacity Reservation is reduced by three.

Console

###### To launch instances into an existing Capacity Reservation

1. Follow the procedure to [launch an instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md), but don't launch the instance until
    you've completed the following steps to specify the settings for the
    placement group and Capacity Reservation.

2. Expand **Advanced details** and do the
    following:
1. For **Placement group**, select the
       cluster placement group in which to launch the
       instance.

2. For **Capacity Reservation**, choose one of the following
       options depending on the configuration of the Capacity Reservation:

- **None** – Prevents the
instances from launching into a Capacity Reservation. The instances
run in On-Demand capacity.

- **Open** – Launches the
instances into any Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes
and sufficient capacity for the number of instances
you selected. If there is no matching Capacity Reservation with
sufficient capacity, the instance uses On-Demand
capacity.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation** – Launches
the instances into the selected Capacity Reservation. If the
selected Capacity Reservation does not have sufficient capacity for
the number of instances you selected, the instance
launch fails.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation resource group**
– Launches the instances into any Capacity Reservation with
matching attributes and available capacity in the
selected Capacity Reservation group. If the selected group does not
have a Capacity Reservation with matching attributes and available
capacity, the instances launch into On-Demand
capacity.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation only** –
Launches the instances into a Capacity Reservation. If a Capacity Reservation ID
isn't specified, the instances launch into an open
Capacity Reservation. If capacity isn't available, the instances
fail to launch.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation resource group**
**only** – Launches the instances
into a Capacity Reservation in a Capacity Reservation resource group. If a Capacity Reservation
resource group ARN isn't specified, the instances
launch into an open Capacity Reservation. If capacity isn't
available, the instances fail to launch.
3. In the **Summary** panel, review your instance
    configuration, and then choose **Launch instance**.

AWS CLI

###### To launch an instance into an existing Capacity Reservation

Use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command and specify the
`--capacity-reservation-specification` option.

The following example launches an instance into any open Capacity Reservation
with matching attributes and available capacity:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key-pair \
    --subnet-id subnet-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification CapacityReservationPreference=open
```

The following example launches an instance into a `targeted` Capacity Reservation:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key-pair \
    --subnet-id subnet-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification \
        CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE}
```

The following example launches an instance into the specified Capacity Reservation group:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key-pair \
    --subnet-id subnet-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification \
        CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn=arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/my-cr-group}
```

The following example launches an instance into a Capacity Reservation only. Because it
does not specify a Capacity Reservation ID, the instance launches in any open Capacity Reservation with
matching attributes and available capacity:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key-pair \
    --subnet-id subnet-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification \
        CapacityReservationPreference=capacity-reservations-only
```

The following example launches an instance into a specific Capacity Reservation only.
If capacity isn't available in the specified Capacity Reservation, the instance fails to launch.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key-pair \
    --subnet-id subnet-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification \
        CapacityReservationPreference=capacity-reservations-only \
        CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE}
```

PowerShell

###### To launch an instance into an existing Capacity Reservation

Use the [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md) cmdlet.

The following example launches an instance into any open Capacity Reservation
with matching attributes and available capacity:

```powershell

New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -InstanceType t2.micro `
    -KeyName "my-key-pair" `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -CapacityReservationSpecification_CapacityReservationPreference "open"
```

The following example launches an instance into a `targeted` Capacity Reservation:

```powershell

New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -InstanceType t2.micro `
    -KeyName "my-key-pair" `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -CapacityReservationTarget_CapacityReservationId cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE
```

The following example launches an instance into the specified Capacity Reservation group:

```powershell

New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -InstanceType t2.micro `
    -KeyName "my-key-pair" `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -CapacityReservationTarget_CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn `
        "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/my-cr-group"
```

The following example launches an instance into a Capacity Reservation only. Because it
does not specify a Capacity Reservation ID, the instance launches in any open Capacity Reservation with
matching attributes and available capacity:

```powershell

New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -InstanceType t2.micro `
    -KeyName "my-key-pair" `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -CapacityReservationSpecification_CapacityReservationPreference "capacity-reservations-only"
```

The following example launches an instance into a specific Capacity Reservation only.
If capacity isn't available in the specified Capacity Reservation, the instance fails to launch.

```powershell

New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -InstanceType t2.micro `
    -KeyName "my-key-pair" `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -CapacityReservationSpecification_CapacityReservationPreference "capacity-reservations-only" `
    -CapacityReservationTarget_CapacityReservationId cr-1234abcd56EXAMPLE
```
