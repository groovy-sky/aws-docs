# Understand automatic scaling for Spot Fleet

_Automatic scaling_ enables your Spot Fleet to increase or decrease its
target capacity based on demand. With automatic scaling, a Spot Fleet can either launch
instances (scale out) or terminate instances (scale in) within a specified range, in
response to one or more scaling policies.

Automatic scaling for Spot Fleet is made possible by a combination of the Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch,
and Application Auto Scaling APIs. Spot Fleet requests are created with Amazon EC2, alarms are created with CloudWatch,
and scaling policies are created with Application Auto Scaling.

**Types of automatic scaling**

Spot Fleet supports the following types of automatic scaling:

- [Target tracking scaling](spot-fleet-target-tracking.md)
– Increase or decrease  the current capacity of the fleet by targeting a
value for a specific metric. This is similar to the way that your thermostat
maintains the temperature of your home—you select the desired temperature
and the thermostat does the rest.

- [Step scaling](spot-fleet-step-scaling.md) – Increase
or decrease the current capacity of the fleet based on a set of scaling
adjustments, known as step adjustments, that vary based on the size of the alarm
breach.

- [Scheduled scaling](spot-fleet-scheduled-scaling.md) –
Increase or decrease the current capacity of the fleet based on the date and
time.

## Considerations

When using automatic scaling for your Spot Fleet, consider the following:

- **Instance weighting** – If you're
using [instance\
weighting](ec2-fleet-instance-weighting.md), keep in mind that Spot Fleet can exceed the target capacity as
needed. Fulfilled capacity can be a floating-point number but target
capacity must be an integer, so Spot Fleet rounds up to the next integer. You must
take these behaviors into account when you look at the outcome of a scaling
policy when an alarm is triggered. For example, suppose that the target
capacity is 30, the fulfilled capacity is 30.1, and the scaling policy
subtracts 1. When the alarm is triggered, the automatic scaling process
subtracts 1 from 30.1 to get 29.1 and then rounds it up to 30, so no scaling
action is taken. As another example, suppose that you selected instance
weights of 2, 4, and 8, and a target capacity of 10, but no weight 2
instances were available so Spot Fleet provisioned instances of weights 4 and 8
for a fulfilled capacity of 12. If the scaling policy decreases target
capacity by 20% and an alarm is triggered, the automatic scaling process
subtracts 12\*0.2 from 12 to get 9.6 and then rounds it up to 10, so no
scaling action is taken.

- **Cooldown period** – The scaling
policies that you create for Spot Fleet support a cooldown period. This is the
number of seconds after a scaling activity completes where previous
trigger-related scaling activities can influence future scaling events. For
scale-out policies, while the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity
that has been added by the previous scale-out event that initiated the
cooldown is calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next scale
out. The intention is to continuously (but not excessively) scale out. For
scale in policies, the cooldown period is used to block subsequent scale in
requests until it has expired. The intention is to scale in conservatively
to protect your application's availability. However, if another alarm
triggers a scale-out policy during the cooldown period after a scale-in,
automatic scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

- **Use detailed monitoring** – We
recommend that you scale based on instance metrics with a 1-minute frequency
because that ensures a faster response to utilization changes. Scaling on
metrics with a 5-minute frequency can result in slower response time and
scaling on stale metric data. To send metric data for your instances to CloudWatch
in 1-minute periods, you must specifically enable detailed monitoring. For
more information, see [Manage detailed monitoring for your EC2 instances](manage-detailed-monitoring.md) and [Create a Spot Fleet request using defined parameters](create-spot-fleet.md#create-spot-fleet-advanced).

- **AWS CLI** – If you use the AWS CLI for
configuring scaling for Spot Fleet, you'll use the [application-autoscaling](../../../cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling.md) commands.
