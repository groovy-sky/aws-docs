# Aggregate statistics by AMI

You can aggregate statistics by AMI for your instances that have detailed monitoring enabled.
Instances that use basic monitoring are not included in the aggregates. Before you can get
statistics aggregated across instances, you must [enable detailed monitoring](manage-detailed-monitoring.md#enable-detailed-monitoring) (at an additional charge), which provides data in
1-minute periods.

Note that Amazon CloudWatch cannot aggregate data across AWS Regions. Metrics are completely
separate between Regions.

This example shows you how to determine average CPU utilization for all instances that
use a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The average is over 60-second time intervals for
a one-day period.

###### To display the average CPU utilization by AMI (console)

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**.

3. Choose the **EC2** namespace and then choose **By Image**
**(AMI) Id**.

4. Choose the row for the **CPUUtilization** metric and the specific
    AMI, which displays a graph for the metric for the specified AMI. To name the graph,
    choose the pencil icon. To change the time range, select one of the predefined values or
    choose **custom**.

5. To change the statistic or the period for the metric, choose the **Graphed**
**metrics** tab. Choose the column heading or an individual value, and then
    choose a different value.

###### To get the average CPU utilization for an image ID (AWS CLI)

Use the [get-metric-statistics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/get-metric-statistics.html) command as follows.

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization  --period 3600 \
--statistics Average --dimensions Name=ImageId,Value=ami-3c47a355 --start-time 2022-10-10T00:00:00 --end-time 2022-10-11T00:00:00
```

The following is example output. Each value represents an average CPU utilization
percentage for the EC2 instances running the specified AMI.

```json

    "Datapoints": [
        {
            "Timestamp": "2022-10-10T07:00:00Z",

            "Unit": "Percent"
        },
        {
            "Timestamp": "2022-10-10T14:00:00Z",
            "Average": 0.079579831932773085,
            "Unit": "Percent"
        },
        {
            "Timestamp": "2022-10-10T06:00:00Z",
            "Average": 0.036000000000000011,
            "Unit": "Percent"
        }
    ],
    "Label": "CPUUtilization"
}
```
