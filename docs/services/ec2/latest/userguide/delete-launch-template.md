# Delete a launch template or a launch template version
<a name="delete-launch-template"></a>

If you no longer require a launch template, you can delete it. Deleting a launch template deletes all of its versions. If you only want to delete a specific version of a launch template, you can do so while retaining the other versions of the launch template.

Deleting a launch template or launch template version doesn't affect any instances that you've launched from the launch template.

## Delete a launch template version
<a name="delete-launch-template-version"></a>

If you no longer require a launch template version, you can delete it.

**Considerations**
+ You can't replace the version number after you delete it.
+ You can't delete the default version of the launch template; you must first assign a different version as the default. If the default version is the only version for the launch template, you must [delete the entire launch template](#delete-launch-template).
+ When using the console, you can delete one launch template version at a time. When using the AWS CLI, you can delete up to 200 launch template versions in a single request. To delete more than 200 versions in a single request, you can [delete the launch template](#delete-launch-template), which also deletes all of its versions.
