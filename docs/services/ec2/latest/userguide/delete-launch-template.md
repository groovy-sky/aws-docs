# Delete a launch template or a launch template version

If you no longer require a launch template, you can delete it. Deleting a launch
template deletes all of its versions. If you only want to delete a specific version of a
launch template, you can do so while retaining the other versions of the launch
template.

Deleting a launch template or launch template version doesn't affect any instances
that you've launched from the launch template.

## Delete a launch template and all of its versions

If you no longer require a launch template, including all of its versions, you can
delete the launch template. Deleting a launch template deletes all of its
versions.

Console

###### To delete a launch template and all its versions

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Launch**
**Templates**.

3. Select the launch template and choose
    **Actions**, **Delete**
**template**.

4. Enter `Delete` to confirm deletion, and
    then choose **Delete**.

AWS CLI

###### To delete a launch template and all its versions

Use the [delete-launch-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/delete-launch-template.html) command and specify the
launch template.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 delete-launch-template --launch-template-id lt-01238c059e3466abc
```

PowerShell

###### To delete a launch template and all its versions

Use the [Remove-EC2LaunchTemplate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Remove-EC2LaunchTemplate.html) (AWS Tools for PowerShell) command and
specify the launch template. If `-Force` is omitted,
PowerShell prompts for a confirmation.

```powershell

Remove-EC2LaunchTemplate -LaunchTemplateId lt-0123456789example -Force
```

## Delete a launch template version

If you no longer require a launch template version, you can delete it.

###### Considerations

- You can't replace the version number after you delete it.

- You can't delete the default version of the launch template; you must
first assign a different version as the default. If the default version is
the only version for the launch template, you must [delete the entire launch\
template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/delete-launch-template.html).

- When using the console, you can delete one launch template version at a
time. When using the AWS CLI, you can delete up to 200 launch template
versions in a single request. To delete more than 200 versions in a single
request, you can [delete the launch\
template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/delete-launch-template.html), which also deletes all of its versions.
