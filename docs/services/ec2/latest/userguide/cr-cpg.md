# Use Capacity Reservations with cluster placement groups

You can create Capacity Reservations in a cluster placement group to reserve Amazon EC2 compute capacity
for your workloads. Cluster placement groups offer the benefit of low network latency
and high network throughput.

Creating a Capacity Reservation in a cluster placement group ensures that you have access to compute
capacity in your cluster placement groups when you need it, for as long as you need it.
This is ideal for reserving capacity for high-performance (HPC) workloads that require
compute scaling. It allows you to scale your cluster down while ensuring that the
capacity remains available for your use so that you can scale back up when needed.

After you create a Capacity Reservation in a cluster placement group, you can share it with other AWS
accounts. For more information, see [Sharing Capacity Reservations in cluster placement groups](#cpg-cr-sharing).

## Limitations

Keep the following in mind when creating Capacity Reservations in cluster placement groups:

- If an existing Capacity Reservation is not in a placement group, you can't modify the Capacity Reservation
to reserve capacity in a placement group. To reserve capacity in a placement
group, you must create the Capacity Reservation in the placement group.

- After you create a Capacity Reservation in a placement group, you can't modify it to
reserve capacity outside of the placement group.

- You can increase your reserved capacity in a placement group by modifying
an existing Capacity Reservation in the placement group, or by creating additional Capacity Reservations in
the placement group. However, you increase your chances of getting an
insufficient capacity error.

- You can share Capacity Reservations only from the cluster placement group that you own. You cannot share
Capacity Reservations from a cluster placement group that you do not own.

- You can't delete a cluster placement group that has `active`
Capacity Reservations. You must cancel all Capacity Reservations in the cluster placement group before you
can delete it.

## Work with Capacity Reservations in cluster placement groups

To start using Capacity Reservations with cluster placement groups, perform the following
steps.

###### Note

If you want to create a Capacity Reservation in an existing cluster placement group, skip Step 1. Then for
Steps 2 and 3, specify the ARN of the existing cluster placement group.

###### Tasks

- [Step 1: (Conditional) Create a cluster placement group for use with a Capacity Reservation](#create-cpg)

- [Step 2: Create a Capacity Reservation in a cluster placement group](#create-cr-in-cpg)

- [Step 3: Launch instances into Capacity Reservations in a cluster placement group](#launch-instance-into-cpg)

### Step 1: ( _Conditional_) Create a cluster placement group for use with a Capacity Reservation

Perform this step only if you need to create a new cluster placement group. To
use an existing cluster placement group, skip this step and then for Steps 2 and
3, use the ARN of that cluster placement group.

Console

###### To create a cluster placement group

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Placement**
**Groups**, and then choose **Create**
**placement group**.

3. For **Name**, specify a descriptive name
    for the placement group.

4. For **Placement strategy**, choose
    **Cluster**.

5. Choose **Create group**.

6. In the **Placement groups** table, in the
    **Group ARN** column, make a note of
    the ARN of the cluster placement group that you created.
    You'll need it for the next step.

AWS CLI

###### To create a cluster placement group

Use the [create-placement-group](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-placement-group.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-placement-group \
    --group-name MyPG \
    --strategy cluster
```

Make a note of the placement group ARN returned in the
output, because you'll need it for the next step.

PowerShell

###### To create a cluster placement group

Use the [New-EC2PlacementGroup](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2placementgroup.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

New-EC2PlacementGroup `
    -GroupName my-placement-group `
    -Strategy "cluster"
```

Make a note of the placement group ARN returned in the output,
because you'll need it for the next step.

### Step 2: Create a Capacity Reservation in a cluster placement group

You create a Capacity Reservation in a cluster placement group in the same way that you create any Capacity Reservation.
However, you must also specify the ARN of the cluster placement group in which
to create the Capacity Reservation.

###### Considerations

- The specified cluster placement group must be in the
`available` state. If the cluster placement group is in
the `pending`, `deleting`, or `deleted`
state, the request fails.

- The Capacity Reservation and the cluster placement group must be in the same
Availability Zone. If the request to create the Capacity Reservation specifies an
Availability Zone that is different from that of the cluster placement
group, the request fails.

- You can create Capacity Reservations only for instance types that are supported by
cluster placement groups. If you specify an unsupported instance type,
the request fails.

- If you create an `open` Capacity Reservation in a cluster placement group
and there are existing running instances that have matching attributes
(placement group ARN, instance type, Availability Zone, platform, and
tenancy), those instances automatically run in the Capacity Reservation.

- Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if one of the following is
true:

- Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity to fulfill the
request. Either try again at a later time, try a different
Availability Zone, or try a smaller capacity. If your workload
is flexible across instance types and sizes, try different
instance attributes.

- The requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance limit for the
selected instance family. Increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the
instance family and try again. For more information, see [On-Demand Instance quotas](ec2-on-demand-instances.md#ec2-on-demand-instances-limits).

Console

###### To create a Capacity Reservation

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Choose **Capacity Reservations**, and then choose
    **Create Capacity Reservation**.

3. On the **Create a Capacity Reservation** page, specify the instance type, platform,
    Availability Zone, Tenancy, quantity, and end date as
    needed.

4. For **Placement group**, select the ARN
    of the cluster placement group in which to create the
    Capacity Reservation.

5. Choose **Create**.

For more information, see [Create a Capacity Reservation](capacity-reservations-create.md).

AWS CLI

###### To create a Capacity Reservation

Use the [create-capacity-reservation](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-capacity-reservation.md) command. For
`--placement-group-arn`, specify the ARN of the
cluster placement group in which to create the Capacity Reservation.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-capacity-reservation \
    --instance-type instance_type \
    --instance-platform platform \
    --availability-zone-id az_id \
    --instance-count quantity \
    --placement-group-arn "placement_group_arn"
```

PowerShell

###### To create a Capacity Reservation

Use the [Add-EC2CapacityReservation](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/add-ec2capacityreservation.md)
cmdlet. For `-PlacementGroupArn`, specify the ARN of the
cluster placement group in which to create the Capacity Reservation.

```powershell

Add-EC2CapacityReservation `
    -InstanceType instance_type `
    -InstancePlatform platform `
    -AvailabilityZoneId az_id `
    -InstanceCount quantity `
    -PlacementGroupArn "placement_group_arn"
```

### Step 3: Launch instances into Capacity Reservations in a cluster placement group

You can launch an instance into a Capacity Reservation that is in a cluster placement group with one of
the following options:

- _Specifying the ARN of the cluster placement group in which to launch the_
_instance_ – When you provide the ARN of a cluster placement group,
Amazon EC2 launches the instance into that cluster placement group. You can use one of the
following methods:

- _Specifying `open`_ – You do not have
to specify the Capacity Reservation in the instance launch request. If the instance has
attributes (placement group ARN, instance type, Availability Zone, platform,
and tenancy) that match a Capacity Reservation in the specified placement group, the instance
automatically runs in the Capacity Reservation.

- _Specifying a Capacity Reservation_ – If the Capacity Reservation accepts only targeted
instance launches, you must specify the target Capacity Reservation in addition to the cluster
placement group in the request.

- _Specifying a Capacity Reservation group_ – For more information,
see [Using Capacity Reservation in cluster placement groups with a Capacity Reservation\
group](using-cpg-odcr-crg.md).

- _Specifying only a Capacity Reservation group_ – For more
information, see [Using Capacity Reservation in\
cluster placement groups with a Capacity Reservation group](using-cpg-odcr-crg.md).

- _Specifying only a Capacity Reservation_ – You can launch instances into
a Capacity Reservation in a cluster placement group.

###### Note

When you launch instances by specifying only a Capacity Reservation or only a Capacity Reservation group, the instances
are launched into the Capacity Reservations that are created in the cluster placement group, but the
instances are not directly attached to the cluster placement group.

Console

###### To launch instances into an existing Capacity Reservation

1. Follow the procedure to [launch an\
    instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md), but don't launch the instance until
    you've completed the following steps to specify the settings
    for the placement group and Capacity Reservation.

2. Expand **Advanced details** and do the
    following:
1. For **Placement group**, select
       the cluster placement group in which to launch the
       instance.

2. For **Capacity Reservation**, choose one of the
       following options depending on the configuration of
       the Capacity Reservation:

- **Open** – To launch
the instances into any `open` Capacity Reservation in
the cluster placement group that has matching
attributes and sufficient capacity.

- **Target by ID** – To
launch the instances into a Capacity Reservation that accepts only
targeted instance launches.

- **Target by group** –
To launch the instances into any Capacity Reservation with
matching attributes and available capacity in the
selected Capacity Reservation group.
3. In the **Summary** panel, review your
    instance configuration, and then choose **Launch**
**instance**. For more information, see [Launch an EC2 instance using the launch instance wizard in the console](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md).

AWS CLI

###### To launch instances into an existing Capacity Reservation

Use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command. If you need to target a
specific Capacity Reservation or a Capacity Reservation group, specify the
`--capacity-reservation-specification` parameter.
For `--placement`, specify the `GroupName`
parameter and then specify the name of the placement group that
you created in the previous steps.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --count quantity \
    --instance-type instance_type \
    --key-name key_pair_name \
    --subnet-id subnet-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=capacity_reservation_id} \
    --placement "GroupName=cluster_placement_group_name"
```

PowerShell

###### To launch instances into an existing Capacity Reservation

Use the [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md)
cmdlet. For `-Placement`, specify the `GroupName`
parameter and then specify the name of the placement group that
you created in the previous steps.

```powershell

New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -InstanceType instance_type `
    -KeyName key_pair_name `
    -SubnetId subnet-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -CapacityReservationTarget_CapacityReservationId capacity_reservation_id `
    -Placement_GroupName cluster_placement_group_name
```

## Sharing Capacity Reservations in cluster placement groups

You can share Capacity Reservations in cluster placement groups by either sharing only the Capacity Reservations, or by
sharing both the Capacity Reservations and the cluster placement group in which they were created.

By sharing only the Capacity Reservation, you give consumer accounts access to that Capacity Reservation only. Consumer
accounts have no visibility or access to the cluster placement group in which the Capacity Reservation is
created. This gives you fine-grained control over consumer account access. Consumer accounts
can't view any information about the cluster placement group, including its ARN.

When you share the cluster placement group and the Capacity Reservation, the cluster placement group is
visible and accessible to consumer accounts. They can launch instances and create their own
Capacity Reservations in it.
