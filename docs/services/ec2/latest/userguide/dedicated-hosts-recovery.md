# Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host recovery
<a name="dedicated-hosts-recovery"></a>

Dedicated Host auto recovery restarts your instances on to a new replacement host when certain problematic conditions are detected on your Dedicated Host. Host recovery reduces the need for manual intervention and lowers the operational burden if there is an unexpected Dedicated Host failure concerning system power or network connectivity events. Other Dedicated Host issues will require manual intervention to recover from.

**Note**
Dedicated Host auto recovery of supported metal instance types will take longer to detect and recover from than non-metal instance types.

## Pricing
<a name="dedicated-hosts-recovery-pricing"></a>

There are no additional charges for using host recovery, but the usual Dedicated Host charges apply. For more information, see [ Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/pricing/).

As soon as host recovery is initiated, you are no longer billed for the impaired Dedicated Host. Billing for the replacement Dedicated Host begins only after it enters the `available` state.

If the impaired Dedicated Host was billed using the On-Demand rate, the replacement Dedicated Host is also billed using the On-Demand rate. If the impaired Dedicated Host had an active Dedicated Host Reservation, it is transferred to the replacement Dedicated Host.
