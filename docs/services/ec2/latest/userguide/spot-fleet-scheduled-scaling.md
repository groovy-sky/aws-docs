# Scheduled scaling: Scale Spot Fleet on a schedule

Scaling your fleet on a schedule enables you to scale your application in response
to predictable changes in demand. By creating _scheduled_
_actions_, you can instruct Spot Fleet to perform scaling activities at specific
times. To create a scheduled action, you must specify an existing Spot Fleet, the time
when the scaling activity must occur, and the desired minimum and maximum capacity.
Scheduled actions can be configured to scale once or on a recurring schedule. If you
needs change, you can edit or delete scheduled actions.

###### Prerequisites

- Scheduled actions can only be created for existing Spot Fleets. You can't create
a scheduled action when you create a Spot Fleet.

- The Spot Fleet request must have a request type of `maintain`.
Automatic scaling is not supported for requests of type
`request`.

- Configure the [IAM permissions required for Spot Fleet automatic scaling](spot-fleet-auto-scaling-iam.md).

- Review the [Considerations](spot-fleet-automatic-scaling.md#considerations-for-spot-fleet-automatic-scaling).

03. Select your Spot Fleet request.

04. Choose the **Scheduled Scaling** tab near the bottom of
     the screen. If you selected the link for your Spot Fleet, there is no tab;
     instead, scroll down to the **Scheduled Scaling**
     section.

05. Choose **Create scheduled action**.

06. For **Name**, specify a name for the scheduled
     action.

07. Enter a value for **Minimum capacity**, **Maximum**

3. Select your Spot Fleet request.

4. Choose the **Scheduled Scaling** tab near the bottom of

**capacity**, or both.

7. For **Recurrence**, choose one of the predefined
    schedules (for example, **Every day**), or choose
    **Custom** and enter a cron expression. For more
    information about the cron expressions supported by scheduled scaling, see
    [Cron expressions](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-scheduled-rule-pattern.md#eb-cron-expressions) in the
