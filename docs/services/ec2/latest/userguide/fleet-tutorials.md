# Tutorials for EC2 Fleet

There are different ways to configure an EC2 Fleet. The configuration you choose depends on
your specific use case.

The following tutorials cover some of the possible use cases and provide the tasks required
to implement them.

**Use instance weighting to manage the availability and performance**
**of your EC2 Fleet.**

With instance weighting, you assign a weight to each instance type in your EC2 Fleet to
represent their compute capacity and performance relative to each other.
Based on the weights, the fleet can use any combination of the specified
instance types, as long as it can fulfil the desired target
capacity.

**Use On-Demand capacity to ensure availability during peak periods,**
**but benefit from additional Spot capacity at a lower**
**cost.**

Configure your EC2 Fleet to use On-Demand Instances as the primary capacity to ensure available capacity
during peak periods. In addition, allocate some capacity to Spot Instances to
benefit from discounted pricing, while keeping in mind that Spot Instances can be
interrupted if Amazon EC2 needs the capacity back.

**Use Capacity Reservations to reserve compute capacity for your**
**On-Demand Instances.**

Configure your EC2 Fleet to use `targeted` Capacity Reservations first when launching On-Demand Instances. If
you have strict capacity requirements, and are running business-critical
workloads that require a certain level of long or short-term capacity
assurance, we recommend that you create a Capacity Reservation to ensure that you
always have access to Amazon EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long
as you need it.

**Use Capacity Blocks to reserve highly sought-after GPU instances for**
**your ML workloads.**

Configure your EC2 Fleet to launch instances into Capacity Blocks.

**Use Interruptible Capacity Reservations to temporarily repurpose**
**idle capacity across your AWS Organization and save costs.**

Configure your EC2 Fleet to launch instances into Interruptible Capacity Reservations,
which represent spare capacity within your AWS organization.
Capacity owners can reclaim the capacity at any time. Once
reclaimed, EC2 terminates the instances after a 2-minute notice.
