# View Spot Instance pricing history

Spot Instance prices are set by Amazon EC2 and adjust gradually based on long-term trends in supply
and demand for Spot Instance capacity.

When your Spot request is fulfilled, your Spot Instances launch at the current Spot price, not
exceeding the On-Demand price. You can view the Spot price history for the last 90 days,
filtering by instance type, operating system, and Availability Zone.

For the _current_ Spot Instance prices, see [Amazon EC2 Spot Instances Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing).

Console

###### To view the Spot price history

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Spot Requests**.

3. Choose **Pricing history**.

4. For **Graph**, choose to compare the price history by
    **Availability Zones** or by **Instance**
**Types**.

- If you choose **Availability Zones**, then choose the **Instance**
**type**, operating system ( **Platform**),
