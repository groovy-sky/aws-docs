# Add Capacity Reservations to a group
<a name="cr-groups-add"></a>

You can add Capacity Reservations that you own in your account, or Capacity Reservations that are shared with you by other AWS accounts to a group.

**Considerations**

+ You can add only Capacity Reservations in the `active` state to a group.
+ If a shared Capacity Reservation is later unshared by its owner, Amazon EC2 automatically removes it from your group.
