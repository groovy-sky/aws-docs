# Create a Spot Fleet

Using the AWS Management Console, you can quickly create a Spot Fleet request by choosing only an AMI and
your desired total target capacity. Amazon EC2 will configure a fleet that best meets your
needs and follows Spot best practices. Alternatively, you can modify any of the default
settings.

If you want to include On-Demand Instances in your fleet, you must specify a launch template in
your request and specify you desired On-Demand capacity.

The fleet launches On-Demand Instances when capacity is available, and launches Spot Instances when your
maximum price exceeds the Spot price and capacity is available.

If your fleet includes Spot Instances and is of type `maintain`, Amazon EC2 will attempt
to maintain your fleet target capacity when your Spot Instances are interrupted.

     **Get started**. Otherwise, choose
     **Create Spot Fleet Request**.

04. For **Launch parameters**, you can either
     manually configure the launch parameters or you can use a launch
     template, as follows:
    1. \[Manually configure\] To define the launch parameters
        in the Amazon EC2 console, choose **Manually**
       **configure launch parameters**, and then do
        the following:
       1. For **AMI**, choose one of
           the basic AMIs provided by AWS, or choose
           **Search for AMI** to use an AMI
           from our user community, the

           AWS Marketplace, or one of your own.

          ###### Note

          If an AMI specified in the launch parameters
          is deregistered or disabled, no new instances can
          be launched from the AMI. For fleets that are set
          to maintain target capacity, the target capacity
          will not be maintained.

       2. (Optional) For **Key pair**
          **name**, choose an existing key pair or
           create a new one.

          \[Existing key pair\] Choose the key
           pair.

          \[New key pair\] Choose **Create new key**
          **pair** to go the **Key**
          **pairs** page. When you are done, return
           to the **Spot Requests** page and
           refresh the list.

       3. (Optional) Expand **Additional launch**
          **parameters**, and do the
           following:

               **EBS-optimized**, select
               **Launch EBS-optimized**
              **instances**.

          02. (Optional) To add temporary block-level
               storage for your instances, for **Instance**
              **store**, choose **Attach at**
              **launch**.

          03. (Optional) To add storage, choose
               **Add new volume**, and specify
               additional instance store volumes or Amazon EBS
               volumes, depending on the instance type.

          04. (Optional) By default, basic monitoring is
               enabled for your instances. To enable detailed
               monitoring, for **Monitoring**,
               select **Enable CloudWatch detailed**
              **monitoring**.

          05. (Optional) To run a Dedicated Spot Instance, for
               **Tenancy**, choose
               **Dedicated - run a dedicated**
              **instance**.

          06. (Optional) For **Security**
              **groups**, choose one or more security
               groups or create a new one.

              \[Existing security group\] Choose one or more
               security groups.

              \[New security group\] Choose **Create**
              **new security group** to go the
               **Security Groups** page. When
               you are done, return to the **Spot**
              **Requests** and refresh the list.

          07. (Optional) To make your instances reachable
               from the internet, for **Auto-assign IPv4**
              **Public IP**, choose
               **Enable**.

          08. (Optional) To launch your Spot Instances with an
               IAM role, for **IAM instance**
              **profile**, choose the role.

          09. (Optional) To run a start-up script, copy it
               to **User data**.

          10. (Optional) To add a tag, choose
               **Create tag** and enter the key
               and value for the tag, and choose
               **Create**. Repeat for each
               tag.

              For each tag, to tag the instances and the
               Spot Fleet request with the same tag, ensure that both
               **Instances** and
               **Fleet** are selected. To tag
               only the instances launched by the fleet, clear
               **Fleet**. To tag only the Spot Fleet
               request, clear
               **Instances**.
    2. \[Launch template\] To use a configuration you created
        in a launch template, choose **Use a launch**
       **template**, and for **Launch**
       **template**, choose a launch
        template.

       ###### Note

       If you want On-Demand capacity in your Spot Fleet, you
       must specify a launch template.
05. For **Additional request details**, do the
     following:
    1. Review the additional request details. To make
        changes, clear **Apply**
       **defaults**.

    2. (Optional) For **IAM fleet role**,
        you can use the default role or choose a different role.
        To use the default role after changing the role, choose
        **Use default role**.

    3. (Optional) To create a request that is valid only
        during a specific time period, edit **Request**
       **valid from** and **Request valid**
       **until**.

    4. (Optional) By default, Amazon EC2 terminates your Spot Instances
        when the Spot Fleet request expires. To keep them running
        after your request expires, clear **Terminate**
       **the instances when the request**
       **expires**.

    5. (Optional) To register your Spot Instances with a load
        balancer, choose **Receive traffic from one or**
       **more load balancers** and choose one or
        more Classic Load Balancers or target groups.
06. For **Target capacity**, do the
     following:
    1. For **Total target capacity**,
        specify the number of units to request. For the type of
        unit, you can choose **Instances**,
        **vCPUs**, or **Memory**
       **(MiB)**. To specify a target capacity of 0
        so that you can add capacity later, you must first
        select **Maintain target**
       **capacity**.

    2. (Optional) For **Include On-Demand base**
       **capacity**, specify the number of On-Demand
        units to request. The number must be less than the
        **Total target capacity**. Amazon EC2
        calculates the difference, and allocates the difference
        to Spot units to request.

       ###### Important

       To specify optional On-Demand capacity, you must
       first choose a launch template.

    3. (Optional) By default, Amazon EC2 terminates Spot Instances when
        they are interrupted. To maintain the target capacity,
        select **Maintain target capacity**.
        You can then specify that Amazon EC2 terminates, stops, or
        hibernates Spot Instances when they are interrupted. To do so,
        choose the corresponding option from
        **Interruption behavior**.

       ###### Note

       If an AMI specified in the launch parameters is
       deregistered or disabled, no new instances can be
       launched from the AMI. In this case, for fleets that
       are set to maintain target capacity, the target
       capacity will not be maintained.

    4. (Optional) To allow Spot Fleet to launch a replacement Spot Instance
        when an instance rebalance notification is emitted for
        an existing Spot Instance in the fleet, select **Capacity**
       **rebalance**, and then choose an instance
        replacement strategy. If you choose **Launch**
       **before terminate**, specify the delay (in
        seconds) before Amazon EC2 terminates the old instances. For
        more information, see [Use Capacity Rebalancing in EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet to replace at-risk Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-capacity-rebalance.html).

    5. (Optional) To control the amount you pay per hour for
        all the Spot Instances in your fleet, select **Set**
       **maximum cost for Spot Instances** and then enter the
        maximum total amount you're willing to pay per hour.
        When the maximum total amount is reached, Spot Fleet stops
        launching Spot Instances even if it hasn’t met the target
        capacity. For more information, see [Set a spending limit for your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-control-spending.html).
07. For **Network**, do the following:
    1. For **Network**, choose an existing
        VPC or create a new one.

       \[Existing VPC\] Choose the VPC.

       \[New VPC\] Choose **Create new VPC**
        to go the Amazon VPC console. When you're done, return to
        this screen and refresh the list.

    2. (Optional) For **Availability Zone**,
        let Amazon EC2 choose the Availability Zones for your Spot Instances,
        or specify one or more Availability Zones.

       If you have more than one subnet in an Availability
        Zone, choose the appropriate subnet from
        **Subnet**. To add subnets, choose
        **Create new subnet** to go to the
        Amazon VPC console. When you are done, return to this screen
        and refresh the list.
08. For **Instance type requirements**, you can
     either specify instance attributes and let Amazon EC2 identify the
     optimal instance types with these attributes, or you can specify
     a list of instances. For more information, see [Specify attributes for instance type selection for EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet](ec2-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.md).
    1. If you choose **Specify instance attributes**
       **that match your compute requirements**,
        specify your instance attributes as follows:
       1. For **vCPUs**, enter the
           desired minimum and maximum number of vCPUs. To
           specify no limit, select **No**
          **minimum** or **No**
          **maximum**, or both.

       2. For **Memory (GiB)**, enter
           the desired minimum and maximum amount of memory.
           To specify no limit, select **No**
          **minimum** or **No**
          **maximum**, or both.

       3. (Optional) For **Additional instance**
          **attribute**, you can optionally specify
           one or more attributes to express your compute
           requirements in more detail. Each additional
           attribute adds a further constraint to your
           request. You can omit the additional attributes;
           when omitted, the default values are used. For a
           description of each attribute and their default
           values, see [get-spot-placement-scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-spot-placement-scores.html).

       4. (Optional) To view the instance types with
           your specified attributes, expand
           **Preview matching instance**
          **types**. To exclude instance types from
           being used in your request, select the instances
           and then choose **Exclude selected**
          **instance types**.
    2. If you choose **Manually select instance**
       **types**, Spot Fleet provides a default list of
        instance types. To select more instance types, choose
        **Add instance types**, select the
        instance types to use in your request, and choose
        **Select**. To delete instance
        types, select the instance types and choose
        **Delete**.
09. For **Allocation strategy**, choose a Spot
     allocation strategy and an On-Demand allocation strategy that
     meets your needs. For more information, see [Use allocation strategies to determine how EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet fulfills Spot and On-Demand capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.html).

10. For **Your fleet request at a glance**,
     review your fleet configuration, and make any adjustments if
     necessary.

11. (Optional) To download a copy of the launch configuration for
     use with the AWS CLI, choose **JSON**
    **config**.

12. When you're ready to launch your Spot Fleet, choose
     **Launch**.

    The Spot Fleet request type is `fleet`. When the request
     is fulfilled, requests of type `instance` are added,
     where the state is `active` and the status is
     `fulfilled`.

AWS CLI

###### To create a Spot Fleet request

Use the [request-spot-fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-fleet.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 request-spot-fleet --spot-fleet-request-config file://config.json
```

For example configuration files, see [Example CLI configurations Spot Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-examples.html).

PowerShell

###### To create a Spot Fleet request

Use the [Request-EC2SpotFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Request-EC2SpotFleet.html) cmdlet. The following example
launches Spot Instances in a capacity-optimized fleet.

```powershell

Request-EC2SpotFleet `
    -SpotFleetRequestConfig_TargetCapacity 50 `
    -SpotFleetRequestConfig_AllocationStrategy "CapacityOptimized" `
    -SpotFleetRequestConfig_IamFleetRole "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-spot-fleet-role" `
    -SpotFleetRequestConfig_LaunchTemplateConfig @($launchConfig)
```

Define the launch configuration as follows, setting the launch
template and override properties that you need. For example
configurations, see [Example CLI configurations Spot Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-examples.html).

```powershell

$lcSpec = Amazon.EC2.Model.FleetLaunchTemplateSpecification
# To do - Set FleetLaunchTemplateSpecification properties
$lcOverrides = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.LaunchTemplateOverrides
# To do - Set LaunchTemplateOverrides properties
$launchConfig = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.LaunchTemplateConfig
$launchConfig.LaunchTemplateSpecification $lcSpec
$launchConfig.Overrides @($lcOverrides)
```

## Create a Spot Fleet that replaces unhealthy Spot Instances

Spot Fleet checks the health status of the Spot Instances in the fleet every two minutes. The
health status of an instance is either `healthy` or
`unhealthy`.

Spot Fleet determines the health status of an instance by using the status checks
provided by Amazon EC2. An instance is determined as `unhealthy` when the
status of either the instance status check or the system status check is
`impaired` for three consecutive health checks. For more information,
see [Status checks for Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html).

You can configure your fleet to replace unhealthy Spot Instances. After enabling health
check replacement, a Spot Instance is replaced when it is reported as `unhealthy`.
The fleet could go below its target capacity for up to a few minutes while an
unhealthy Spot Instance is being replaced.

###### Requirements

- Health check replacement is supported only for Spot Fleets that maintain a
target capacity (fleets of type `maintain`), not for one-time
Spot Fleets (fleets of type `request`).

- Health check replacement is supported only for Spot Instances. This feature is not
supported for On-Demand Instances.

- You can configure your Spot Fleet to replace unhealthy instances only when you
create it.

- Users can use health check replacement only if they have permission to
call the `ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus` action.

Console

###### To configure a Spot Fleet to replace unhealthy Spot Instances

1. Follow the steps for creating a Spot Fleet in [Create a Spot Fleet request using defined parameters](#create-spot-fleet-advanced).

2. To configure the fleet to replace unhealthy Spot Instances, expand
    **Additional launch parameters**, and under
    **Health check**, select **Replace**
**unhealthy instances**. To enable this option, you
    must first choose **Maintain target**
**capacity**.

AWS CLI

###### To configure a Spot Fleet to replace unhealthy Spot Instances

Use the [request-spot-fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-fleet.html) command with the
