# Security groups for EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint

A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources
that it is associated with. For example, we deny traffic to and from an Amazon EC2 instance
unless it is specifically allowed by the security groups associated with the
instance.

The following examples show you how to configure the security group rules for the
EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint and the target instances.

- [Target instance security group rules](#resource-security-group-rules)

## EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint security group rules

The security group rules for an EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint must allow outbound traffic
destined for the target instances to leave the endpoint. You can specify either the
instance security group or the IPv4 or IPv6 address range of the VPC as the
destination.

Traffic to the endpoint originates from the EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint Service, and it is
allowed regardless of the inbound rules for the endpoint security group. To control
who can use EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint to connect to an instance, use an IAM policy. For more
information, see [Permissions to use EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint to connect to instances](permissions-for-ec2-instance-connect-endpoint.md#iam-OpenTunnel).

###### Example outbound rule: Security group referencing

The following example uses security group referencing, which means that the
destination is a security group associated with the target instances. This rule
allows outbound traffic from the endpoint to all instances that use this
security group.

instance security group

###### Example outbound rule: IPv4 address range

The following example allows outbound traffic to the specified IPv4 address
range. The IPv4 addresses of an instance is assigned from its subnet, so you can
use the IPv4 address range of the VPC.

###### Example outbound rule: IPv6 address range

The following example allows outbound traffic to the specified IPv6 address
range. The IPv6 addresses of an instance is assigned from its subnet, so you can
use the IPv6 address range of the VPC.

## Target instance security group rules

The security group rules for target instances must allow inbound traffic from the
EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint. You can specify either the endpoint security group or an IPv4 or
IPv6 address range as the source. If you specify an IPv4 address range, the source
depends on whether client IP preservation is off or on. For more information, see
[Considerations](connect-with-ec2-instance-connect-endpoint.md#ec2-instance-connect-endpoint-prerequisites).

Because security groups are stateful, the response traffic is allowed to leave the
VPC regardless of the outbound rules for the instance security group.

###### Example inbound rule: Security group referencing

The following example uses security group referencing, which means that the
source is the security group associated with the endpoint. This rule allows
inbound SSH traffic from the endpoint to all instances that use this security
group, whether client IP preservation is on or off. If there are no other
inbound security group rules for SSH, then the instances accept SSH traffic only
from the endpoint.

endpoint security group

###### Example inbound rule: Client IP preservation off

The following example allows inbound SSH traffic from the specified IPv4
address range. Because client IP preservation is off, the source IPv4 address is
the address of the endpoint network interface. The address of the endpoint
network interface is assigned from its subnet, so you can use the IPv4 address
range of the VPC to allow connections to all instances in the VPC.

###### Example inbound rule: Client IP preservation on

The following example allows inbound SSH traffic from the specified IPv4
address range. Because client IP preservation is on, the source IPv4 address is
the address of the client.
