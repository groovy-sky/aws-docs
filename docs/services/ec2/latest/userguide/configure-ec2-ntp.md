# Set the time reference on your EC2 instance to use the local Amazon Time Sync Service

The local Amazon Time Sync Service either uses the Network Time Protocol (NTP), or provides a local
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) hardware clock on [supported instances](#ptp-hardware-clock-requirements). The PTP
hardware clock supports either an NTP connection (Linux and Windows instances), or a
direct PTP connection (Linux instances only). The NTP and direct PTP connections use the
same highly accurate time source, but the direct PTP connection is more accurate than
the NTP connection. The NTP connection to the Amazon Time Sync Service supports leap smearing while the
PTP connection to the PTP hardware clock does not smear time. For more information, see
[Leap seconds](set-time.md#leap-seconds).

Your instances can access the local Amazon Time Sync Service as follows:

- Through NTP at the following IP address endpoints:

- IPv4: `169.254.169.123`

- IPv6: `fd00:ec2::123` (Only accessible on [Nitro-based instances](instance-types.md#instance-hypervisor-type).)

- (Linux only) Through a direct PTP connection to connect to a local PTP
hardware clock:

- `PHC0`

Amazon Linux AMIs, Windows AMIs, and most partner AMIs configure your instance to use the NTP
IPv4 endpoint by default. This is the recommended setting for most customer workloads.
No further configuration is required for instances launched from these AMIs unless you
want to use the IPv6 endpoint or connect directly to the PTP hardware clock.

NTP and PTP connections do not require any VPC configuration changes, and your
instance does not require access to the internet.

###### Considerations

- There is a 1024 packet per second (PPS) limit to services that use [link-local](using-instance-addressing.md#link-local-addresses) addresses. This limit includes the aggregate of [Route 53 Resolver DNS Queries](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/amazondns-concepts.md#vpc-dns-limits), [Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)](instancedata-data-retrieval.md) requests, Amazon Time Service Network Time Protocol (NTP) requests, and [Windows Licensing Service (for Microsoft Windows based instances)](https://aws.amazon.com/windows/resources/licensing) requests.

- Only Linux instances can use a _direct PTP_
_connection_ to connect to the local PTP hardware clock. Windows
instances use NTP to connect to the local PTP hardware clock.

## Connect to the IPv4 endpoint of the Amazon Time Sync Service

Your AMI might already have configured the Amazon Time Sync Service by default. Otherwise, use
the following procedures to configure your instance to use the local Amazon Time Sync Service
through the IPv4 endpoint.

Amazon Linux

AL2023 and recent versions of Amazon Linux 2 are configured to use the
Amazon Time Sync Service IPv4 endpoint by default. If you confirm that your instance
is already configured, you can skip the following procedure.

###### To verify that chrony is configured to use the IPv4 endpoint

Run the following command. In the output, the line that starts with
`^*` indicates the preferred time source.

```nohighlight

chronyc sources -v | grep -F ^*
^* 169.254.169.123               3   4   377    14    +12us[+9653ns] +/-  290us
```

###### To configure chrony to connect to the IPv4 endpoint on older versions of Amazon Linux 2

1. Connect to your instance and uninstall the NTP
    service.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum erase 'ntp*'
```

2. Install the `chrony` package.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install chrony
```

3. Open the `/etc/chrony.conf` file using a
    text editor (such as **vim** or
    **nano**). Add the following line before any other `server` or `pool`
    statements that may be present in the file, and
    save your changes:

```nohighlight

server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
```

4. Restart the `chrony` daemon
    ( `chronyd`).

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo service chronyd restart
```

```nohighlight

Starting chronyd:                                          [  OK  ]
```

###### Note

On
RHEL
and CentOS (up to version 6), the
service name is `chrony` instead of
`chronyd`.

5. To configure `chronyd` to start at each
    system boot, use the `chkconfig`
    command.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo chkconfig chronyd on
```

6. Verify that `chrony` is using the
    `169.254.169.123` IPv4 endpoint to
    synchronize the time.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ chronyc sources -v | grep -F ^*
```

In the output, `^*` indicates the preferred time source.

```nohighlight

^* 169.254.169.123               3   6    17    43    -30us[ -226us] +/-  287us
```

7. Verify the time synchronization metrics that are
    reported by `chrony`.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ chronyc tracking
```

Ubuntu

###### To configure chrony to connect to the IPv4 endpoint on Ubuntu

1. Connect to your instance and use `apt` to
    install the `chrony` package.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install chrony
```

###### Note

If necessary, update your instance first by
running `sudo apt update`.

2. Open the `/etc/chrony/chrony.conf` file
    using a text editor (such as **vim** or
    **nano**). Add the following line
    before any other `server` or
    `pool` statements that are already
    present in the file, and save your changes:

```nohighlight

server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
```

3. Restart the `chrony` service.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/chrony restart
```

```nohighlight

Restarting chrony (via systemctl): chrony.service.
```

4. Verify that `chrony` is using the
    `169.254.169.123` IPv4 endpoint to
    synchronize the time.

```nohighlight

ubuntu:~$ chronyc sources -v | grep -F ^*
```

In the output, the line starting with `^*` indicates the preferred time source.

```nohighlight

SUSE Linux

Starting with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15, `chrony`
is the default implementation of NTP.

###### To configure chrony to connect to IPv4 endpoint on SUSE Linux

1. Open the `/etc/chrony.conf` file using a
    text editor (such as **vim** or
    **nano**).

2. Verify that the file contains the following
    line:

```nohighlight

server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
```

If this line is not present, add it.

3. Comment out any other server or pool lines.

4. Open YaST and enable the chrony service.

Windows

Starting with the August 2018 release, Windows AMIs use the Amazon Time Sync Service by
default. No further configuration is required for instances launched from
these AMIs and you can skip the following procedures.

If you're using an AMI that doesn't have the Amazon Time Sync Service configured by default,
first verify your current NTP configuration. If your instance is already
using the IPv4 endpoint of the Amazon Time Sync Service, no further configuration is required.
If your instance is not using the Amazon Time Sync Service, then complete the procedure to
change the NTP server to use the Amazon Time Sync Service.

###### To verify the NTP configuration

1. From your instance, open a Command Prompt window.

2. Get the current NTP configuration by typing the following
    command:

```nohighlight

w32tm /query /configuration
```

This command returns the current configuration settings for the
    Windows instance and will show if you're connected to the
    Amazon Time Sync Service.

3. (Optional) Get the status of the current configuration by typing
    the following command:

```nohighlight

w32tm /query /status
```

This command returns information such as the last time the
    instance synced with the NTP server and the poll interval.

###### To change the NTP server to use the Amazon Time Sync Service

1. From the Command Prompt window, run the following command:

```nohighlight

w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:169.254.169.123 /syncfromflags:manual /update
```

2. Verify your new settings by using the following command:

```nohighlight

w32tm /query /configuration
```

In the output that's returned, verify that `NtpServer`
    displays the `169.254.169.123` IPv4 endpoint.

###### Default NTP settings for Amazon Windows AMIs

Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) generally adhere to the out-of-the-box
defaults except in cases where changes are required to function on EC2
infrastructure. The following settings have been determined to work well
in a virtual environment, as well as to keep any clock drift to within
one second of accuracy:

- Update Interval –
Governs how frequently the time service will adjust system time
towards accuracy. AWS configures the update interval to occur
once every two minutes.

- NTP Server – Starting
with the August 2018 release, AMIs use the Amazon Time Sync Service by default.
This time service is accessible from any AWS Region at the
169.254.169.123 IPv4 endpoint. Additionally, the 0x9 flag
indicates that the time service is acting as a client, and to
use `SpecialPollInterval` to determine how frequently
to check in with the configured time server.

- Type – "NTP" means that
the service acts as a standalone NTP client instead of acting as
part of a domain.

- Enabled and InputProvider
– The time service is enabled and provides time to the
operating system.

- Special Poll Interval –
Checks against the configured NTP Server every 900 seconds (15
minutes).

###### Note

For Windows Server 2025 AMIs, the
`SpecialPollInterval` value is 1024 seconds
instead of 900 seconds.

## Connect to the IPv6 endpoint of the Amazon Time Sync Service

This section explains how the steps described in [Connect to the IPv4 endpoint of the Amazon Time Sync Service](#configure-amazon-time-service-IPv4) differ if you are
configuring your instance to use the local Amazon Time Sync Service through the IPv6 endpoint. It
doesn't explain the entire Amazon Time Sync Service configuration process.

The IPv6 endpoint is only accessible on [Nitro-based instances](instance-types.md#instance-hypervisor-type).

We don't recommend using both the IPv4 and IPv6 endpoint entries together. The
IPv4 and IPv6 NTP packets come from the same local server for your instance.
Configuring both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints is unnecessary and will not improve the
accuracy of the time on your instance.

Linux

Depending on the Linux distribution you're using, when you reach the step
to edit the `chrony.conf` file, you'll be using the IPv6 endpoint
of the Amazon Time Sync Service ( `fd00:ec2::123`) rather than the IPv4 endpoint
( `169.254.169.123`):

```nohighlight

server fd00:ec2::123 prefer iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
```

Save the file and verify that chrony is using the
`fd00:ec2::123` IPv6 endpoint to synchronize time:

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ chronyc sources -v
```

In the output, if you see the `fd00:ec2::123` IPv6 endpoint,
the configuration is complete.

Windows

When you reach the step to change the NTP server to use the Amazon Time Sync Service, you'll
be using the IPv6 endpoint of the Amazon Time Sync Service ( `fd00:ec2::123`) rather
than the IPv4 endpoint ( `169.254.169.123`):

```nohighlight

w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:fd00:ec2::123 /syncfromflags:manual /update
```

Verify that your new settings are using the `fd00:ec2::123`
IPv6 endpoint to synchronize time:

```nohighlight

w32tm /query /configuration
```

In the output, verify that `NtpServer` displays the
`fd00:ec2::123` IPv6 endpoint.

## Connect to the PTP hardware clock

The PTP hardware clock is part of the [AWS Nitro System](../instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.md),
so it is directly accessible on [supported bare metal and virtualized EC2 instances](#ptp-hardware-clock-requirements) without using any
customer resources.

The NTP endpoints for the PTP hardware clock are the same as those for the regular
Amazon Time Sync Service. If your instance has a PTP hardware clock and you configured the NTP
connection (to either the IPv4 or IPv6 endpoint), your instance time is
automatically sourced from the PTP hardware clock over NTP.

For Linux instances, you can configure a _direct_
PTP connection, which will give you more accurate time than the NTP connection.
Windows instances only support an NTP connection to the PTP hardware clock.

### Requirements

The PTP hardware clock is available on an instance when the following
requirements are met:

- Supported AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio),
Asia Pacific (Malaysia), Asia Pacific (Thailand),
Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Europe (Stockholm)

- Supported Local Zones: US East (New York City)

- Supported instance families:

- **General purpose:** M7a, M7g, M7i

- **Memory optimized:** R7a, R7g, R7i

- **Storage optimized:** I8g, I8ge

- (Linux only) ENA driver version 2.10.0 or later installed on a
supported operating system. For more information about supported
operating systems, see the driver [prerequisites](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/tree/master/kernel/linux/ena) on _GitHub_.

This section describes how to configure your Linux instance to use the
local Amazon Time Sync Service through the PTP hardware clock using a direct PTP connection.
It requires adding a server entry for the PTP hardware clock in the
`chrony` configuration file.

###### To configure a direct PTP connection to the PTP hardware clock (Linux instances only)

1. **Install prerequisites**

Connect to your Linux instance and do the following:

1. Install the Linux kernel driver for Elastic Network
       Adapter (ENA) version 2.10.0 or later.

2. Enable the PTP hardware clock.

For the installation instructions, see [Linux kernel driver for Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)\
family](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/tree/master/kernel/linux/ena) on _GitHub_.

2. **Verify ENA PTP device**

Verify that the ENA PTP hardware clock device shows up on your
    instance.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ for file in /sys/class/ptp/*; do echo -n "$file: "; cat "$file/clock_name"; done
```

Expected output

```nohighlight

/sys/class/ptp/ptp<index>: ena-ptp-<PCI slot>
```

Where:

- `index` is the
kernel-registered PTP hardware clock index.

- `PCI slot` is the
ENA ethernet controller PCI slot. This is the same slot as
shown in `lspci | grep ENA`.

Example output

```nohighlight

/sys/class/ptp/ptp0: ena-ptp-05
```

If `ena-ptp-<PCI slot>`
is not in the output, the ENA driver was not correctly installed.
Review step 1 in this procedure for installing the driver.

3. **Configure PTP symlink**

PTP devices are typically named `/dev/ptp0`,
    `/dev/ptp1`, and so on, with their index depending on
    the hardware initialization order. Creating a symlink ensures that
    applications like chrony consistently reference the correct device,
    regardless of index changes.

The latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMIs include a `udev` rule that
    creates the `/dev/ptp_ena` symlink, pointing to the
    correct `/dev/ptp` entry associated with the ENA
    host.

First check if the symlink is present by running the following
    command.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ ls -l /dev/ptp*
```

Example output

```nohighlight

crw------- 1 root root 245, 0 Jan 31 2025 /dev/ptp0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      4 Jan 31 2025 /dev/ptp_ena -> ptp0
```

Where:

- `/dev/ptp<index>`
is the path to the PTP device.

- `/dev/ptp_ena` is the constant symlink,
which points to the same PTP device.

If the `/dev/ptp_ena` symlink is present, skip to Step
4 in this procedure. If it's missing, do the following:
1. Add the following `udev` rule.

      ```nohighlight

      [ec2-user ~]$ echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"ptp\", ATTR{clock_name}==\"ena-ptp-*\", SYMLINK += \"ptp_ena\"" | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/53-ec2-network-interfaces.rules
      ```

2. Reload the `udev` rule, either by rebooting the
       instance, or by running the following command.

      ```nohighlight

      [ec2-user ~]$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
      ```
4. **Configure chrony**

chrony must be configured to use the `/dev/ptp_ena`
    symlink instead of directly referencing
    / `dev/ptp<index>`.
1. Edit `/etc/chrony.conf` using a text editor and
       add the following line anywhere in the file.

      ```nohighlight

      refclock PHC /dev/ptp_ena poll 0 delay 0.000010 prefer
      ```

2. Restart chrony.

      ```nohighlight

      [ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl restart chronyd
      ```
5. **Verify chrony**
**configuration**

Verify that chrony is using the PTP hardware clock to synchronize
    the time on this instance.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ chronyc sources
```

Expected output

```nohighlight

MS Name/IP address         Stratum Poll Reach LastRx Last sample
===============================================================================
#* PHC0                          0   0    377    1   +2ns[ +1ns] +/-   5031ns
```

In the output that's returned, `*` indicates the
    preferred time source. `PHC0` corresponds to the PTP
    hardware clock. You might need to wait a few seconds after
    restarting chrony for the asterisk to appear.
