# Aggregate statistics across instances

Aggregate statistics are available for instances that have detailed monitoring enabled.
Instances that use basic monitoring are not included in the aggregates. Before you can get
statistics aggregated across instances, you must [enable detailed monitoring](manage-detailed-monitoring.md#enable-detailed-monitoring) (at an additional charge), which provides data in
1-minute periods.

Note that Amazon CloudWatch cannot aggregate data across AWS Regions. Metrics are completely
separate between Regions.

This example shows you how to use detailed monitoring to get the average CPU usage for
your EC2 instances. Because no dimension is specified, CloudWatch returns statistics for all
dimensions in the `AWS/EC2` namespace.

###### Important

This technique for retrieving all dimensions across an AWS namespace does not work for
custom namespaces that you publish to Amazon CloudWatch. With custom namespaces, you must specify
the complete set of dimensions that are associated with any given data point to retrieve
statistics that include the data point.

###### To display average CPU utilization across your instances (console)

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**.

3. Choose the **EC2** namespace and then choose **Across All**
**Instances**.

4. Choose the row that contains **CPUUtilization**, which displays a
    graph for the metric for all your EC2 instances. To name the graph, choose the pencil
    icon. To change the time range, select one of the predefined values or choose
    **custom**.

5. To change the statistic or the period for the metric, choose the **Graphed**
**metrics** tab. Choose the column heading or an individual value, and then
    choose a different value.

###### To get average CPU utilization across your instances (AWS CLI)

Use the [get-metric-statistics](../../../cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/get-metric-statistics.md) command as follows to get the average of the
**CPUUtilization** metric across your instances.

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
    --namespace AWS/EC2 \
    --metric-name CPUUtilization \
    --period 3600  --statistics "Average" "SampleCount" \
    --start-time 2022-10-11T23:18:00 \
    --end-time 2022-10-12T23:18:00
```

The following is example output:

```json

{
    "Datapoints": [
        {
            "SampleCount": 238.0,
            "Timestamp": "2022-10-12T07:18:00Z",
            "Average": 0.038235294117647062,
            "Unit": "Percent"
        },
        {
            "SampleCount": 240.0,
            "Timestamp": "2022-10-12T09:18:00Z",
            "Average": 0.16670833333333332,
            "Unit": "Percent"
        },
        {
            "SampleCount": 238.0,
            "Timestamp": "2022-10-11T23:18:00Z",
            "Average": 0.041596638655462197,
            "Unit": "Percent"
        }
    ],
    "Label": "CPUUtilization"
}
```
