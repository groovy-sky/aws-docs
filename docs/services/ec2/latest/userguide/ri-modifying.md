# Modify Reserved Instances

When your needs change, you can modify your Standard or Convertible Reserved Instances and continue to benefit
from the billing benefit. You can modify attributes such as the Availability Zone,
instance size (within the same instance family and generation), and scope of your
Reserved Instance.

###### Note

You can also exchange a Convertible Reserved Instance for another Convertible Reserved Instance with a different configuration.
For more information, see [Exchange Convertible Reserved Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-convertible-exchange.html).

You can modify all or a subset of your Reserved Instances. You can separate your original Reserved Instances
into two or more new Reserved Instances. For example, if you have a reservation for 10 instances in
`us-east-1a` and decide to move 5 instances to `us-east-1b`,
the modification request results in two new reservations: one for 5 instances in
`us-east-1a` and the other for 5 instances in
`us-east-1b`.

You can also _merge_ two or more Reserved Instances into a single Reserved Instance. For
example, if you have four `t2.small` Reserved Instances of one instance each, you can
merge them to create one `t2.large` Reserved Instance. For more information, see [Support for modifying instance sizes](#ri-modification-instancemove).

After modification, the benefit of the Reserved Instances is applied only to instances that match
the new parameters. For example, if you change the Availability Zone of a reservation,
the capacity reservation and pricing benefits are automatically applied to instance
usage in the new Availability Zone. Instances that no longer match the new parameters
are charged at the On-Demand rate, unless your account has other applicable
reservations.

If your modification request succeeds:

- The modified reservation becomes effective immediately and the pricing benefit
is applied to the new instances beginning at the hour of the modification
request. For example, if you successfully modify your reservations at 9:15PM,
the pricing benefit transfers to your new instance at 9:00PM. You can get the
effective date of the modified Reserved Instances by using the [describe-reserved-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-reserved-instances.html) command.

- The original reservation is retired. Its end date is the start date of the new
reservation, and the end date of the new reservation is the same as the end date
of the original Reserved Instance. If you modify a three-year reservation that had 16 months
left in its term, the resulting modified reservation is a 16-month reservation
with the same end date as the original one.

- The modified reservation lists a $0 fixed price and not the fixed price of the
original reservation.

- The fixed price of the modified reservation does not affect the discount
pricing tier calculations applied to your account, which are based on the fixed
price of the original reservation.

If your modification request fails, your Reserved Instances maintain their original configuration,
and are immediately available for another modification request.

There is no fee for modification, and you do not receive any new bills or
invoices.

You can modify your reservations as frequently as you like, but you cannot change or
cancel a pending modification request after you submit it. After the modification has
completed successfully, you can submit another modification request to roll back any
changes you made, if needed.

## Requirements and restrictions for modification

You can modify these attributes as follows.

Modifiable attributeSupported platformsLimitations and considerations

Change **Availability Zones**
within the same Region

Linux and Windows

-

Change the **scope** from
Availability Zone to Region and vice versa

Linux and Windows

A zonal Reserved Instance is scoped to an Availability Zone and reserves
capacity in that Availability Zone. If you change the scope from
Availability Zone to Region (in other words, from zonal to
regional), you lose the capacity reservation benefit.

A regional Reserved Instance is scoped to a Region. Your
Reserved Instance discount can apply to instances running in any
Availability Zone in that Region. Furthermore, the Reserved
Instance discount applies to instance usage across all sizes in
the selected instance family. If you change the scope from
Region to Availability Zone (in other words, from regional to
zonal), you lose Availability Zone flexibility and instance size
flexibility (if applicable).

For more information, see [How Reserved Instance discounts are applied](apply-ri.md).

Change the **instance size**
within the same instance family and generation

Linux/UNIX only

Instance size flexibility is not available for Reserved Instances on the
other platforms, which include Linux with SQL Server Standard,
Linux with SQL Server Web, Linux with SQL Server Enterprise, Red
Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux, Windows, Windows with SQL
Standard, Windows with SQL Server Enterprise, and Windows with
SQL Server Web.

The reservation must use default tenancy. Some instance
families are not supported, because there are no other sizes
available. For more information, see [Support for modifying instance sizes](#ri-modification-instancemove)

###### Requirements

Amazon EC2 processes your modification request if there is sufficient capacity for
your new configuration (if applicable), and if the following conditions are
met:

- The Reserved Instance cannot be modified before or at the same time that you purchase
it

- The Reserved Instance must be active

- There cannot be a pending modification request

- The Reserved Instance is not listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace

- There must be a match between the instance size footprint of the original
reservation and the new configuration. For more information, see [Support for modifying instance sizes](#ri-modification-instancemove).

- The original Reserved Instances are all Standard Reserved Instances or all Convertible Reserved Instances, not some of each
type

- The original Reserved Instances must expire within the same hour, if they are Standard
Reserved Instances

- For modifying instance size, the Reserved Instance must support instance size
flexibility. For the list of Reserved Instances that don't support instance size
flexibility, see [Instance size flexibility](apply-ri.md#ri-instance-size-flexibility).

## Support for modifying instance sizes

You can modify the instance size of a Reserved Instance if the following requirements are
met.

###### Requirements

- The platform is Linux/UNIX.

- You must select another instance size in the same [instance\
family](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/instance-type-names.html) (indicated by a letter, for example, T) and [generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/instance-type-names.html)
(indicated by a number, for example, 2).

For example, you can modify a Reserved Instance from `t2.small` to
`t2.large` because they're both in the same T2 family and
generation. But you can't modify a Reserved Instance from T2 to M2 or from T2 to T3,
because in both these examples, the target instance family and generation
are not the same as the original Reserved Instance.

- You can modify the instance size of a Reserved Instance only if it supports instance
size flexibility. For the list of Reserved Instances that don't support instance size
flexibility, see [Instance size flexibility](apply-ri.md#ri-instance-size-flexibility).

- You can't modify the instance size of Reserved Instances for `t1.micro`
instances, because `t1.micro` has only one size.

- The original and new Reserved Instance must have the same instance size
footprint.

- [Normalization factors for bare metal instances](#ri-normalization-factor-bare-metal-2)

### Instance size footprint

Each Reserved Instance has an _instance size footprint_, which is
determined by the normalization factor of the instance size and the number of
instances in the reservation. When you modify the instance sizes in an Reserved Instance, the
footprint of the new configuration must match that of the original
configuration, otherwise the modification request is not processed.

To calculate the instance size footprint of a Reserved Instance, multiply the number of
instances by the normalization factor. In the Amazon EC2 console, the normalization
factor is measured in units. The following table describes the normalization
factor for the instance sizes in an instance family. For example,
`t2.medium` has a normalization factor of 2, so a reservation for
four `t2.medium` instances has a footprint of 8 units.

Instance sizeNormalization factornano0.25micro0.5small1medium2large4xlarge82xlarge163xlarge244xlarge326xlarge488xlarge649xlarge7210xlarge8012xlarge9616xlarge12818xlarge14424xlarge19232xlarge25648xlarge38456xlarge448112xlarge896

You can allocate your reservations into different instance sizes across the
same instance family as long as the instance size footprint of your reservation
remains the same. For example, you can divide a reservation for one
`t2.large` (1 @ 4 units) instance into four `t2.small`
(4 @ 1 unit) instances. Similarly, you can combine a reservation for four
`t2.small` instances into one `t2.large` instance.
However, you cannot change your reservation for two `t2.small`
instances into one `t2.large` instance because the footprint of the
new reservation (4 units) is larger than the footprint of the original
reservation (2 units).

In the following example, you have a reservation with two
`t2.micro` instances (1 unit) and a reservation with one
`t2.small` instance (1 unit). If you merge both of these
reservations to a single reservation with one `t2.medium` instance (2
units), the footprint of the new reservation equals the footprint of the
combined reservations.

![Modifying Reserved Instances.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ri-modify-merge.png)

You can also modify a reservation to divide it into two or more reservations.
In the following example, you have a reservation with a `t2.medium`
instance (2 units). You can divide the reservation into two reservations, one
with two `t2.nano` instances (.5 units) and the other with three
`t2.micro` instances (1.5 units).

![Modifying Reserved Instances.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ri-modify-divide.png)

### Normalization factors for bare metal instances

You can modify a reservation with `metal` instances using other
sizes within the same instance family. Similarly, you can modify a reservation
with instances other than bare metal instances using the `metal` size
within the same instance family. Generally, a bare metal instance is the same
size as the largest available instance size within the same instance family. For
example, an `i3.metal` instance is the same size as an
`i3.16xlarge` instance, so they have the same normalization
factor.

The following table describes the normalization factor for the bare metal
instance sizes in the instance families that have bare metal instances. The
normalization factor for `metal` instances depends on the instance
family, unlike the other instance sizes.

Instance sizeNormalization factor`a1.metal`32`m5zn.metal` \| `x2iezn.metal` `z1d.metal`96`c6g.metal` \|

`u-24tb1.metal`448`u-6tb1.metal` \|
`u-9tb1.metal` \|
`u-12tb1.metal`896

For example, an `i3.metal` instance has a normalization factor of
128\. If you purchase an `i3.metal` default tenancy Amazon Linux/Unix
Reserved Instance, you can divide the reservation as follows:

- An `i3.16xlarge` is the same size as an
`i3.metal` instance, so its normalization factor is 128
(128/1). The reservation for one `i3.metal` instance can be
modified into one `i3.16xlarge` instance.

- An `i3.8xlarge` is half the size of an
`i3.metal` instance, so its normalization factor is 64
(128/2). The reservation for one `i3.metal` instance can be
divided into two `i3.8xlarge` instances.

- An `i3.4xlarge` is a quarter the size of an
`i3.metal` instance, so its normalization factor is 32
(128/4). The reservation for one `i3.metal` instance can be
divided into four `i3.4xlarge` instances.

## Submit modification requests

Before you modify your Reserved Instances, ensure that you have read the applicable [restrictions](#ri-modification-limits). Before you modify the
instance size, calculate the total [instance size footprint](#ri-modification-instancemove) of the original reservations that you want to
modify and ensure that it matches the total instance size footprint of your new
configurations.

Console

###### To modify your Reserved Instances

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the **Reserved Instances** page, select
    one or more Reserved Instances to modify, and choose
    **Actions**, **Modify Reserved**
**Instances**.

If your Reserved Instances are not in the active state or cannot be
    modified, **Modify Reserved Instances** is disabled.

3. The first entry in the modification table displays attributes
    of the selected Reserved Instances, and at least one target configuration
    beneath it. The **Units** column displays the
    total instance size footprint. Choose **Add**
    for each new configuration to add. Modify the attributes as
    needed for each configuration.

- **Scope**: Choose whether the
configuration applies to an Availability Zone or to the
whole Region.

- **Availability Zone**: Choose the
required Availability Zone. Not applicable for regional
Reserved Instances.

- **Instance type**: Select the
required instance type. The combined configurations must
equal the instance size footprint of your original
configurations.

- **Count**: Specify the number of
instances. To split the Reserved Instances into multiple
configurations, reduce the count, choose
**Add**, and specify a count for
the additional configuration. For example, if you have a
single configuration with a count of 10, you can change
its count to 6 and add a configuration with a count of
4\. This process retires the original Reserved Instance after the new
Reserved Instances are activated.

4. Choose **Continue**.

5. To confirm your modification choices when you finish
    specifying your target configurations, choose **Submit**
**modifications**.

6. You can determine the status of your modification request by
    looking at the **State** column in the Reserved Instances
    screen. The following are the possible states.

- **active _(pending_**
**_modification)_** —
Transition state for original Reserved Instances

- **retired _(pending_**
**_modification)_** —
Transition state for original Reserved Instances while new Reserved Instances are
being created

- **retired** — Reserved Instances
successfully modified and replaced

- **active** — One of
the following:

- New Reserved Instances created from a successful
modification request

- Original Reserved Instances after a failed modification
request

AWS CLI

###### To modify your Reserved Instances

Use the [modify-reserved-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-reserved-instances.html) command. You can provide the
configuration details in a JSON file.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-reserved-instances \
    --reserved-instances-ids b847fa93-e282-4f55-b59a-1342f5bd7c02 \
    --target-configurations file://configuration.json
```

###### To get the status of your modification request

Use the [describe-reserved-instances-modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-reserved-instances-modifications.html) command. The
status is `processing`, `fulfilled`, or
`failed`.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-reserved-instances-modifications \
    --reserved-instances-modification-ids rimod-d3ed4335-b1d3-4de6-ab31-0f13aaf46687 \
    --query ReservedInstancesModifications[].Status
```

PowerShell

###### To modify your Reserved Instances

Use the [Edit-EC2ReservedInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2ReservedInstance.html) cmdlet. You can provide the
configuration details in an object of type
`Amazon.EC2.Model.ReservedInstancesConfiguration`.

```powershell

Edit-EC2ReservedInstance `
    -ReservedInstancesId b847fa93-e282-4f55-b59a-1342f5bd7c02 `
    -TargetConfiguration $configuration
```

###### To get the status of your modification request

Use the [Get-EC2ReservedInstancesModification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2ReservedInstancesModification.html) cmdlet. The status
is `processing`, `fulfilled`, or
`failed`.

```powershell

Get-EC2ReservedInstancesModification `
    -ReservedInstancesModificationId rimod-d3ed4335-b1d3-4de6-ab31-0f13aaf46687 | `
    Select Status
```

## Troubleshoot modification requests

If the target configuration settings that you requested were unique, you receive a
message that your request is being processed. At this point, Amazon EC2 has only
determined that the parameters of your modification request are valid. Your
modification request can still fail during processing due to unavailable
capacity.

In some situations, you might get a message indicating incomplete or failed
modification requests instead of a confirmation. Use the information in such
messages as a starting point for resubmitting another modification request. Ensure
that you have read the applicable [restrictions](#ri-modification-limits) before submitting the request.

###### Not all selected Reserved Instances can be processed for modification

Amazon EC2 identifies and lists the Reserved Instances that cannot be modified. If you receive a
message like this, go to the **Reserved Instances** page in the
Amazon EC2 console and check the information for the Reserved Instances.

###### Error in processing your modification request

You submitted one or more Reserved Instances for modification and none of your requests can
be processed. Depending on the number of reservations you are modifying, you can
get different versions of the message.

Amazon EC2 displays the reasons why your request cannot be processed. For example, you
might have specified the same target configuration—a combination of
Availability Zone and platform—for one or more subsets of the Reserved Instances you are
modifying. Try submitting the modification requests again, but ensure that the
instance details of the reservations match, and that the target configurations for
all subsets being modified are unique.
