# Modify the Capacity Reservation settings of your instance

You can modify the following Capacity Reservation settings for a stopped instance at any time:

- Start in any Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes (instance type, platform,
Availability Zone, and tenancy) and available capacity.

- Start the instance in a specific Capacity Reservation.

- Start in any Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes and available capacity in a
Capacity Reservation group

- Prevent the instance from starting in a Capacity Reservation.

Console

###### To modify instance Capacity Reservation settings

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Choose **Instances** and select the instance to
    modify. Stop the instance if it is not already stopped.

3. Choose **Actions**, **Instance**
**settings**, **Modify Capacity Reservation**
**Settings**.

4. For **Capacity Reservation**, choose one of the following
    options:

- **Open** – Launches the instances
into any Capacity Reservation that has matching attributes and sufficient
capacity for the number of instances you selected. If there
is no matching Capacity Reservation with sufficient capacity, the instance
uses On-Demand capacity.

- **None** – Prevents the instances
from launching into a Capacity Reservation. The instances run in On-Demand
capacity.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation** – Launches the
instances into the selected Capacity Reservation. If the selected Capacity Reservation does
not have sufficient capacity for the number of instances you
selected, the instance launch fails.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation group** – Launches
the instances into any Capacity Reservation with matching attributes and
available capacity in the selected Capacity Reservation group. If the
selected group does not have a Capacity Reservation with matching attributes
and available capacity, the instances launch into On-Demand
capacity.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation only** – Launches
the instances into a Capacity Reservation. If a Capacity Reservation ID isn't specified, the
instances launch into an open Capacity Reservation. If capacity isn't
available, the instances fail to launch.

- **Specify Capacity Reservation resource group only**
– Launches the instances into a Capacity Reservation in a Capacity Reservation
resource group. If a Capacity Reservation resource group ARN isn't
specified, the instances launch into an open Capacity Reservation. If
capacity isn't available, the instances fail to
launch.

AWS CLI

###### To modify instance Capacity Reservation settings

Use the [modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes.html)
command.

The following example changes the Capacity Reservation preference to `none`.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification CapacityReservationPreference=none
```

The following example the target to a specific Capacity Reservation.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification \
    CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=cr-1234567890abcdef0}
```

The following example changes the target to a specific Capacity Reservation group.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification \
        CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn=arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/my-cr-group}
```

The following example changes the Capacity Reservation preference to
`capacity-reservation-only`. Because it doesn't specify a Capacity Reservation,
instances launch into any open Capacity Reservation with matching attributes and
available capacity.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification CapacityReservationPreference=capacity-reservation-only
```

The following example changes the Capacity Reservation preference to
`capacity-reservation-only` and changes the target
to a specific Capacity Reservation. If capacity isn't available in the specified Capacity Reservation,
the instances fail to launch.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-capacity-reservation-attributes \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --capacity-reservation-specification \
        CapacityReservationPreference=capacity-reservation-only \
        CapacityReservationTarget={CapacityReservationId=cr-1234567890abcdef0}
```

PowerShell

###### To modify instance Capacity Reservation settings

Use the [Edit-EC2InstanceCapacityReservationAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstanceCapacityReservationAttribute.html) cmdlet.

The following example changes the Capacity Reservation preference to `none`.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceCapacityReservationAttribute `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -CapacityReservationSpecification_CapacityReservationPreference "none"
```

The following example the target to a specific Capacity Reservation.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceCapacityReservationAttribute `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -CapacityReservationTarget_CapacityReservationId cr-1234567890abcdef0
```

The following example changes the target to a specific Capacity Reservation group.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceCapacityReservationAttribute `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -CapacityReservationTarget_CapacityReservationResourceGroupArn `
        "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/my-cr-group"
```

The following example changes the Capacity Reservation preference to
`capacity-reservation-only`. Because it doesn't specify a Capacity Reservation,
instances launch into any open Capacity Reservation with matching attributes and
available capacity.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceCapacityReservationAttribute `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -CapacityReservationSpecification_CapacityReservationPreference "capacity-reservation-only"
```

The following example changes the Capacity Reservation preference to
`capacity-reservation-only` and changes the target
to a specific Capacity Reservation. If capacity isn't available in the specified Capacity Reservation,
the instances fail to launch.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceCapacityReservationAttribute `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -CapacityReservationSpecification_CapacityReservationPreference "capacity-reservation-only" `
    -CapacityReservationTarget_CapacityReservationId cr-1234567890abcdef0
```
