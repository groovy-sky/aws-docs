# Modify an EC2 Fleet
<a name="modify-ec2-fleet"></a>

You can modify the total target capacity, Spot capacity, and On-Demand capacity of an EC2 Fleet. You can also modify whether running instances should be terminated if the new total target capacity is reduced below the current size of the fleet.

## Considerations
<a name="modify-ec2-fleet-considerations"></a>

Consider the following when modifying an EC2 Fleet:
+ **Fleet type** – You can only modify an EC2 Fleet of type `maintain`. You can't modify an EC2 Fleet of type `request` or `instant`.
+ **Fleet parameters** – You can modify the following parameters of an EC2 Fleet:
  + `target-capacity-specification` – Increase or decrease the target capacity for:
    + `TotalTargetCapacity`
    + `OnDemandTargetCapacity`
    + `SpotTargetCapacity`
  + `excess-capacity-termination-policy` – Whether running instances should be terminated if the total target capacity of the EC2 Fleet is decreased below the current size of the fleet. Valid values are:
    + `no-termination`
    + `termination`
+ **Fleet behavior when increasing total target capacity** – When you increase the total target capacity, the EC2 Fleet launches the additional instances according to the instance purchasing option specified for `DefaultTargetCapacityType`, which is either On-Demand Instances or Spot Instances, and according to the specified [allocation strategy](ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.md).
+ **Fleet behavior when decreasing Spot target capacity** – When you decrease the Spot target capacity, the EC2 Fleet deletes any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet reaches the new target capacity. When an EC2 Fleet terminates a Spot Instance because the target capacity was decreased, the instance receives a Spot Instance interruption notice.

  Instances are selected for termination based on the allocation strategy:
  + `capacity-optimized` – Terminates instances from pools with the least available capacity.
  + `price-capacity-optimized` – Uses a combination of price and available capacity: terminates instances from pools with the least available capacity and which are the highest-priced among these pools.
  + `diversified` – Terminates instances across all pools.
  + `lowest-price` – Terminates instances from highest-priced pools.

  Alternatively, you can request that EC2 Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.
+ **Fleet state** – You can modify an EC2 Fleet that is in the `submitted` or `active` state. When you modify a fleet, it enters the `modifying` state.

## Commands for modifying an EC2 Fleet
<a name="modify-ec2-fleet-commands"></a>

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To modify the total target capacity of an EC2 Fleet**
Use the [modify-fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-fleet.html) command.

```
aws ec2 modify-fleet \
    --fleet-id {{fleet-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE}} \
    --target-capacity-specification TotalTargetCapacity={{20}}
```

If you are decreasing the target capacity but want to keep the fleet at its current size, you can modify the previous example as follows.

```
aws ec2 modify-fleet \
    --fleet-id {{fleet-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE}} \
    --target-capacity-specification TotalTargetCapacity={{10}} \
    --excess-capacity-termination-policy no-termination
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To modify the total target capacity of an EC2 Fleet**
Use the [Edit-EC2Fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2Fleet.html) cmdlet.

```
Edit-EC2Fleet `
    -FleetId "{{fleet-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE}}" `
    -TargetCapacitySpecification_TotalTargetCapacity {{20}}
```

If you are decreasing the target capacity but want to keep the fleet at its current size, you can modify the previous example as follows.

```
Edit-EC2Fleet `
    -FleetId "{{fleet-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE}}" `
    -TargetCapacitySpecification_TotalTargetCapacity {{20}} `
    -ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy "NoTermination"
```
