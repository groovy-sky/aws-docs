# Track your Free Tier usage for Amazon EC2

When you create your AWS account, you can get started with Amazon EC2 for free using the
[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free). Your Free Tier benefits
are different depending on whether you created your account before July 15, 2025, or on
or after July 15, 2025. For more information, see [Explore AWS services with\
AWS Free Tier](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier.md) in the _AWS Billing User Guide_.

## Free Tier benefits before and after July 15, 2025

## Track Free Tier usage for accounts created before July 15, 2025

###### Note

_**This section only applies to Free Tier users who**_
_**created AWS accounts before July 15, 2025. If you created your account**_
_**on or after July 15, 2025, see [Tracking your AWS Free Tier usage](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/tracking-free-tier-usage.md) in the**_
_**AWS Billing User Guide.**_

If you created your account before July 15, 2025, you can use Amazon EC2 without incurring
charges if you've been an AWS customer for less than 12 months and you stay within
the AWS Free Tier usage limits. It's important to track your Free Tier usage to
avoid billing surprises. If you exceed the Free Tier limits, you'll incur standard
pay-as-go charges. For more information, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

###### Note

If you've been an AWS customer for more than 12 months, you're no longer
eligible for Free Tier usage and you won't see the **EC2**
**Free Tier** box that is described in the following
procedure.

###### To track your Free Tier usage

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **EC2 Dashboard**.

3. Find the **EC2 Free Tier** box (at top right).

![The EC2 Free Tier box in the EC2 Dashboard.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2-free-tier-widget.png)

4. In the **EC2 Free Tier** box, check your Free Tier usage, as
    follows:

- Under **EC2 Free Tier offers in use**, take note of
the warnings:

- **End of month forecast** – This warns
that you will incur charges this month if you continue with your
current usage pattern.

- **Exceeds Free Tier** – This warns
that you've exceeded your Free Tier limits and you're already
incurring charges.

- Under **Offer usage (monthly)**, take note of your
usage of Linux instances, Windows instances, and EBS storage. The
percentage indicates how much of your Free Tier limits you've used this
month. If you're at 100%, you will incur charges for further use.

###### Note

This information appears only after you've created an instance.
However, usage information is not updated in real time; it's updated
three times a day.

5. To avoid incurring further charges, delete any resources that are either incurring charges
    now, or will incur charges if you exceed your Free Tier limit usage.

- For the instructions to delete your instance, see [Terminate Amazon EC2 instances](terminating-instances.md).

- To check if you have resources in other Regions that might be incurring charges, in the
**EC2 Free Tier** box, choose **View Global**
**EC2 resources** to open the **EC2 Global**
**View**. For more information, see [View resources across Regions using AWS Global View](global-view.md).

6. To view your resource usage for all AWS services under the AWS Free Tier,
    at the bottom of the **EC2 Free Tier** box, choose
    **View all AWS Free Tier offers**. For more information,
    see [Trying\
    services using AWS Free Tier](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-free-tier.md) in the _AWS_
_Billing User Guide_.
