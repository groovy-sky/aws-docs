# Configure the Instance Metadata Service options

The Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) runs locally on every EC2 instance. The _instance metadata options_ refer to a set of configurations
that control the accessibility and behavior of the IMDS on an EC2
instance.

You can configure the following instance metadata options on each instance:

**Instance metadata service (IMDS)**:
`enabled` \| `disabled`

You can enable or disable the IMDS on an instance. When disabled, you or
any code won't be able to access the instance metadata on the
instance.

The IMDS has two endpoints on an instance: IPv4
( `169.254.169.254`) and IPv6 ( `[fd00:ec2::254]`).
When you enable the IMDS, the IPv4 endpoint is automatically enabled. If you
want to enable the IPv6 endpoint, you need to do so explicitly.

**IMDS IPv6 endpoint**: `enabled` \|
`disabled`

You can explicitly enable the IPv6 IMDS endpoint on an instance. When the
IPv6 endpoint is enabled, the IPv4 endpoint remains enabled. The IPv6
endpoint is only supported on [Nitro-based instances](instance-types.md#instance-hypervisor-type) in [IPv6-supported subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html#subnet-ip-address-range) (dual stack or IPv6 only).

**Metadata version**: `IMDSv1 or IMDSv2
						(token optional)` \| `IMDSv2 only (token required)`

When requesting instance metadata, IMDSv2 calls require a token. IMDSv1
calls do not require a token. You can configure an instance to allow either
IMDSv1 or IMDSv2 calls (where a token is optional), or to only allow IMDSv2
calls (where a token is required).

**Metadata response hop limit**:
`1`– `64`

The hop limit is the number of network hops that the PUT response is allowed to make. You
can set the hop limit to a minimum of `1` and a maximum of
`64`. In a container environment, a hop limit of
`1` can cause issues. For information about how to mitigate
these issues, see the information about container environments under [Instance metadata access considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html#imds-considerations).

**Access to tags in instance metadata**:
`enabled` \| `disabled`

You can enable or disable access to the instance's tags from an instance's
metadata. For more information, see [View tags for your EC2 instances using instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/work-with-tags-in-IMDS.html).

To view an instance's current configuration, see [Query instance metadata options for existing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html#query-IMDS-existing-instances).

## Where to configure instance metadata options

Instance metadata options can be configured at different levels, as
follows:

- **Account** – You can set default
values for the instance metadata options at the account level for each
AWS Region. When an instance is launched, the instance metadata options
are automatically set to the account-level values. You can change these
values at launch. Account-level default values do not affect existing
instances.

- **AMI** – You can set the
`imds-support` parameter to `v2.0` when you
register or modify an AMI. When an instance is launched with this AMI, the
instance metadata version is automatically set to IMDSv2 and the hop
limit is set to 2.

- **Instance** – You can change all the
instance metadata options on an instance at launch, overriding the default
settings. You can also change the instance metadata options after launch on
a running or stopped instance. Note that changes may be restricted by an IAM
or SCP policy.

For more information, see [Configure instance metadata options for new instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-new-instances.html) and [Modify instance metadata options for existing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-existing-instances.html).

## Order of precedence for instance metadata options

The value for each instance metadata option is determined at instance launch,
following a hierarchical order of precedence. The hierarchy, with the highest
precedence at the top, is as follows:

- **Precedence 1: Instance configuration at**
**launch** – Values can be specified either in the launch
template or in the instance configuration. Any values specified here
override values specified at the account level or in the AMI.

- **Precedence 2: Account settings** –
If a value is not specified at instance launch, then it is determined by the
account-level settings (which are set for each AWS Region). Account-level
settings either include a value for each metadata option, or indicate no
preference at all.

- **Precedence 3: AMI configuration** –
If a value is not specified at instance launch or at the account level, then
it is determined by the AMI configuration. This applies only to
`HttpTokens` and `HttpPutResponseHopLimit`.

Each metadata option is evaluated separately. The instance can be configured with
a mix of direct instance configuration, account-level defaults, and the
configuration from the AMI.

You can change the value of any metadata option after launch on a running or
stopped instance, unless changes are restricted by an IAM or SCP policy.

###### Note

The account-level IMDSv2 enforcement setting is evaluated after the order of
precedence has determined the instance's IMDS settings. When IMDSv2
enforcement is enabled, instances enabled with IMDSv1 will fail. For
more information about enforcement, see [Enforce IMDSv2 at the account level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-new-instances.html#enforce-imdsv2-at-the-account-level).

###### Warning

If IMDSv2 enforcement is enabled and `httpTokens` has not been set to
`required` in either the instance configuration at launch, the
account settings, or the AMI configuration, your launch will fail.

**Example 1 – Determine values for metadata**
**options**

In this example, an EC2 instance is launched into a Region where the
`HttpPutResponseHopLimit` is set to `1` at the account
level. The specified AMI has `ImdsSupport` set to `v2.0`. No
metadata options are specified directly on the instance at launch. The instance is
launched with the following metadata options:

```json

"MetadataOptions": {
    ...
    "HttpTokens": "required",
    "HttpPutResponseHopLimit": 1,
    ...
```

These values were determined as follows:

- **No metadata options specified at launch:**
During the launch of the instance, specific values for the metadata options
were not provided either in the instance launch parameters or in the launch
template.

- **Account settings take next precedence:** In
the absence of specific values specified at launch, the settings at the
account level within the Region take precedence. This means that the default
values configured at the account level are applied. In this case, the
`HttpPutResponseHopLimit` was set to `1`.

- **AMI settings take last precedence:** In the
absence of a specific value specified at launch or at the account level for
`HttpTokens` (the instance metadata version), the AMI setting
is applied. In this case, the AMI setting `ImdsSupport: v2.0`
determined that `HttpTokens` was set to `required`.
Note that while the AMI setting `ImdsSupport: v2.0` is designed
to set `HttpPutResponseHopLimit: 2`, it was overridden by the
account-level setting `HttpPutResponseHopLimit: 1`, which has
higher precedence.

**Example 2 – Determine values for metadata**
**options**

In this example, the EC2 instance is launched with the same settings as in the
previous Example 1, but with `HttpTokens` set to `optional`
directly on the instance at launch. The instance is launched with the following
metadata options:

```json

"MetadataOptions": {
    ...
    "HttpTokens": "optional",
    "HttpPutResponseHopLimit": 1,
    ...
```

The value for `HttpPutResponseHopLimit` is determined in the same way
as in Example 1. However, the value for `HttpTokens` is determined as
follows: Metadata options configured on the instance at launch take first
precedence. Even though the AMI was configured with `ImdsSupport: v2.0`
(in other words, `HttpTokens` is set to `required`), the value
specified on the instance at launch ( `HttpTokens` set to
`optional`) took precedence.

**Example 3 – Determine values for metadata options with**
**HttpTokensEnforced enabled**

In this example, the account in the Region has `HttpTokens = required` and
`HttpTokensEnforced = enabled`.

Consider the following EC2 instance launch attempts:

- Launch attempt with `HttpTokens` set to `optional` – The
launch fails because the account-level enforcement is enabled
( `HttpTokensEnforced = enabled`) and the launch parameter
takes precedence over the account default.

- Launch attempt with `HttpTokens` set to `required` – The
launch succeeds because it complies with the account-level enforcement.

- Launch attempt with no `HttpTokens` value specified – The launch
succeeds because the value defaults to `required` based on the
account settings.

### Set the instance metadata version

When an instance is launched, the value for the instance _metadata_
_version_ is either **IMDSv1 or IMDSv2 (token**
**optional)** ( `httpTokens=optional`) or **IMDSv2**
**only (token required) ( `httpTokens=required`)**.

At instance launch, you can either manually specify the value for the metadata version, or
use the default value. If you manually specify the value, it overrides any
defaults. If you opt not to manually specify the value, it will be determined by
a combination of default settings.

The following flowchart shows how the metadata version for an instance at launch is
determined by the settings at the different levels of the configuration and
where enforcement is evaluated. The table that follows provides the specific
settings at each level.

![A flowchart that shows the evaluation points for the instance metadata version and IMDSv2 enforcement.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/imds-defaults-launch-flow.png)

The table shows how the metadata version for an instance at launch (indicated by
**Resulting instance configuration** in column 4) is
determined by the settings at the different levels of configuration. The order
of precedence is from left to right, where the first column takes the highest
precedence, as follows:

- Column 1: **Launch parameter** –
Represents the setting on the instance that you manually specify at
launch.

- Column 2: **Account level default**
– Represents the setting for the account.

- Column 3: **AMI default** – Represents the
setting on the AMI.

## Use IAM condition keys to restrict instance metadata options

You can use IAM condition keys in an IAM policy or SCP as follows:

- Allow an instance to launch only if it's configured to require the use of
IMDSv2

- Restrict the number of allowed hops

- Turn off access to instance metadata

- [Modify instance metadata options for existing instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-IMDS-existing-instances.html)

###### Note

You should proceed cautiously and conduct careful testing before making any
changes. Take note of the following:

- If you enforce the use of IMDSv2, applications or agents that use
IMDSv1 for instance metadata access will break.

- If you turn off all access to instance metadata, applications or agents
that rely on instance metadata access to function will break.

- For IMDSv2, you must use `/latest/api/token` when
retrieving the token.

- (Windows only) If your PowerShell version is earlier than 4.0, you must
[update to Windows Management Framework 4.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/windows-management-framework-wmf-4-0-update-now-available-for-windows-server-2012-windows-server-2008-r2-sp1-and-windows-7-sp1) to require the use
of IMDSv2.
