# Install NVIDIA public drivers

If the AWS Marketplace AMIs described in [Use AMIs that include NVIDIA drivers](preinstalled-nvidia-driver.md) don't fit your use case, you can
install the public drivers and bring your own license. Installation options include
the following:

- [Option 1: Driver-only install](#public-nvidia-driver-only-install)

- [Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit](#public-nvidia-driver-cuda-install)
(recommended for Linux distributions)

###### P6-B200 and P6-B300 instance type considerations

The P6-B200 and P6-B300 platforms are unique in that they expose Mellanox
ConnectX network interface cards (NICs) to the instance as PCIe devices. These NICs do not
act as typical network interfaces but instead function as NVSwitch bridges providing a
control path to initialize and configure the NVFabric, which is the NVLink topology of the
GPU interconnect.

To fully initialize the system, the NVIDIA Fabric Manager must configure `NVFabric`
and establish the NVSwitch topology. This enables InfiniBand kernel modules to communicate with
the Mellanox ConnectX NICs.

NVIDIA Fabric Manager is included in the CUDA toolkit. We recommend [Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit](#public-nvidia-driver-cuda-install)
for this instance type.

## Option 1: Driver-only install

To install a specific driver, log on to your instance and download the 64-bit NVIDIA public
driver for the instance type from [http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx). For **Product Type**,
**Product Series**, and **Product**, use the options shown
in the following table.

Then follow the **Local Repository Installation** instructions in the
[NVIDIA Driver Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/driver-installation-guide/index.html).

###### Note

P6-B200 and P6-B300 instance types require installation and configuration of
additional packages that come bundled with the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. For more information, see
instructions for your Linux distribution in [Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit](#public-nvidia-driver-cuda-install).

1 The operating system for G5g instances is Linux aarch64.

2 For P6-B200 and P6-B300 instance types, there are additional
installation requirements to configure NVIDIA Fabric Manager.

## Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit

Install instructions vary slightly by operating system. To install public drivers on your
instance with the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, follow the instructions for your instance operating system.
For instance operating systems that aren't shown here, follow the instructions for your operating
system and instance type architecture on the NVIDIA Developer website. For more information, see
[CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

For instance type architecture or other specifications, see the [Accelerated computing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ac.html) specifications in the
_Amazon EC2 Instance Types_ reference.

This section covers an NVIDIA CUDA toolkit install on an Amazon Linux 2023
instance. The command examples in this section are based on an `x86_64`
architecture.

For `arm64-sbsa` commands, see [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_arch=arm64-sbsa&target_os=Linux) and select the options that apply to your
distribution. Instructions appear after you've made your final selection.

###### Prerequisite

Before installing the toolkit and drivers, run the following command to
ensure that you have the correct version of the kernel headers and
development packages.

```sh

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dnf install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r) -y
```

###### Download the toolkit and drivers

Choose the type of installation to use for your instance, and follow the
associated steps.

RPM local installation

You can follow these instructions to download the CUDA toolkit
installer repository bundle to your instance, then extract and register
the specified bundle.

To view instructions on the NVIDIA developer website, see [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?Distribution=Amazon-Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_os=Linux&target_type=rpm_local&target_version=2023).

```sh

[ec2-user ~]$ wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/13.0.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-amzn2023-13-0-local-13.0.0_580.65.06-1.x86_64.rpm
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo rpm -i cuda-repo-amzn2023-13-0-local-13.0.0_580.65.06-1.x86_64.rpm
```

RPM network installation

You can follow these instructions to register the CUDA repository with the
package manager on your instance. When you run the install steps, the package
manager downloads only the packages that are required.

To view instructions on the NVIDIA developer website, see [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?Distribution=Amazon-Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_os=Linux&target_type=rpm_network&target_version=2023).

```

4. Enable Fabric Manager and driver persistence

```sh

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl enable nvidia-fabricmanager
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced
```

5. ( _P6-B200 and P6-B300 only_) These instance types
    require installation and configuration of additional packages that come bundled with
    the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.

1. Install NVIDIA Link Subnet Manager and `ibstat`.

```sh

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dnf install nvlink5
```

2. Enable automatic loading of the Infiniband module on startup.

```sh

[ec2-user ~]$ echo "ib_umad" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
```

6. Reboot the instance

```sh

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo reboot
```

5. ( _P6-B200 and P6-B300 only_) These instance types
    require installation and configuration of additional packages that come bundled with
    the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.

1. Install the latest InfiniBand-specific device driver and diagnostic utilities.

```sh

$ sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r) -y
$ sudo apt install infiniband-diags -y
```

2. Install NVIDIA Link Subnet Manager.

```sh

$ sudo apt install nvlsm -y

6. Reboot the instance

```sh

sudo reboot
```

7. Update your path and add the following environment variable.

```sh

$ export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda-13.0/bin
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda-13.0/lib64
```

To install the NVIDIA driver on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder where you downloaded the driver and launch the
    installation file. Follow the instructions to install the driver and
    reboot your instance as required.

2. Disable the display adapter named **Microsoft Basic Display**
**Adapter** that is marked with a warning icon using Device
    Manager. Install these Windows features: **Media**
**Foundation** and **Quality Windows Audio Video**
**Experience**.

###### Important

Don't disable the display adapter named **Microsoft Remote**
**Display Adapter**. If **Microsoft Remote**
**Display Adapter** is disabled your connection might be
interrupted and attempts to connect to the instance after it has
rebooted might fail.

3. Check Device Manager to verify that the GPU is working
    correctly.

4. To achieve the best performance from your GPU, complete the
    optimization steps in [Optimize GPU settings on Amazon EC2 instances](optimize-gpu.md).
