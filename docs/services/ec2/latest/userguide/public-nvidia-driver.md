# Install NVIDIA public drivers
<a name="public-nvidia-driver"></a>

If the AWS Marketplace AMIs described in [Use AMIs that include NVIDIA drivers](preinstalled-nvidia-driver.md) don't fit your use case, you can install the public drivers and bring your own license. Installation options include the following:
+ [Option 1: Driver-only install](#public-nvidia-driver-only-install)
+ [Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit](#public-nvidia-driver-cuda-install) (recommended for Linux distributions)

 

**P6-B200 and P6-B300 instance type considerations**
The P6-B200 and P6-B300 platforms are unique in that they expose Mellanox ConnectX network interface cards (NICs) to the instance as PCIe devices. These NICs do not act as typical network interfaces but instead function as NVSwitch bridges providing a control path to initialize and configure the NVFabric, which is the NVLink topology of the GPU interconnect.

To fully initialize the system, the NVIDIA Fabric Manager must configure `NVFabric` and establish the NVSwitch topology. This enables InfiniBand kernel modules to communicate with the Mellanox ConnectX NICs.

NVIDIA Fabric Manager is included in the CUDA toolkit. We recommend [Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit](#public-nvidia-driver-cuda-install) for this instance type.

## Option 1: Driver-only install
<a name="public-nvidia-driver-only-install"></a>

To install a specific driver, log on to your instance and download the 64-bit NVIDIA public driver for the instance type from [ http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx). For **Product Type**, **Product Series**, and **Product**, use the options shown in the following table.

Then follow the **Local Repository Installation** instructions in the [ NVIDIA Driver Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/driver-installation-guide/index.html).

**Note**
P6-B200 and P6-B300 instance types require installation and configuration of additional packages that come bundled with the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. For more information, see instructions for your Linux distribution in [Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit](#public-nvidia-driver-cuda-install).

1 The operating system for G5g instances is Linux aarch64.

2 For P6-B200 and P6-B300 instance types, there are additional installation requirements to configure NVIDIA Fabric Manager.

## Option 2: Install with the CUDA toolkit
<a name="public-nvidia-driver-cuda-install"></a>

Install instructions vary slightly by operating system. To install public drivers on your instance with the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit, follow the instructions for your instance operating system. For instance operating systems that aren't shown here, follow the instructions for your operating system and instance type architecture on the NVIDIA Developer website. For more information, see [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

For instance type architecture or other specifications, see the [Accelerated computing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ac.html) specifications in the *Amazon EC2 Instance Types* reference.

### Amazon Linux 2023
<a name="nvidia-public-install-driver-al2023"></a>

This section covers an NVIDIA CUDA toolkit install on an Amazon Linux 2023 instance. The command examples in this section are based on an `x86_64` architecture.

For `arm64-sbsa` commands, see [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=arm64-sbsa) and select the options that apply to your distribution. Instructions appear after you've made your final selection.

**Prerequisite**
Before installing the toolkit and drivers, run the following command to ensure that you have the correct version of the kernel headers and development packages.

```
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dnf install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r) -y
```

**Download the toolkit and drivers**
Choose the type of installation to use for your instance, and follow the associated steps.

#### [ AL2023 NVIDIA repository ]

Amazon Linux 2023 provides NVIDIA GPU drivers and CUDA toolkit packages through a dedicated repository that AWS maintains. AWS qualifies this repository with AL2023 release candidates and provides security advisories through the Amazon Linux Security Center. We recommend this option for AL2023 instances because it simplifies installation and keeps drivers updated through the standard `dnf update` workflow.

For instructions, see [NVIDIA drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2023/ug/nvidia-drivers.html) in the *Amazon Linux 2023 User Guide*.

#### [ RPM local installation ]

You can follow these instructions to download the CUDA toolkit installer repository bundle to your instance, then extract and register the specified bundle.

To view instructions on the NVIDIA developer website, see [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Amazon-Linux&target_version=2023&target_type=rpm_local).

   ```

### Windows operating systems
<a name="nvidia-public-install-driver-windows"></a>

To install the NVIDIA driver on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder where you downloaded the driver and launch the installation file. Follow the instructions to install the driver and reboot your instance as required.

1. Disable the display adapter named **Microsoft Basic Display Adapter** that is marked with a warning icon using Device Manager. Install these Windows features: **Media Foundation** and **Quality Windows Audio Video Experience**.
**Important**
Don't disable the display adapter named **Microsoft Remote Display Adapter**. If **Microsoft Remote Display Adapter** is disabled your connection might be interrupted and attempts to connect to the instance after it has rebooted might fail.

1. Check Device Manager to verify that the GPU is working correctly.

1. To achieve the best performance from your GPU, complete the optimization steps in [Optimize GPU settings on Amazon EC2 instances](optimize_gpu.md).
