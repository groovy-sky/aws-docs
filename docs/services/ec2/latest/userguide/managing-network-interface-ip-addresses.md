# Manage the IP addresses for your network interface

You can manage the following IP addresses for your network interfaces:

- Elastic IP addresses (one per private IPv4 address)

- IPv4 addresses

- IPv6 addresses

Console

###### To manage the IP addresses of a network interface

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**.

3. Select the checkbox for the network interface.

4. To manage the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, do the following:
1. Choose **Actions**, **Manage IP addresses**.

2. Expand the network interface.

3. For **IPv4 addresses**, edit the IP addresses as needed. To assign
       an additional IPv4 address, choose **Assign new IP**
      **address** and then specify an IPv4 address from
       the subnet range or let AWS choose one for you.

4. (Dual stack or IPv6 only) For **IPv6 addresses**, edit the IP
       addresses as needed. To assign an additional IPv6 address,
       choose **Assign new IP address** and then
       specify an IPv6 address from the subnet range or let AWS
       choose one for you.

5. To assign or unassign a public IPv4 address to a network interface, choose
       **Auto-assign public IP**. You can
       enable or disable this for any network interface, but it
       only affects the primary network interface.

6. (Dual stack or IPv6-only) For **Assign primary IPv6**
      **IP**, choose **Enable** to
       assign a primary IPv6 address. The first GUA associated with
       the network interface is chosen as the primary IPv6 address.
       After you assign a primary IPv6 address, you can't change
       it. This address is the primary IPv6 address until the
       instance is terminated or the network interface is
       detached.

7. Choose **Save**.
5. To associate an Elastic IP address, do the following:
1. Choose **Actions**, **Associate address**.

2. For **Elastic IP address**, select the Elastic IP address.

3. For **Private IPv4 address**, select the private IPv4
       address to associate with the Elastic IP address.

4. (Optional) Choose **Allow the Elastic IP address to be reassociated**
       if the network interface is currently associated with another instance or network
       interface.

5. Choose **Associate**.
6. To disassociate an Elastic IP address, do the following:
1. Choose **Actions**, **Disassociate address**.

2. For **Public IP address**, select the Elastic IP address.

3. Choose **Disassociate**.

AWS CLI

###### To manage the IPv4 addresses

Use the following [assign-private-ip-addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/assign-private-ip-addresses.html)
command to assign an IPv4 address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface-id eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --private-ip-addresses 10.0.0.82
```

Use the following [unassign-private-ip-addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/unassign-private-ip-addresses.html)
command to unassign an IPv4 address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 unassign-private-ip-addresses \
    --network-interface-id eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --private-ip-addresses 10.0.0.82
```

###### To manage the IPv6 addresses

Use the following [assign-ipv6-addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/assign-ipv6-addresses.html)
command to assign an IPv6 address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 assign-ipv6-addresses \
    --network-interface-id eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --ipv6-addresses 2001:db8:1234:1a00:9691:9503:25ad:1761
```

Use the following [unassign-ipv6-addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/unassign-ipv6-addresses.html)
command to unassign an IPv6 address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 unassign-ipv6-addresses \
    --network-interface-id eni-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --ipv6-addresses 2001:db8:1234:1a00:9691:9503:25ad:1761
```

###### To manage the Elastic IP address for the primary private IPv4 address

Use the following [associate-address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-address.html)
command to associate an Elastic IP address with the primary private IPv4 address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 associate-address \
    --allocation-id eipalloc-0b263919b6EXAMPLE \
    --network-interface-id eni-1234567890abcdef0

command to disassociate an Elastic IP address from the primary private IPv4 address.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 disassociate-address --association-id eipassoc-2bebb745a1EXAMPLE
