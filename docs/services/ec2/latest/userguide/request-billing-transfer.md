# Assign billing of a shared EC2 Capacity Reservation to another account

To assign billing of the available capacity of a shared Capacity Reservation to another
account, the Capacity Reservation owner must initiate a request to the required account. In the
Amazon EC2 console, this request is called a _transfer_
_request_.

A Capacity Reservation owner can assign billing of the available capacity of Capacity Reservation to an
account only if:

- The Capacity Reservation is already shared with that account.

- The account is consolidated under the same AWS Organizations payer account as
the Capacity Reservation owner.

Billing is assigned to the specified account only once they accept the
request.

When a Capacity Reservation owner initiates a request, an Amazon EventBridge event is sent to the
requested account. For more information, see [Monitor billing assignment requests for shared Capacity Reservations](billing-ownership-events.md).
