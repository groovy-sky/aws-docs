# Assign billing of a shared EC2 Capacity Reservation to another account
<a name="request-billing-transfer"></a>

To assign billing of the available capacity of a shared Capacity Reservation to another account, the Capacity Reservation owner must initiate a request to the required account. In the Amazon EC2 console, this request is called a *transfer request*.

A Capacity Reservation owner can assign billing of the available capacity of Capacity Reservation to an account only if:
+ The Capacity Reservation is already shared with that account.
+ The account is consolidated under the same AWS Organizations payer account as the Capacity Reservation owner.

Billing is assigned to the specified account only once they accept the request.

When a Capacity Reservation owner initiates a request, an Amazon EventBridge event is sent to the requested account. For more information, see [Monitor billing assignment requests for shared Capacity Reservations](billing-ownership-events.md).
