# Install NVIDIA GRID drivers (G7e, G6, Gr6, G6e, G6f, Gr6f, G5, G4dn, and G3 instances)
<a name="nvidia-GRID-driver"></a>

These downloads are available to AWS customers only. By downloading, in order to adhere to requirements of the AWS solution referred to in the NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement (EULA), you agree to use the downloaded software only to develop AMIs for use with the NVIDIA L4, NVIDIA L40S, NVIDIA A10G, NVIDIA Tesla T4, or NVIDIA Tesla M60 hardware. You can use the GRID drivers to both create and use AMIs within the AWS environment. Upon installation of the software, you are bound by the terms of the [NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement](https://aws-nvidia-license-agreement.s3.amazonaws.com/NvidiaGridAWSUserLicenseAgreement.DOCX). For information about the version of the NVIDIA GRID driver for your operating system, see the [NVIDIA Virtual GPU (vGPU) Software](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/) on the NVIDIA website.

**Considerations**
+ G7e instances require GRID 19.1 or later for Linux and 19.4 (582.16) or later for Windows.
+ G6f and Gr6f instances require GRID 18.4 to GRID 19.5.
+ G6e instances require GRID 17.4 or later.
+ G6 and Gr6 instances require GRID 17.1 or later.
+ G5 instances require GRID 13.1 or later (or GRID 12.4 or later).
+ G3 instances require AWS provided DNS resolution for GRID licensing to work.
+ [IMDSv2](configuring-instance-metadata-service.md) is only supported with NVIDIA driver version 14.0 or greater.
+ For Windows instances, if you launch your instance from a custom Windows AMI, the AMI must be a standardized image created with Windows Sysprep to ensure that the GRID driver works. For more information, see [Create an Amazon EC2 AMI using Windows Sysprep](ami-create-win-sysprep.md).
+ GRID 17.0 and later do not support Windows Server 2019.
+ GRID 14.2 and later do not support Windows Server 2016.
+ GRID 17.0 and later is not supported with G3 instances.
+ For Linux instances, you might need to install or update packages, such as gcc, if the NVIDIA installer fails with an error message. The specifics depend on the versions of the operating system and the kernel. For more information, see the NVIDIA Enterprise Support Portal.

**Prerequisites**
+ (Linux) Verify that the AWS CLI is installed on your instance and configured with default credentials. For more information, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*.
+ (Windows) Configure default credentials for the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell on your instance. For more information, see [Getting started with the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-started.html) in the *AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide*.
+ Your user or role must have the permissions granted that contains the **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy.

## Windows operating systems
<a name="nvidia-grid-windows"></a>

**To install the NVIDIA GRID driver on your Windows instance**

1. Connect to your Windows instance and open a PowerShell window.

1. Download the drivers and the [NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement](https://aws-nvidia-license-agreement.s3.amazonaws.com/NvidiaGridAWSUserLicenseAgreement.DOCX) from Amazon S3 to your desktop using the following PowerShell commands.

   ```
   $Bucket = "ec2-windows-nvidia-drivers"
   $KeyPrefix = "latest"
   $LocalPath = "$home\Desktop\NVIDIA"
   $Objects = Get-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -KeyPrefix $KeyPrefix -Region us-east-1
   foreach ($Object in $Objects) {
   $LocalFileName = $Object.Key
   if ($LocalFileName -ne '' -and $Object.Size -ne 0) {
   $LocalFilePath = Join-Path $LocalPath $LocalFileName
   Copy-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -Key $Object.Key -LocalFile $LocalFilePath -Region us-east-1
   }
   }
   ```

   Multiple versions of the NVIDIA GRID driver are stored in this bucket. You can download all of the available Windows versions in the bucket by removing the `-KeyPrefix $KeyPrefix` option. For information about the version of the NVIDIA GRID driver for your operating system, see the [NVIDIA Virtual GPU (vGPU) Software](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/) on the NVIDIA website.

   Starting with GRID version 11.0, you can use the drivers under `latest` for both G3 and G4dn instances. We will not add versions later than 11.0 to `g4/latest`, but will keep version 11.0 and the earlier versions specific to G4dn under `g4/latest`.

   G5 instances require GRID 13.1 or later (or GRID 12.4 or later).

1. Navigate to the desktop and double-click the installation file to launch it (choose the driver version that corresponds to your instance OS version). Follow the instructions to install the driver and reboot your instance as required. To verify that the GPU is working properly, check Device Manager.

1. (Optional) Use the following command to disable the licensing page in the control panel to prevent users from accidentally changing the product type (NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation is enabled by default). For more information, see the [GRID Licensing User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/4.6/grid-licensing-user-guide/index.html).

**PowerShell**
Run the following PowerShell commands to create the registry value to disable the licensing page in the control panel. The AWS Tools for PowerShell in AWS Windows AMIs defaults to the 32-bit version and this command fails. Instead, use the 64-bit version of PowerShell included with the operating system.

   ```
   New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global" -Name GridLicensing
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\GridLicensing" -Name "NvCplDisableManageLicensePage" -PropertyType "DWord" -Value "1"
   ```

**Command Prompt**
Run the following registry command to create the registry value to disable the licensing page in the control panel. You can run it using the Command Prompt window or a 64-bit version of PowerShell.

   ```
   reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\GridLicensing" /v NvCplDisableManageLicensePage /t REG_DWORD /d 1
