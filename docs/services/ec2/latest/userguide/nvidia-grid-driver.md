# Install NVIDIA GRID drivers (G7e, G6, Gr6, G6e, G6f, Gr6f, G5, G4dn, and G3 instances)

These downloads are available to AWS customers only. By downloading, in order to adhere
to requirements of the AWS solution referred to in the NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User
License Agreement (EULA), you agree to use the downloaded software only to develop
AMIs for use with the NVIDIA L4, NVIDIA L40S, NVIDIA A10G, NVIDIA Tesla T4, or
NVIDIA Tesla M60 hardware. You can use the GRID drivers to both create and use
AMIs within the AWS environment. Upon installation of the software, you are
bound by the terms of the [NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement](https://aws-nvidia-license-agreement.s3.amazonaws.com/NvidiaGridAWSUserLicenseAgreement.DOCX). For information about the
version of the NVIDIA GRID driver for your operating system, see the [NVIDIA Virtual GPU (vGPU) Software](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu)
on the NVIDIA website.

###### Considerations

- G7e instances require GRID 19.1 or later for Linux and 19.3 (581.192) or later for Windows.

- G6f and Gr6f instances require GRID 18.4 or later.

- G6e instances require GRID 17.4 or later.

- G6 and Gr6 instances require GRID 17.1 or later.

- G5 instances require GRID 13.1 or later (or GRID 12.4 or
later).

- G3 instances require AWS provided DNS resolution for GRID licensing
to work.

- [IMDSv2](configuring-instance-metadata-service.md) is
only supported with NVIDIA driver version 14.0 or greater.

- For Windows instances, if you launch your instance from a custom Windows AMI,
the AMI must be a standardized image created with
Windows Sysprep to ensure that the GRID driver works. For more
information, see [Create an Amazon EC2 AMI using Windows Sysprep](ami-create-win-sysprep.md).

- GRID 17.0 and later do not support Windows Server 2019.

- GRID 14.2 and later do not support Windows Server 2016.

- GRID 17.0 and later is not supported with G3 instances.

- For Linux instances, you might need to install or update packages,
such as gcc, if the NVIDIA installer fails with an error message. The
specifics depend on the versions of the operating system and the kernel.
For more information, see the NVIDIA Enterprise Support Portal.

###### Prerequisites

- (Linux) Verify that the AWS CLI is installed on your instance and configured
with default credentials. For more information, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

- (Windows) Configure default credentials for the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell on your instance.
For more information, see [Getting started with\
the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-started.html) in the _AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide_.

- Your user or role must have the permissions granted that contains the
**AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy.

###### To install the NVIDIA GRID driver on your instance

    ```

13. Reboot the instance.

    ```nohighlight

    $ sudo reboot
    ```

14. (Optional) Depending on your use case, you might complete the
     following optional steps. If you do not require this
     functionality, do not complete these steps.
    1. To help take advantage of the four displays of up to
        4K resolution, set up the high-performance display
        protocol [Amazon DCV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv).

    2. NVIDIA Quadro Virtual Workstation mode is enabled by
        default. To activate GRID Virtual Applications for RDSH
        Application hosting capabilities, complete the GRID
        Virtual Application activation steps in [Activate NVIDIA GRID Virtual Applications on your Amazon EC2 GPU-based instances](activate-grid.md).

    3. Install the GUI desktop/workstation package.

       ```nohighlight

       $ sudo apt-get install -y lightdm ubuntu-desktop
       ```

###### To install the NVIDIA GRID driver on your Windows instance

1. Connect to your Windows instance and open a PowerShell window.

2. Download the drivers and the [NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement](https://aws-nvidia-license-agreement.s3.amazonaws.com/NvidiaGridAWSUserLicenseAgreement.DOCX) from Amazon S3 to
    your desktop using the following PowerShell commands.

```powershell

$Bucket = "ec2-windows-nvidia-drivers"
$KeyPrefix = "latest"
$LocalPath = "$home\Desktop\NVIDIA"
$Objects = Get-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -KeyPrefix $KeyPrefix -Region us-east-1
foreach ($Object in $Objects) {
$LocalFileName = $Object.Key
if ($LocalFileName -ne '' -and $Object.Size -ne 0) {
$LocalFilePath = Join-Path $LocalPath $LocalFileName
Copy-S3Object -BucketName $Bucket -Key $Object.Key -LocalFile $LocalFilePath -Region us-east-1
}
}
```

Multiple versions of the NVIDIA GRID driver are stored in this bucket.
    You can download all of the available Windows versions in the bucket by
    removing the `-KeyPrefix $KeyPrefix` option. For information
    about the version of the NVIDIA GRID driver for your operating system,
    see the [NVIDIA Virtual GPU\
    (vGPU) Software](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu) on the NVIDIA website.

Starting with GRID version 11.0, you can use the drivers under
    `latest` for both G3 and G4dn instances. We will
    not add versions later than 11.0 to `g4/latest`, but
    will keep version 11.0 and the earlier versions specific to G4dn under
    `g4/latest`.

G5 instances require GRID 13.1 or later (or GRID 12.4 or
    later).

3. Navigate to the desktop and double-click the installation file to
    launch it (choose the driver version that corresponds to your instance
    OS version). Follow the instructions to install the driver and reboot
    your instance as required. To verify that the GPU is working properly,
    check Device Manager.

4. (Optional) Use the following command to disable the licensing page in
    the control panel to prevent users from accidentally changing the
    product type (NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation is enabled by default).
    For more information, see the [GRID Licensing User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/4.6/grid-licensing-user-guide/index.html).

###### PowerShell

Run the following PowerShell commands to create the registry value
    to disable the licensing page in the control panel. The AWS Tools for PowerShell
    in AWS Windows AMIs defaults to the 32-bit version and this
    command fails. Instead, use the 64-bit version of PowerShell
    included with the operating system.

```nohighlight

New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global" -Name GridLicensing
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\GridLicensing" -Name "NvCplDisableManageLicensePage" -PropertyType "DWord" -Value "1"
```

###### Command Prompt

Run the following registry command to create the registry value to
    disable the licensing page in the control panel. You can run it
    using the Command Prompt window or a 64-bit version of
    PowerShell.

```nohighlight

reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\GridLicensing" /v NvCplDisableManageLicensePage /t REG_DWORD /d 1
```

5. (Optional) Depending on your use case, you might complete the
    following optional steps. If you do not require this functionality, do
    not complete these steps.
1. To help take advantage of the four displays of up to 4K
       resolution, set up the high-performance display protocol, [Amazon DCV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv).

2. NVIDIA Quadro Virtual Workstation mode is enabled by default.
       To activate GRID Virtual Applications for RDSH Application
       hosting capabilities, complete the GRID Virtual Application
       activation steps in [Activate NVIDIA GRID Virtual Applications on your Amazon EC2 GPU-based instances](activate-grid.md).
