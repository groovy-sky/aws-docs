# Create a resource group for UltraServer Capacity Blocks

You can use AWS Resource Groups to create logical collections of UltraServer Capacity Blocks. After you create
the resource group, you can add UltraServer Capacity Blocks that you own in your account. After you add
the UltraServer Capacity Blocks, you can target instances launches to the resource group instead of the
individual Capacity Blocks. Instances that target a resource group match with any UltraServer Capacity Blocks
in the group that has matching attributes and available capacity. If the resource group does
not have an UltraServer Capacity Block with matching attributes and available capacity, the instance
launch fails.

If an UltraServer Capacity Block is removed from a resource group while it has running instances, those
instances continue to run in the Capacity Block. If an UltraServer Capacity Block in a group ends while it has
running instances, the instances are terminated.

You can't add instance Capacity Blocks to a resource group.

To create a resource group for UltraServer Capacity Blocks, use one of the following methods.

AWS CLI

###### To create a resource group for UltraServer Capacity Blocks

Use the [create-group](../../../cli/latest/reference/resource-groups/create-group.md)
AWS CLI command, and for `--configuration`, specify the following:

```json

{
  "Configuration": [
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "instance-type",
          "Values": [
            "instance_type"
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "reservation-type",
          "Values": [
            "capacity-block"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
          "Values": [
            "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservation"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

PowerShell

###### To create a resource group for UltraServer Capacity Blocks

Use the [New-RGGroup](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-rggroup.md) cmdlet. For `-Configuration`, specify the following:

```json

{
  "Configuration": [
    {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "instance-type",
          "Values": [
            "instance_type"
          ]
        },
        {
          "Name": "reservation-type",
          "Values": [
            "capacity-block"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
      "Parameters": [
        {
          "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
          "Values": [
            "AWS::EC2::CapacityReservation"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

After you create a resource group for UltraServer Capacity Block, use one of the following methods to add
existing UltraServer Capacity Blocks to it.

AWS CLI

###### To add an UltraServer Capacity Block to a resource group

Use the [group-resources](../../../cli/latest/reference/resource-groups/group-resources.md) command. For `--group` specify the name of
the resource group you created. For `--resource-arns`, specify the
ARNs of the UltraServer Capacity Blocks to add.

```nohighlight

aws resource-groups group-resources \
--group MyCRGroup \
--resource-arns CapacityReservationArn
```

PowerShell

###### To add an UltraServer Capacity Block to a resource group

Use the [Add-RGResource](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/add-rgresource.md)
cmdlet. For `-Group` specify the name of the resource group you created.
For `-ResourceArn `, specify the ARNs of the UltraServer Capacity Blocks to add.

The following example adds two Capacity Reservations to the specified group.

```powershell

Add-RGResource `
-Group MyCRGroup `
-ResourceArn CapacityReservationArn
```
