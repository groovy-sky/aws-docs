# Service-linked role for Spot Instance requests

Amazon EC2 uses service-linked roles for the permissions that it requires to call other
AWS services on your behalf. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role
that is linked directly to an AWS service. Service-linked roles provide a secure
way to delegate permissions to AWS services because only the linked service can
assume a service-linked role. For more information, see [Service-linked\
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

Amazon EC2 uses the service-linked role named
**AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** to launch and manage Spot Instances on your
behalf.

## Permissions granted by AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot

Amazon EC2 uses **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** to complete the
following actions:

- `ec2:DescribeInstances` – Describe Spot Instances

- `ec2:StopInstances` – Stop Spot Instances

- `ec2:StartInstances` – Start Spot Instances

## Create the service-linked role

Under most circumstances, you don't need to manually create a service-linked
role. Amazon EC2 creates the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot**
service-linked role the first time you request a Spot Instance using the console.

If you had an active Spot Instance request before October 2017, when Amazon EC2 began
supporting this service-linked role, Amazon EC2 created the
**AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** role in your AWS account. For
more information, see [A New Role Appeared in My Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_roles.html#troubleshoot_roles_new-role-appeared) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

If you use the AWS CLI or an API to request a Spot Instance, you must first ensure that
this role exists.

###### To create **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** using the console

1. Open the IAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

3. Choose **Create role**.

4. On the **Select type of trusted entity** page, choose
    **EC2**, **EC2 - Spot Instances**,
    **Next: Permissions**.

5. On the next page, choose **Next:Review**.

6. On the **Review** page, choose **Create**
**role**.

###### To create **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** using the AWS CLI

Use the [create-service-linked-role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-service-linked-role.html) command as follows.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name spot.amazonaws.com
```

If you no longer need to use Spot Instances, we recommend that you delete the
**AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** role. After this role is
deleted from your account, Amazon EC2 will create the role again if you request
Spot Instances.

## Grant access to customer managed keys for use with encrypted AMIs and EBS snapshots

If you specify an [encrypted AMI](amiencryption.md) or an
encrypted Amazon EBS snapshot for your Spot Instances and you use a customer managed key for encryption, you
must grant the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** role permission to
use the customer managed key so that Amazon EC2 can launch Spot Instances on your behalf. To do this, you must
add a grant to the customer managed key, as shown in the following procedure.

When providing permissions, grants are an alternative to key policies. For
more information, see [Using Grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html)
and [Using Key Policies in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html)
in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### To grant the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** role permissions to use the customer managed key

- Use the [create-grant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kms/create-grant.html) command to add a grant to the customer managed key and to
specify the principal (the **AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot**
service-linked role) that is given permission to perform the operations
that the grant permits. The customer managed key is specified by the `key-id`
parameter and the ARN of the customer managed key. The principal is specified by the
`grantee-principal` parameter and the ARN of the
**AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** service-linked
role.

```nohighlight

aws kms create-grant \
      --region us-east-1 \
      --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:444455556666:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
      --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/aws-service-role/spot.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot \
      --operations "Decrypt" "Encrypt" "GenerateDataKey" "GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext" "CreateGrant" "DescribeKey" "ReEncryptFrom" "ReEncryptTo"
```
