###### To download and install the latest version of EC2Launch

    backup of the EC2Launch configuration file. The installation process does not
    preserve changes in this file. By default, the file is located in the
    `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Config`
    directory.

2. Download [EC2-Windows-Launch.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/EC2Launch/latest/EC2-Windows-Launch.zip) to a directory on the instance.

3. Download [install.ps1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/EC2Launch/latest/install.ps1) to the same directory where you downloaded
    `EC2-Windows-Launch.zip`.

4. Run `install.ps1`

5. If you made a backup of the EC2Launch configuration file, copy it to the
    `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Config`
    directory.

###### Note

If you receive an error when downloading the file, and you
are using Windows Server 2016, TLS 1.2 might need
to be enabled for your PowerShell terminal. You can enable
TLS 1.2 for the current PowerShell session with the
following command and then try again:

```powershell

[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

Verify the installation by checking the launch agent. Run the following commands from
a PowerShell window as an administrator:

```powershell

Import-Module C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Module\Ec2Launch.psm1
Import-LocalizedData -BaseDirectory C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Module\ -FileName 'Ec2Launch.psd1' -BindingVariable moduleManifest
$moduleManifest.Get_Item('ModuleVersion')
```
