**To download and install the latest version of EC2Launch**

1. If you have already installed and configured EC2Launch on an instance, make a backup of the EC2Launch configuration file. The installation process does not preserve changes in this file. By default, the file is located in the `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Config` directory.

1. Download [EC2-Windows-Launch.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/EC2Launch/latest/EC2-Windows-Launch.zip) to a directory on the instance.

1. Download [install.ps1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/EC2Launch/latest/install.ps1) to the same directory where you downloaded `EC2-Windows-Launch.zip`.

1. Run `install.ps1`

1. If you made a backup of the EC2Launch configuration file, copy it to the `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Config` directory.

**Note**
If you receive an error when downloading the file, and you are using Windows Server 2016, TLS 1.2 might need to be enabled for your PowerShell terminal. You can enable TLS 1.2 for the current PowerShell session with the following command and then try again:

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

Verify the installation by checking the launch agent. Run the following commands from a PowerShell window as an administrator:

```
Import-Module C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Module\Ec2Launch.psm1
Import-LocalizedData -BaseDirectory C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Module\ -FileName 'Ec2Launch.psd1' -BindingVariable moduleManifest
$moduleManifest.Get_Item('ModuleVersion')
