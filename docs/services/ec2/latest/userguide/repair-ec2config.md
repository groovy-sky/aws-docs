# Troubleshoot issues with the EC2Config launch agent

The following information can help you troubleshoot issues with the EC2Config
service.

## Update EC2Config on an unreachable instance

Use the following procedure to update the EC2Config service on a Windows Server
instance that is inaccessible using Remote Desktop.

###### To update EC2Config on an Amazon EBS-backed Windows instance that you can't connect to

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

03. Locate the affected instance. Select the instance and choose **Instance**
    **state**, and then choose **Stop**
    **instance**.

    ###### Warning

    When you stop an instance, the data on instance store volumes is lost.
    To preserve this data, back it up to persistent storage.

04. Choose **Launch instances** and create a temporary `t2.micro`
     instance in the same Availability Zone as the affected instance. Use a
     different AMI than the one that you used to launch the affected
     instance.

    ###### Important

    If you do not create the instance in the same Availability Zone as the
    affected instance you will not be able to attach the root volume of the
    affected instance to the new instance.

05. In the EC2 console, choose **Volumes**.

06. Locate the root volume of the affected instance. Detach the volume
     and then attach the volume to the temporary instance
     that you created earlier. Attach it with the default device name (xvdf).

07. Use Remote Desktop to connect to the temporary instance, and then use the
     Disk Management utility to make the volume available for use.

08. [Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/EC2Config/EC2Install.zip)
     the latest version of the EC2Config service. Extract the files from the `.zip`
     file to the `Temp` directory on the drive you attached.

09. On the temporary instance, open the Run dialog box, type
     `regedit`, and press Enter.

10. Choose `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`. From the **File**
     menu, choose **Load Hive**. Choose the drive and then
     navigate to and open the following file:
     `Windows\System32\config\SOFTWARE`. When prompted,
     specify a key name.

11. Select the key you just loaded and navigate to
     `Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion`. Choose the
     `RunOnce` key. If this key doesn't exist, choose
     `CurrentVersion` from the context (right-click) menu, choose
     **New** and then choose **Key**. Name
     the key `RunOnce`.

12. From the context (right-click) menu choose the `RunOnce` key,
     choose **New** and then choose **String**
    **Value**. Enter `Ec2Install` as the name and
     `C:\Temp\Ec2Install.exe /quiet` as the data.

13. Choose the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\specified key
    								name\Microsoft\Windows
    							NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` key. From the context (right-click)
     menu choose **New**, and then choose **String**
    **Value**. Enter `AutoAdminLogon` as the
     name and `1` as the value data.

14. Choose the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\specified key
    								name\Microsoft\Windows
    							NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon>` key. From the context (right-click)
     menu choose **New**, and then choose **String**
    **Value**. Enter `DefaultUserName` as the
     name and `Administrator` as the value data.

15. Choose the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\specified key
    								name\Microsoft\Windows
    							NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` key. From the context (right-click)
     menu choose **New**, and then choose **String**
    **Value**. Type `DefaultPassword` as the
     name and enter a password in the value data.

16. In the Registry Editor navigation pane, choose the temporary key that you
     created when you first opened Registry Editor.

17. From the **File** menu, choose **Unload**
    **Hive**.

18. In Disk Management Utility, choose the drive you attached earlier,
     open the context (right-click) menu, and choose
     **Offline**.

19. In the Amazon EC2 console, detach the affected volume from the temporary
     instance and reattach it to your instance with the device name `/dev/sda1`.
     You must specify this device name to designate the volume as a root
     volume.

20. [Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances](stop-start.md) the instance.

21. After the instance starts, check the system log and verify that you see
     the message **`Windows is ready to use`**.

22. Open Registry Editor and choose
     `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
    							NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`. Delete the String Value keys you
     created earlier: **AutoAdminLogon**,
     **DefaultUserName**, and
     **DefaultPassword**.

23. Delete or stop the temporary instance you created in this
     procedure.
