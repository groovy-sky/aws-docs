# Using service-linked roles for EC2 Capacity Manager
<a name="using-service-linked-roles-cm"></a>

EC2 Capacity Manager uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role). A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Capacity Manager. Service-linked roles are predefined by Capacity Manager and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.

A service-linked role makes setting up Capacity Manager easier because you don't have to manually add the necessary permissions. Capacity Manager defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Capacity Manager can assume its roles. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity.

You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting their related resources. This protects your Capacity Manager resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources.

For information about other services that support service-linked roles, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) and look for the services that have **Yes** in the **Service-linked roles** column. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.

## Service-linked role permissions for Capacity Manager
<a name="slr-permissions"></a>

Capacity Manager uses the service-linked role named **AWSServiceRoleForEC2CapacityManager** to allow you to manage capacity resources and integrate with AWS Organizations on your behalf.

The AWSServiceRoleForEC2CapacityManager service-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
+ `ec2.capacitymanager.amazonaws.com`

The role permissions policy named AWSEC2CapacityManagerServiceRolePolicy allows Capacity Manager to complete the following actions:
+  `organizations:DescribeOrganization`
+  `organizations:ListAccounts`
+  `organizations:ListChildren`
+  `organizations:ListAWSServiceAccessForOrganization`
+  `organizations:ListDelegatedAdministrators`

You must configure permissions to allow your users, groups, or roles to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more information, see [Service-linked role permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Creating a service-linked role for Capacity Manager
<a name="create-slr"></a>

You can use the IAM console to create a service-linked role with the **AWSEC2CapacityManagerServiceRolePolicy** use case. In the AWS CLI or the AWS API, create a service-linked role with the `ec2.capacitymanager.amazonaws.com` service name. For more information, see [Creating a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#create-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*. If you delete this service-linked role, you can use this same process to create the role again.

## Editing a service-linked role for Capacity Manager
<a name="edit-slr"></a>

Capacity Manager does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForEC2CapacityManager service-linked role. After you create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM. For more information, see [Editing a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## Deleting a service-linked role for Capacity Manager
<a name="delete-slr"></a>

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way you don't have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained. However, you must clean up the resources for your service-linked role before you can manually delete it.

**Note**
If the Capacity Manager service is using the role when you try to delete the resources, then the deletion might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes and try the operation again.

**To remove Capacity Manager resources used by the AWSServiceRoleForEC2CapacityManager**

1. All delegated administrators must have disabled their Capacity Manager before removing organizations access.

1. You must delete any active data exports before disabling a capacity manager.

**To manually delete the service-linked role using IAM**

Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForEC2CapacityManager service-linked role. For more information, see [Deleting a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*.
