## Upgrade Windows Server instances (AWS PV upgrade) with Distributor

You can use Distributor, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to install or upgrade the
AWS PV driver package. The installation or upgrade can be performed one time, or
you can install or update it on a schedule. The `In-place update` option
for **Installation Type** isn't supported for this Distributor
package.

###### Important

If your instance is a domain controller, see [Upgrade a domain controller (AWS PV upgrade)](#aws-pv-upgrade-dc). The upgrade process for domain
controller instances is different than standard editions of Windows.

01. We recommend that you create a backup in case you need to roll back your
     changes.

    ###### Tip

    Instead of creating the AMI from the Amazon EC2 console, you can use Systems Manager
    Automation to create the AMI using the `AWS-CreateImage`
    runbook. For more information, see [AWS-CreateImage](../../../systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-aws-createimage.md) in the
    _AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook reference User_
    _Guide_.

    1. When you stop an instance, the data on any instance store volumes
        is erased. Before you stop an instance, verify that you've copied
        any data that you need from your instance store volumes to
        persistent storage, such as Amazon EBS or Amazon S3.

    2. In the navigation pane, choose
        **Instances**.

    3. Select the instance that requires the driver upgrade, and choose
        **Instance state**, **Stop**
       **instance**.

    4. After the instance is stopped, select the instance, choose
        **Actions**, then **Image and**
       **templates**, and then choose **Create**
       **image**.

    5. Choose **Instance state**, **Start**
       **instance**.
02. Connect to the instance using Remote Desktop. For more information, see
     [Connect to your Windows instance using an RDP client](connect-rdp.md).

03. We recommend that you take all non-system disks offline and note any drive
     letter mappings to the secondary disks in Disk Management before you perform
     this upgrade. This step is not required if you are performing an in-place
     update of AWS PV drivers. We also recommend setting non-essential services
     to **Manual** start-up in the Services console.

04. For the instructions for how to install or upgrade the AWS PV driver
     package using Distributor, see the procedures in [Install or update packages](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/distributor-working-with-packages-deploy.md) in the _AWS Systems Manager User_
    _Guide_.

05. For **Name**, choose
     **AWSPVDriver**.

06. For **Installation type**, select **Uninstall and**
    **reinstall**.

07. Configure the other parameters for the package as necessary and run
     installation or upgrade using the referenced procedure in [Step 4](#distributor-procedure-awspv).

    After running the Distributor package, the instance automatically reboots
     and then upgrades the driver. The instance will not be available for up to
     15 minutes.

08. After the upgrade is complete, and the instance passes both health checks
     in the Amazon EC2 console, verify that the new driver was installed by connecting
     to the instance using Remote Desktop.

09. After you are connected, run the following PowerShell command:

    ```powershell

    Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Amazon\PVDriver
    ```

10. Verify that the driver version is the same as the latest version listed in
     the Driver Version History table. For more information, see [AWS PV driver package history](xen-drivers-overview.md#pv-driver-history) Open
     Disk Management to review any offline secondary volumes and bring them
     online corresponding to the drive letters noted in [Step 3](#secondary-disks-step-distributor).

If you previously disabled [TCP offloading](pvdrivers-troubleshooting.md#citrix-tcp-offloading) using Netsh for Citrix PV drivers we
recommend that you re-enable this feature after upgrading to AWS PV drivers. TCP
Offloading issues with Citrix drivers are not present in the AWS PV drivers. As a
result, TCP Offloading provides better performance with AWS PV drivers.

If you previously applied a static IP address or DNS configuration to the network
interface, you might need to reapply the static IP address or DNS configuration
after upgrading AWS PV drivers.

## Upgrade Windows Server instances (AWS PV upgrade) manually

Use the following procedure to perform an in-place upgrade of AWS PV drivers, or
to upgrade from Citrix PV drivers to AWS PV drivers on Windows Server 2008 R2,
Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server
2019, or Windows Server 2022. This upgrade is not available for Red Hat drivers, or
for other versions of Windows Server.

Some older versions of Windows Server can't use the latest drivers. To verify
which driver version to use for your operating system, see the driver version table
in the [Paravirtual drivers for Windows instances](xen-drivers-overview.md)
page.

###### Important

If your instance is a domain controller, see [Upgrade a domain controller (AWS PV upgrade)](#aws-pv-upgrade-dc). The upgrade process for domain
controller instances is different than standard editions of Windows.

       **Actions**, then **Image and**
      **templates**, and then choose **Create**
      **image**.

5. Choose **Instance state**, **Start**
      **instance**.
2. Connect to the instance using Remote Desktop.

3. We recommend that you take all non-system disks offline and note any drive
    letter mappings to the secondary disks in Disk Management before you perform
    this upgrade. This step is not required if you are performing an in-place
    update of AWS PV drivers. We also recommend setting non-essential services
    to **Manual** start-up in the Services console.

4. Download the drivers to your instance using one of the following
    options:
   - Browser – [Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/AWSPV/Latest/AWSPVDriver.zip)

      the latest driver package to the instance and
      extract the zip archive.

   - PowerShell – Run the
      following commands:

     ```powershell

     Invoke-WebRequest https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/AWSPV/Latest/AWSPVDriver.zip -outfile $env:USERPROFILE\pv_driver.zip
     Expand-Archive $env:userprofile\pv_driver.zip -DestinationPath $env:userprofile\pv_drivers
     ```

     If you receive an error when downloading the file, and you
      are using Windows Server 2016 or earlier, TLS 1.2 might need
      to be enabled for your PowerShell terminal. You can enable
      TLS 1.2 for the current PowerShell session with the
      following command and then try again:

     ```powershell

     [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
     ```
5. Run `AWSPVDriverSetup.msi`.

After running the MSI, the instance automatically reboots and then upgrades the
driver. The instance will not be available for up to 15 minutes. After the upgrade
is complete and the instance passes both health checks in the Amazon EC2 console, you can
verify that the new driver was installed by connecting to the instance using Remote
Desktop and then running the following PowerShell command:

```powershell

Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Amazon\PVDriver
```

Verify that the driver version is the same as the latest version listed in the
Driver Version History table. For more information, see [AWS PV driver package history](xen-drivers-overview.md#pv-driver-history) Open Disk
Management to review any offline secondary volumes and bring them online
corresponding to the drive letters noted in [Step 3](#secondary-disks-step-manual).

If you previously disabled [TCP offloading](pvdrivers-troubleshooting.md#citrix-tcp-offloading) using Netsh for Citrix PV drivers we
recommend that you re-enable this feature after upgrading to AWS PV drivers. TCP
Offloading issues with Citrix drivers are not present in the AWS PV drivers. As a
result, TCP Offloading provides better performance with AWS PV drivers.

If you previously applied a static IP address or DNS configuration to the network
interface, you might need to reapply the static IP address or DNS configuration
after upgrading AWS PV drivers.

## Upgrade a domain controller (AWS PV upgrade)

Use the following procedure on a domain controller to perform either an in-place
upgrade of AWS PV drivers, or to upgrade from Citrix PV drivers to AWS PV
drivers. To ensure that your FSMO roles remain operational during the upgrade, we
recommend that you transfer those roles to other domain controllers before you start
the upgrade. For more information, see [How to view and transfer FSMO roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/view-transfer-fsmo-roles) on the _Microsoft_
_Learn_ website.

###### To upgrade a domain controller

01. We recommend that you create a backup of your domain controller in case
     you need to roll back your changes. Using an AMI as a backup is not
     supported. For more information, see [Backup and restore considerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/virtualized-domain-controllers-hyper-v) in the Microsoft
     documentation.

02. Run the following command to configure Windows to boot into Directory
     Services Restore Mode (DSRM).

    ###### Warning

    Before running this command, confirm that you know the DSRM password.
    You'll need this information so that you can log in to your instance
    after the upgrade is complete and the instance automatically
    reboots.

    ```nohighlight

    bcdedit /set {default} safeboot dsrepair
    ```

    PowerShell:

    ```powershell

    PS C:\> bcdedit /set "{default}" safeboot dsrepair
    ```

    The system must boot into DSRM because the upgrade utility removes Citrix
     PV storage drivers so it can install AWS PV drivers. Therefore we
     recommend noting any drive letter and folder mappings to the secondary disks
     in Disk Management. When Citrix PV storage drivers are not present,
     secondary drives are not detected. Domain controllers that use an NTDS
     folder on secondary drives will not boot because the secondary disk is not
     detected.

    ###### Warning

    After you run this command do not manually reboot the system. The
    system will be unreachable because Citrix PV drivers do not support
    DSRM.

03. Run the following command to add `DisableDCCheck` to
     the registry:

    ```nohighlight

    reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Amazon\AWSPVDriverSetup /v DisableDCCheck /t REG_SZ /d true
    ```

04. [Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/AWSPV/Latest/AWSPVDriver.zip)

     the latest driver package to the instance and extract
     the zip archive.

05. Run `AWSPVDriverSetup.msi`.

    After running the MSI, the instance automatically reboots and then
     upgrades the driver. The instance will not be available for up to 15
     minutes.

06. After the upgrade is complete and the instance passes both health checks
     in the Amazon EC2 console, connect to the instance using Remote Desktop. Open
     Disk Management to review any offline secondary volumes and bring them
     online corresponding to the drive letters and folder mappings noted
     earlier.

    You must connect to the instance by specifying the username in the
     following format _hostname_\\administrator. For example,
     Win2k12TestBox\\administrator.

07. Run the following command to remove the DSRM boot configuration:

    ```nohighlight

    bcdedit /deletevalue safeboot
    ```

08. Reboot the instance.

09. To complete the upgrade process, verify that the new driver was installed.
     In Device Manager, under **Storage Controllers**, locate
     **AWS PV Storage Host Adapter**. Verify that the
     driver version is the same as the latest version listed in the Driver
     Version History table. For more information, see [AWS PV driver package history](xen-drivers-overview.md#pv-driver-history).

10. Run the following command to delete `DisableDCCheck`
     from the registry:

    ```nohighlight

    reg delete HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Amazon\AWSPVDriverSetup /v DisableDCCheck
    ```

###### Note

If you previously disabled [TCP offloading](pvdrivers-troubleshooting.md#citrix-tcp-offloading) using Netsh for Citrix PV drivers we
recommend that you re-enable this feature after upgrading to AWS PV Drivers.
TCP Offloading issues with Citrix drivers are not present in the AWS PV
drivers. As a result, TCP Offloading provides better performance with AWS PV
drivers.

## Upgrade Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 instances (Red Hat to Citrix PV upgrade)

Before you start upgrading your Red Hat drivers to Citrix PV drivers, make sure
you do the following:

- Install the latest version of the EC2Config service. For more information,
see [Install the latest version of EC2Config](usingconfig-install.md).

- Verify that you have Windows PowerShell 3.0 installed. To verify the
version that you have installed, run the following command in a PowerShell
window:

```powershell

PS C:\> $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

Windows PowerShell 3.0 is bundled in the Windows Management Framework
(WMF) version 3.0 install package. If you need to install Windows PowerShell
3.0, see [Windows Management Framework 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595) in the Microsoft Download
Center.

- Back up your important information on the instance, or create an AMI from
the instance. For more information about creating an AMI, see [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).

###### Tip

Instead of creating the AMI from the Amazon EC2 console, you can use Systems Manager
Automation to create the AMI using the `AWS-CreateImage`
runbook. For more information, see [AWS-CreateImage](../../../systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-aws-createimage.md) in the
_AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook reference User_
_Guide_.

If you create an AMI, make sure that you do the following:

- Write down your password.

- Do not run the Sysprep tool manually or using the EC2Config
service.

- Set your Ethernet adapter to obtain an IP address automatically
using DHCP.

###### To upgrade Red Hat drivers

01. Connect to your instance and log in as the local administrator. For more
     information about connecting to your instance, see [Connect to your Windows instance using RDP](connecting-to-windows-instance.md).

02. In your instance, [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/Drivers/Citrix-Win_PV.zip) the Citrix PV upgrade package.

03. Extract the contents of the upgrade package to a location of your
     choice.

04. Double-click the **Upgrade.bat** file. If you get a
     security warning, choose **Run**.

05. In the **Upgrade Drivers** dialog box, review the
     information and choose **Yes** if you are ready to start
     the upgrade.

06. In the **Red Hat Paravirtualized Xen Drivers for Windows**
    **uninstaller** dialog box, choose **Yes** to
     remove the Red Hat software. Your instance will be rebooted.

    ###### Note

    If you do not see the uninstaller dialog box, choose **Red Hat**
    **Paravirtualize** in the Windows taskbar.

    ![Red Hat Paravirtualized in taskbar.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/win2003-citrix-taskbar.png)

07. Check that the instance has rebooted and is ready to be used.
    1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
        [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

## Upgrade your Citrix Xen guest agent service

If you are using Citrix PV drivers on Windows Server, you can upgrade the Citrix
Xen guest agent service. This Windows service handles tasks such as shutdown and
restart events from the API. You can run this upgrade package on any version of
Windows Server, as long as the instance is running Citrix PV drivers.

###### Important

For Windows Server 2008 R2 and later, we recommend you upgrade to AWS PV
drivers that include the Guest Agent update.

Before you start upgrading your drivers, make sure you back up your important
information on the instance, or create an AMI from the instance. For more
information about creating an AMI, see [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).

###### Tip

Instead of creating the AMI from the Amazon EC2 console, you can use Systems Manager
Automation to create the AMI using the `AWS-CreateImage`
runbook. For more information, see [AWS-CreateImage](../../../systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-aws-createimage.md) in the
_AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook reference User_
_Guide_.

If you create an AMI, make sure you do the following:

- Do not enable the Sysprep tool in the EC2Config service.

- Write down your password.

- Set your Ethernet adapter to DHCP.

###### To upgrade your Citrix Xen guest agent service

1. Connect to your instance and log in as the local administrator. For more
    information about connecting to your instance, see [Connect to your Windows instance using RDP](connecting-to-windows-instance.md).

2. On your instance, [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/Drivers/Citrix-Win_PV.zip) the Citrix upgrade package.
