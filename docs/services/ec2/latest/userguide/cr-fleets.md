# Capacity Reservation Fleets

An _On-Demand Capacity Reservation Fleet_ is a group of Capacity Reservations.

A Capacity Reservation Fleet request contains all of the configuration information that's needed to
launch a Capacity Reservation Fleet. Using a single request, you can reserve large amounts of Amazon EC2
capacity for your workload across multiple instance types, up to a target capacity that
you specify.

After you create a Capacity Reservation Fleet, you can manage the Capacity Reservations in the fleet collectively by
modifying or canceling the Capacity Reservation Fleet.

## How Capacity Reservation Fleets work

When you create a Capacity Reservation Fleet, the Fleet attempts to create individual Capacity Reservations to meet
the total target capacity that you specified in the Fleet request.

The number of instances for which the Fleet reserves capacity depends on the [total target capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/crfleet-concepts.html#target-capacity) and
the [instance type\
weights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/crfleet-concepts.html#instance-weight) that you specify. The instance type for which it
reserves capacity depends on the [allocation strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/crfleet-concepts.html#allocation-strategy) and [instance type priorities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/crfleet-concepts.html#instance-priority)
that you use.

If there is insufficient capacity at the time the Fleet is created, and it is
unable to immediately meet its total target capacity, the Fleet asynchronously
attempts to create Capacity Reservations until it has reserved the requested amount of
capacity.

When the Fleet reaches its total target capacity, it attempts to maintain that
capacity. If a Capacity Reservation in the Fleet is cancelled, the Fleet automatically creates one
or more Capacity Reservations, depending on your Fleet configuration, to replace the lost capacity
and to maintain its total target capacity.

The Capacity Reservations in the Fleet can't be managed individually. They must be managed
collectively by modifying the Fleet. When you modify a Fleet, the Capacity Reservations in the Fleet
are automatically updated to reflect the changes.

Currently, Capacity Reservation Fleets support the `open` instance matching criteria,
and all Capacity Reservations launched by a Fleet automatically use this instance matching criteria.
With this criteria, new instances and existing instances that have matching
attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone, and tenancy) automatically
run in the Capacity Reservations created by a Fleet. Capacity Reservation Fleets do not support targeted instance
matching criteria.

## Considerations

Keep the following in mind when working with Capacity Reservation Fleets:

- A Capacity Reservation Fleet can be created, modified, viewed, and cancelled using the
AWS CLI and AWS API.

- The Capacity Reservations in a Fleet can't be managed individually. They must be managed
collectively by modifying or cancelling the Fleet.

- A Capacity Reservation Fleet can't span across Regions.

- A Capacity Reservation Fleet can't span across Availability Zones.

- Capacity Reservations created by a Capacity Reservation Fleet are automatically tagged with the following
AWS generated tag:

- Key —
`aws:ec2-capacity-reservation-fleet`

- Value —
`fleet_id`

You can use this tag to identify Capacity Reservations that were created by a
Capacity Reservation Fleet.

## Pricing

There are no additional charges for using Capacity Reservation Fleets. You are billed for the
individual Capacity Reservations that are created by your Capacity Reservation Fleets. For more information about how
Capacity Reservations are billed, see [Capacity Reservation pricing and billing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservations-pricing-billing.html).
