# Grant permission to tag Amazon EC2 resources during creation

Some resource-creating Amazon EC2 API actions enable you to specify tags when you
create the resource. You can use resource tags to implement attribute-based control
(ABAC). For more information, see [Tag your resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#tag-resources) and [Control access using attribute-based access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-policies-for-amazon-ec2.html#control-access-with-tags).

To enable users to tag resources on creation, they must have permissions to use
the action that creates the resource, such as `ec2:RunInstances` or
`ec2:CreateVolume`. If tags are specified in the resource-creating
action, Amazon performs additional authorization on the `ec2:CreateTags`
action to verify if users have permissions to create tags. Therefore, users must
also have explicit permissions to use the `ec2:CreateTags` action.

In the IAM policy definition for the `ec2:CreateTags` action, use the
`Condition` element with the `ec2:CreateAction` condition
key to give tagging permissions to the action that creates the resource.

The following example demonstrates a policy that allows users to launch instances
and apply any tags to instances and volumes during launch. Users are not permitted
to tag any existing resources (they cannot call the `ec2:CreateTags`
action directly).

```json

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "ec2:RunInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "ec2:CreateTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:*/*",
      "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {
             "ec2:CreateAction" : "RunInstances"
          }
       }
    }
  ]
}
```

Similarly, the following policy allows users to create volumes and apply any tags
to the volumes during volume creation. Users are not permitted to tag any existing
resources (they cannot call the `ec2:CreateTags` action directly).

```json

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "ec2:CreateVolume"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
         "ec2:CreateTags"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:*/*",
      "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {
             "ec2:CreateAction" : "CreateVolume"
          }
       }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `ec2:CreateTags` action is only evaluated if tags are applied
during the resource-creating action. Therefore, a user that has permissions to
create a resource (assuming there are no tagging conditions) does not require
permissions to use the `ec2:CreateTags` action if no tags are specified
in the request. However, if the user attempts to create a resource with tags, the
request fails if the user does not have permissions to use the
`ec2:CreateTags` action.

The `ec2:CreateTags` action is also evaluated if tags are provided in a
launch template. For an example policy, see [Tags in a launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ExamplePolicies_EC2.html#iam-example-tags-launch-template).

## Control access to specific tags

You can use additional conditions in the `Condition` element of
your IAM policies to control the tag keys and values that can be applied to
resources.

The following condition keys can be used with the examples in the preceding
section:

- `aws:RequestTag`: To indicate that a particular tag key or
tag key and value must be present in a request. Other tags can also be
specified in the request.

- Use with the `StringEquals` condition operator to
enforce a specific tag key and value combination, for example,
to enforce the tag
`cost-center` = `cc123`:

```json

"StringEquals": { "aws:RequestTag/cost-center": "cc123" }
```

- Use with the `StringLike` condition operator to
enforce a specific tag key in the request; for example, to
enforce the tag key `purpose`:

```json

"StringLike": { "aws:RequestTag/purpose": "*" }
```

- `aws:TagKeys`: To enforce the tag keys that are used in the
request.

- Use with the `ForAllValues` modifier to enforce
specific tag keys if they are provided in the request (if tags
are specified in the request, only specific tag keys are
allowed; no other tags are allowed). For example, the tag keys
`environment` or `cost-center` are
allowed:

```json

"ForAllValues:StringEquals": { "aws:TagKeys": ["environment","cost-center"] }
```

- Use with the `ForAnyValue` modifier to enforce the
presence of at least one of the specified tag keys in the
request. For example, at least one of the tag keys
`environment` or `webserver` must be
present in the request:

```json

"ForAnyValue:StringEquals": { "aws:TagKeys": ["environment","webserver"] }
```

These condition keys can be applied to resource-creating actions that support
tagging, as well as the `ec2:CreateTags` and
`ec2:DeleteTags` actions. To learn whether an Amazon EC2 API action
supports tagging, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for\
Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonec2.html).

To force users to specify tags when they create a resource, you must use the
`aws:RequestTag` condition key or the `aws:TagKeys`
condition key with the `ForAnyValue` modifier on the
resource-creating action. The `ec2:CreateTags` action is not
evaluated if a user does not specify tags for the resource-creating
action.

For conditions, the condition key is not case-sensitive and the condition
value is case-sensitive. Therefore, to enforce the case-sensitivity of a tag
key, use the `aws:TagKeys` condition key, where the tag key is
specified as a value in the condition.

For example IAM policies, see [Example policies to control access the Amazon EC2 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ExamplePolicies_EC2.html). For more information, see [Conditions with multiple context keys or values](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-logic-multiple-context-keys-or-values.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.
