# How Amazon EC2 instance hibernation works

The following diagram shows a basic overview of the hibernation process for EC2
instances.

## What happens when you hibernate an instance

When you hibernate an instance, the following happens:

- The instance moves to the `stopping` state. Amazon EC2 signals the
operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk). The hibernation
freezes all of the processes, saves the contents of the RAM to the EBS root
volume, and then performs a regular shutdown.

- After the shutdown is complete, the instance moves to the
`stopped` state.

- Any EBS volumes remain attached to the instance, and their data persists,
including the saved contents of the RAM.

- Any Amazon EC2 instance store volumes remain attached to the instance, but the
data on the instance store volumes is lost.

- In most cases, the instance is migrated to a new underlying host computer
when it's started. This is also what happens when you stop and start an
instance.

- When the instance is started, the instance boots up and the operating
system reads in the contents of the RAM from the EBS root volume, before
unfreezing processes to resume its state.

- The instance retains its private IPv4 addresses and any IPv6 addresses.
When the instance is started, the instance continues to retain its private
IPv4 addresses and any IPv6 addresses.

- Amazon EC2 releases the public IPv4 address. When the instance is started,
Amazon EC2 assigns a new public IPv4 address to the instance.

- The instance retains its associated Elastic IP addresses. You're charged
for any Elastic IP addresses that are associated with a hibernated
instance.

For information about how hibernation differs from reboot, stop, and terminate,
see [Differences between instance states](ec2-instance-lifecycle.md#lifecycle-differences).

## Limitations

- When you hibernate an instance, the data on any instance store volumes is
lost.

- (Linux instances) You can't hibernate a Linux instance that has more than 150 GiB of
RAM.

- (Windows instances) You can't hibernate a Windows instance that has more than 16 GiB of
RAM.

- While your instance is hibernated, you can't modify it. This is different
to a stopped instance that isn't hibernated, where you can modify certain
attributes, such as the instance type or size.

- If you create a snapshot or AMI from an instance that is hibernated or has
hibernation enabled, you might not be able to connect to a new instance that
is launched from the AMI or from an AMI that was created from the
snapshot.

- (Spot Instances only) If Amazon EC2 hibernates your Spot Instance, only Amazon EC2 can resume
your instance. If you hibernate your Spot Instance ( [user-initiated hibernation](hibernating-instances.md)), you
can resume your instance. A hibernated Spot Instance can only be resumed if capacity
is available and the Spot price is less than or equal to your specified
maximum price.

- You can't hibernate an instance that is in an Auto Scaling group or used by Amazon ECS.
If your instance is in an Auto Scaling group and you try to hibernate it, the Amazon EC2
Auto Scaling service marks the stopped instance as unhealthy, and might terminate it
and launch a replacement instance. For more information, see [Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

- You can't hibernate an instance that is configured to boot in UEFI mode
with [UEFI Secure Boot](uefi-secure-boot.md)
enabled.

- If you hibernate an instance that was launched into a Capacity Reservation, the Capacity Reservation does
not ensure that the hibernated instance can resume after you try to start
it.

- You can’t hibernate an instance that uses a kernel below 5.10 if Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) mode is enabled.

- We
do not support keeping an instance hibernated for more than 60 days. To keep
the instance for longer than 60 days, you must start the hibernated
instance, stop the instance, and start it.

- We constantly update our platform with upgrades and security patches,
which can conflict with existing hibernated instances. We notify you about
critical updates that require a start for hibernated instances so that we
can perform a shutdown or a reboot to apply the necessary upgrades and
security patches.

## Considerations for hibernating a Spot Instance

- If _you_ hibernate your Spot Instance, you can
restart it provided capacity is available and the Spot price is less than or
equal to your specified maximum price.

- If _Amazon EC2_ hibernates your Spot Instance:

- Only Amazon EC2 can resume your instance.

- Amazon EC2 resumes the hibernated Spot Instance when capacity becomes available
with a Spot price that is less than or equal to your specified
maximum price.

- Before Amazon EC2 hibernates your Spot Instance, you'll receive an interruption
notice two minutes before hibernation starts.
