# Set the time reference on your EC2 instance or any internet-connected device to use the public Amazon Time Sync Service

You can set your instance, or any internet-connected device such as your local
computer or an on-prem server, to use the public Amazon Time Sync Service, which is accessible over the
internet at `time.aws.com`. You can use the public Amazon Time Sync Service as a backup for the
local Amazon Time Sync Service and to connect resources outside of AWS to the Amazon Time Sync Service.

###### Note

For the best performance, we recommend using the _local_ Amazon Time Sync Service on your instances, and only using the _public_ Amazon Time Sync Service as a backup.

Use the instructions for the operating system of your instance or device.

###### To set your Linux instance or device to use the public Amazon Time Sync Service using chrony or ntpd

1. Edit `/etc/chrony.conf` (if you use chrony) or
    `/etc/ntp.conf` (if you use ntpd) using a text editor as
    follows:
1. To prevent your instance or device from trying to mix smeared
       and non-smeared servers, remove or comment out lines starting
       with `server` except any existing connection to the
       local Amazon Time Sync Service.

      ###### Important

      If you're setting your EC2 instance to connect to the
      public Amazon Time Sync Service, do not remove the following line which sets
      your instance to connect to the local Amazon Time Sync Service. The local
      Amazon Time Sync Service is a more direct connection and will provide better
      clock accuracy. The public Amazon Time Sync Service should only be used as a
      backup.

      ```nohighlight

      server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst minpoll 4 maxpoll 4
      ```

2. Add the following line to connect to the public Amazon Time Sync Service.

      ```nohighlight

      pool time.aws.com iburst
      ```
2. Restart the daemon using one of the following commands.

- chrony

```nohighlight

sudo service chronyd force-reload
```

- ntpd

```nohighlight
