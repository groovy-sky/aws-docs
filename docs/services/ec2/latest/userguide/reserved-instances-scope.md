# Regional and zonal Reserved Instances (scope)

When you purchase a Reserved Instance, you determine the scope of the Reserved Instance. The scope is either
regional or zonal.

- **Regional**: When you purchase a Reserved Instance for a
Region, it's referred to as a _regional_ Reserved Instance.

- **Zonal**: When you purchase a Reserved Instance for a
specific Availability Zone, it's referred to as a _zonal_ Reserved Instance.

The scope does not affect the price. You pay the same price for a regional or zonal
Reserved Instance. For more information about Reserved Instance pricing, see [Key variables that determine Reserved Instance pricing](ec2-reserved-instances.md#ri-key-pricing-variables) and
[Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/pricing).

For more information about how to specify the scope of a Reserved Instance, see [RI\
Attributes](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances), specifically the **Availability Zone**
bullet.
