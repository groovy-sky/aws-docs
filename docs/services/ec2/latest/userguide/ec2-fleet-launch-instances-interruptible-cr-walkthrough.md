# Tutorial: Configure your EC2 Fleet to launch instances into Interruptible Capacity Reservations

This tutorial walks you through the steps that you must perform so that your EC2 Fleet
launches instances into Interruptible Capacity Reservations.

Interruptible Capacity Reservations represent spare capacity lent to you by On-Demand Capacity Reservation owners within
your AWS organization. These reservations are suitable for interruptible workloads
because the capacity owner can reclaim the capacity at any time with a 2-minute
interruption notice, after which EC2 terminates the instances. For more information
about Interruptible Capacity Reservations, see [Interruptible Capacity Reservations](interruptible-capacity-reservations.md).

The target capacity of the EC2 Fleet request should be less than or equal to the available
capacity of the Interruptible Capacity Reservation that you are targeting. If the target capacity
request exceeds the available capacity of your Interruptible Capacity Reservation, EC2 Fleet launches as
many instances as it can and reports the launched instances in the API response.

Instances running in an Interruptible Capacity Reservation continue to run until you manually stop or
terminate them, or until the capacity owner reclaims the capacity. When the capacity
owner reclaims the capacity, Amazon EC2 sends an Amazon EventBridge notification 2 minutes
before terminating the instances.

## Considerations

- Only EC2 Fleet requests of type `instant` are supported for
launching instances into Interruptible Capacity Reservations.

- Using `OnDemandTargetCapacity` or
`SpotTargetCapacity` while also setting
`reserved-capacity` as the
`DefaultTargetCapacityType` is not supported.

- When you specify multiple launch templates, each targeting a different
Interruptible Capacity Reservation, EC2 Fleet provisions instances across all matching
reservations.

- For Interruptible Capacity Reservations, EC2 Fleet does not fall back to launching On-Demand Instances or
Spot Instances for the remainder of the desired target capacity.

## Verify permissions

Before creating an EC2 Fleet, verify that you have an IAM role with the required
permissions. For more information, see [EC2 Fleet prerequisites](ec2-fleet-prerequisites.md).

To launch instances into an Interruptible Capacity Reservation, you must perform the following
steps:

## Step 1: Create a launch template

Use the [create-launch-template](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-launch-template.md) command to create a launch template that
specifies the Interruptible Capacity Reservation to target. In the launch template, set
`MarketType` to
`interruptible-capacity-reservation` and specify the
`CapacityReservationId` of your Interruptible Capacity Reservation.

Example launch template configuration:

```JSON

{
    "LaunchTemplateName": "interruptible-cr-launch-template",
    "LaunchTemplateData": {
        "InstanceType": "m5.large",
        "ImageId": "ami-0abcdef1234567890",
        "CapacityReservationSpecification": {
            "CapacityReservationTarget": {
                "CapacityReservationId": "cr-0123456789abcdef0"
            }
        },
        "InstanceMarketOptions": {
            "MarketType": "interruptible-capacity-reservation"
        }
    }
}
```

Example output

```JSON

{
    "LaunchTemplate": {
        "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-0123456789example",
        "LaunchTemplateName": "interruptible-cr-launch-template",
        "CreateTime": "2026-03-12T10:00:00.000Z",
        "CreatedBy": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Admin",
        "DefaultVersionNumber": 1,
        "LatestVersionNumber": 1
    }
}
```

For more information, see [Create an Amazon EC2 launch template](create-launch-template.md).

## Step 2: Configure the EC2 Fleet

Create a configuration file for the EC2 Fleet that specifies the launch template and
target capacity. The following configuration uses the launch template
`interruptible-cr-launch-template` that you created in Step 1.

You must specify `ReservedCapacityOptions` with
`ReservationType` set to
`interruptible-capacity-reservation` when using
`reserved-capacity` as the
`DefaultTargetCapacityType`.

Create a file named `config.json` with the following
content:

```JSON

{
    "LaunchTemplateConfigs": [
        {
            "LaunchTemplateSpecification": {
                "LaunchTemplateName": "interruptible-cr-launch-template",
                "Version": "1"
            },
            "Overrides": [
                {
                    "InstanceType": "m5.large",
                    "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1a"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "TargetCapacitySpecification": {
        "TotalTargetCapacity": 10,
        "DefaultTargetCapacityType": "reserved-capacity"
    },
    "ReservedCapacityOptions": {
        "ReservationType": ["interruptible-capacity-reservation"]
    },
    "Type": "instant"
}
```

Key configuration parameters:

ParameterDescription`DefaultTargetCapacityType`Set to `reserved-capacity` to indicate that
instances should be launched into reserved capacity.`ReservedCapacityOptions`Specifies the type of reserved capacity. For Interruptible
Capacity Reservations, set `ReservationType` to
`["interruptible-capacity-reservation"]`.`Type`Must be set to `instant`. Only instant fleets are
supported for Interruptible Capacity Reservations.

## Step 3: Launch the fleet and view results

Use the [create-fleet](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-fleet.md) command to create the fleet:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-fleet \
    --cli-input-json file://config.json
```

After you create the `instant` fleet using the preceding
configuration, EC2 Fleet launches 10 instances into the Interruptible Capacity Reservation to
meet the target capacity.

###### Note

If the fleet cannot fulfill the full target capacity, the response includes
the instances that were launched and any errors for unfulfilled capacity.

Example output

```JSON

{
    "FleetId": "fleet-12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
    "Instances": [
        {
            "LaunchTemplateAndOverrides": {
                "LaunchTemplateSpecification": {
                    "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-0123456789example",
                    "Version": "1"
                },
                "Overrides": {
                    "InstanceType": "m5.large",
                    "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1a"
                }
            },
            "Lifecycle": "interruptible-capacity-reservation",
            "InstanceIds": [
                "i-0123456789example1",
                "i-0123456789example2",
                "i-0123456789example3",
                "i-0123456789example4",
                "i-0123456789example5",
                "i-0123456789example6",
                "i-0123456789example7",
                "i-0123456789example8",
                "i-0123456789example9",
                "i-0123456789example0"
            ],
            "InstanceType": "m5.large",
            "Platform": "Linux/UNIX"
        }
    ],
    "Errors": []
}
```

## Clean up

To stop incurring charges, terminate the instances when they are no longer needed.
Note that EC2 also terminates instances launched into an Interruptible Capacity Reservation
automatically when the capacity owner reclaims the capacity.
