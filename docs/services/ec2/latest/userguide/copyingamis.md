# Copy an Amazon EC2 AMI

When you need a consistent Amazon EC2 instance configuration across multiple Regions, you can use
a single Amazon Machine Image (AMI) as your template to launch all the instances. However, AMIs are
Region-specific resources—to launch an instance in a specific AWS Region, the AMI
must be located in that Region. Therefore, to use the same AMI in multiple Regions, you must
copy it from the source Region to each target Region.

The method you use to copy an AMI depends on whether you're copying across Regions _within the same [partition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#partition)_ or _across different_
_partitions_:

- **Cross-Region copying** – Copy AMIs across Regions
_within the same partition_, for example,
across the Regions within the commercial partition. This copy method is described in
this topic.

- **Cross-partition copying** – Copy AMIs _from one partition to another partition_, for example,
from the commercial partition to the AWS GovCloud (US) partition. For information about
this copy method, see [Store and restore an AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-store-restore.html).

- **Cross-account copying** – Create a copy of an AMI
that another AWS account has [shared with your\
AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharingamis-explicit.html). This copy method is described in this topic.

The time taken to complete the copy operation for cross-Region and cross-account AMI copying
is on a best-effort basis. If you need control over the completion time, you can specify a
completion window ranging from 15 minutes to 48 hours, ensuring your AMI is copied within
your required timeframe. Additional charges apply for time-based AMI copy operations. For
more information, see [Time-based copies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/time-based-copies.html) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

## Considerations

- **Permission to copy AMIs** – You can use IAM
policies to grant or deny users permission to copy AMIs. Starting October 28,
2024, you can specify resource-level permissions for the `CopyImage`
action on the source AMI. Resource-level permissions for the new AMI are
available as before.

- **Launch permissions and Amazon S3 bucket**
**permissions** – AWS does not copy launch permissions or
Amazon S3 bucket permissions from the source AMI to the new AMI. After the copy
operation is complete, you can apply launch permissions and Amazon S3 bucket
permissions to the new AMI.

- **Tags** – You can only copy user-defined AMI tags
that you attached to the source AMI. System tags (prefixed with
`aws:`) and user-defined tags that are attached by other
AWS accounts will not be copied. When copying an AMI, you can attach new tags
to the new AMI and its backing snapshots.

- **Quotas for time-based AMI copies** – After you reach
your _cumulative snapshot copy throughput quota_, subsequent
time-based AMI copy requests fail. For more information, see [Quotas for time-based copies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/time-based-copies.html#time-based-copies-quota) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

- **Supported source-destination copies** – The location
of the source AMI determines whether you can copy it and the allowed
destinations for the new AMI:

- If the source AMI is in a Region, you can copy it within that
Region, to another Region, to an Outpost associated with that
Region, or to a Local Zone in that Region.

- If the source AMI is in a Local Zone, you can copy it within that Local Zone, to the
parent Region of that Local Zone, or to certain other Local Zones with
the same parent Region.

- If the source AMI is on an Outpost, you can't copy it.

- **CLI parameters for source and destination** – When
using the CLI, the following parameters are supported for specifying the source
location of the AMI to copy and the destination of the new AMI. Note that the
copy operation must be initiated in the destination Region; if you omit the
`--region` parameter, the destination assumes the default Region
configured in your AWS CLI settings.

Source to destinationSource parameterDestination parameterRegion to Region`--source-region``--region`Region to Outpost`--source-region``--destination-outpost-arn` (the ARN of the Outpost)Region to Local Zone

## Costs

There is no charge for copying an AMI when no completion time is specified. However,
additional charges apply for time-based AMI copy operations. For more information, see
[Time-based copies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/time-based-copies.html#time-based-copies-pricing) in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

Standard storage and data transfer rates apply. If you copy an EBS-backed AMI, you will
incur charges for the storage of any additional EBS snapshots.

## Copy an AMI

You can copy an AMI that you own or an AMI that was shared with you from another account.
For the supported source and destination combinations, see [Considerations](#copy-ami-considerations).

Console

###### To copy an AMI

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. From the console navigation bar, select the Region that contains
    the AMI.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs** to
    display the list of AMIs available to you in the Region.

4. If you don't see the AMI you want to copy, choose a different
    filter. You can filter by AMIs **Owned by me**,
    **Private images**, **Public**
**images**, and **Disabled**
**images**.

5. Select the AMI to copy, and then choose
    **Actions**, **Copy**
**AMI**.

6. On the **Copy Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** page, specify the
    following information:
1. **AMI copy name**: A name for the new
       AMI. You can include the operating system information in
       the name because Amazon EC2 does not provide this information
       when displaying details about the AMI.

2. **AMI copy description**: By default, the
       description includes information about the source AMI so
       that you can distinguish a copy from its original. You can
       change this description as needed.

3. **Destination Region**: The Region in which to copy the AMI. For
       more information, see [Cross-Region copying](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ami-copy-works.html#copy-amis-across-regions) and [Cross-account copying](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ami-copy-works.html#copy-ami-across-accounts).

4. **Copy tags**: Select this checkbox to
       include your user-defined AMI tags when copying the AMI.
       System tags (prefixed with `aws:`) and
       user-defined tags that are attached by other AWS accounts
       will not be copied.

5. **Time-based copy**: You can specify whether the copy operation
       completes within a specific timeframe or on a best-effort
       basis, as follows:

- To complete the copy within a specific
timeframe:

- Select **Enable time-based**
**copy**.

- For **Completion**
**duration**, enter the number of minutes
(in 15-minute increments) allowed for the copy
operation. The completion duration applies to all
snapshots associated with the AMI.

For more information, see [Time-based copies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/time-based-copies.html) in the
_Amazon EBS User Guide_.

- To complete the copy on a best-effort basis:

- Leave **Enable time-based**
**copy** unselected.

6. (EBS-backed AMIs only) **Encrypt EBS snapshots of AMI copy**: Select
       this checkbox to encrypt the target snapshots, or to
       re-encrypt them using a different key. If encryption by
       default is enabled, the **Encrypt EBS snapshots of**
      **AMI copy** checkbox is selected and cannot be
       cleared. For more information, see [Encryption and copying](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-ami-copy-works.html#ami-copy-encryption).

7. (EBS-backed AMIs only) **KMS key**: The
       KMS key to used to encrypt the target snapshots.

8. **Tags**: You can tag the new
       AMI and the new snapshots with the same tags, or you can tag
       them with different tags.

- To tag the new AMI and the new snapshots with the
_same_ tags,
choose **Tag image and snapshots**
**together**. The same tags are applied to
the new AMI and every snapshot that is
created.

- To tag the new AMI and the new snapshots with
_different_ tags,
choose **Tag image and snapshots**
**separately**. Different tags are applied
to the new AMI and the snapshots that are created.
Note, however, that all the new snapshots that are
created get the same tags; you can't tag each new
snapshot with a different tag.

To add a tag, choose **Add tag**, and
enter the key and value for the tag. Repeat for each
tag.

9. When you're ready to copy the AMI, choose **Copy**
      **AMI**.

      The initial status of the new AMI is
       `Pending`. The AMI copy operation is complete
       when the status is `Available`.

AWS CLI

###### To copy an AMI from one Region to another Region

Use the [copy-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/copy-image.html) command. You
must specify both the source and destination Regions. You specify the
source Region using the `--source-region` parameter. You can
specify the destination Region using the `--region` parameter
(or omit this parameter to assume the default Region configured in your
AWS CLI settings).

```nohighlight

aws ec2 copy-image \
    --source-image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --source-region us-west-2 \
    --name my-ami \
    --region us-east-1
```

When you encrypt a target snapshot during AMI copy, you must specify these
additional parameters: `--encrypted` and `--kms-key-id`.

###### To copy an AMI from a Region to a Local Zone

Use the [copy-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/copy-image.html) command. You
must specify both the source and destination. You specify the source
Region using the `--source-region` parameter. You specify the
destination Local Zone using the
`--destination-availability-zone` parameter (you can use
`--destination-availability-zone-id` instead). Note that
you can only copy an AMI from a Region to a Local Zone within that same
Region.

```nohighlight

Region using the `--source-region` parameter. You specify the
destination Region using the `--region` parameter (or omit
this parameter to assume the default Region configured in your AWS CLI
settings). The source Local Zone is assumed from the location of the
specified source AMI ID. Note that you can only copy an AMI from a Local
Zone to its parent Region.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 copy-image \
    --source-image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --source-region cn-north-1 \
    --name my-ami \
    --region cn-north-1
```

###### To copy an AMI from one Local Zone to another Local Zone

Use the [copy-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/copy-image.html) command. You
must specify both the source and destination. You specify the source
Region of the Local Zone using the `--source-region`
parameter. You specify the destination Local Zone using the
`--destination-availability-zone` parameter (you can use
`--destination-availability-zone-id` instead). The source
Local Zone is assumed from the location of the specified source AMI ID.
You specify the parent Region of the destination Local Zone using the
`--region` parameter (or omit this parameter to assume
the default Region configured in your AWS CLI settings).

```nohighlight

aws ec2 copy-image \
    --source-image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
