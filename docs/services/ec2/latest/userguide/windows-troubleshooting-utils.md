# EC2 Windows troubleshooting utilities

The `EC2WinUtil` driver provides the following types of troubleshooting support
for your Windows instance.

**Crash call stacks**

`EC2WinUtil` collects basic crash information from your instance
and writes it out to the serial console. The following list includes some of the
key details that the utility writes to the console.

- Identification of the module that generated the fault.

- The Windows error code associated with the event.

- A stack trace of the most recent calls.

With these details, you can perform initial root cause analysis and determine if
further analysis is needed. Output to the serial console also enables AWS to track
crash trends for Amazon EC2 drivers, and diagnose large scale crash events.

###### Note

`EC2WinUtil` doesn't collect any customer data in its crash call stacks.
