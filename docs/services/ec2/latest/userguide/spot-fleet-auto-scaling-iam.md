# IAM permissions required for Spot Fleet automatic scaling
<a name="spot-fleet-auto-scaling-IAM"></a>

Automatic scaling for Spot Fleet is made possible by a combination of the Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, and Application Auto Scaling APIs. Spot Fleet requests are created with Amazon EC2, alarms are created with CloudWatch, and scaling policies are created with Application Auto Scaling. In addition to the [IAM permissions required for using Spot Fleet](spot-fleet-prerequisites.md#spot-fleet-iam-users) and Amazon EC2, the user that accesses the fleet scaling settings must have the appropriate permissions for the services that support automatic scaling.

To use automatic scaling for Spot Fleet, users must have permissions to use the actions shown in the following example policy.

You can also create your own IAM policies that allow more fine-grained permissions for calls to the Application Auto Scaling API. For more information, see [Identity and Access Management for Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/auth-and-access-control.html) in the *Application Auto Scaling User Guide*.

The Application Auto Scaling service also needs permission to describe your Spot Fleet and CloudWatch alarms, and permissions to modify your Spot Fleet target capacity on your behalf. If you enable automatic scaling for your Spot Fleet, it creates a service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForApplicationAutoScaling_EC2SpotFleetRequest`. This service-linked role grants Application Auto Scaling permission to describe the alarms for your policies, to monitor the current capacity of the fleet, and to modify the capacity of the fleet. The original managed Spot Fleet role for Application Auto Scaling was `aws-ec2-spot-fleet-autoscale-role`, but it is no longer required. The service-linked role is the default role for Application Auto Scaling. For more information, see [Service-linked roles for Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Application Auto Scaling User Guide*.
