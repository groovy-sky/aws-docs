# Reschedule a scheduled event for an EC2 instance

You can reschedule an event so that it occurs at a specific date and time that
suits you. After you reschedule an event, it might take a minute or two before the
the updated date is displayed.

###### Limitations

- Only events with an event deadline date can be rescheduled. The event
can be rescheduled up to the event deadline date. The event deadline
date is indicated in the **Deadline** column (console)
and the `NotBeforeDeadline` field (AWS CLI).

- Only events that have not yet started can be rescheduled. The start
time is indicated in the **Start time** column
(console) and the `NotBefore` field (AWS CLI). Events that are
scheduled to start in the next 5 minutes can't be rescheduled.

- The new event start time must be at least 60 minutes from the current
time.

- If you reschedule multiple events using the console, the event
deadline date is determined by the event with the earliest event
deadline date.

Console

###### To reschedule an event

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Events**.

3. Choose **Resource type: instance** from the
    filter list.

4. Select one or more instances, and then choose
    **Actions**, **Schedule**
**event**.

Only events that have an event deadline date, indicated by a
    value for **Deadline**, can be rescheduled. If
    one of the selected events does not have a deadline date,
    **Actions**, **Schedule**
**event** is disabled.

5. For **New start time**, enter a new date and
    time for the event. The new date and time must occur before the
    **Event deadline**.

6. Choose **Save**.

It might take a minute or two for the updated event start time
    to be reflected in the console.

AWS CLI

###### To reschedule an event

Use the [modify-instance-event-start-time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-event-start-time.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-event-start-time \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --instance-event-id instance-event-0d59937288b749b32 \
    --not-before 2020-03-25T10:00:00.000
```

PowerShell

###### To reschedule an event

Use the [Edit-EC2InstanceEventStartTime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstanceEventStartTime.html)
cmdlet.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceEventStartTime `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -InstanceEventId instance-event-0d59937288b749b32 `
    -NotBefore 2020-03-25T10:00:00.000
```
