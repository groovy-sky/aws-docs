# NitroTPM for Amazon EC2 instances

Nitro Trusted Platform Module (NitroTPM) is a virtual device that is provided by the [AWS Nitro System](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro) and conforms to the [TPM 2.0 specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/trusted-platform-module-2-0-a-brief-introduction). It securely stores artifacts (such as passwords, certificates,
or encryption keys) that are used to authenticate the instance. NitroTPM can generate keys and
use them for cryptographic functions (such as hashing, signing, encryption, and
decryption).

NitroTPM provides _measured boot_, a process where the
bootloader and operating system create cryptographic hashes of every boot binary and combine
them with the previous values in NitroTPM internal Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). With
measured boot, you can obtain signed PCR values from NitroTPM and use them to prove to remote
entities the integrity of the instance's boot software. This is known as remote _attestation_.

With NitroTPM, keys and secrets can be tagged with a specific PCR value so that they can
never be accessed if the value of the PCR, and thus the instance integrity, changes. This
special form of conditional access is referred to as _sealing and_
_unsealing_. Operating system technologies, like [BitLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker), can use NitroTPM to seal a drive decryption key so that the drive can only
be decrypted when the operating system has booted correctly and is in a known good state.

To use NitroTPM, you must select an [Amazon Machine Image](amis.md) (AMI)
that has been configured for NitroTPM support, and then use the AMI to launch [Nitro-based instances](instance-types.md#instance-hypervisor-type).
You can select one of Amazon's prebuilt AMIs or create one yourself.

###### Pricing

There is no additional cost for using NitroTPM. You pay only for the underlying resources
that you use.
