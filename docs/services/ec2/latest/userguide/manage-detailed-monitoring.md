# Manage detailed monitoring for your EC2 instances

Amazon CloudWatch provides two categories of monitoring: _basic monitoring_
and _detailed monitoring_. By default, your instance is configured for
basic monitoring. You can optionally enable detailed monitoring to help you more quickly
identify and act on operational issues. You can enable or turn off detailed monitoring
at launch or when the instance is running or stopped.

Enabling detailed monitoring on an instance does not affect the monitoring of its
attached EBS volumes. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EBS](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/using-cloudwatch-ebs.md).

The following table highlights the differences between basic monitoring and detailed
monitoring for your instances.

Monitoring typeDescriptionCharges**Basic monitoring**

Status check metrics are available in 1-minute periods.
All other metrics are available in 5-minute periods.

No charge.**Detailed monitoring**

You can get metrics in 1-minute periods, provided you enable detailed monitoring for the
instance.

Once you've enabled detailed monitoring, you can aggregate the data across
groups of similar instances.

You are charged per metric that Amazon EC2 sends to CloudWatch. You are not charged for
data storage. For more information, see **Paid tier**
on the [Amazon CloudWatch pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

## Required permissions

To enable detailed monitoring for an instance, your user must
have permission to use the [MonitorInstances](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-monitorinstances.md)
API action. To turn off detailed monitoring for an instance, your
user must have permission to use the [UnmonitorInstances](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-unmonitorinstances.md)
API action.

## Enable detailed monitoring at launch

Use the following procedures to enable detailed monitoring at launch. By default,
your instance uses basic monitoring.

Console

###### To enable detailed monitoring when launching an instance

When launching an instance using the Amazon EC2 console, under **Advanced**
**details**, select the **Detailed CloudWatch monitoring**
checkbox.

AWS CLI

###### To enable detailed monitoring when launching an instance

Use the [run-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html)
command with the `--monitoring` option.

```nohighlight

--monitoring Enabled=true
```

PowerShell

###### To enable detailed monitoring when launching an instance

Use the [New-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html)
cmdlet with the `-Monitoring` parameter.

```powershell

-Monitoring $true
```

## Manage detailed monitoring

Use the following procedures to manage detailed monitoring for a running or stopped instance.

Console

###### To manage detailed monitoring

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Monitor and troubleshoot**,
    **Manage detailed monitoring**.

5. On the **Detailed monitoring** page, for **Detailed**
**monitoring**, do one of the following:
   - Detailed monitoring – Select **Enable**.

   - Basic monitoring – Clear **Enable**.
6. Choose **Confirm**.

AWS CLI

###### To enable detailed monitoring

Use the following [monitor-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/monitor-instances.html)
command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
```

###### To disable detailed monitoring

Use the [unmonitor-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/unmonitor-instances.html)
command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 unmonitor-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0
```

PowerShell

###### To enable detailed monitoring

Use the [Start-EC2InstanceMonitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Start-EC2InstanceMonitoring.html)
cmdlet.

```powershell

Start-EC2InstanceMonitoring -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0
```

###### To disable detailed monitoring

Use the [Stop-EC2InstanceMonitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2InstanceMonitoring.html)
