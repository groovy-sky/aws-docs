# Manage detailed monitoring for your EC2 instances
<a name="manage-detailed-monitoring"></a>

Amazon CloudWatch provides two categories of monitoring: *basic monitoring* and *detailed monitoring*. By default, your instance is configured for basic monitoring. You can optionally enable detailed monitoring to help you more quickly identify and act on operational issues. You can enable or turn off detailed monitoring at launch or when the instance is running or stopped.

Enabling detailed monitoring on an instance does not affect the monitoring of its attached EBS volumes. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/using_cloudwatch_ebs.html).

The following table highlights the differences between basic monitoring and detailed monitoring for your instances.

| Monitoring type | Description | Charges |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic monitoring | Status check metrics are available in 1-minute periods. All other metrics are available in 5-minute periods. | No charge. |
| Detailed monitoring | You can get metrics in 1-minute periods, provided you enable detailed monitoring for the instance.<br />Once you've enabled detailed monitoring, you can aggregate the data across groups of similar instances. | You are charged per metric that Amazon EC2 sends to CloudWatch. You are not charged for data storage. For more information, see Paid tier on the [Amazon CloudWatch pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/#Paid_tier). |

## Required permissions
<a name="iam-detailed-monitoring"></a>

To enable detailed monitoring for an instance, your user must have permission to use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_MonitorInstances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_MonitorInstances.html) API action. To turn off detailed monitoring for an instance, your user must have permission to use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_UnmonitorInstances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_UnmonitorInstances.html) API action.
