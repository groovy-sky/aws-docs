# Launch Amazon EC2 instances into a host resource group

Dedicated Hosts are also integrated with AWS License Manager. With License Manager, you can create a host resource
group, which is a collection of Dedicated Hosts that are managed as a single entity. When creating
a host resource group, you specify the host management preferences, such as
auto-allocate and auto-release, for the Dedicated Hosts. This allows you to launch instances onto
Dedicated Hosts without manually allocating and managing those hosts. For more information, see
[Host Resource\
Groups](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.md) in the _AWS License Manager User Guide_.

When you launch an instance into a host resource group that has a Dedicated Host with
available instance capacity, Amazon EC2 launches the instance onto that host. If the host
resource group does not have a host with available instance capacity, Amazon EC2
automatically allocates a new host in the host resource group, and then launches the
instance onto that host. For more information, see [Host Resource\
Groups](../../../license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.md) in the _AWS License Manager User Guide_.

###### Requirements and limits

- You must associate a core- or socket-based license configuration with the
AMI.

- You can't use SQL Server, SUSE, or RHEL AMIs provided
by Amazon EC2 with Dedicated Hosts.

- You can't target a specific host by choosing a host ID, and you can't
enable instance affinity when launching an instance into a host resource
group.

Console

###### To launch an instance into a host resource group

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**,
    **Launch instance**.

3. In the **Application and OS Images** section,
    select an AMI from the list.

4. In the **Instance type** section, select the
    instance type to launch.

5. In the **Key pair** section, select the key
    pair to associate with the instance.

6. In the **Advanced details** section, do the
    following:
1. For **Tenancy**, select
       **Dedicated Host**.

2. For **Target host by**, select
       **Host resource group**.

3. For **Tenancy host resource group**,
       select the host resource group into which to launch the
       instance.

4. For **Tenancy affinity**, do one of
       the following:

- Select **Off**
— The instance launches onto the specified
host, but it is not guaranteed to restart on the
same Dedicated Host if stopped.

- Select the Dedicated Host ID — If stopped, the
instance always restarts on this specific host.

For more information about Affinity, see [Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host auto-placement and host affinity](dedicated-hosts-understanding.md).
7. Configure the remaining instance options as needed. For more
    information, see [Reference for Amazon EC2 instance configuration parameters](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md).

8. Choose **Launch instance**.

AWS CLI

###### To launch an instance into a host resource group

Use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command. In the
`--placement` option, omit the tenancy
and specify the ARN of the host resource group.

```nohighlight

--placement HostResourceGroupArn=arn:aws:resource-groups:us-east-2:123456789012:group/my-resource-group
```

PowerShell

###### To launch an instance into a host resource group

Use the [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md) cmdlet. In the
`-Placement` parameter, omit the tenancy
and specify the ARN of the host resource group.

```powershell

-Placement_HostResourceGroupArn arn:aws:resource-groups:us-east-2:123456789012:group/my-resource-group
```
