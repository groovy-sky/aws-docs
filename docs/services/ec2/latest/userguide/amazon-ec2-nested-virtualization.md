# Use nested virtualization to run hypervisors in Amazon EC2 instances

Nested virtualization allows you to run hypervisors such as Hyper-V and KVM inside virtual
Amazon EC2 instances. Virtual EC2 instances are non-bare metal instances. This capability extends
virtualization flexibility by adding processor-level virtualization support to virtual EC2
instances, enabling a hypervisor running in your instance to create and manage virtual
machines.

Nested virtualization can help when you're running development tools like Docker Desktop, Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), Android Studio emulators, or QEMU in your development workflow, as it allows you to choose from a wide range of standard virtual Amazon EC2 instance types that meet your specific performance and price requirements.

There is no additional cost for using nested virtualization.

## How it works

Virtual EC2 instances run on a physical host that has the Nitro hypervisor. To support
nested virtualization, the Nitro System passes the processor extensions, such as Intel
VT-x, to instances to facilitate running nested virtual machines. The nested
virtualization architecture consists of three layers: the physical AWS
infrastructure and Nitro hypervisor (L0), your EC2 instance running a hypervisor (L1),
and one or more virtual machines created within that instance (L2).

## Considerations

Before you begin using nested virtualization, consider the following:

- **Supported instance types** – Nested
virtualization is currently supported on C8i, M8i, and R8i instances.

- **Supported hypervisors** – Currently, KVM
and Hyper-V are the supported L1 hypervisors.

- **Windows instances** – When nested
virtualization is enabled on a Windows instance:

- **[Credential\**
**Guard](credential-guard.md)** – Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) is
automatically disabled.

- **Hibernation** – Instance
hibernate and resume is not supported.

- **CPU limit** – Not supported on
Windows instances with more than 192 CPUs, such as
`m8i.96xl`.

- **Security responsibilities** – When using
nested virtualization on EC2 instances, AWS is responsible for
"security _of_ the cloud," protecting the
underlying infrastructure and maintaining the strong isolation boundaries
between EC2 instances provided by the AWS Nitro System. Customers
are responsible for "security _in_ the cloud,"
which includes securing the operating system, hypervisor, nested virtual
machines, guest operating systems, applications, and data within the EC2
instances.

- **Performance** – AWS recommends that
customers who want to run workloads that require access to hardware
virtualization extensions, and are performance sensitive or have strict latency
requirements, to evaluate bare metal instances.

## Launch a new instance with nested virtualization enabled

When you launch a new instance, you can turn on nested virtualization to run hypervisors and virtual machines on it.

###### Prerequisites

You must have the required IAM permissions to launch an Amazon EC2 instance.

Console

###### To enable nested virtualization during instance launch

1. Follow the [Launch an EC2 instance using the launch instance wizard in the console](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) procedure and configure your instance as needed.

2. Ensure a supported instance type is selected.

3. Expand **Advanced details**, and for
    **Nested virtualization**, choose
    **Enable**.

4. In the **Summary** panel, review your instance configuration, and then choose **Launch instance**.

AWS CLI

###### To launch an instance with nested virtualization enabled

Use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --instance-type r8i.4xlarge \
    --cpu-options "NestedVirtualization=enabled" \
    --key-name my-key-pair
```

PowerShell

###### To launch an instance with nested virtualization enabled

Use the [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md) command.

```powershell

New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 `
    -InstanceType r8i.4xlarge `
    -CpuOption @{NestedVirtualization='enabled'} `
    -KeyName my-key-pair
```

## Configure an existing instance to use nested virtualization

You can turn on nested virtualization on an existing Amazon EC2 instance.

###### Prerequisites

- The instance must be in a `stopped` state.

- The instance type must support nested virtualization.

Console

###### To enable nested virtualization on an existing instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance you want to modify from the instances table.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Instance**
**settings**, **Change CPU**
**options**.

5. On the **Change CPU options** page, for
    **Nested virtualization**, choose one of the
    following options:

- **Enable** – Turns on nested
virtualization for the instance

- **Disable** – Turns off nested
virtualization for the instance

6. Review your changes, and then choose **Change**
    to apply the new CPU options.

AWS CLI

###### To enable nested virtualization on an existing instance

First stop the instance, and then use the [modify-instance-cpu-options](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-cpu-options.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-cpu-options \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --core-count 4 \
    --threads-per-core 2 \
    --nested-virtualization enabled
```

PowerShell

###### To enable nested virtualization on an existing instance

First stop the instance, and then use the [Edit-EC2InstanceCpuOption](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2instancecpuoption.md) command.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceCpuOption `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -CoreCount 4 `
    -ThreadsPerCore 2 `
    -NestedVirtualization enabled
```
