# Instance identity documents for Amazon EC2 instances

Each instance that you launch has an instance identity document that provides information about the instance itself.
You can use the instance identity document to validate the attributes of the instance.

The instance identity document is generated when the instance is stopped and started, restarted, or launched.
You can access the instance identity document for an instance through the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).
For the instructions, see [Retrieve the instance identity document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/retrieve-iid.html).

The instance identity document uses plaintext JSON format. It includes the following information.
