# Prerequisites for EC2 instance hibernation

You can enable hibernation support for an On-Demand Instance or a Spot Instance when you launch it. You
can't enable hibernation on an existing instance, whether it is running or stopped. For
more information, see [Enable instance\
hibernation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enabling-hibernation.html).

###### AMIs for Graviton instance types

- AL2023 AMI (64-bit Arm) released 2024.07.01 or later ¹

- Amazon Linux 2 AMI (64-bit Arm) released 2024.06.20 or later

¹ For AL2023 minimal AMI, [additional configuration is required](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hibernation-enabled-AMI.html#configure-AL2023-minimal-for-hibernation).

² For CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, hibernation is supported on
Nitro-based instances only.

³ We recommend disabling KASLR on instances with Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy
Jellyfish), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa), Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic
Beaver), and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus). For more information, see
[Disable KASLR on an instance (Ubuntu only)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hibernation-disable-kaslr.html).

⁴ For the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) AMI, hibernation is not supported on
`t3.nano` instance types. No patch will be made available
because Ubuntu (Xenial Xerus) ended support in April 2021. If you want to
use `t3.nano` instance types, we recommend that you upgrade to
the Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)
AMI, or the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) AMI.

⁵ Support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
(Xenial Xerus) has reached end of life.

To configure your own AMI to support hibernation, see [Configure a Linux AMI to support hibernation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hibernation-enabled-AMI.html).

Console

###### To get the instance types that support hibernation

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instance Types**.

3. Add the filter **On-Demand Hibernation support = true**.

4. (Optional) Add filters to further scope to specific instance types of interest.

AWS CLI

###### To get the instance types that support hibernation

Use the [describe-instance-types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/describe-instance-types/.html) command. Note that the available
instance types vary by Region.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instance-types \
    --filters Name=hibernation-supported,Values=true \
    --query "InstanceTypes[*].[InstanceType]" \
    --output text | sort
```

PowerShell

###### To get the instance types that support hibernation

Use the [Get-EC2InstanceType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2InstanceType.html) cmdlet. Note that the available
instance types vary by Region.

```powershell

(Get-EC2InstanceType `
    -Filter @{Name="hibernation-supported"; Values="true"}).InstanceType | Sort-Object
```

## Instance RAM size

Linux instances – Must be less than 150 GiB.

Windows instances – Must be less than or equal to 16
GiB. For hibernating a T3 or T3a Windows instance, we recommend at least 1 GiB of
RAM.

## Root volume type

The root volume must be an EBS volume, not an instance store volume.

## Root volume size

The root volume must be large enough to store the RAM contents and accommodate
your expected usage, for example, OS or applications. If you enable hibernation,
space is allocated on the root volume at launch to store the RAM.

## Root volume encryption

The root volume must be encrypted to ensure the protection of sensitive content
that is in memory at the time of hibernation. When RAM data is moved to the EBS root
volume, it is always encrypted. Encryption of the root volume is enforced at
instance launch.

Use one of the following three options to ensure that the root volume is an
encrypted EBS volume:

- **EBS encryption by default** – You
can enable EBS encryption by default to ensure that all new EBS volumes
created in your AWS account are encrypted. This way, you can enable
hibernation for your instances without specifying encryption intent at
instance launch. For more information, see [Enable encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/encryption-by-default.html).

- **EBS "single-step" encryption** – You
can launch encrypted EBS-backed EC2 instances from an unencrypted AMI and
also enable hibernation at the same time. For more information, see [Use encryption with EBS-backed AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIEncryption.html).

- **Encrypted AMI** – You can enable EBS
encryption by using an encrypted AMI to launch your instance. If your AMI
does not have an encrypted root snapshot, you can copy it to a new AMI and
request encryption. For more information, see [Encrypt an unencrypted image during copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIEncryption.html#copy-unencrypted-to-encrypted) and [Copy an AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html#ami-copy-steps).

## EBS volume type

The EBS volumes must use one of the following EBS volume types:

- General Purpose SSD ( `gp2` and `gp3`)

- Provisioned IOPS SSD ( `io1` and `io2`)

If you choose a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume type, you must provision the EBS volume with the
appropriate IOPS to achieve optimum performance for hibernation. For more
information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.md) in
the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

## Spot Instance requests

For Spot Instances, the following requirements apply:

- The Spot Instance request type must be `persistent`.

- You can't specify a launch group in the Spot Instance request.
