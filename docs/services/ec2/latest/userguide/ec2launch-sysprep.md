# Create an AMI using Windows Sysprep with EC2Launch

When you create an image from an instance with the EC2Launch agent installed, EC2Launch
performs specific tasks as the image is prepared. This includes working with Windows Sysprep.
For more information, see [Windows Sysprep phases](ami-create-win-sysprep.md#sysprep-phases).

EC2Launch offers a default answer file and batch files for Windows Sysprep that automate and
secure the image-preparation process on your AMI. Modifying these files is optional.
These files are located in the following directory by default:
`C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Sysprep`.

###### Important

Do not use Windows Sysprep to create an instance backup. Windows Sysprep removes system-specific
information. If you remove this information there might be unintended consequences
for an instance backup.

## EC2Launch answer and batch files for Windows Sysprep

The EC2Launch answer file and batch files for Windows Sysprep include the
following:

`Unattend.xml`

This is the default answer file. If you run
`SysprepInstance.ps1` or choose
**ShutdownWithSysprep** in the user interface, the
system reads the setting from this file.

`BeforeSysprep.cmd`

Customize this batch file to run commands before EC2Launch runs
Windows Sysprep.

`SysprepSpecialize.cmd`

Customize this batch file to run commands during the Windows Sysprep
specialize phase.

## Run Windows Sysprep with EC2Launch

On the full installation of Windows Server 2016 and later (with a desktop
experience), you can run Windows Sysprep with EC2Launch manually or by using the
**EC2 Launch Settings** application.

###### To run Windows Sysprep using the EC2Launch Settings application

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, locate or create a Windows Server 2016 or later
    AMI.

2. Launch a Windows instance from the AMI.

3. Connect to your Windows instance and customize it.

4. Search for and run the **EC2LaunchSettings** application.
    It is located in the following directory by default:
    `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Settings`.

![EC2 Launch Settings application](../../../images/awsec2/latest/userguide/images/ec2launch-sysprep-png.md)

5. Select or clear options as needed. These settings are stored in the
    `LaunchConfig.json` file.

6. For **Administrator Password**, do one of the
    following:

- Choose **Random**. EC2Launch generates a password
and encrypts it using the user's key. The system disables this
setting after the instance is launched so that this password
persists if the instance is rebooted or stopped and started.

- Choose **Specify** and type a password that meets
the system requirements. The password is stored in
`LaunchConfig.json` as clear text and is
deleted after Windows Sysprep sets the administrator password. If you shut
down now, the password is set immediately. EC2Launch encrypts the
password using the user's key.

- Choose **DoNothing** and specify a password in
the `unattend.xml` file. If you don't specify a
password in `unattend.xml`, the administrator
account is disabled.

7. Choose **Shutdown with Sysprep**.

###### To manually run Windows Sysprep using EC2Launch

1. In the Amazon EC2 console locate or create a Windows Server 2016 or later
    Datacenter edition AMI that you want to duplicate.

2. Launch and connect to your Windows instance.

3. Customize the instance.

4. Specify settings in the `LaunchConfig.json` file. This
    file is located in the
    `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Config`
    directory by default.

For `adminPasswordType`, specify one of the following
    values:

`Random`

EC2Launch generates a password and encrypts it using the
user's key. The system disables this setting after the instance
is launched so that this password persists if the instance is
rebooted or stopped and started.

`Specify`

EC2Launch uses the password you specify in
`adminPassword`. If the password does not meet
the system requirements, EC2Lauch generates a random password
instead. The password is stored in
`LaunchConfig.json` as clear text and is
deleted after Windows Sysprep sets the administrator password. EC2Launch
encrypts the password using the user's key.

`DoNothing`

EC2Launch uses the password you specify in the
`unattend.xml` file. If you don't specify
a password in `unattend.xml`, the
administrator account is disabled.

5. (Optional) Specify settings in `unattend.xml` and other
    configuration files. If plan to attend to the installation, then you don't
    need to make changes in these files. The files are located in the following
    directory by default:
    `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Sysprep`.

6. In Windows PowerShell, run `./InitializeInstance.ps1
   							-Schedule`. The script is located in the following directory, by
    default:
    `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts`.
    This script schedules the instance to initialize during the next boot. You
    must run this script before you run the
    `SysprepInstance.ps1` script in the next step.

7. In Windows PowerShell, run `./SysprepInstance.ps1`. The script
    is located in the following directory by default:
    `C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts`.

You are logged off the instance and the instance shuts down. If you check the
**Instances** page in the Amazon EC2 console, the instance state
changes from `Running` to `Stopping`, and then to
`Stopped`. At this point, it is safe to create an AMI from this
instance.

## Update metadata/KMS routes for Server 2016 and later when launching a custom AMI

To update metadata/KMS routes for Server 2016 and later when launching a
custom AMI, do one of the following:

- Run the EC2LaunchSettings GUI
(C:\\ProgramData\\Amazon\\EC2-Windows\\Launch\\Settings\\Ec2LaunchSettings.exe)
and select the option to shut down with Windows Sysprep.

- Run EC2LaunchSettings and shut down without Windows Sysprep before creating the
AMI. This sets the EC2 Launch Initialize tasks to run at the next boot,
which will set routes based on the subnet for the instance.

- Manually reschedule EC2 Launch initialize tasks before creating an AMI
from [PowerShell](ec2launch-config.md#ec2launch-inittasks).

###### Important

Take note of the default password reset behavior before rescheduling
tasks.

- To update the routes on a running instance that is experiencing Windows activation or
communication with instance metadata failures, see ["Unable to activate Windows"](common-messages.md#activate-windows).
