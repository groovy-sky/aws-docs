# Instance lifecycle in a group
<a name="cr-groups-lifecycle"></a>

When a Capacity Reservation in a group changes state, the impact on your running instances depends on the reservation type.

## On-Demand Capacity Reservations

When an On-Demand Capacity Reservation in a group is canceled, expires, or has its capacity reduced, instances that target the group match with any other On-Demand Capacity Reservation in the group that has matching attributes (instance type, platform, Availability Zone, and tenancy) and available capacity. If the group does not have an On-Demand Capacity Reservation with matching attributes and available capacity, the instances run using On-Demand capacity. If you add a matching On-Demand Capacity Reservation to the group later, Amazon EC2 automatically moves the instances into its reserved capacity.

## Interruptible Capacity Reservations

When the capacity of an interruptible Capacity Reservation is reclaimed, instances receive an interruption notice 2 minutes before termination. For more information, see [Interruption experience](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/interruptible-capacity-reservations.html#interruption-experience).

## Capacity Blocks

Instances running in a Capacity Block in a Capacity Reservation Resource Group are terminated before the Capacity Block ends, the same as for a Capacity Block that you target directly. For more information, see [How Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks work](capacity-blocks-how.md).
