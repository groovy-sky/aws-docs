# Increase the size of an EBS volume on your Mac instance

You can increase the size of your Amazon EBS volumes on your Mac instance. For more information, see
[Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-modify-volume.html)
in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

After you increase the size of the volume, you must increase the size of your APFS container
as follows.

###### Make increased disk space available for use

1. Determine if a restart is required. If you resized an existing EBS volume on a running Mac instance, you must
    [reboot](ec2-instance-reboot.md) the instance to make the new size available.
    If disk space modification was done during launch time, a reboot will not be required.

[ec2-user ~]$  diskutil list external physical
/dev/disk0 (external, physical):
      #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
      0:                 GUID_partition_scheme            *322.1 GB     disk0
      1:                 EFI EFI                           209.7 MB     disk0s1
      2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2        321.9 GB     disk0s2
```

2. Copy and paste the following command.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ PDISK=$(diskutil list physical external | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f1)
APFSCONT=$(diskutil list physical external | grep "Apple_APFS" | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f8)
yes | sudo diskutil repairDisk $PDISK
```

3. Copy and paste the following command.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer $APFSCONT 0
```
