# Create a Spot Instance request

To use Spot Instances, you create a Spot Instance request that includes the desired number of instances, the
instance type, and the Availability Zone. If capacity is available, Amazon EC2 fulfills your
request immediately. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 waits until your request can be fulfilled or until
you cancel the request.

You can use the [launch instance wizard](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) in the Amazon EC2 console or the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command to
request a Spot Instance in the same way that you can launch an On-Demand Instance. This method is only
recommended for the following reasons:

- You're already using the [launch instance wizard](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md) or [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md) command
to launch On-Demand Instances, and you simply want to change to launching Spot Instances
by changing a single parameter.

- You do not need multiple instances with different instance types.

This method is generally not recommended for launching Spot Instances because you can't specify
multiple instance types, and you can't launch Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the same request.
For the preferred methods for launching Spot Instances, which include launching a _fleet_ that includes Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances with multiple
instance types, see [Which is the best Spot request method to use?](spot-best-practices.md#which-spot-request-method-to-use)

If you request multiple Spot Instances at one time, Amazon EC2 creates separate Spot Instance requests so
that you can track the status of each request separately. For more information about
tracking Spot Instance requests, see [Get the status of a Spot Instance request](spot-request-status.md).

Console

###### To create a Spot Instance request

Steps 1–9 are the same steps you'd use to launch an On-Demand Instance. At Step 10, you
configure the Spot Instance request.

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, select a Region.

03. From the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, choose **Launch instance**.

04. (Optional) Under **Name and tags**, you can name your instance, and
     tag the Spot Instance request, the instance, the volumes, and the elastic
     graphics. For information about tags, see [Tag your Amazon EC2 resources](using-tags.md).
    1. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for your instance.

       The instance name is a tag, where the key is **Name**, and the value is the
        name that you specify. If you don't specify a name, the
        instance can be identified by its ID, which is
        automatically generated when you launch the
        instance.

    2. To tag the Spot Instance request, the instance, the volumes, and the elastic graphics, choose
        **Add additional tags**. Choose
        **Add tag**, and then enter a key
        and value, and select the resource type to tag. Choose
        **Add tag** again for each
        additional tag to add.
05. Under **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**, choose
     the operating system (OS) for your instance, and then select an
     AMI. For more information, see [Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-ami).

06. Under **Instance type**, select the instance type that meets your
     requirements for the hardware configuration and size of your
     instance. For more information, see [Instance type](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-instance-type).

07. Under **Key pair (login)**, choose an existing key pair, or choose
     **Create new key pair** to create a new
     one. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 key pairs and Amazon EC2 instances](ec2-key-pairs.md).

    ###### Important

    If you choose the **Proceed without key pair (Not**
    **recommended)** option, you won't be able to connect to the instance
    unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log
    in.

08. Under **Network settings**, use the default settings, or choose
     **Edit** to configure the network settings
     as necessary.

    Security groups form part of the network settings, and define firewall rules for your
     instance. These rules specify which incoming network traffic is
     delivered to your instance.

    For more information, see [Network settings](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-network-settings).

09. The AMI you selected includes one or more volumes of storage, including the root
     device volume. Under **Configure storage**, you
     can specify additional volumes to attach to the instance by
     choosing **Add new volume**. For more
     information, see [Configure storage](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-storage).

10. Under **Advanced details**, configure the Spot Instance request as
     follows:
    1. Under **Purchasing option**, select the **Request Spot**
       **Instances** checkbox.

    2. You can either keep the default configuration for the Spot Instance request, or choose
        **Customize** (at the right) to
        specify custom settings for your Spot Instance request.

       When you choose **Customize**, the following fields appear.
       1. **Maximum price**: You can request Spot Instances at the Spot
           price, capped at the On-Demand price, or you can specify
           the maximum amount you're willing to pay.

          ###### Warning

          If you specify a maximum price, your instances will be interrupted more frequently
          than if you choose **No maximum**
          **price**.

          If you specify a maximum price, it must be more than USD $0.001. Specifying a value
          below USD $0.001 will result in a failed
          launch.

- **No maximum price**: Your Spot Instance will launch at the current Spot
price. The price will never exceed the On-Demand
price. (Recommended)

- **Set your maximum price (per instance/hour)**: You can specify
the maximum amount you're willing pay.

- If you specify a maximum price that is less
than the current Spot price, your Spot Instance will not
launch.

- If you specify a maximum price that is more than the current Spot price, your Spot Instance
will launch and be charged at the current Spot
price. After your Spot Instance is running, if the Spot
price rises above your maximum price, Amazon EC2
interrupts your Spot Instance.

- Regardless of the maximum price you specify, you will always be charged the
current Spot price.

To review Spot price trends, see [View Spot Instance pricing history](using-spot-instances-history.md).

       2. **Request type**: The Spot Instance request type that you choose determines
           what happens if your Spot Instance is interrupted.

- **One-time**: Amazon EC2 places a one-time request for your Spot Instance. If
your Spot Instance is interrupted, the request is not
resubmitted.

- **Persistent request**: Amazon EC2 places a persistent request for
your Spot Instance. If your Spot Instance is interrupted, the
request is resubmitted to replenish the
interrupted Spot Instance.

If you do not specify a value, the default is a one-time request.

       3. **Valid to**: The expiration date of a _persistent_ Spot Instance request.

          This field is not supported for one-time requests. A
           _one-time_ request
           remains active until all the instances in the request
           launch or you cancel the request.

- **No request expiry date**: The request remains active until you
cancel it.

- **Set your request expiry date**: The persistent request remains
active until the date that you specify, or until
you cancel it.

       4. **Interruption behavior**: The behavior that you choose determines
           what happens when a Spot Instance is interrupted.

- For persistent requests, valid values are **Stop** and
**Hibernate**. When an instance
is stopped, charges for EBS volume storage
apply.

###### Note

Spot Instances now use the same hibernation functionality as On-Demand Instances. To enable
hibernation, you can either choose
**Hibernate** here, or you can
choose **Enable** from the
**Stop - Hibernate behavior**
field, which appears lower down in the launch
instance wizard. For the hibernation
prerequisites, see [Prerequisites for EC2 instance hibernation](hibernating-prerequisites.md).

- For one-time requests, only
**Terminate** is valid.

If you do not specify a value, the default is **Terminate**, which
is not valid for a persistent Spot Instance request. If you keep
the default and try to launch a persistent Spot Instance request,
you'll get an error.

For more information, see [Behavior of Spot Instance interruptions](interruption-behavior.md).
11. On the **Summary** panel, for **Number of**
    **instances**, enter the number of instances to
     launch.

    ###### Note

    Amazon EC2 creates a separate request for each Spot Instance.

12. On the **Summary** panel, review the details of your instance, and
     make any necessary changes. After you submit your Spot Instance request,
     you can't change the parameters of the request. You can navigate
     directly to a section in the launch instance wizard by choosing
     its link in the **Summary** panel.
     For more information, see [Summary](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-summary).

13. When you're ready to launch your instance, choose **Launch**
    **instance**.

    If the instance fails to launch or the state immediately goes to
     `terminated` instead of `running`, see [Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance launch issues](troubleshooting-launch.md).

AWS CLI

###### To create a Spot Instance request using run-instances

Use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md)
command and specify the Spot Instance options in the `--instance-market-options`
parameter as follows.

```nohighlight

--instance-market-options file://spot-options.json
```

The following is the data structure to specify in the JSON file.
You can also specify `ValidUntil` and `InstanceInterruptionBehavior`.
If you do not specify a field in the data structure, the default value is used.

The following example creates a `persistent` request.

```json

{
  "MarketType": "spot",
  "SpotOptions": {
    "SpotInstanceType": "persistent"
  }
}
```

**To create a Spot Instance request using request-spot-instances**

###### Note

We strongly discourage using the [request-spot-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-instances.md) command to request a Spot Instance because it
is a legacy API with no planned investment. For more information, see
[Which is the best Spot request method to use?](spot-best-practices.md#which-spot-request-method-to-use)

Use the [request-spot-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-instances.md) command to create a one-time request.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 request-spot-instances \
    --instance-count 5 \
    --type "one-time" \
    --launch-specification file://specification.json
```

Use the [request-spot-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-instances.md) command to create a persistent request.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 request-spot-instances \
    --instance-count 5 \
    --type "persistent" \
    --launch-specification file://specification.json
```

For example launch specification files to use with these commands, see [Spot Instance request example launch specifications](spot-request-examples.md). If you download a launch
specification file from the Spot Requests console, you must use the
[request-spot-fleet](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-fleet.md) command instead (the Spot Requests
console specifies a Spot Instance request using a Spot Fleet).

PowerShell

###### To create a Spot Instance request

Use the [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md)
cmdlet and specify the Spot Instance options using the `-InstanceMarketOption`
parameter.

```powershell

-InstanceMarketOptions $marketOptions
```

Create the data structure for the Spot Instance options as follows.

```powershell

$spotOptions = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.SpotMarketOptions
$spotOptions.SpotInstanceType="persistent"
$marketOptions = New-Object Amazon.EC2.Model.InstanceMarketOptionsRequest
$marketOptions.MarketType = "spot"
$marketOptions.SpotOptions = $spotOptions
```
