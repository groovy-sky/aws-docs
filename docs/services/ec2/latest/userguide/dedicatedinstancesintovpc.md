# Launch Dedicated Instances into a VPC with default tenancy

When you create a VPC, you have the option of specifying its instance tenancy. If
you launch an instance into a VPC that has an instance tenancy of `dedicated`,
it runs as a Dedicated Instance on hardware that's dedicated for your use.

For more information about launching an instance with a tenancy of `host`,
see [Launch Amazon EC2 instances on an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host](launching-dedicated-hosts-instances.md).

For more information about VPC tenancy options, see [Create a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.
