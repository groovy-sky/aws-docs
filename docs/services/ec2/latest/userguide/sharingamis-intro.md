# Make your AMI publicly available for use in Amazon EC2
<a name="sharingamis-intro"></a>

You can make your AMI publicly available by sharing it with all AWS accounts.

If you want to prevent the public sharing of your AMIs, you can enable *block public access for AMIs*. This blocks any attempts to make an AMI public, helping to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse of AMI data. Note that enabling block public access does not affect your AMIs that are already publicly available; they remain publicly available. For more information, see [Understand block public access for AMIs](block-public-access-to-amis.md).

To allow only specific accounts to use your AMI to launch instances, see [Share an AMI with specific AWS accounts](sharingamis-explicit.md).

## Considerations
<a name="considerations-for-sharing-public-AMIs"></a>

Consider the following before making an AMI public.
+ **Ownership** – To make an AMI public, your AWS account must own the AMI.
+ **Region** – AMIs are a Regional resource. When you share an AMI, it is available only in the Region from which you shared it. To make an AMI available in a different Region, copy the AMI to the Region and then share it. For more information, see [Copy an Amazon EC2 AMI](CopyingAMIs.md).
+ **Block public access** – To publicly share an AMI, [block public access for AMIs](block-public-access-to-amis.md) must be disabled in each Region in which the AMI will be publicly shared. After you've publicly shared the AMI, you can re-enable block public access for AMIs to prevent further public sharing of your AMIs.
+ **Some AMIs can't be made public** – If your AMI includes one of the following components, you can't make it public (but you can [share the AMI with specific AWS accounts](sharingamis-explicit.md)):
  + Encrypted volumes
  + Snapshots of encrypted volumes
  + Product codes
+ **Avoid exposing sensitive data** – To avoid exposing sensitive data when you share an AMI, read the security considerations in [Recommendations for creating shared Linux AMIs](building-shared-amis.md) and follow the recommended actions.
+ **Usage** – When you share an AMI, users can only launch instances from the AMI. They can’t delete, share, or modify it. However, after they have launched an instance using your AMI, they can then create an AMI from the instance they launched.
+ **Automatic deprecation** – By default, the deprecation date of all public AMIs is set to two years from the AMI creation date. You can set the deprecation date to earlier than two years. To cancel the deprecation date, or to move the deprecation to a later date, you must make the AMI private by only [sharing it with specific AWS accounts](sharingamis-explicit.md).
+ **Remove obsolete AMIs** – After a public AMI reaches its deprecation date, if no new instances were launched from the AMI for six or more months, AWS eventually removes the public sharing property so that obsolete AMIs don’t appear in the public AMI lists.
+ **Billing** – You are not billed when your AMI is used by other AWS accounts to launch instances. The accounts that launch instances using the AMI are billed for the instances that they launch.

## Share an AMI with all AWS accounts (share publicly)
<a name="share-an-ami-publicly"></a>

After you make an AMI public, it is available in **Community AMIs** in the console, which you can access from the **AMI Catalog** in the left navigator in the EC2 console or when launching an instance using the console. Note that it can take a short while for an AMI to appear in **Community AMIs** after you make it public.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To make an AMI public**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

1. Select your AMI from the list, and then choose **Actions**, **Edit AMI permissions**.

1. Under **AMI availability**, choose **Public**.

1. Choose **Save changes**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

Each AMI has a `launchPermission` property that controls which AWS accounts, besides the owner's, are allowed to use that AMI to launch instances. By modifying the `launchPermission` property of an AMI, you can make the AMI public (which grants launch permissions to all AWS accounts), or share it with only the AWS accounts that you specify.

You can add or remove account IDs from the list of accounts that have launch permissions for an AMI. To make the AMI public, specify the `all` group. You can specify both public and explicit launch permissions.

**To make an AMI public**

1. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-image-attribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-image-attribute.html) command as follows to add the `all` group to the `launchPermission` list for the specified AMI.

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
       --image-id {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} \
       --launch-permission "Add=[{Group=all}]"
   ```

1. To verify the launch permissions of the AMI, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-image-attribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-image-attribute.html) command.

   ```
   aws ec2 describe-image-attribute \
       --image-id {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} \
       --attribute launchPermission
   ```

1. (Optional) To make the AMI private again, remove the `all` group from its launch permissions. Note that the owner of the AMI always has launch permissions and is therefore unaffected by this command.

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
       --image-id {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} \
       --launch-permission "Remove=[{Group=all}]"
   ```

1. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2ImageAttribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2ImageAttribute.html) command as follows to add the `all` group to the `launchPermission` list for the specified AMI.

   ```
   Edit-EC2ImageAttribute `
       -ImageId {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} `
       -Attribute launchPermission `
       -OperationType add `
       -UserGroup all
   ```

1. To verify the launch permissions of the AMI, use the following [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2ImageAttribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2ImageAttribute.html) command.

   ```
   Get-EC2ImageAttribute `
       -ImageId {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} `
       -Attribute launchPermission
   ```
