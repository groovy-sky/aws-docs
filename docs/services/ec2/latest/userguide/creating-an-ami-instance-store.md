# Create an Amazon S3-backed AMI

The AMI that you specify when you launch your instance determines the type of root
volume.

To create an Amazon S3-backed Linux AMI, start from an instance that you've launched from an
existing Amazon S3-backed Linux AMI. After you've customized the instance to suit your needs,
bundle the volume and register a new AMI, which you can use to launch new instances with
these customizations.

You can't create an Amazon S3-backed Windows AMI because Windows AMIs don't support instance store
for the root volume.

###### Important

Only the following instance types support an instance store volume as the root volume and
require an Amazon S3-backed AMI: C1, C3, D2, I2, M1, M2, M3, R3, and X1.

The AMI creation process is different for Amazon EBS-backed AMIs. For more information, see
[Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).

## Overview of AMI creation

The following diagram summarizes the process of creating an AMI from an instance with an
instance store root volume.

![Creating an Amazon S3-backed AMI.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ami_create_instance_store.png)

First, launch an instance from an AMI that's similar to the AMI that you'd like to
create. You can connect to your instance and customize it. When the instance is set up
the way you want it, you can bundle it. It takes several minutes for the bundling
process to complete. After the process completes, you have a bundle, which consists of
an image manifest ( `image.manifest.xml`) and files
( `image.part.` _xx_) that contain a template
for the root volume. Next you upload the bundle to your Amazon S3 bucket and then register
your AMI.

###### Note

To upload objects to an S3 bucket for your Amazon S3-backed Linux AMI,
ACLs must be enabled for the bucket. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 will not be able to set
ACLs on the objects to upload. If your destination bucket uses the bucket owner
enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, this won’t work because ACLs are
disabled. For more information, see [Controlling ownership of \
objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.md).

When you launch an instance using the new AMI, we create the root volume for the
instance using the bundle that you uploaded to Amazon S3. The storage space used by the
bundle in Amazon S3 incurs charges to your account until you delete it. For more information,
see [Deregister an Amazon EC2 AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/deregister-ami.html).

If you add instance store volumes to your instance in addition to the root volume, the block
device mapping for the new AMI contains information for these volumes, and the block
device mappings for instances that you launch from the new AMI automatically contain
information for these volumes. For more information, see [Block device mappings for volumes on Amazon EC2 instances](block-device-mapping-concepts.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can create an AMI, you must complete the following tasks:

- Install the AMI tools. For more information, see [Set up the Amazon EC2 AMI tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-up-ami-tools.html).

- Install the AWS CLI. For more information, see [Getting started with the\
AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html).

- Ensure that you have an S3 bucket for the bundle, and that your bucket has
ACLs enabled. For more information on configuring ACLs, see [Configuring ACLs](../../../s3/latest/userguide/managing-acls.md).

- To create an S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console, open the Amazon S3 console
at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3) and choose **Create**
**Bucket**.

- To create an S3 bucket with the AWS CLI, you can use the [mb](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/mb.html) command. If your installed
version of the AMI tools is 1.5.18 or later, you can also use the
`ec2-upload-bundle` command to create the S3 bucket. For
more information, see [ec2-upload-bundle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-tools-commands.html#ami-upload-bundle).

- Ensure that the files in your bundle aren't encrypted in the S3 bucket. If you
require encryption for your AMI, you can use an EBS-backed AMI instead. For more
information, see [Use encryption with EBS-backed AMIs](amiencryption.md).

- Ensure that you have your AWS account ID. For more information, see [View AWS account identifiers](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.md) in
the _AWS Account Management Reference Guide_.

- Ensure that you have credentials to use the AWS CLI. For more information, see
[Authentication and access credentials for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)
in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

- Ensure that you have an X.509 certificate and corresponding private
key.

- If you need to create an X.509 certificate, see [Manage signing certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-up-ami-tools.html#ami-tools-managing-certs). The X.509 certificate
and private key are used to encrypt and decrypt your AMI.

- \[China (Beijing)\] Use the
`$EC2_AMITOOL_HOME/etc/ec2/amitools/cert-ec2-cn-north-1.pem`
certificate.

- \[AWS GovCloud (US-West)\] Use the
`$EC2_AMITOOL_HOME/etc/ec2/amitools/cert-ec2-gov.pem`
certificate.

- Connect to your instance and customize it. For example, you can install
software and applications, copy data, delete temporary files, and modify the
Linux configuration.

## Create an AMI from an Amazon Linux instance

The following procedures describe how to create an AMI from an instance with an instance
store root volume running Amazon Linux 1. They might not work for instances running other Linux
distributions.

###### To prepare to use the AMI tools (HVM instances only)

1. The AMI tools require GRUB Legacy to boot properly. Use the following
    command to install GRUB:

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install -y grub
```

2. Install the partition management packages with the following
    command:

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install -y gdisk kpartx parted
```

###### To create an AMI from an Amazon Linux instance with an instance store root volume

This procedure assumes that you have satisfied the prerequisites in [Prerequisites](#bundle-ami-prerequisites).

In the following commands, replace each `user input placeholder`
with your own information.

1. Upload your credentials to your instance. We use these credentials to
    ensure that only you and Amazon EC2 can access your AMI.

1. Create a temporary directory on your instance for your credentials
       as follows:

      ```nohighlight

      [ec2-user ~]$ mkdir /tmp/cert
      ```

      This enables you to exclude your credentials from the created
       image.

2. Copy your X.509 certificate and corresponding private key from
       your computer to the `/tmp/cert` directory on
       your instance using a secure copy tool such as [scp](linux-file-transfer-scp.md). The `-i
      										my-private-key.pem` option
       in the following **scp** command is the private key
       you use to connect to your instance with SSH, not the X.509 private
       key. For example:

      ```nohighlight

      you@your_computer:~ $ scp -i my-private-key.pem /path/to/pk-HKZYKTAIG2ECMXYIBH3HXV4ZBEXAMPLE.pem /path/to/cert-HKZYKTAIG2ECMXYIBH3HXV4ZBEXAMPLE.pem ec2-user@ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/tmp/cert/
      pk-HKZYKTAIG2ECMXYIBH3HXV4ZBEXAMPLE.pem  100%  717     0.7KB/s   00:00
      cert-HKZYKTAIG2ECMXYIBH3HXV4ZBEXAMPLE.pem  100%  685     0.7KB/s   00:00
      ```

Alternatively, because these are plain text files, you can open the
certificate and key in a text editor and copy their contents into new files
in `/tmp/cert`.

2. Prepare the bundle to upload to Amazon S3 by running the [ec2-bundle-vol](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-tools-commands.html#ami-bundle-vol) command from
    inside your instance. Be sure to specify the `-e` option to
    exclude the directory where your credentials are stored. By default, the
    bundle process excludes files that might contain sensitive information.
    These files include `*.sw`, `*.swo`,
    `*.swp`, `*.pem`,
    `*.priv`, `*id_rsa*`,
    `*id_dsa*` `*.gpg`, `*.jks`,
    `*/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and
    `*/.bash_history`. To include all of these files, use
    the `--no-filter` option. To include some of these files, use the
    `--include` option.

###### Important

By default, the AMI bundling process creates a compressed, encrypted
collection of files in the `/tmp` directory that
represents your root volume. If you do not have enough free disk space
in `/tmp` to store the bundle, you need to specify a
different location for the bundle to be stored with the `-d
   									/path/to/bundle/storage`
option. Some instances have ephemeral storage mounted at
`/mnt` or `/media/ephemeral0`
that you can use, or you can also create, attach, and mount a new Amazon EBS)
volume to store the bundle. For more information, see [Create an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-creating-volume.html)
in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

1. You must run the **ec2-bundle-vol** command as
       root. For most commands, you can use **sudo** to gain
       elevated permissions, but in this case, you should run **sudo**
      **-E su** to keep your environment variables.

      ```nohighlight

      [ec2-user ~]$ sudo -E su
      ```

      Note that bash prompt now identifies you as the root user, and
       that the dollar sign has been replaced by a hash tag, signalling
       that you are in a root shell:

      ```
      [root ec2-user]#
      ```

2. To create the AMI bundle, run the [ec2-bundle-vol](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-tools-commands.html#ami-bundle-vol) command as follows:

      ```nohighlight

      [root ec2-user]# ec2-bundle-vol -k /tmp/cert/pk-HKZYKTAIG2ECMXYIBH3HXV4ZBEXAMPLE.pem -c /tmp/cert/cert-HKZYKTAIG2ECMXYIBH3HXV4ZBEXAMPLE.pem -u 123456789012 -r x86_64 -e /tmp/cert --partition gpt
      ```

      ###### Note

      For the China (Beijing) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, use the
      `--ec2cert` parameter and specify the
      certificates as per the [prerequisites](#bundle-ami-prerequisites).

      It can take a few minutes to create the image. When this command
       completes, your `/tmp` (or non-default) directory
       contains the bundle ( `image.manifest.xml`, plus
       multiple
       `image.part.` `xx`
       files).

3. Exit from the root shell.

      ```nohighlight

      [root ec2-user]# exit
      ```
3. (Optional) To add more instance store volumes, edit the block device
    mappings in the `image.manifest.xml` file for your AMI.
    For more information, see [Block device mappings for volumes on Amazon EC2 instances](block-device-mapping-concepts.md).
1. Create a backup of your `image.manifest.xml`
       file.

      ```nohighlight

      [ec2-user ~]$ sudo cp /tmp/image.manifest.xml /tmp/image.manifest.xml.bak
      ```

2. Reformat the `image.manifest.xml` file so that
       it is easier to read and edit.

      ```nohighlight

      [ec2-user ~]$ sudo xmllint --format /tmp/image.manifest.xml.bak > /tmp/image.manifest.xml
      ```

3. Edit the block device mappings in `image.manifest.xml` with a text
       editor. The example below shows a new entry for the
       `ephemeral1` instance store volume.

      ###### Note

      For a list of excluded files, see [ec2-bundle-vol](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-tools-commands.html#ami-bundle-vol).

      ```nohighlight

          <block_device_mapping>
            <mapping>
              <virtual>ami</virtual>
              <device>sda</device>
            </mapping>
            <mapping>
              <virtual>ephemeral0</virtual>
              <device>sdb</device>
            </mapping>
            <mapping>
              <virtual>ephemeral1</virtual>
              <device>sdc</device>
            </mapping>
            <mapping>
              <virtual>root</virtual>
              <device>/dev/sda1</device>
            </mapping>
          </block_device_mapping>
      ```

4. Save the `image.manifest.xml` file and exit
       your text editor.
4. To upload your bundle to Amazon S3, run the [ec2-upload-bundle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-tools-commands.html#ami-upload-bundle) command as follows.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ ec2-upload-bundle -b amzn-s3-demo-bucket/bundle_folder/bundle_name -m /tmp/image.manifest.xml -a your_access_key_id -s your_secret_access_key
```

###### Important

To register your AMI in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), you must specify both
the target Region with the `--region` option and a bucket
path that already exists in the target Region or a unique bucket path
that can be created in the target Region.

5. (Optional) After the bundle is uploaded to Amazon S3, you can remove the bundle
    from the `/tmp` directory on the instance using the
    following **rm** command:

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo rm /tmp/image.manifest.xml /tmp/image.part.* /tmp/image
```

###### Important

If you specified a path with the `-d
   									/path/to/bundle/storage` option
in [Step 2](#step_with_bundle_path_amazon_linux), use that path
instead of `/tmp`.

6. To register your AMI, run the [register-image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/register-image.html)
    command as follows.

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ aws ec2 register-image --image-location amzn-s3-demo-bucket/bundle_folder/bundle_name/image.manifest.xml --name AMI_name --virtualization-type hvm
```

###### Important

If you previously specified a Region for the [ec2-upload-bundle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-tools-commands.html#ami-upload-bundle) command, specify that Region
again for this command.
