# Select a Region for your Amazon EC2 resources

Amazon EC2 resources are specific to the AWS Region or zone in which they reside. When
you create an Amazon EC2 resource, you select the Region for the resource.

###### Considerations

- Some AWS resources might not be available in all Regions. Ensure that you
can create all the AWS resources that you need in a Region before you start
creating resources in a Region.

- Some Regions are disabled by default. You must enable these Regions before you
can use them. For more information , see [AWS\
Regions](../../../global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.md).

###### To select a Region for a resource using the console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the **Regions** selector and
    then choose the Region.

3. The Regions selector includes all resources that are available for use in your
    AWS account. Choose the underlined text near the bottom of the list to view
    the Regions that are not enabled for your account.

###### To select a Region for a resource using the AWS CLI

You can configure the AWS CLI to use a default Region. If you don't specify a Region
in the command, the default Region is used. To use a different Region for a specific
command, add the following option.

```nohighlight

--region us-east-1
```

###### To select a Region for a resource using the Tools for PowerShell

You can configure the Tools for Windows PowerShell to use a default Region. If you don't specify a Region
in a command, the default Region is used. To use a different Region for a specific
command, add the following parameter.

```powershell

-Region us-east-1
```
