<a name="using-regions-availability-zones-setup"></a>

Amazon EC2 resources are specific to the AWS Region or zone in which they reside. When you create an Amazon EC2 resource, you select the Region for the resource.

**Considerations**
+ Some AWS resources might not be available in all Regions. Ensure that you can create all the AWS resources that you need in a Region before you start creating resources in a Region.
+ Some Regions are disabled by default. You must enable these Regions before you can use them. For more information , see [AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html).

**To select a Region for a resource using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
