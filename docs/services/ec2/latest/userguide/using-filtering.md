# Find your Amazon EC2 resources

You can get a list of some types of resources using the Amazon EC2 console. You can get a list of
each type of resource using its corresponding command or API action. If you have many
resources, you can filter the results to include, or exclude, only the resources that match
certain criteria.

### List resources using the console

You can view the most common Amazon EC2 resource types using the console. To view additional
resources, use the command line interface or the API actions.

###### To list EC2 resources using the console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. Amazon EC2 resources are specific to an AWS Region. From the navigation bar,
    choose a Region from the **Regions** selector.

![View your Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/EC2_select_region.png)

3. In the navigation pane, choose the option that corresponds to the resource type. For
    example, to list all your instances, choose **Instances**.

### Filter resources using the console

###### To filter a list of resources

1. In the navigation pane, select a resource type (for example,
    **Instances**).

2. Choose the search field.

3. Select the filter from the list.

4. Select an operator, for example, **= (Equals)**. Some attributes have
    more available operators to select. Note that not all screens support
    selecting an operator.

5. Select a filter value.

6. To edit a selected filter, choose the filter token (blue box), make the required edits,
    and then choose **Apply**. Note that not all screens
    support editing the selected filter.

![Edit a filter.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/filter-edit.png)

7. When you are finished, remove the filter.

#### Supported filters

The Amazon EC2 console supports two types of filtering.

- _API filtering_ happens on the server side. The filtering is applied
on the API call, which reduces the number of resources returned by
the server. It allows for quick filtering across large sets of
resources, and it can reduce data transfer time and cost between the
server and the browser. API filtering supports
**=** (equals) and **:**
(contains) operators, and is always case sensitive.

- _Client filtering_ happens on the client side. It enables you to
filter down on data that is already available in the browser (in
other words, data that has already been returned by the API). Client
filtering works well in conjunction with an API filter to filter
down to smaller data sets in the browser. In addition to
**=** (equals) and **:**
(contains) operators, client filtering can also support range
operators, such as **>=** (greater than or equal),
and negation (inverse) operators, such as **!=**
(does not equal).

The Amazon EC2 console supports the following types of searches:

**Search by keyword**

Searching by keyword is a free text search that lets you search for a value across all
of your resources' attributes or tags, without specifying an
attribute or tag key to search.

###### Note

All keyword searches use _client filtering_.

To search by keyword, enter or paste what you’re looking for in the search field, and
then choose **Enter**. For example, searching
for `123` matches all instances that have
_123_ in any of their attributes, such as
an IP address, instance ID, VPC ID, or AMI ID, or in any of
their tags, such as the Name. If your free text search returns
unexpected matches, apply additional filters.

**Search by attribute**

Searching by an attribute lets you search a specific attribute across all of your
resources.

###### Note

Attribute searches use either _API filtering_ or _client_
_filtering_, depending on the selected
attribute. When performing an attribute search, the
attributes are grouped accordingly.

For example, you can search the **Instance state**
attribute for all of your instances to return only instances that are in the
`stopped` state. To do this:

1. In the search field on the
    **Instances** screen, start
    entering `Instance state`. As you enter the
    characters, the two types of filters appear for
    **Instance state**: **API**
**filters** and **Client**
**filters**.

2. To search on the server side, choose **Instance state** under
    **API filters**. To search on the
    client side, choose **Instance state**
**(client)** under **Client**
**filters**.

A list of possible operators for the selected attribute appears.

3. Choose the **=** (Equals)
    operator.

A list of possible values for the selected attribute
    and operator appears.

4. Choose **stopped** from the list.

**Search by tag**

Searching by a tag lets you filter the resources in the currently displayed table by a tag key or a tag value.

Tag searches use either _API filtering_ or
_client filtering_, depending on the
settings in the Preferences window.

###### To ensure API filtering for tags

1. Open the **Preferences** window.

2. Clear the **Use regular expression matching** checkbox. If this
    checkbox is selected, client filtering is performed.

3. Select the **Use case sensitive matching** checkbox. If this
    checkbox is cleared, client filtering is performed.

4. Choose **Confirm**.

When searching by tag, you can use the following values:

- **(empty)** – Find all resources with
the specified tag key, but there must be no tag
value.

- **All values** – Find all resources with the specified tag
key and any tag value.

- **Not tagged** – Find all resources that do not have the
specified tag key.

- The displayed value – Find all resources with the specified tag key and the
specified tag value.

You can use the following techniques to enhance or refine your searches:

**Inverse search**

Inverse searches let you search for resources that do **not** match a
specified value. In the **Instances** and
**AMIs** screens, inverse searches are
performed by selecting the **!=** (Does not
equal) or **!:** (Does not contain) operator
and then selecting a value. In other screens, inverse searches
are performed by prefixing the search keyword with the
exclamation mark (!) character.

###### Note

Inverse search is supported with keyword searches and attribute searches on _client_ filters only. It is not
supported with attribute searches on API filters.

For example, you can search the **Instance**
**state** attribute for all of your instances to
exclude all instances that are in the `terminated`
state. To do this:

1. In the search field on the
    **Instances** screen, start
    entering `Instance state`. As you enter the
    characters, the two types of filters appear for
    **Instance state**: **API**
**filters** and **Client**
**filters**.

2. Under **Client filters**, choose **Instance state**
**(client)**. Inverse search is only
    supported on _client_
    filters.

A list of possible operators for the selected attribute appears.

3. Choose **!=** (Does not equal), and then choose
    **terminated**.

To filter instances based on an instance state attribute, you can also use the search
icons ( ![Search icon.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/search.png) ) in the **Instance**
**state** column. The search icon with a plus sign (
**+** ) displays all the instances that
_match_ that attribute. The
search icon with a minus sign ( **-** )
_excludes_ all instances
that match that attribute.

Here is another example of using the inverse search: To list all instances that are
**not** assigned the security
group named `launch-wizard-1`, under **Client**
**filters**, search by the **Security group**
**name** attribute, choose **!=**,
and in the search bar, enter
`launch-wizard-1`.

**Partial search**

With partial searches, you can search for partial string values. To perform a partial
search, enter only a part of the keyword that you want to search
for. On the **Instances** and
**AMIs** screens, partial searches can only
be performed with the **:** (Contains)
operator. On other screens, you can select the client filter
attribute and immediately enter only a part of the keyword that
you want to search for. For example, on the **Instance**
**type** screen, to search for all
`t2.micro`, `t2.small`, and
`t2.medium` instances, search by the
**Instance Type** attribute, and for the
keyword, enter `t2`.

**Regular expression search**

To use regular expression searches, you must select the **Use regular**
**expression matching** checkbox in the
**Preferences** window.

Regular expressions are useful when you need to match the values in a field with a
specific pattern. For example, to search for a value that starts
with `s`, search for `^s`. To search for a
value that ends with `xyz`, search for
`xyz$`. Or to search for a value that starts with
a number that is followed by one or more characters, search for
`[0-9]+.*`.

###### Note

Regular expression search is supported with keyword searches and attribute
searches on client filters only. It is not supported with attribute searches on
API filters.

**Case-sensitive search**

To use case-sensitive searches, you must select the **Use case sensitive**
**matching** checkbox in the
**Preferences** window. The case-sensitive
preference only applies to client and tag filters.

###### Note

API filters are always case-sensitive.

**Wildcard search**

Use the `*` wildcard to match zero or more characters. Use the
`?` wildcard to match zero or one character. For
example, if you have a data set with the values
`prod`, `prods`, and
`production`, a search of `prod*`
matches all values, whereas `prod?` matches only
`prod` and `prods`. To use the literal
values, escape them with a backslash (\\). For example,
" `prod\*`" would match `prod*`.

###### Note

Wildcard search is supported with attribute and tag searches on API filters only. It
is not supported with keyword searches, and with attribute
and tag searches on client filters.

**Combining searches**

In general, multiple filters with the same attribute are automatically joined with
`OR`. For example, searching for `Instance State : Running`
and `Instance State : Stopped` returns all instances that are either running
OR stopped. To join search with `AND`, search across different attributes.
For example, searching for `Instance State : Running` and
`Instance Type : c4.large` returns only instances that are of type
`c4.large` AND that are in the running state.

### Save filter sets using the console

A _saved filter set_ is a customized group of filters that
you can create and reuse to efficiently view your Amazon EC2 resources. This feature
helps streamline your workflow, enabling quick access to specific resource
views.

Saved filter sets are only supported in the Amazon EC2 console and are currently only available for the **Volumes** page.

#### Key features

- **Customization:** Create filter sets tailored to your
needs. For example, you can create a filter set to display only your
`gp3` volumes that were created after a specified
date.

- **Default filter:** Set a default filter set for a page,
and the default filters are automatically applied when you navigate to
the page. If no default is set, no filters are applied.

- **Easy application:** Select a saved filter set to apply it
instantly. Amazon EC2 then displays the relevant resources, with the
active filters indicated by blue tokens.

- **Flexibility:** Create, modify, and delete filter sets as
needed.

#### Create a filter set

###### To create a new filter set

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Volumes**.

###### Note

Saved filter sets are currently only available for **Volumes**.

3. In the search field, select filters for your filter set.

4. Choose the arrow next to the **Clear filters** button, and choose
    **Save new filter set**.

5. In the **Save filter set** window, do the following:
1. For **Filter set name**, enter a name for the filter set.

2. (Optional) For **Filter set description**, enter a description for
       the filter set.

3. (Optional) To set the filter set as the default filter, select the **Set as**
      **default** checkbox.

      ###### Note

      The default filter is automatically applied every time you open the console page.

4. Choose **Save**.

#### Modify a filter set

###### To modify a filter set

1. From the **Saved filter sets** list, select the filter to
    modify.

2. To add a filter, in the search field, select a filter to add to your filter set. To
    delete a filter in the set, choose the **X** on the
    filter token.

3. Choose the arrow next to the **Clear filters** button, and choose
    **Modify filter set**.

4. In the **Modify filter set** window, do the following:
1. (Optional) To set the filter set as the default filter, select the **Set as**
      **default** checkbox.

      ###### Note

      The default filter is automatically applied every time you open the console page.

2. Choose **Modify**.

#### Delete a filter set

###### To delete a filter set

1. From the **Saved filter sets** list, select the filter to
    delete.

2. Choose the arrow next to the **Clear filters** button, and choose
    **Delete filter set**.

3. In the **Delete filter set** window, review the filter to confirm this
    is the filter you want to delete, and then choose
    **Delete**.

## List and filter using the command line

Each resource type has a corresponding API actions that you use to describe, list, or get
resources of that type. The resulting lists of resources can be long, so it can be faster
and more useful to filter the results to include only the resources that match specific
criteria.

###### Filtering considerations

- You can specify up to 50 filters and up to 200 values per filter in a single request.

- Filter strings can be up to 255 characters in length.

- You can use wildcards with the filter values. An asterisk (\*) matches zero or more
characters, and a question mark (?) matches zero or one character.

- Filter values are case sensitive.

- Your search can include the literal values of the wildcard characters; you just need to
escape them with a backslash before the character. For example, a value of
`\*amazon\?\\` searches for the literal string `*amazon?\`.

- You can't specify a filter value of null. Instead, use client-side
filtering. For example, the following command uses the **--query** option
and returns the IDs of the instances that were launched without a key pair.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instances \
      --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[?!not_null(KeyName)].InstanceId' \
      --output text
```

AWS CLI

###### Example: Specify a single filter

You can list your Amazon EC2 instances using [describe-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html). Without filters, the response
contains information for all of your resources. You can use the following option to
include only the running instances in the output.

```nohighlight

--filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=running
```

To list only the instance IDs for your running instances, add the `--query`
option as follows.

```nohighlight

--query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId"
```

###### Example: Specify multiple filters or filter values

If you specify multiple filters or multiple filter values, the resource must
match all filters to be included in the output.

You can use the following option to list all instances whose type is either
`m5.large` or `m5d.large`.

```nohighlight

--filters Name=instance-type,Values=m5.large,m5d.large
```

You can use the following option to list all stopped instances whose type is
`t2.micro`.

```nohighlight

--filters Name=instance-state-name,Values=stopped Name=instance-type,Values=t2.micro
```

###### Example: Use wildcards in a filter value

You can use the following option with [describe-snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-snapshots.html)
to return only the snapshots whose description is "database".

```nohighlight

--filters Name=description,Values=database
```

The \* wildcard matches zero or more characters. You can use the following option
to return only the snapshots whose description includes the word database.

```nohighlight

--filters Name=description,Values=*database*
```

The ? wildcard matches exactly 1 character. You can use the following option
to return only the snapshots whose description is "database" or
"database" followed by one character.

```nohighlight

--filters Name=description,Values=database?
```

You can use the following option to return only the snapshots whose
description is "database" followed by up to four characters. This excludes
descriptions with "database" followed by five or more characters.

```nohighlight

--filters Name=description,Values=database????
```

###### Example: Filter based on date

With the AWS CLI, you can use JMESPath to filter results using expressions.
For example, the following [describe-snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-snapshots.html) command displays the IDs of all
snapshots created by the specified AWS account before the specified date.
If you do not specify the owner, the results include all public snapshots.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
    --filters Name=owner-id,Values=123456789012 \
    --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime<='2024-03-31')].[SnapshotId]" \
    --output text
```

The following example displays the IDs of all snapshots created in the specified date range.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
    --filters Name=owner-id,Values=123456789012 \
    --query "Snapshots[?(StartTime>='2024-01-01') && (StartTime<='2024-12-31')].[SnapshotId]" \
    --output text
```

###### Example: Filter based on tags

For examples of how to filter a list of resources according to their tags, see [Filter Amazon EC2 resources by tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/filtering-the-list-by-tag.html).

PowerShell

###### Example: Specify a single filter

You can list your Amazon EC2 instances using [Get-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html). Without filters, the response
contains information for all of your resources. You can use the following
parameter to include only the running instances in the output.

```powershell

-Filter @{Name="instance-state-name"; Values="running"}
```

The following example lists only the instance IDs for your running instances.

```powershell

(Get-EC2Instance -Filter @{Name="instance-state-name"; Values="stopped"}).Instances | Select InstanceId
```

###### Example: Specify multiple filters or filter values

If you specify multiple filters or multiple filter values, the resource must
match all filters to be included in the results.

You can use the following option to list all instances whose type is either
`m5.large` or `m5d.large`.

```powershell

-Filter @{Name="instance-type"; Values="m5.large", "m5d.large"}
```

You can use the following option to list all stopped instances whose type is
`t2.micro`.

```powershell

-Filter @{Name="instance-state-name"; Values="stopped"}, @{Name="instance-type"; Values="t2.micro"}
```

## View resources across Regions using Amazon EC2 Global View

Amazon EC2 Global View enables you to view and search for Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC resources
in a single AWS Region, or across multiple Regions simultaneously in a single
console. For more information, see [View resources across Regions using AWS Global View](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/global-view.html).
