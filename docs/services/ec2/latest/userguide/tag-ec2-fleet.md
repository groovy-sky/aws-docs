# Tag a new or existing EC2 Fleet request and the instances and volumes it launches
<a name="tag-ec2-fleet"></a>

To help categorize and manage your EC2 Fleet requests and the instances and volumes that it launches, you can tag them with custom metadata. You can assign a tag to an EC2 Fleet request when you create it, or afterward. Similarly, you can assign a tag to the instances and volumes when they're launched by the fleet, or afterward.

When you tag a fleet request, the instances and volumes that are launched by the fleet are not automatically tagged. You need to explicitly tag the instances and volumes launched by the fleet. You can choose to assign tags to only the fleet request, or to only the instances launched by the fleet, or to only the volumes attached to the instances launched by the fleet, or to only the network interfaces created by the fleet, or to all of them.

**Note**
For `instant` fleet types, you can tag volumes that are attached to On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances. You can also tag network interfaces for `instant` fleet types. For `request` or `maintain` fleet types, you can only tag volumes that are attached to On-Demand Instances.

For more information about how tags work, see [Tag your Amazon EC2 resources](Using_Tags.md).

**Prerequisite**

Grant the user the permission to tag resources. For more information, see [Example: Tag resources](ExamplePolicies_EC2.md#iam-example-taggingresources).

**To grant a user the permission to tag resources**
Create a IAM policy that includes the following:
+ The `ec2:CreateTags` action. This grants the user permission to create tags.
+ The `ec2:CreateFleet` action. This grants the user permission to create an EC2 Fleet request.
+ For `Resource`, we recommend that you specify `"*"`. This allows users to tag all resource types.

To provide access, add permissions to your users, groups, or roles:
+ Users and groups in AWS IAM Identity Center:

  Create a permission set. Follow the instructions in [Create a permission set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//singlesignon/latest/userguide/howtocreatepermissionset.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide*.
+ Users managed in IAM through an identity provider:

  Create a role for identity federation. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for a third-party identity provider (federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
+ IAM users:
  + Create a role that your user can assume. Follow the instructions in [Create a role for an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
  + (Not recommended) Attach a policy directly to a user or add a user to a user group. Follow the instructions in [Adding permissions to a user (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console) in the *IAM User Guide*.

**To tag a new EC2 Fleet request**
To tag an EC2 Fleet request when you create it, specify the key-value pair in the [JSON file](create-ec2-fleet.md#ec2-fleet-cli-skeleton) used to create the fleet. The value for `ResourceType` must be `fleet`. If you specify another value, the fleet request fails.

**To tag instances and volumes launched by an EC2 Fleet**
To tag instances and volumes when they are launched by the fleet, specify the tags in the [launch template](create-launch-template.md) that is referenced in the EC2 Fleet request.

**Note**
You can't tag volumes attached to Spot Instances that are launched by a `request` or `maintain` fleet type.

**To tag an existing EC2 Fleet request, instance, and volume**
Use the [create-tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-tags.html) command to tag existing resources.

```
aws ec2 create-tags \
    --resources {{fleet-12a34b55-67cd-8ef9-ba9b-9208dEXAMPLE}} {{i-1234567890abcdef0}} {{vol-1234567890EXAMPLE}} \
    --tags Key={{purpose}},Value={{test}}
```
