# Use Capacity Rebalancing in EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet to replace at-risk Spot Instances

With Capacity Rebalancing, your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet can maintain the desired Spot capacity by
proactively replacing Spot Instances at risk of interruption. When a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk
of interruption, Amazon EC2 sends a [rebalance\
recommendation](rebalance-recommendations.md). If Capacity Rebalancing is enabled, the rebalance
recommendation triggers the launch of a new Spot Instance before the at-risk instance is
interrupted.

Capacity Rebalancing helps you maintain workload availability by proactively
augmenting your fleet with new Spot Instances before running instances are interrupted by
Amazon EC2.

###### To configure EC2 Fleet to use Capacity Rebalancing to launch a replacement Spot Instance

Use the [create-fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-fleet.html)
command and the relevant parameters in the
`MaintenanceStrategies` structure. For an example JSON configuration,
see [Example 7: Configure Capacity Rebalancing to launch replacement Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-examples.html#ec2-fleet-config8).

###### To configure Spot Fleet to use Capacity Rebalancing to launch a replacement Spot Instance

You can use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI to configure Capacity
Rebalancing.

(Console) When creating the Spot Fleet, select the **Capacity rebalance**
checkbox. For more information, see step 6.d. in [Create a Spot Fleet request using defined parameters](create-spot-fleet.md#create-spot-fleet-advanced).

(AWS CLI) Use the [request-spot-fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-fleet.html)
command and the relevant parameters in the `SpotMaintenanceStrategies`
structure. For an example JSON configuration, see [Example 8: Configure Capacity Rebalancing to launch replacement Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-examples.html#fleet-config8).

## Limitations

- Capacity Rebalancing is available only for fleets of type
`maintain`.

- When the fleet is running, you can't modify the Capacity Rebalancing
setting. To change the Capacity Rebalancing setting, you must delete the
fleet and create a new fleet.

## Configuration options

The `ReplacementStrategy` for EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet supports the following two
values:

`launch-before-terminate`

Amazon EC2 terminates the Spot Instances that receive a rebalance notification after
new replacement Spot Instances are launched. When you specify
`launch-before-terminate`, you must also specify a value
for `termination-delay`. After the new replacement instances
are launched, Amazon EC2 waits for the duration of the
`termination-delay`, and then terminates the old
instances. For `termination-delay`, the minimum is 120
seconds (2 minutes), and the maximum is 7200 seconds (2 hours).

We recommend that you use `launch-before-terminate` only if
you can predict how long your instance shutdown procedures will take to
complete. This will ensure that the old instances are terminated only
after the shutdown procedures are completed. Note that Amazon EC2 can
interrupt the old instances with a two-minute warning before the
`termination-delay`.

We strongly recommend against using the `lowest-price`
(EC2 Fleet) or `lowestPrice` (Spot Fleet) allocation strategy in
combination with `launch-before-terminate` to avoid having
replacement Spot Instances that are also at an elevated risk of
interruption.

`launch`

Amazon EC2 launches replacement Spot Instances when a rebalance notification is
emitted for existing Spot Instances. Amazon EC2 does not terminate the instances that
receive a rebalance notification. You can terminate the old instances,
or you can leave them running. You are charged for all instances while
they are running.

## Considerations

If you configure an EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet for Capacity Rebalancing, consider the
following:

**Provide as many Spot capacity pools in the request**
**as possible**

Configure your fleet to use multiple instance types and Availability
Zones. This provides the flexibility to launch Spot Instances in various Spot
capacity pools. For more information, see [Be flexible about instance types and Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html#be-instance-type-flexible).

**Avoid an elevated risk of interruption of**
**replacement Spot Instances**

To avoid an elevated risk of interruption, we recommend the
`capacity-optimized` or
`capacity-optimized-prioritized` allocation strategy.
These strategies ensure that replacement Spot Instances are launched in the most
optimal Spot capacity pools, and are therefore less likely to be
interrupted in the near future. For more information, see [Use the price and capacity optimized allocation strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html#use-capacity-optimized-allocation-strategy).

If you use the `lowest-price` allocation strategy, your
replacement Spot Instances might be at an elevated risk of interruption. This is
because Amazon EC2 will always launch instances in the lowest priced pool
that has available capacity at that moment, even if your replacement
Spot Instances are likely to be interrupted soon after being launched.

**Amazon EC2 will only launch a new instance if**
**availability is the same or better**

One of the goals of Capacity Rebalancing is to improve a Spot Instance's
availability. If an existing Spot Instance receives a rebalance recommendation,
Amazon EC2 will only launch a new instance if the new instance provides the
same or better availability than the existing instance. If the risk of
interruption of a new instance will be worse than the existing instance,
then Amazon EC2 will not launch a new instance. Amazon EC2 will, however, continue
to assess the Spot capacity pools, and will launch a new instance if
availability improves.

There is a chance that your existing instance will be interrupted
without Amazon EC2 proactively launching a new instance. When this happens,
Amazon EC2 will attempt to launch a new instance regardless of whether the
new instance has a high risk of interruption.

**Capacity Rebalancing does not increase your Spot Instance**
**interruption rate**

When you enable Capacity Rebalancing, it does not increase your [Spot Instance interruption rate](spot-interruptions.md) (the
number of Spot Instances that are reclaimed when Amazon EC2 needs the capacity back).
However, if Capacity Rebalancing detects an instance is at risk of
interruption, Amazon EC2 will immediately attempt to launch a new instance.
The result is that more instances might be replaced than if you’d waited
for Amazon EC2 to launch a new instance after the at-risk instance was
interrupted.

While you might replace more instances with Capacity Rebalancing
enabled, you benefit from being proactive rather than reactive by having
more time to take action before your instances are interrupted. With a
[Spot Instance interruption\
notice](spot-instance-termination-notices.md), you typically only have up to two minutes to
gracefully shut down your instance. With Capacity Rebalancing launching
a new instance in advance, you give existing processes a better chance
of completing on your at-risk instance, you can start your instance
shutdown procedures, and prevent new work from being scheduled on your
at-risk instance. You can also start preparing the newly-launched
instance to take over the application. With Capacity Rebalancing’s
proactive replacement, you benefit from graceful continuity.

As a theoretical example to demonstrate the risks and benefits of
using Capacity Rebalancing, consider the following scenario:

- 2:00 PM – A rebalance recommendation is received for
instance-A, and Amazon EC2 immediately starts attempting to launch a
replacement instance-B, giving you time to start your shutdown
procedures.\*

- 2:30 PM – A rebalance recommendation is received for
instance-B, replaced with instance-C, giving you time to start
your shutdown procedures.\*

- 2:32 PM – If Capacity Rebalancing wasn’t enabled, and
if a Spot Instance interruption notice would've been received at 2:32 PM
for instance-A, you would only have had up to two minutes to
take action, but Instance-A would have been running up till this
time.

\\* If `launch-before-terminate` is specified, Amazon EC2 will
terminate the at-risk instance after the replacement instance comes
online.

**Amazon EC2 can launch new replacement Spot Instances until**
**fulfilled capacity is double target capacity**

When a fleet is configured for Capacity Rebalancing, the fleet
attempts to launch a new replacement Spot Instance for every Spot Instance that receives a
rebalance recommendation. After a Spot Instance receives a rebalance
recommendation, it is no longer counted as part of the fulfilled
capacity. Depending on the replacement strategy, Amazon EC2 either terminates
the instance after a preconfigured termination delay, or leaves it
running. This gives you the opportunity to perform [rebalancing actions](rebalance-recommendations.md#rebalancing-actions) on the
instance.

If your fleet reaches double its target capacity, it stops launching
new replacement instances even if the replacement instances themselves
receive a rebalance recommendation.

For example, you create a fleet with a target capacity of 100 Spot Instances.
All of the Spot Instances receive a rebalance recommendation, which causes Amazon EC2
to launch 100 replacement Spot Instances. This raises the number of fulfilled
Spot Instances to 200, which is double the target capacity. Some of the
replacement instances receive a rebalance recommendation, but no more
replacement instances are launched because the fleet can't exceed double
its target capacity.

Note that you are charged for all of the instances while they are
running.

**We recommend that you configure your fleet to**
**terminate Spot Instances that receive a rebalance**
**recommendation**

If you configure your fleet for Capacity Rebalancing, we recommend
that you choose `launch-before-terminate` with an appropriate
termination delay only if you can predict how long your instance
shutdown procedures will take to complete. This will ensure that the old
instances are terminated only after the shutdown procedures are
completed.

If you choose to terminate the instances that are recommended for
rebalance yourself, we recommend that you monitor the rebalance
recommendation signal that is received by the Spot Instances in the fleet. By
monitoring the signal, you can quickly perform [rebalancing actions](rebalance-recommendations.md#rebalancing-actions) on the
affected instances before Amazon EC2 interrupts them, and then you can
manually terminate them. If you do not terminate the instances, you
continue paying for them while they are running. Amazon EC2 does not
automatically terminate the instances that receive a rebalance
recommendation.

You can set up notifications using Amazon EventBridge or instance metadata. For
more information, see [Monitor rebalance recommendation signals](rebalance-recommendations.md#monitor-rebalance-recommendations).

**The fleet does not count instances that receive a**
**rebalance recommendation when calculating fulfilled capacity during**
**scale in or out**

If your fleet is configured for Capacity Rebalancing, and you change
the target capacity to either scale in or scale out, the fleet does not
count the instances that are marked for rebalance as part of the
fulfilled capacity, as follows:

- Scale in – If you decrease your desired target
capacity, Amazon EC2 terminates instances that are not marked for
rebalance until the desired capacity is reached. The instances
that are marked for rebalance are not counted towards the
fulfilled capacity.

For example, you create a fleet with a target capacity of 100
Spot Instances. 10 instances receive a rebalance recommendation, so Amazon EC2
launches 10 new replacement instances, resulting in a fulfilled
capacity of 110 instances. You then reduce the target capacity
to 50 (scale in), but the fulfilled capacity is actually 60
instances because the 10 instances that are marked for rebalance
are not terminated by Amazon EC2. You need to manually terminate
these instances, or you can leave them running.

- Scale out – If you increase your desired target
capacity, Amazon EC2 launches new instances until the desired
capacity is reached. The instances that are marked for rebalance
are not counted towards the fulfilled capacity.

For example, you create a fleet with a target capacity of 100
Spot Instances. 10 instances receive a rebalance recommendation, so the
fleet launches 10 new replacement instances, resulting in a
fulfilled capacity of 110 instances. You then increase the
target capacity to 200 (scale out), but the fulfilled capacity
is actually 210 instances because the 10 instances that are
marked for rebalance are not counted by the fleet as part of the
target capacity. You need to manually terminate these instances,
or you can leave them running.
