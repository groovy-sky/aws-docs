# Associate an Elastic IP address with an instance

After you allocate an Elastic IP address, you can associate it with an AWS resource,
such as an EC2 instance, NAT gateway, or Network Load Balancer. To associate an Elastic IP address with
a different AWS resource later on, you can disassociate it from its current resource
and then associated it with the new resource.

## Allocate an Elastic IP address

You can allocate an Elastic IP address for use in a Region. There is a charge for all
Elastic IP addresses whether they are in use (associated with a resource, like an EC2 instance)
or idle (created in your account but unassociated).

Console

###### To allocate an Elastic IP address

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Network & Security**,
    **Elastic IPs**.

3. Choose **Allocate Elastic IP address**.

4. (Optional) When you allocate an Elastic IP address (EIP), you
    choose the **Network border group** in which to
    allocate the EIP. A network border group is a collection of
    Availability Zones (AZs), Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from
    which AWS advertises a public IP address. Local Zones and
    Wavelength Zones may have different network border groups than
    the AZs in a Region to ensure minimum latency or physical
    distance between the AWS network and the customers accessing
    the resources in these Zones.

###### Important

You must allocate an EIP in the same network border group
as the AWS resource that will be associated with the EIP.
An EIP in one network border group can only be advertised in
zones in that network border group and not in any other
zones represented by other network border groups.

If you have Local Zones or Wavelength Zones enabled (for more
    information, see [Enable a Local Zone](../../../local-zones/latest/ug/getting-started.md#getting-started-find-local-zone) or [Enable Wavelength Zones](../../../wavelength/latest/developerguide/get-started-wavelength.md#enable-zone-group)), you can choose a network
    border group for AZs, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones. Choose
    the network border group carefully as the EIP and the AWS
    resource it is associated with must reside in the same network
    border group. You can use the EC2 console to view the network
    border group that your Availability Zones, Local Zones, or
    Wavelength Zones are in. Typically, all Availability Zones in
    a Region belong to the same network border group, whereas Local
    Zones or Wavelength Zones belong to their own separate network
    border groups.

If you don't have Local Zones or Wavelength Zones enabled,
    when you allocate an EIP, the network border group that
    represents all of the AZs for the Region (such as
    `us-west-2`) is predefined for you and you cannot
    change it. This means that the EIP that you allocate to this
    network border group will be advertised in all AZs in the Region
    you're in.

5. For **Public IPv4 address pool**, choose one of the
    following:

- **Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses**—If you want an IPv4
address to be allocated from Amazon's pool of IPv4
addresses.

- **Public IPv4 address that you bring to your AWS**
**account**—If you want to allocate a
non-contiguous (non-sequential) public IPv4 address from
an IP address pool that you have brought to your AWS
account. This option is disabled if you do not have any
IP address pools. For more information about bringing
your own IP address range to your AWS account, see
[Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) to Amazon EC2](ec2-byoip.md).

- **Customer owned pool of IPv4 addresses**—If you want to
allocate an IPv4 address from a pool created from your
on-premises network for use with an AWS Outpost. This
option is disabled if you do not have an AWS
Outpost.

- **Allocate using an IPAM IPv4 pool**: If you want to allocate sequential Elastic IP addresses from a
contiguous public IPv4 block in an IPAM pool. Allocating sequential
Elastic IP addresses can significantly reduce management
overhead for security access control lists and simplify
IP address allocation and tracking for enterprises
scaling on AWS. For more information, see [Allocate sequential Elastic IP addresses from an IPAM pool](../../../vpc/latest/ipam/tutorials-eip-pool.md)
in the _Amazon VPC IPAM User Guide_.

6. (Optional) To add a tag, choose **Add new tag**
    and enter a tag key and a tag value.

AWS CLI

###### To allocate an Elastic IP address

Use the [allocate-address](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-address.md)
AWS CLI command.

In the following example, Amazon EC2 selects an address from Amazon's address pool.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 allocate-address
```

In the following example, Amazon EC2 selects an address from the specified
pool that you brought to AWS using BYOIP.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 allocate-address \
    --public-ipv4-pool ipv4pool-ec2-012345abcdef67890
```

The following example specifies an address from the specified IPv4 IPAM pool.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 allocate-address \
    --ipam-pool-id ipam-pool-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --address 192.0.2.0
```

PowerShell

###### To allocate an Elastic IP address

Use the [New-EC2Address](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2address.md)
cmdlet.

In the following example, Amazon EC2 selects an address from Amazon's address pool.

```powershell

New-EC2Address
```

In the following example, Amazon EC2 selects an address from the specified
pool that you brought to AWS using BYOIP.

```powershell

New-EC2Address `
    -PublicIpv4Pool ipv4pool-ec2-012345abcdef67890
```

The following example specifies an address from the specified IPv4 IPAM pool.

```powershell

New-EC2Address `
    -IpamPoolId ipam-pool-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Address 192.0.2.0
```

## Associate an Elastic IP address

If you're associating an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable
communication with the internet, you must also ensure that your instance is in a
public subnet. For more information, see [Enable internet access using an internet gateway](../../../vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-internet-gateway.md) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.
