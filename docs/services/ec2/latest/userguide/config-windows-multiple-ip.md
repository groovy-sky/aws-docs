# Configure secondary private IPv4 addresses for Windows instances

You can specify multiple private IPv4 addresses for your instances.
After you assign a secondary private IPv4 address to an instance, you must
configure the operating system on the instance to recognize the secondary private IPv4
address.

###### Note

These instructions are based on Windows Server 2022. The implementation of these steps might
vary based on the operating system of the Windows instance.

###### Tasks

- [Prerequisites](#prereq-steps)

- [Step 1: Configure static IP addressing in your instance](#step1)

- [Step 2: Configure a secondary private IP address for your instance](#step2)

- [Step 3: Configure applications to Use the secondary private IP address](#step3)

## Prerequisites

- Assign the secondary private IPv4 address to the network interface for the instance.
You can assign the secondary private IPv4 address when you launch the instance, or after
the instance is running. For more information, see [Assign secondary IP addresses to an instance](instance-secondary-ip-addresses.md#assign-secondary-ip-address).

## Step 1: Configure static IP addressing in your instance

To enable your Windows instance to use multiple IP addresses, you must configure your
instance to use static IP addressing rather than a DHCP server.

###### Important

When you configure static IP addressing in your instance, the IP address must match exactly
what is shown in the console, CLI, or API. If you enter these IP addresses
incorrectly, the instance could become unreachable.

###### To configure static IP addressing on a Windows instance

1. Connect to your instance.

2. Find the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway addresses for the
    instance by performing the following steps:
1. Run the following command in PowerShell:

      ```nohighlight

      ipconfig /all
      ```

      Review the output and note the **IPv4 Address**, **Subnet**
      **Mask**, **Default Gateway**, and
       **DNS Servers** values for the network interface.
       Your output should resemble the following example:

      ```nohighlight

      ...

         NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled
      ```
3. Open the **Network and Sharing Center** by running the following command
    in PowerShell:

```nohighlight

& $env:SystemRoot\system32\control.exe ncpa.cpl
```

4. Open the context (right-click) menu for the network interface (Local Area Connection or
    Ethernet) and choose **Properties**.

5. Choose **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**,
    **Properties**.

6. In the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties** dialog box,
    choose **Use the following IP address**, enter the following values, and
    then choose **OK**.

FieldValue**IP address**The IPv4 address obtained in step 2 above.**Subnet mask**The subnet mask obtained in step 2 above.**Default gateway**The default gateway address obtained in step 2 above.**Preferred DNS server**The DNS server obtained in step 2 above.**Alternate DNS server**The alternate DNS server obtained in step 2 above. If an alternate DNS server was not listed, leave
this field blank.

###### Important

If you set the IP address to any value other than the current IP address,
you will lose connectivity to the instance.

![IP Addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/windows-ip-static.png)

You will lose RDP connectivity to the Windows instance for a few seconds while the
instance converts from using DHCP to static addressing. The instance retains the same IP
address information as before, but now this information is static and not managed by
DHCP.

## Step 2: Configure a secondary private IP address for your instance

After you have set up static IP addressing on your Windows instance, you are ready to
prepare a second private IP address.

###### To configure a secondary IP address

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and select your
     instance.

03. On the **Networking**, note the secondary IP address.

04. Connect to your instance.

05. On your Windows instance, choose **Start**, **Control**
    **Panel**.

06. Choose **Network and Internet**, **Network and Sharing**
    **Center**.

07. Select the network interface (Local Area Connection or Ethernet) and choose
     **Properties**.

08. On the **Local Area Connection Properties** page, choose
     **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**,
     **Properties**, **Advanced**.

09. Choose **Add**.

10. In the **TCP/IP Address** dialog box, type the secondary private IP
     address for **IP address**. For **Subnet**
    **mask**, type the same subnet mask that you entered for the primary
     private IP address in [Step 1: Configure static IP addressing in your instance](#step1), and then
     choose **Add**.

    ![TCP/IP Address dialog box](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/windows-ip-add.png)

11. Verify the IP address settings and choose **OK**.

    ![IP Settings tab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/windows-ip-advanced-tcpip.png)

12. Choose **OK**, **Close**.

13. To confirm that the secondary IP address has been added to the operating system, run
     the `ipconfig /all` command in PowerShell. Your output should
     resemble the following:

    ```nohighlight

    Ethernet adapter Ethernet 4:

       Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
       Description . . . . . . . . . . . : Amazon Elastic Network Adapter #2
       Physical Address. . . . . . . . . : 02-9C-3B-FC-8E-67
       DHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . . . . : No
       Autoconfiguration Enabled . . . . : Yes

       IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 10.200.0.129(Preferred)
       Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
       Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.200.0.1
       DHCPv6 IAID . . . . . . . . . . . : 151166011
       DHCPv6 Client DUID. . . . . . . . : 00-01-00-01-2D-67-AC-FC-12-34-9A-BE-A5-E7
       DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 10.200.0.2
       NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled
    ```

## Step 3: Configure applications to Use the secondary private IP address

You can configure any applications to use the secondary private IP address. For example, if
your instance is running a website on IIS, you can configure IIS to use the secondary
private IP address.

###### To configure IIS to use the secondary private IP address

1. Connect to your instance.

2. Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.

3. In the **Connections** pane, expand
    **Sites**.

4. Open the context (right-click) menu for your website and choose **Edit**
**Bindings**.

5. In the **Site Bindings** dialog box, for **Type**,
    choose **http**, **Edit**.

6. In the **Edit Site Binding** dialog box, for **IP**
**address**, select the secondary private IP address. (By default, each website
    accepts HTTP requests from all IP addresses.)

7. Choose **OK**, **Close**.
