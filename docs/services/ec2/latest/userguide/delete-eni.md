# Delete a network interface
<a name="delete_eni"></a>

Deleting a network interface releases all attributes associated with the interface and releases any private IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses to be used by another instance.

You can't delete a network interface that is in use. First, you must [detach the network interface](network-interface-attachments.md#detach_eni).
