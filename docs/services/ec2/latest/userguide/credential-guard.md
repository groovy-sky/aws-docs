# Credential Guard for Windows instances
<a name="credential-guard"></a>

The AWS Nitro System supports Credential Guard for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Windows instances. Credential Guard is a Windows virtualization-based security (VBS) feature that enables the creation of isolated environments to protect security assets, such as Windows user credentials and code integrity enforcement, beyond Windows kernel protections. When you run EC2 Windows instances, Credential Guard uses the AWS Nitro System to protect Windows login credentials from being extracted from the operating system's memory.

## Prerequisites
<a name="credential-guard-prerequisites"></a>

Your Windows instance must meet the following prerequisites to utilize Credential Guard.

**Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**
The AMI must be preconfigured to enable NitroTPM and UEFI Secure Boot. For more information on supported AMIs, see [Requirements for using NitroTPM with Amazon EC2 instances](enable-nitrotpm-prerequisites.md).

**Memory integrity**
*Memory integrity*, also known as *hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI)* or *hypervisor enforced code integrity*, isn't supported. Before you turn on Credential Guard, you must ensure this feature is disabled. For more information, see [Disable memory integrity](#disable-memory-integrity).

**Instance types**
The following instance types support Credential Guard across all sizes unless noted otherwise: `C5`, `C5d`, `C5n`, `C6i`, `C6id`, `C6in`, `C7i`, `C7i-flex`, `M5`, `M5d`, `M5dn`, `M5n`, `M5zn`, `M6i`, `M6id`, `M6idn`, `M6in`, `M7i`, `M7i-flex`, `R5`, `R5b`, `R5d`, `R5dn`, `R5n`, `R6i`, `R6id`, `R6idn`, `R6in` `R7i`, `R7iz`, `T3`.
+ Though NitroTPM has some required instance types in common, the instance type must be one of the preceding instance types to support Credential Guard.
+ Credential Guard isn't supported for:
  + Bare metal instances.
  + The following instance types: `C7i.48xlarge`, `M7i.48xlarge`, and `R7i.48xlarge`.
For more information about instance types, see the [Amazon EC2 Instance Types Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/instance-types.html).

## Launch a supported instance
<a name="credential-guard-launch-instance"></a>

You can use the Amazon EC2 console or AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to launch an instance which can support Credential Guard. You will need a compatible AMI ID for launching your instance which is unique for each AWS Region.

**Tip**
You can use the following link to discover and launch instances with compatible Amazon provided AMIs in the Amazon EC2 console:
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#Images:visibility=public-images;v=3;search=:TPM-Windows_Server;ownerAlias=amazon](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#Images:visibility=public-images;v=3;search=:TPM-Windows_Server;ownerAlias=amazon)

------
#### [ Console ]

**To launch an instance**
Follow the steps to [launch an instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md), specifying a supported instance type and a preconfigured Windows AMI.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To launch an instance**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command to launch an instance using a supported instance type and preconfigured Windows AMI.

```
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id resolve:ssm:/aws/service/ami-windows-latest/{{TPM-Windows_Server-2022-English-Full-Base}} \
    --instance-type {{c6i.large}} \
    --region {{us-east-1}} \
    --subnet-id {{subnet-0abcdef1234567890}}
    --key-name {{key-name}}
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To launch an instance**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) command to launch an instance using a supported instance type and preconfigured Windows AMI.

```
New-EC2Instance `
    -ImageId resolve:ssm:/aws/service/ami-windows-latest/{{TPM-Windows_Server-2022-English-Full-Base}} `
    -InstanceType {{c6i.large}} `
    -Region {{us-east-1}} `
    -SubnetId {{subnet-0abcdef1234567890}} `
    -KeyName {{key-name}}
```

## Disable memory integrity
<a name="disable-memory-integrity"></a>

You can use the Local Group Policy Editor to disable memory integrity in supported scenarios. The following guidance can be applied for each configuration setting under **Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity**:
+ **Enabled without lock** – Modify the setting to **Disabled** to disable memory integrity.
+ **Enabled with UEFI lock** – Memory integrity has been enabled with UEFI lock. Memory integrity can't be disabled once it has been enabled with UEFI lock. We recommend creating a new instance with memory integrity disabled and terminating the unsupported instance if it's not in use.

**To disable memory integrity with the Local Group Policy Editor**

1. Connect to your instance as a user account with administrator privileges using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). For more information, see [Connect to your Windows instance using an RDP client](connect-rdp.md).

1. Open the Start menu and search for **cmd** to start a command prompt.

1. Run the following command to open the Local Group Policy Editor: `gpedit.msc`

1. In the Local Group Policy Editor, choose **Computer Configuration**, **Administrative Templates**, **System**, **Device Guard**.

1. Select **Turn On Virtualization Based Security**, then select **Edit policy setting**.

1. Open the settings drop-down for **Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity**, choose **Disabled**, then choose **Apply**.

1. Reboot the instance to apply the changes.

## Turn on Credential Guard
<a name="turn-on-credential-guard"></a>

After you have launched a Windows instance with a supported instance type and compatible AMI, and confirmed that memory integrity is disabled, you can turn on Credential Guard.

**Important**
Administrator privileges are required to perform the following steps to turn on Credential Guard.

**To turn on Credential Guard**

1. Connect to your instance as a user account with administrator privileges using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). For more information, see [Connect to your Windows instance using an RDP client](connect-rdp.md).

1. Open the Start menu and search for **cmd** to start a command prompt.

1. Run the following command to open the Local Group Policy Editor: `gpedit.msc`

1. In the Local Group Policy Editor, choose **Computer Configuration**, **Administrative Templates**, **System**, **Device Guard**.

1. Select **Turn On Virtualization Based Security**, then select **Edit policy setting**.

1. Choose **Enabled** within the **Turn On Virtualization Based Security** menu.

1. For **Select Platform Security Level**, choose **Secure Boot and DMA Protection**.

1. For **Credential Guard Configuration**, choose **Enabled with UEFI lock**.
**Note**
The remaining policy settings are not required to enable Credential Guard and can be left as **Not Configured**.

   The following image displays the VBS settings configured as described previously:
![Virtualization Based Security Group Policy Object settings with Turn On Virtualization Based Security enabled.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/vbs-credential-guard-gpo-enabled.png)

1. Reboot the instance to apply the settings.

## Verify that Credential Guard is running
<a name="verify-credential-guard"></a>

You can use the Microsoft System Information (`Msinfo32.exe`) tool to confirm that Credential Guard is running.

**Important**
You must first reboot the instance to finish applying the policy settings required to enable Credential Guard.

**To verify Credential Guard is running**

1. Connect to your instance using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). For more information, see [Connect to your Windows instance using an RDP client](connect-rdp.md).

1. Within the RDP session to your instance, open the Start menu and search for **cmd** to start a command prompt.

1. Open System Information by running the following command: `msinfo32.exe`

1. The Microsoft System Information tool lists the details for VBS configuration. Next to Virtualization-based security Services, confirm that **Credential Guard** appears as **Running**.

   The following image displays VBS is running as described previously:
![An image of the Microsoft System Information Tool with the Virtualization-based security line showing a status of Running, confirming Credential Guard is running.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/vbs-credential-guard-msinfo32-enabled.png)
