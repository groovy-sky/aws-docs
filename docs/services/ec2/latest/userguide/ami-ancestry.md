# Use AMI ancestry to trace the origin of an AMI

AMI ancestry helps you trace the origin of an AMI by returning the IDs and Regions of all
its ancestor AMIs. When you create or copy an AMI, the new AMI retains the ID and Region of
its source (parent) AMI. This enables you to track the chain of AMIs back to the root
AMI.

###### Key benefits

Using AMI ancestry helps you:

- Track AMI derivatives to ensure compliance with internal policies.

- Identify potentially vulnerable AMIs when a security issue is found in an ancestor
AMI.

- Maintain visibility of AMI origins across multiple Regions.

## How AMI ancestry works

AMI ancestry identifies the parent AMI that was used to create the specified AMI, the
parent's parent, and so on, up to the root AMI. Here's how it works:

- Each AMI displays the ID and Region of its source (parent) AMI.

- Starting with your selected AMI, the list of ancestry entries displays each
parent AMI in sequence.

- The list of ancestry entries traces back until it reaches the root AMI. The
root AMI is one of the following:

- A public AMI from a [verified\
provider](sharing-amis.md#verified-ami-provider) (identified by its owner alias, which is either
`amazon` or `aws-marketplace`).

- An AMI with no recorded ancestor. For example, when using [RegisterImage](creating-an-ami-ebs.md#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot)
to create an AMI directly from a set of snapshots, there is no source
AMI to track, unlike when creating an AMI from an instance.

- An AMI whose source AMI is from a different [partition](../../../glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.md#partition).

- The 50th AMI in the list. The maximum number of AMIs in an ancestry
list is 50.

## Considerations

- The ID and Region of the source AMI are only available for AMIs created using
[CreateImage](creating-an-ami-ebs.md#how-to-create-ebs-ami), [CopyImage](copyingamis.md#ami-copy-steps), or [CreateRestoreImageTask](store-restore-how-it-works.md#CreateRestoreImageTask).

- For AMIs created using [CreateImage](creating-an-ami-ebs.md#how-to-create-ebs-ami) (creates an AMI from an instance), the source AMI ID is
the ID of the AMI used to launch the instance.

- The source AMI information is not available for:

- AMIs created using [RegisterImage](creating-an-ami-ebs.md#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot)
because they were created from snapshots.

- For some older AMIs.

- The source AMI information is preserved when:

- AMIs are copied across Regions.

- Source AMIs are deregistered (deleted).

- You don’t have access to the source AMIs.

- Each ancestry list is limited to 50 AMIs.

## View AMI ancestry

You can view an AMI's ancestry using the following methods.

Console

###### To view the ancestry of an AMI

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

3. Select an AMI and choose the **AMI ancestry**
    tab.

4. The **AMI ancestry entries** table lists all the
    AMIs in the ancestry list.

- **AMI ID** – The identifier of
each AMI in the ancestry list. The first entry in the table
is the selected AMI, followed by its ancestors.

- **Source AMI ID** – The ID of the
AMI from which the AMI in the **AMI**
**ID** column was created. A dash
( **-**) indicates the end of the AMI
ancestry list.

- **Source AMI Region** – The
AWS Region where the source AMI is located.

- **Ancestry level** – The position
in the ancestry list, where:

- **0 (input AMI)** indicates the
selected AMI whose ancestry you want to know.

- Increasing numbers show older ancestors.

- **`n` (original**
**AMI)** indicates the root AMI, with the
number indicating how far back the ancestry list
goes.

- **Creation date** – When the AMI
was created, in UTC format.

- **Owner alias** – The alias of the
AMI owner (for example, `amazon`). A dash
( **-**) indicates that the AMI has no
owner alias.

AWS CLI

###### To view the ancestry of an AMI

Use the [get-image-ancestry](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-image-ancestry.md) command and specify the AMI ID.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-image-ancestry \
    --image-id ami-1111111111EXAMPLE \
    --region us-east-1
```

The following is example output. The output lists AMIs in ancestry order:
the first entry is the specified (input) AMI, followed by its parent,
parent's parent, and so on, and ends with the root AMI.

```json

{
    "ImageAncestryEntries": [
        {
            "CreationDate": "2025-01-17T18:37:50.000Z",
            "ImageId": "ami-1111111111EXAMPLE", // Input AMI
            "SourceImageId": "ami-2222222222EXAMPLE",
            "SourceImageRegion": "us-east-1"

        },
        {
            "CreationDate": "2025-01-17T18:37:50.000Z",
            "ImageId": "ami-2222222222EXAMPLE", // Parent AMI
            "SourceImageId": "ami-3333333333EXAMPLE",
            "SourceImageRegion": "us-east-1"
        },
        ...
        {
            "CreationDate": "2025-01-17T18:37:50.000Z",
            "ImageId": "ami-8888888888EXAMPLE", // Root AMI
            "ImageOwnerAlias": "aws-marketplace",
            "SourceImageId": "ami-9999999999EXAMPLE",
            "SourceImageRegion": "us-east-2"
        }
    ]
}
```

PowerShell

###### To view the ancestry of an AMI

Use the [Get-EC2ImageAncestry](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2imageancestry.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

Get-EC2ImageAncestry -ImageId ami-1111111111EXAMPLE
```

The following is example output. The output lists AMIs in ancestry order:
the first entry is the specified (input) AMI, followed by its parent,
parent's parent, and so on, and ends with the root AMI.

```nohighlight

ImageAncestryEntries : {
    @{
        CreationDate = "2025-01-17T18:37:50.000Z"
        ImageId = "ami-1111111111EXAMPLE"    # Input AMI
        SourceImageId = "ami-2222222222EXAMPLE"
        SourceImageRegion = "us-east-1"
    },
    @{
        CreationDate = "2025-01-17T18:37:50.000Z"
        ImageId = "ami-2222222222EXAMPLE"    # Parent AMI
        SourceImageId = "ami-3333333333EXAMPLE"
        SourceImageRegion = "us-east-1"
    },
    ...

## Identify the source AMI

If you only need to identify the immediate parent (source) AMI used to create an AMI,
you can use the following methods.

Console

###### To identify the source AMI used to create the selected AMI

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

3. Select the AMI to view its details.

The source AMI information appears in the following fields:
    **Source AMI ID** and **Source AMI**
**Region**

AWS CLI

###### To identify the source AMI used to create the specified AMI

Use the [describe-images](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-images \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --image-ids ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --query "Images[].{ID:SourceImageId,Region:SourceImageRegion}"
```

The following is example output.

```json

[
    {
        "ID": "ami-0abcdef1234567890",
        "Region": "us-west-2"
    }
}
```

PowerShell

###### To identify the source AMI used to create the specified AMI

Use the [Get-EC2Image](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2image.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

Get-EC2Image -ImageId ami-0abcdef1234567890 | Select SourceImageId, SourceImageRegion
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

SourceImageId           SourceImageRegion
-------------           -----------------
ami-0abcdef1234567890 us-west-2
```
