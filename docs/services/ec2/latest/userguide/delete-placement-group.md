# Delete a placement group
<a name="delete-placement-group"></a>

If you need to replace a placement group or no longer need one, you can delete it. Before you can delete a placement group, it must contain no instances. You can terminate the instances, move them to another placement group, or remove them from the placement group.

You cannot delete a placement group that is a parent of a cluster placement group. Delete the cluster placement groups first.
