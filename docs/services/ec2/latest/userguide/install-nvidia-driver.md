# NVIDIA drivers for your Amazon EC2 instance
<a name="install-nvidia-driver"></a>

An instance with an attached NVIDIA GPU, such as a P- or G- series instance types, must have the appropriate NVIDIA driver installed. Depending on the instance type, you can either download a public NVIDIA driver, download a driver from Amazon S3 that is available only to AWS customers, or use an AWS AMI with the driver pre-installed.

To install AMD drivers on an instance with an attached AMD GPU, such as a G4ad instance, see [AMD drivers](install-amd-driver.md) instead.

## Types of NVIDIA drivers
<a name="nvidia-driver-types"></a>

The following are the main types of NVIDIA drivers that can be used with GPU-based instances.

Tesla drivers
These drivers are intended primarily for compute workloads, which use GPUs for computational tasks such as parallelized floating-point calculations for machine learning and fast Fourier transforms for high performance computing applications.

GRID drivers
These drivers are certified to provide optimal performance for professional visualization applications that render content such as 3D models or high-resolution videos. You can configure GRID drivers to support two modes. Quadro Virtual Workstations provide access to four 4K displays per GPU. GRID vApps provide RDSH App hosting capabilities.

Gaming drivers
These drivers contain optimizations for gaming and are updated frequently to provide performance enhancements. They support a single 4K display per GPU.

**Configured mode**
On Windows, the Tesla drivers are configured to run in Tesla Compute Cluster (TCC) mode. The GRID and gaming drivers are configured to run in Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) mode. In TCC mode, the card is dedicated to compute workloads. In WDDM mode, the card supports both compute and graphics workloads.

**NVIDIA control panel**
The NVIDIA control panel is supported with GRID and Gaming drivers. It is not supported with Tesla drivers.

**Supported APIs for Tesla, GRID, and gaming drivers**
+ OpenCL, OpenGL, and Vulkan
+ NVIDIA CUDA and related libraries (for example, cuDNN, TensorRT, nvJPEG, and cuBLAS)
+ NVENC for video encoding and NVDEC for video decoding
+ Windows-only APIs: DirectX, Direct2D, DirectX Video Acceleration, DirectX Raytracing

## Available drivers by instance type
