# Track ENA Windows driver version releases
<a name="ena-driver-releases-windows"></a>

Windows AMIs include the ENA Windows driver to enable enhanced networking.

For Windows Server versions 2016 and above, we recommend that you use the latest driver version. For earlier versions of Windows Server, refer to the following table to determine which ENA driver version to use.

| Windows Server version | ENA driver version |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | 2.6.0 and earlier |
| Windows Server 2012 | 2.6.0 and earlier |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 | 2.2.3 and earlier |
