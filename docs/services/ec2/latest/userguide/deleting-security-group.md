**Requirements**

#### [ Console ]

**To delete a security group**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**.

   1. Copy the ID of the security group to delete.

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

   1. In the search bar, add **Security group IDs equals** filter and paste the ID of the security group. If there are no results, then the security group is not associated with an instance. Otherwise, you must disassociate the security group before you can delete it.

1. Select the security group and choose **Actions**, **Delete security groups**.
