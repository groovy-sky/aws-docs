# Allow organizations and OUs to use a KMS key
<a name="allow-org-ou-to-use-key"></a>

If you share an AMI that is backed by encrypted snapshots, you must also allow the organizations or organizational units (OUs) to use the KMS keys that were used to encrypt the snapshots.

**Note**
The encrypted snapshots must be encrypted with a *customer managed* key. You can’t share AMIs that are backed by snapshots that are encrypted with the default AWS managed key.

To control access to the KMS key, in the [key policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) you can use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-principalorgid](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-principalorgid) and [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-principalorgpaths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-principalorgpaths) condition keys to allow only specific principals permission to the specified actions. A principal can be a user, IAM role, federated user, or AWS account root user.

The condition keys are used as follows:
+ `aws:PrincipalOrgID` – Allows any principal belonging to the organization represented by the specified ID.
+ `aws:PrincipalOrgPaths` – Allows any principal belonging to the OUs represented by the specified paths.

To give an organization (including the OUs and accounts that belong to it) permission to use a KMS key, add the following statement to the key policy.

```
{
    "Sid": "Allow access for organization root",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": [
        "kms:Describe*",
        "kms:List*",
        "kms:Get*",
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:CreateGrant"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "{{o-123example}}"
        }
    }
}
```

To give specific OUs (and the accounts that belong to it) permission to use a KMS key, you can use a policy similar to the following example.

```
{
        "Sid": "Allow access for specific OUs and their descendants",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": [
            "kms:Describe*",
            "kms:List*",
            "kms:Get*",
            "kms:Encrypt",
            "kms:Decrypt",
            "kms:ReEncrypt*",
            "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
            "kms:CreateGrant"
        ],
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
                "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "{{o-123example}}"
            },
            "ForAnyValue:StringLike": {
                "aws:PrincipalOrgPaths": [
                    "{{o-123example/r-ab12/ou-ab12-33333333/*}}",
                    "{{o-123example/r-ab12/ou-ab12-22222222/*}}"
                ]
            }
        }
}
```
