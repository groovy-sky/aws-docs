# Paravirtual drivers for Windows instances
<a name="xen-drivers-overview"></a>

Windows AMIs contain a set of drivers to permit access to virtualized hardware. These drivers are used by Amazon EC2 to map instance store and Amazon EBS volumes to their devices. The following table shows key differences between the different drivers.

|  | Red Hat PV | Citrix PV | AWS PV |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instance type | Not supported for all instance types. If you specify an unsupported instance type, the instance is impaired. | Supported for Xen instance types. | Supported for Xen instance types. |
| Attached volumes | Supports up to 16 attached volumes. | Supports more than 16 attached volumes. | Supports more than 16 attached volumes. |
| Network | The driver has known issues where the network connection resets under high loads; for example, fast FTP file transfers. |  | The driver automatically configures jumbo frames on the network adapter when on a compatible instance type. When the instance is in a cluster placement group, this offers better network performance between instances that are in the cluster placement group. For more information, see [Placement groups for your Amazon EC2 instances](placement-groups.md). |

The following table shows which PV drivers you should run on each version of Windows Server on Amazon EC2.

| Windows Server version | PV driver version |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Server 2025 | Not supported |

## AWS PV drivers
<a name="xen-driver-awspv"></a>

The AWS PV drivers are stored in the `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\Xentools` directory. This directory also contains public symbols and a command line tool, `xenstore_client.exe`, that enables you to access entries in XenStore. For example, the following PowerShell command returns the current time from the Hypervisor:

```
PS C:\> [DateTime]::FromFileTimeUTC((gwmi -n root\wmi -cl AWSXenStoreBase).XenTime).ToString("hh:mm:ss")
11:17:00
```

The AWS PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`. These driver components are as follows: xenbus, xeniface, xennet, xenvbd, and xenvif.

AWS PV drivers also have a Windows service named LiteAgent, which runs in user-mode. It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from AWS APIs on Xen generation instances. You can access and manage services by running `Services.msc` from the command line. When running on Nitro generation instances, the AWS PV drivers are not used and the LiteAgent service will self-stop starting with driver version 8.2.4. Updating to the latest AWS PV driver also updates the LiteAgent and improves reliability on all instance generations.

### Install the latest AWS PV drivers

| 7.4.2 | Stability fixes for support of X1 instance type. | August 2, 2016 |
| 7.4.1 |  +  Performance improvement in AWS PV Storage driver. <br />+  Stability fixes in AWS PV Storage driver: Fixed an issue where the instances were hitting a system crash with bug check code 0x0000DEAD. <br />+  Stability fixes in AWS PV Network driver. <br />+  Added support for Windows Server 2008R2.   | July 12, 2016 |
| 7.3.2 |  +  Improved logging and diagnostics. <br />+  Stability fix in AWS PV Storage driver. In some cases disks may not surface in Windows after reattaching the disk to the instance. <br />+  Added support for Windows Server 2012.   | June 24, 2015 |
| 7.3.1 | TRIM update: Fix related to TRIM requests. This fix stabilizes instances and improves instance performance when managing large numbers of TRIM requests. |  |
| 7.3.0 | TRIM support: The AWS PV driver now sends TRIM requests to the hypervisor. Ephemeral disks will properly process TRIM requests given the underlying storage supports TRIM (SSD). Note that EBS-based storage does not support TRIM as of March 2015. |  |
| 7.2.5 |  +  Stability fix in AWS PV Storage drivers: In some cases the AWS PV driver could dereference invalid memory and cause a system failure. <br />+  Stability fix while generating a crash dump: In some cases the AWS PV driver could get stuck in a race condition when writing a crash dump. Before this release, the issue could only be resolved by forcing the driver to stop and restart which lost the memory dump.   |  |
| 7.2.4 | Device ID persistence: This driver fix masks the platform PCI device ID and forces the system to always surface the same device ID, even if the instance is moved. More generally, the fix affects how the hypervisor surfaces virtual devices. The fix also includes modifications to the co-installer for the AWS PV drivers so the system persists mapped virtual devices. |  |
| 7.2.2 |  +  Load the AWS PV drivers in Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) mode: Directory Services Restore Mode is a safe mode boot option for Windows Server domain controllers. <br />+  Persist device ID when virtual network adapter device is reattached: This fix forces the system to check the MAC address mapping and persist the device ID. This fix ensures that adapters retain their static settings if the adapters are reattached.   |  |
| 7.2.1 |  +  Run in safe mode: Fixed an issue where the driver would not load in safe mode. Previously the AWS PV Drivers would only instantiate in normal running systems. <br />+  Add disks to Microsoft Windows Storage Pools: Previously we synthesized page 83 queries. The fix disabled page 83 support. Note this does not affect storage pools that are used in a cluster environment because PV disks are not valid cluster disks.   |  |
| 7.2.0 | Base: The AWS PV base version. |  |

## Citrix PV drivers
<a name="xen-driver-citrix"></a>

The Citrix PV drivers are stored in the `%ProgramFiles%\Citrix\XenTools` (32-bit instances) or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Citrix\XenTools` (64-bit instances) directory.

The Citrix PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services`. These driver components are as follows: xenevtchn, xeniface, xennet, Xennet6, xensvc, xenvbd, and xenvif.

Citrix also has a driver component named XenGuestAgent, which runs as a Windows service. It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from the API. You can access and manage services by running `Services.msc` from the command line.

If you are encountering networking errors while performing certain workloads, you may need to disable the TCP offloading feature for the Citrix PV driver. For more information, see [TCP offloading](pvdrivers-troubleshooting.md#citrix-tcp-offloading).

## Red Hat PV drivers
<a name="xen-driver-redhat"></a>

Red Hat drivers are supported for legacy instances, but are not recommended on newer instances with more than 12GB of RAM due to driver limitations. Instances with more than 12GB of RAM running Red Hat drivers can fail to boot and become inaccessible. We recommend upgrading Red Hat drivers to Citrix PV drivers, and then upgrade Citrix PV drivers to AWS PV drivers.

The source files for the Red Hat drivers are in the `%ProgramFiles%\RedHat` (32-bit instances) or `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\RedHat` (64-bit instances) directory. The two drivers are `rhelnet`, the Red Hat Paravirtualized network driver, and `rhelscsi`, the Red Hat SCSI miniport driver.
