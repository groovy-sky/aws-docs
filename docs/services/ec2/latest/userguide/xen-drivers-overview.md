# Paravirtual drivers for Windows instances

Windows AMIs contain a set of drivers to permit access to virtualized hardware. These
drivers are used by Amazon EC2 to map instance store and Amazon EBS volumes to their devices. The
following table shows key differences between the different drivers.

Red Hat PVCitrix PVAWS PV

Instance type

Not supported for all instance types. If you specify an unsupported
instance type, the instance is impaired.

Supported for Xen instance types.

Supported for Xen instance types.

Attached volumes

Supports up to 16 attached volumes.

Supports more than 16 attached volumes.

Supports more than 16 attached volumes.

Network

The driver has known issues where the network connection resets under
high loads; for example, fast FTP file transfers.

The driver automatically configures jumbo frames on the network
adapter when on a compatible instance type. When the instance is in a
cluster placement group, this offers better network performance between
instances that are in the cluster placement group. For more information,
see [Placement groups for your Amazon EC2 instances](placement-groups.md).

The following table shows which PV drivers you should run on each version of Windows
Server on Amazon EC2.

## AWS PV drivers

The AWS PV drivers are stored in the
`%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\Xentools` directory. This directory also
contains public symbols and a command line tool,
`xenstore_client.exe`, that enables you to access entries in
XenStore. For example, the following PowerShell command returns the current time from
the Hypervisor:

```powershell

PS C:\> [DateTime]::FromFileTimeUTC((gwmi -n root\wmi -cl AWSXenStoreBase).XenTime).ToString("hh:mm:ss")
11:17:00
```

The AWS PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`. These
driver components are as follows: xenbus, xeniface, xennet, xenvbd, and xenvif.

AWS PV drivers also have a Windows service named LiteAgent, which runs in user-mode.
It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from AWS APIs on Xen generation
instances. You can access and manage services by running
`Services.msc` from the command line. When running on Nitro
generation instances, the AWS PV drivers are not used and the LiteAgent service will
self-stop starting with driver version 8.2.4. Updating to the latest AWS PV driver
also updates the LiteAgent and improves reliability on all instance generations.

### Install the latest AWS PV drivers

Amazon Windows AMIs contain a set of drivers to permit access to virtualized
hardware. These drivers are used by Amazon EC2 to map instance store and Amazon EBS volumes to
their devices. We recommend that you install the latest drivers to improve stability
and performance of your EC2 Windows instances.

###### Installation options

- Use AWS Systems Manager to automatically update the PV drivers. For more
information, see [Walkthrough:\
Automatically Update PV Drivers on EC2 Windows Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-update-pv-drivers.html) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

- [Download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/AWSPV/Latest/AWSPVDriver.zip)

the driver package and run the install program
manually. Be sure to check the `readme.txt` file for
system requirements. For information about downloading and installing the
AWS PV drivers, or upgrading a domain controller, see [Upgrade Windows Server instances (AWS PV upgrade) manually](upgrading-pv-drivers.md#aws-pv-upgrade).

\*AWS PV driver version 7.4.3's signature expires on March
29, 2019. We recommend updating to the latest AWS PV driver.

18 Nov 2016

7.4.2

Stability fixes for support of X1 instance
type.

2 Aug 2016

7.4.1

- Performance improvement in AWS PV Storage
driver.

- Stability fixes in AWS PV Storage driver: Fixed an
issue where the instances were hitting a system crash
with bug check code 0x0000DEAD.

- Stability fixes in AWS PV Network driver.

- Added support for Windows Server 2008R2.

12 July 2016

7.3.2

- Improved logging and diagnostics.

- Stability fix in AWS PV Storage driver. In some
cases disks may not surface in Windows after reattaching
the disk to the instance.

- Added support for Windows Server 2012.

24 June 2015

7.3.1

TRIM update: Fix related to TRIM requests. This fix stabilizes
instances and improves instance performance when managing large
numbers of TRIM requests.

7.3.0

TRIM support: The AWS PV driver now sends TRIM requests to
the hypervisor. Ephemeral disks will properly process TRIM
requests given the underlying storage supports TRIM (SSD). Note
that EBS-based storage does not support TRIM as of March
2015.

7.2.5

- Stability fix in AWS PV Storage drivers: In some
cases the AWS PV driver could dereference invalid
memory and cause a system failure.

- Stability fix while generating a crash dump: In some
cases the AWS PV driver could get stuck in a race
condition when writing a crash dump. Before this
release, the issue could only be resolved by forcing the
driver to stop and restart which lost the memory
dump.

7.2.4

Device ID persistence: This driver fix masks the platform PCI
device ID and forces the system to always surface the same
device ID, even if the instance is moved. More generally, the
fix affects how the hypervisor surfaces virtual devices. The fix
also includes modifications to the co-installer for the AWS PV
drivers so the system persists mapped virtual devices.

7.2.2

- Load the AWS PV drivers in Directory Services
Restore Mode (DSRM) mode: Directory Services Restore
Mode is a safe mode boot option for Windows Server
domain controllers.

- Persist device ID when virtual network adapter device
is reattached: This fix forces the system to check the
MAC address mapping and persist the device ID. This fix
ensures that adapters retain their static settings if
the adapters are reattached.

7.2.1

- Run in safe mode: Fixed an issue where the driver
would not load in safe mode. Previously the AWS PV
Drivers would only instantiate in normal running
systems.

- Add disks to Microsoft Windows Storage Pools:
Previously we synthesized page 83 queries. The fix
disabled page 83 support. Note this does not affect
storage pools that are used in a cluster environment
because PV disks are not valid cluster disks.

7.2.0

Base: The AWS PV base version.

## Citrix PV drivers

The Citrix PV drivers are stored in the
`%ProgramFiles%\Citrix\XenTools` (32-bit instances) or
`%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Citrix\XenTools` (64-bit instances)
directory.

The Citrix PV driver components are listed in the Windows registry under
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services`. These
driver components are as follows: xenevtchn, xeniface, xennet, Xennet6, xensvc, xenvbd,
and xenvif.

Citrix also has a driver component named XenGuestAgent, which runs as a Windows
service. It handles tasks such as shutdown and restart events from the API. You can
access and manage services by running `Services.msc` from the command
line.

If you are encountering networking errors while performing certain workloads, you may
need to disable the TCP offloading feature for the Citrix PV driver. For more
information, see [TCP offloading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/pvdrivers-troubleshooting.html#citrix-tcp-offloading).

## Red Hat PV drivers

Red Hat drivers are supported for legacy instances, but are not recommended on newer
instances with more than 12GB of RAM due to driver limitations. Instances with more than
12GB of RAM running Red Hat drivers can fail to boot and become inaccessible. We
recommend upgrading Red Hat drivers to Citrix PV drivers, and then upgrade Citrix PV
drivers to AWS PV drivers.

The source files for the Red Hat drivers are in the
`%ProgramFiles%\RedHat` (32-bit instances) or
`%ProgramFiles(x86)%\RedHat` (64-bit instances) directory. The
two drivers are `rhelnet`, the Red Hat Paravirtualized network
driver, and `rhelscsi`, the Red Hat SCSI miniport driver.
