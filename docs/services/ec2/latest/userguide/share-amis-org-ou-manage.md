# Manage AMI sharing with an organization or OU
<a name="share-amis-org-ou-manage"></a>

You can manage AMI sharing with organizations and organization units (OU) to control whether they can launch Amazon EC2 instances.

## View the organizations and OUs with which an AMI is shared
<a name="decribe-ami-launch-permissions"></a>

You can find the organizations and OUs with which you've shared your AMI.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To check with which organizations and OUs you've shared your AMI**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

1. Select your AMI in the list, choose the **Permissions** tab, and scroll down to **Shared organizations/OUs**.

   To find AMIs that are shared with you, see [Find shared AMIs to use for Amazon EC2 instances](usingsharedamis-finding.md).

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To check with which organizations and OUs you've shared your AMI**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-image-attribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-image-attribute.html) command with the `launchPermission` attribute.

```
aws ec2 describe-image-attribute \
    --image-id {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} \
    --attribute launchPermission
```

The following is an example response.

```
{
    "ImageId": "ami-0abcdef1234567890",
    "LaunchPermissions": [
        {
            "OrganizationalUnitArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111122223333:ou/o-123example/ou-1234-5example"
        }
    ]
}
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To check with which organizations and OUs you've shared your AMI**
Use the [Get-EC2ImageAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2ImageAttribute.html) cmdlet.

```
Get-EC2ImageAttribute `
    -ImageId {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} `
    -Attribute launchPermission
```

## Share an AMI with an organization or OU
<a name="share-amis-org-ou"></a>

You can share an AMI with an organization or OU.

**Note**
You do not need to share the Amazon EBS snapshots that an AMI references in order to share the AMI. Only the AMI itself needs to be shared, and the system automatically provides the instance with access to the referenced EBS snapshots for the launch. However, you do need to share the KMS keys used to encrypt snapshots that the AMI references. For more information, see [Allow organizations and OUs to use a KMS key](allow-org-ou-to-use-key.md).

#### [ Console ]

**To share an AMI with an organization or an OU**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **AMIs**.

1. Select your AMI in the list, and then choose **Actions**, **Edit AMI permissions**.

1. Under **AMI availability**, choose **Private**.

1. Next to **Shared organizations/OUs**, choose **Add organization/OU ARN**.

1. For **Organization/OU ARN**, enter the organization ARN or OU ARN with which you want to share the AMI, and then choose **Share AMI**. Note that you must specify the full ARN, not just the ID.

   To share this AMI with multiple organizations or OUs, repeat this step until you have added all of the required organizations or OUs.

1. Choose **Save changes** when you're done.

1. (Optional) To view the organizations or OUs with which you have shared the AMI, select the AMI in the list, choose the **Permissions** tab, and scroll down to **Shared organizations/OUs**. To find AMIs that are shared with you, see [Find shared AMIs to use for Amazon EC2 instances](usingsharedamis-finding.md).

#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To share an AMI with an organization**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-image-attribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-image-attribute.html) command to grant launch permissions for the specified AMI to the specified organization.

```
aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
    --image-id {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} \
    --launch-permission "Add=[{OrganizationArn=arn:aws:organizations::{{123456789012}}:organization/{{o-123example}}}]"
```

**To share an AMI with an OU**
The [modify-image-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-image-attribute.html) command grants launch permissions for the specified AMI to the specified OU. Note that you must specify the full ARN, not just the ID.

```
aws ec2 modify-image-attribute \
    --image-id {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} \
    --launch-permission "Add=[{OrganizationalUnitArn=arn:aws:organizations::{{123456789012}}:ou/{{o-123example}}/{{ou-1234-5example}}}]"
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2ImageAttribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2ImageAttribute.html) command (Tools for Windows PowerShell) to share an AMI as shown in the following examples.

**To share an AMI with an organization or an OU**
The following command grants launch permissions for the specified AMI to the specified organization.

```
Edit-EC2ImageAttribute `
    -ImageId {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} `
    -Attribute launchPermission `
    -OperationType add `
    -OrganizationArn "arn:aws:organizations::{{123456789012}}:organization/{{o-123example}}"
```

**To stop sharing an AMI with an organization or OU**
The following command removes launch permissions for the specified AMI from the specified organization:

```
Edit-EC2ImageAttribute `
    -ImageId {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} `
    -Attribute launchPermission `
    -OperationType remove `
    -OrganizationArn "arn:aws:organizations::{{123456789012}}:organization/{{o-123example}}"
```

**To stop sharing an AMI with all organizations, OUs, and AWS accounts**
The following command removes all public and explicit launch permissions from the specified AMI. Note that the owner of the AMI always has launch permissions and is therefore unaffected by this command.

```
Reset-EC2ImageAttribute `
    -ImageId {{ami-0abcdef1234567890}} `
    -Attribute launchPermission
```

## Stop sharing an AMI with an organization or OU
<a name="stop-sharing-amis-org-ou"></a>

You can stop sharing an AMI with an organization or OU.

**Note**
You can't stop sharing an AMI with a specific account if it's in an organization or OU with which an AMI is shared. If you try to stop sharing the AMI by removing launch permissions for the account, Amazon EC2 returns a success message. However, the AMI continues to be shared with the account.
