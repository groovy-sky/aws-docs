# View resources across Regions using AWS Global View

AWS Global View enables you to view some of your Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC resources across a
single AWS Region, or across multiple Regions in a single console. AWS Global View
also provides _global search_ functionality that lets you search for
specific resources or specific resource types across multiple Regions simultaneously.

AWS Global View does not let you modify resources in any way.

###### To use AWS Global View

Sign in to the [AWS Global View console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2globalview/home).

###### Important

You cannot use a private window in Firefox to access AWS Global View.

The console consists of the following:

- **Region explorer** – This page includes
the following sections:

- **Summary** – Provides a
high-level overview of your resources across all Regions.

Expand **Show all resource summary**
indicates the number of Regions for which your AWS account is enabled.
The remaining fields indicate the number of resources that you currently
have in those Regions. Choose any of the links to view the resources of
that type across all Regions. For example, if the link below the
**Instances** label is **29 in 10 Regions**, it indicates that you
currently have `29` instances across `10` Regions.
Choose the link to view a list of all 29 instances.

- **Region explorer** – Lists all
of the AWS Regions (including those for which your account is not
enabled) and provides totals for each resource type for each
Region.

Choose a Region name to view all resources of all types for that
specific Region. For example, choose **Africa (Cape**
**Town) af-south-1** to view all VPCs, subnets, instances,
security groups, volumes, and Auto Scaling groups in that Region.
Alternatively, select a Region and choose **View**
**resources for selected Region**.

Choose the value for a specific resource type in a specific Region to
view only resources of that type in that Region. For example, choose the
value for Instances for **Africa (Cape Town)**
**af-south-1** to view only the instances in that
Region.

- **Global search** – This page enables you
to search for specific resources or specific resource types across a single
Region or across multiple Regions. It also enables you to view details for a
specific resource.

To search for resources, enter the search criteria in the field preceding the
grid. You can search by Region, by resource type, and by the tags assigned to
resources.

To view the details for a specific resource, select it in the grid. You can
also choose the resource ID of a resource to open it in its respective console.
For example, choose an instance ID to open the instance in the Amazon EC2 console, or
choose a subnet ID to open the subnet in the Amazon VPC console.

- **Regions and Zones** – This page allows
you to view and manage all available Regions, Availability Zones, Local Zones,
and Wavelength Zones.

From the **Regions** tab, you can view all the AWS Regions.
The **Status** column shows the Regions that are enabled for
your AWS account. From this page, you can select a Region to:

- View details of the Region such as the Region code, Geography, and
number of each type of Zone.

You can also view the list of Availability Zones, Local Zones, and
Wavelength Zones and the list of your resources in the Region.

- Enable or disable the Region.

From each zone tab, you can view the list of that zone type. From the **Local Zones** tab, you can opt-in to a Local Zone.

###### Tip

If you only use specific Regions or resource types, you can customize AWS Global
View to display only those Regions and resource types. To customize the displayed
Regions and resource types, in the navigation panel, choose
**Settings**, and then on the **Resources**
and **Regions** tabs, select the Regions and resource types that
you do not want to be displayed in AWS Global View.
