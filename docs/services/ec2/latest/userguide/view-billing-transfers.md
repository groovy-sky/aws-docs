# View billing assignment requests for shared EC2 Capacity Reservations
<a name="view-billing-transfers"></a>

A Capacity Reservation owner can view only the most recent billing assignment request that they initiated. And consumer accounts can view only the most recent billing assignment requests sent to them.

Requests can be viewed for 24 hours after they enter the `cancelled`, `expired`, or `revoked` state. After 24 hours, they can no longer be viewed.
