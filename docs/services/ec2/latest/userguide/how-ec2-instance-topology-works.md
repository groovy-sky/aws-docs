# How Amazon EC2 topology works

The AWS network is arranged in a hierarchy of layers. EC2 instances connect into the
network at or below the third layer, depending on the instance type. An instance's
topology is described by a set of nodes, with one node in each layer of the network. The
node set in the [DescribeInstanceTopology](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-describeinstancetopology.md) or [DescribeCapacityReservationTopology](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-describecapacityreservationtopology.md) API response provides a top-down view
of the network hierarchy, with the bottom node connected to an instance.

###### Note

Some instance types comprise 4 network nodes in a node set representing 4 layers
in the network, while others comprise 3 network nodes representing 3 layers in the
network. For the supported instance types, see [Instance types](ec2-instance-topology-prerequisites.md#inst-net-topology-prereqs-instance-types).

Depending on the type of Capacity Reservation, you might see only 1, 2, or 3 network nodes.

The following diagram provides a visual representation that you can use to understand
EC2 topology. The network nodes are identified as **NN1**
– **NN7**. The numerals **i**, **ii**, and **iii** identify the network layers. The numbers **1**, **2**, **3**, and **4** identify the EC2 instances.
Instances connect to a node in the bottom layer, identified by **iii** in the following diagram. More than one instance can connect to the
same node.

![Graphic representation of the instance topology.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/instance-topology.png)

In this example:

- Instance 1 connects to network node 4 (NN4) in layer iii. NN4 connects to
network node 2 (NN2) in layer ii, and NN2 connects to network node 1 (NN1) in
layer i, which is the top of the network hierarchy in this example. The network
node set comprises NN1, NN2, and NN4, expressed hierarchically from the upper
layers to the bottom layer.

- Instance 2 also connects to network node 4 (NN4). Instance 1 and instance 2
share the same network node set: NN1, NN2, and NN4.

- Instance 3 connects to network node 5 (NN5). NN5 connects to NN2, and NN2
connects to NN1. The network node set for instance 3 is NN1, NN2, and
NN5.

- Instance 4 connects to network node 6 (NN6). Its network node set is NN1, NN3,
and NN6.

When considering the proximity of instances 1, 2, and 3, instances 1 and 2 are closer
to each other because they connect to the same network node (NN4), while instance 3 is
further away because it connects to a different network node (NN5).

When considering the proximity of all the instances in this diagram, instances 1, 2,
and 3 are closer to each other than they are to instance 4 because they share NN2 in
their network node set.

As a general rule, if the network node connected to any two instances is the same,
these instances are physically close to each other, as is the case with instances 1 and
2\. Furthermore, the fewer the number of hops between network nodes, the closer the
instances are to each other. For example, instances 1 and 3 have fewer hops to a common
network node (NN2) than they have to the network node (NN1) they have in common with
instance 4, and are therefore closer to each other than they are to instance 4.

There are no instances running under network node 7 (NN7) in this example, and
therefore the API output won't include NN7.

## How to interpret the DescribeInstanceTopology output

You can describe the instance topology using the [DescribeInstanceTopology](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-describeinstancetopology.md) API. The output provides a hierarchical view
of the underlying network topology for an instance.

The following example output corresponds to the network topology information of
the four instances in the preceding diagram. Comments are included in the example
output for the purposes of this example.

The following information in the output is important to note:

- `NetworkNodes` describes the network node set of a single
instance.

- In each network node set, the network nodes are listed in hierarchical
order from top to bottom.

- The network node that is connected to the instance is the last network
node in the list (the bottom layer).

- To work out which instances are close to each other, first find common
network nodes in the bottom layer. If there are no common network nodes in
the bottom layer, then find common network nodes in the upper layers.

In the following example output, `i-1111111111example` and
`i-2222222222example` are located closest to each other compared to
the other instances in this example because they have the network node
`nn-4444444444example` in common in the bottom layer.

###### Note

The response contains 3 or more network nodes. For information about the
number of network nodes in the response for each supported instance type, see
[Instance types](ec2-instance-topology-prerequisites.md#inst-net-topology-prereqs-instance-types).

## How to interpret the DescribeCapacityReservationTopology output

You can describe the Capacity Reservation topology using the [DescribeCapacityReservationTopology](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-describecapacityreservationtopology.md) API. The output provides a
hierarchical view of the underlying network topology for the reserved
capacity.

The following example output corresponds to the network topology information in
the preceding diagram. Comments are included in the example output for the purposes
of this example.

The following information in the output is important to note:

- `NetworkNodes` describes the network node set of a single
Capacity Reservation.

- In each network node set, the network nodes are listed in hierarchical
order from top to bottom.

- The network node that is connected to the Capacity Reservation is the last network node in
the list (the bottom layer).

- To work out whether Capacity Reservations will be close to each other, first find common
network nodes in the bottom layer in the output. If there are no common
network nodes in the bottom layer, then find common network nodes in the
upper layers.

In the following example output, `cr-1111111111example` is located on
`nn-2222222222example` and `cr-2222222222example` is
located on `nn-3333333333example`. Because the Capacity Reservations are on different
network nodes in `layer ii`, communication from instances in one Capacity Reservation to
instances in the other Capacity Reservation will be inefficient.

###### Note

The response contains 1, 2, or 3 network nodes depending on the type of
Capacity Reservation.

```JSON

{
    "CapacityReservations": [
        {
            "CapacityReservationId": "cr-1111111111example",
            "CapacityBlockId": "null",
            "State": "active",
            "InstanceType": "p4d.24xlarge",
            "NetworkNodes": [
                "nn-1111111111example",      //Corresponds to NN1 - layer i
                "nn-2222222222example"       //Corresponds to NN2 - layer ii
                // Visibility of additional nodes requires an instance launch and
                // the DescribeInstanceTopology API
            ],
            "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a"
        },
        {
            "CapacityReservationId": "cr-2222222222example",
            "CapacityBlockId": "null",
            "State": "active",
            "InstanceType": "trn1.2xlarge",
            "NetworkNodes": [
                "nn-1111111111example",      //Corresponds to NN1 - layer i
                "nn-3333333333example"       //Corresponds to NN3 - layer ii
                // Visibility of additional nodes requires an instance launch and
                // the DescribeInstanceTopology API
            ],
            "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a"
        }

Number of network nodes

Shows all nodes for a running instance. If the instance is in
a Capacity Reservation, the first nodes will match the corresponding Capacity Reservation
topology, followed by additional nodes to connect to the
instance.

Shows a partial set of nodes, which vary based on the Capacity Reservation
state ( `pending` or `active`) and

State

Instances must be in `running` state

Capacity Reservations must be in `pending` or `active`
state

Use cases

- Workload optimization

- Performance tuning

- Runtime topology analysis

- Capacity planning

- Capacity Reservation management (merge/split/assign)
