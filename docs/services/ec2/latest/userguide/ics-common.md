If an instance becomes unreachable during logon, there could be a problem with
your network configuration or Windows Remote Desktop Services. An instance can also
be unresponsive if a process is using large amounts of CPU.

### Network configuration

Use the following information to verify that your AWS, Microsoft Windows,
and local (or on-premises) network configurations aren't blocking access to the
instance.

AWS network configurationConfigurationVerifySecurity group configurationVerify that port 3389 is open for your security group. Verify
you are connecting to the right public IP address. If the
instance was not associated with an Elastic IP, the public IP
changes after the instance stops/starts. For more information,
see [Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer](troubleshoot-connect-windows-instance.md#rdp-issues).VPC configuration (Network ACLs)Verify that the access control list (ACL) for your Amazon VPC is
not blocking access. For information, see [Network\
ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.VPN configurationIf you are connecting to your VPC using a virtual private
network (VPN), verify VPN tunnel connectivity. For more
information, see [Troubleshooting AWS Client VPN: Tunnel connectivity issues to a \
VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/VPNTunnelConnectivityTroubleshooting.html).

Windows network configurationConfigurationVerifyWindows FirewallVerify that Windows Firewall isn't blocking connections to
your instance. Disable Windows Firewall as described in bullet 7
of the remote desktop troubleshooting section, [Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer](troubleshoot-connect-windows-instance.md#rdp-issues). Advanced TCP/IP configuration (Use of static IP)The instance may be unresponsive because you configured a
static IP address. For a VPC, [create\
a network interface](create-network-interface.md) and [attach it to the instance](network-interface-attachments.md#attach_eni).

**Local or on-premises network**
**configuration**

Verify that a local network configuration isn't blocking access. Try to
connect to another instance in the same VPC as your unreachable instance. If you
can't access another instance, work with your local network administrator to
determine whether a local policy is restricting access.

### Remote Desktop Services issues

If the instance can't be reached during logon, there could a problem with
Remote Desktop Services (RDS) on the instance.

###### Tip

You can use the `AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP` runbook to check
and modify various settings that might affect Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
connections. For more information, see [`AWSSupport-TroubleshootRDP`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-troubleshootrdp.html) in the
_AWS Systems Manager Automation runbook reference_.

Remote Desktop Services configurationConfigurationVerifyRDS is runningVerify that RDS is running on the instance. Connect to the
instance using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Services
snap-in ( `services.msc`). In the list of
services, verify that **Remote Desktop**
**Services** is **Running**. If it
isn't, start it and then set the startup type to
**Automatic**. If you can't connect to the
instance by using the Services snap-in, detach the root volume
from the instance, take a snapshot of the volume or create an
AMI from it, attach the original volume to another instance in
the same Availability Zone as a secondary volume, and modify the
[Start](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc959920(v=technet.10)) registry key. When you are finished, reattach
the root volume to the original instance.RDS is enabled

Even if the service is started, it might be disabled.
Detach the root volume from the instance, take a snapshot of
the volume or create an AMI from it, attach the original
volume to another instance in the same Availability Zone as
a secondary volume, and enable the service by modifying the
**Terminal Server** registry key as
described in [Enable Remote Desktop on an EC2 instance with remote registry](troubleshoot-connect-windows-instance.md#troubleshooting-windows-rdp-remote-registry).

When you are finished, reattach the root volume to the
original instance.

### High CPU usage

Check the **CPUUtilization (Maximum)** metric on your
instance by using Amazon CloudWatch. If **CPUUtilization (Maximum)** is
a high number, wait for the CPU to go down and try connecting again. High CPU
usage can be caused by:

- Windows Update

- Security Software Scan

- Custom Startup Script

- Task Scheduler

For more information, see [Get Statistics for a\
Specific Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/US_SingleMetricPerInstance.html) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_. For
additional troubleshooting tips, see [High CPU usage shortly after Windows starts (Windows instances only)](troubleshooting-launch.md#high-cpu-issue).

## Recovery console screen

Console Screenshot Service returned the following.

![Recovery console screenshot.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ts-cs-2.png)

The operating system might boot into the Recovery console and get stuck in this
state if the `bootstatuspolicy` is not set to
`ignoreallfailures`. Use the following procedure to change the
`bootstatuspolicy` configuration to
`ignoreallfailures`.

By default, the policy configuration for public Windows AMIs provided by AWS is
set to `ignoreallfailures`.

1. Stop the unreachable instance.

2. Create a snapshot of the root volume. The root volume is attached to the
    instance as `/dev/sda1`.

Detach the root volume from the unreachable instance, take a snapshot of
    the volume or create an AMI from it, and attach it to another instance in
    the same Availability Zone as a secondary volume.

###### Warning

If your temporary instance and the original instance were launched
using the same AMI, you must complete additional steps or you won't be
able to boot the original instance after you restore its root volume
because of a disk signature collision. If you must create a temporary
instance using the same AMI, to avoid a disk signature collision,
complete the steps in [Disk signature collision](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/win-ts-common-issues.html#disk-signature-collision).

Alternatively, select a different AMI for the temporary instance. For
example, if the original instance uses an AMI for Windows Server 2016,
launch the temporary instance using an AMI for Windows Server
2019.

3. Log in to the instance and run the following command from a command prompt
    to change the `bootstatuspolicy` configuration to
    `ignoreallfailures`.

```nohighlight

bcdedit /store Drive Letter:\boot\bcd /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures
```

4. Reattach the volume to the unreachable instance and start the instance
    again.

## Windows boot manager screen

Console Screenshot Service returned the following.

![Windows Boot Manager Screen.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ts-cs-3.png)

The operating system experienced a fatal corruption in the system file and/or the
registry. When the instance is stuck in this state, you should recover the instance
from a recent backup AMI or launch a replacement instance. If you need to access
data on the instance, detach any root volumes from the unreachable instance, take a
snapshot of those volume or create an AMI from them, and attach them to another
instance in the same Availability Zone as a secondary volume.

## Sysprep screen

Console Screenshot Service returned the following.

![Sysprep Screen.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ts-cs-4.png)

You may see this screen if you did not use the EC2Config Service to call Sysprep
or if the operating system failed while running Sysprep. You can reset the password
using [EC2Rescue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Windows-Server-EC2Rescue.html). Otherwise, see
[Create an Amazon EC2 AMI using Windows Sysprep](ami-create-win-sysprep.md).

## Getting ready screen

Console Screenshot Service returned the following.

![Getting Ready Screen.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ts-cs-5.png)

Refresh the Instance Console Screenshot Service repeatedly to verify that the
progress ring is spinning. If the ring is spinning, wait for the operating system to
start up. You can also check the **CPUUtilization (Maximum)**
metric on your instance by using Amazon CloudWatch to see if the operating system is active.
If the progress ring is not spinning, the instance may be stuck at the boot process.
Reboot the instance. If rebooting does not solve the problem, recover the instance
from a recent backup AMI or launch a replacement instance. If you need to access
data on the instance, detach the root volume from the unreachable instance, take a
snapshot of the volume or create an AMI from it. Then attach it to another instance
in the same Availability Zone as a secondary volume.

## Windows Update screen

Console Screenshot Service returned the following.

![Windows Update Screen.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ts-cs-6.png)

The Windows Update process is updating the registry. Wait for the update to
finish. Do not reboot or stop the instance as this may cause data corruption during
the update.

###### Note

The Windows Update process can consume resources on the server during the
update. If you experience this problem often, consider using faster instance
types and faster EBS volumes.

## Chkdsk

Console Screenshot Service returned the following.

![Chkdsk Screen.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ts-cs-7.png)

Windows is running the chkdsk system tool on the drive to verify file system
integrity and fix logical file system errors. Wait for process to complete.
