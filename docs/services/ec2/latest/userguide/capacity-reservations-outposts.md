# Capacity Reservations on AWS Outposts

AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs,
and tools to customer premises. By providing local access to AWS managed
infrastructure, AWS Outposts enables customers to build and run applications on premises using
the same programming interfaces as in AWS Regions, while using local compute and
storage resources for lower latency and local data processing needs.

An Outpost is a pool of AWS compute and storage capacity deployed at a customer
site. AWS operates, monitors, and manages this capacity as part of an AWS Region.

You can create Capacity Reservations on Outposts that you have created in your account. This allows
you to reserve compute capacity on an Outpost at your site. You create and use Capacity Reservations on
Outposts in the same way that you create and use Capacity Reservations in regular Availability Zones.
The same features and instance matching behavior apply.

You can also share Capacity Reservations on Outposts with other AWS accounts within your
organization using AWS Resource Access Manager. For more information about sharing Capacity Reservations, see [Shared Capacity Reservations](capacity-reservation-sharing.md).

###### Prerequisite

You must have an Outpost installed at your site. For more information, see [Create an Outpost and order Outpost capacity](../../../outposts/latest/userguide/order-outpost-capacity.md) in the _AWS Outposts_
_User Guide_.

**Considerations**

- You can't use Capacity Reservation groups on an Outpost.

###### To use a Capacity Reservation on an Outpost

1. Create a subnet on the Outpost. For more information, see [Create a\
    subnet](../../../outposts/latest/userguide/launch-instance.md#create-subnet) in the _AWS Outposts User Guide_.

2. Create a Capacity Reservation on the Outpost.
1. Open the AWS Outposts console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/outposts/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/outposts/home).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Outposts**, and then
       choose **Actions**, **Create Capacity**
      **Reservation**.

3. Configure the Capacity Reservation as needed and then choose
       **Create**. For more information, see [Create a Capacity Reservation](capacity-reservations-create.md).

      ###### Note

      The **Instance Type** drop-down lists only
      instance types that are supported by the selected Outpost, and the
      **Availability Zone** drop-down lists only the
      Availability Zone with which the selected Outpost is
      associated.
3. Launch an instance into the Capacity Reservation. For **Subnet** choose the
    subnet that you created in Step 1, and for **Capacity Reservation**, select the
    Capacity Reservation that you created in Step 2. For more information, see [Launch\
    an instance on the Outpost](../../../outposts/latest/userguide/launch-instance.md#launch-instances) in the _AWS Outposts User_
_Guide_.
