# Use Amazon FSx with Amazon EC2 instances

The Amazon FSx family of services makes it easy to launch, run, and scale shared storage
powered by popular commercial and open-source file systems. You can use the _new_
_launch instance wizard_ to automatically attach the following types of Amazon FSx
file systems to your Amazon EC2 instances at launch:

- Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP provides fully managed shared storage in the AWS Cloud with the
popular data access and management capabilities of NetApp ONTAP.

- Amazon FSx for OpenZFS provides fully managed cost-effective shared storage powered by
the popular OpenZFS file system.

###### Note

- This functionality is available in the new launch instance wizard only. For
more information, see [Launch an EC2 instance using the launch instance wizard in the console](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md)

- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems can't be
mounted at
launch. You must mount these file systems manually after
launch.

You can choose to mount an existing file system that you created previously, or you can
create a new file system to mount to an instance at launch.

## Security groups and user data script

When you mount an Amazon FSx file system to an instance using the launch instance wizard,
you can choose whether to automatically create and attach the security groups needed to
enable access to the file system, and whether to automatically include the user data
scripts needed to mount the file system and make it available for use.

###### Topics

- [Security groups](#fsx-sg)

- [User data script](#fsx-user-data)

### Security groups

If you choose to automatically create the security groups that are needed to
enable access to the file system, the launch instance wizard creates and attaches
two security groups - one security group is attached to the instance, and the other
is attached to the file system. For more information about the security group
requirements, see [FSx for ONTAP file\
system access control with Amazon VPC](../../../fsx/latest/ontapguide/limit-access-security-groups.md) and [FSx for OpenZFS\
file system access control with Amazon VPC](../../../fsx/latest/openzfsguide/limit-access-security-groups.md).

We add the tag `Name=instance-sg-1` to
the security group that is created and attached to the instance. The value in the
tag is automatically incremented each time the launch instance wizard creates a
security group for Amazon FSx file systems.

The security group includes the following output rules, but no inbound rules.

Outbound rulesProtocol typePort numberDestinationUDP111`file system security group`UDP20001 - 20003`file system security group`UDP4049`file system security group`UDP2049`file system security group`UDP635`file system security group`UDP4045 - 4046`file system security group`TCP4049`file system security group`TCP635`file system security group`TCP2049`file system security group`TCP111`file system security group`TCP4045 - 4046`file system security group`TCP20001 - 20003`file system security group`AllAll`file system security group`

The security group that is created and attached to the file system is tagged with
`Name=fsx-sg-1`. The value in the tag is
automatically incremented each time the launch instance wizard creates a security
group for Amazon FSx file systems.

The security group includes the following rules.

### User data script

If you choose to automatically attach user data scripts, the launch instance wizard adds the
following user data to the instance. This script installs the necessary packages, mounts the
file system, and updates your instance settings so that the file system will automatically
re-mount whenever the instance restarts.

```nohighlight

#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
runcmd:
- yum install -y nfs-utils
- apt-get -y install nfs-common
- svm_id_1=svm_id
- file_system_id_1=file_system_id
- vol_path_1=/vol1
- fsx_mount_point_1=/mnt/fsx/fs1
- mkdir -p "${fsx_mount_point_1}"
- if [ -z "$svm_id_1" ]; then printf "\n${file_system_id_1}.fsx.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com:/${vol_path_1} ${fsx_mount_point_1} nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport,_netdev 0 0\n" >> /etc/fstab; else printf "\n${svm_id_1}.${file_system_id_1}.fsx.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com:/${vol_path_1} ${fsx_mount_point_1} nfs4 nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport,_netdev 0 0\n" >> /etc/fstab; fi
- retryCnt=15; waitTime=30; while true; do mount -a -t nfs4 defaults; if [ $? = 0 ] || [ $retryCnt -lt 1 ]; then echo File system mounted successfully; break; fi; echo File system not available, retrying to mount.; ((retryCnt--)); sleep $waitTime; done;

```

## Mount an Amazon FSx file system at launch

###### To mount a new or existing Amazon FSx file system at launch

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and then choose
    **Launch instance** to open the launch instance
    wizard.

3. In the **Application and OS Images** section, select the AMI to use.

4. In the **Instance type** section, select the instance type.

5. In the **Key pair** section, select an existing key pair or create a new
    one.

6. In the **Network settings** section, do the following:
1. Choose **Edit**.

2. If you want to **mount an existing file**
      **system**, for **Subnet**, choose the file
       system's preferred subnet. We recommend that you launch the instance
       into the same Availability Zone as the file system's preferred subnet to
       optimize performance.

      If you want to **create a new file system** to mount
       to an instance, for **Subnet**, choose the subnet into which to
       launch the instance.

      ###### Important

      You must select a subnet to enable the Amazon FSx functionality in the new launch
      instance wizard. If you do not select a subnet, you will not be able to mount
      an existing file system or create a new one.
7. In the **Storage** section, do the following:
1. Configure the volumes as needed.

2. Expand the **File systems** section and select **FSx**.

3. Choose **Add shared file system**.

4. For **File system**, select the file system to mount.

      ###### Note

      The list displays all Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP and Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file
      systems in your account in the selected Region.

5. To automatically create and attach the security groups needed to enable access to
       the file system, select **Automatically create and attach security groups**.
       If you prefer to create the security groups manually, clear the checkbox. For more
       information, see [Security groups](#fsx-sg).

6. To automatically attach the user data scripts needed to mount the file system, select
       **Automatically mount shared file system by attaching required user data**
      **script**. If you prefer to provide the user data scripts manually, clear
       the checkbox. For more information, see [User data script](#fsx-user-data).
8. In the **Advanced** section, configure the additional instance settings as
    needed.

9. Choose **Launch**.
