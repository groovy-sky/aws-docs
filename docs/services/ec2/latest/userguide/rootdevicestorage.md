# Root volumes for your Amazon EC2 instances

When you launch an instance, we create a _root volume_ for the instance.
The root volume contains the image used to boot the instance. Each instance has a single root
volume. You can add storage volumes to your instances during or after launch.

The AMI that you use to launch an instance determines the type of root volume. You can
launch an instance from either an _Amazon EBS-backed AMI_ (Linux and Windows
instances) or an _Amazon S3-backed AMI_ (Linux instances only). There are
significant differences between what you can do with each type of AMI. For more information
about these differences, see [Root volume type](componentsamis.md#storage-for-the-root-device).

We recommend that you use AMIs backed by Amazon EBS, because these instances launch faster and use
persistent storage.

We reserve specific device names for root volumes. For more information, see
[Device names for volumes on Amazon EC2 instances](device-naming.md).

## Instances with an Amazon EBS root volume

Instances that use Amazon EBS for the root volume automatically have an Amazon EBS volume attached.
When you launch an instance with an Amazon EBS-AMI, we create an Amazon EBS volume for each Amazon EBS
snapshot referenced by the AMI. You can optionally use other Amazon EBS volumes or instance store
volumes, depending on the instance type.

An instance with an EBS root volume can be stopped and later restarted without affecting
data stored in the attached volumes. There are various instance– and volume-related
tasks you can do when an instance with an EBS root volume is in a stopped state. For example,
you can modify the properties of the instance, change its size, or update the kernel it is
using, or you can attach its root volume to a different running instance for debugging or any
other purpose. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volumes](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volumes.md).

###### Limitation

You can't use `st1` or `sc1` EBS volumes as root volumes.

###### Instance failure

If an instance with an EBS root volume fails, you can restore your session by following
one of these methods:

- Stop and then start again (try this method first).

- Automatically snapshot all relevant volumes and create a new AMI. For more information,
see [Create an Amazon EBS-backed AMI](creating-an-ami-ebs.md).

- Attach the volume to the new instance by following these steps:

1. Create a snapshot of the root volume.

2. Register a new AMI using the snapshot.

3. Launch a new instance from the new AMI.

4. Detach the remaining Amazon EBS volumes from the old instance.

5. Reattach the Amazon EBS volumes to the new instance.

## Instances with an instance store root volume (Linux instances only)

###### Note

Windows instances do not support instance store root volumes.

Instances that use instance store for the root volume automatically have one or more
instance store volumes available, with one volume serving as the root volume. When an instance
is launched from an Amazon S3-backed AMI, the AMI is copied to the root volume. Note that you can
optionally use additional instance store volumes, depending on the instance type.

Any data on the instance store volumes persists as long as the instance is running, but
this data is deleted when the instance is terminated (instances with an instance store root
volume do not support the **Stop** action) or if it fails (such as if an
underlying drive has issues). For more information, see [Instance store temporary block storage for EC2 instances](instancestorage.md).

###### Supported instance types

Only the following instance types support an instance store volume as the root volume:
C1, C3, D2, I2, M1, M2, M3, R3, and X1.

###### Instance failure

After an instance with an instance store root volume fails or terminates, it can't be
restored. If you plan to use an instances with an instance store root volume, we highly
recommend that you distribute the data on your instance store volumes across multiple
Availability Zones. You should also back up critical data from your instance store volumes
to persistent storage on a regular basis.
