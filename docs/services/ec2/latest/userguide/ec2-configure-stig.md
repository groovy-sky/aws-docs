# STIG compliance for your EC2 instance
<a name="ec2-configure-stig"></a>

Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are the configuration hardening standards created by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to secure information systems and software. To make your systems compliant with STIG standards, you must install, configure, and test a variety of security settings.

STIGs are applied based on the following vulnerability classifications. When you create a STIG hardened image or apply STIG settings to an existing instance, you can choose which level to apply for hardening. Higher levels include STIG settings from all lower levels. For example, the *High (Category I)* level includes settings from both the Medium and Low categories.

**Compliance levels**
+ **High (Category I)**

  The most severe risk. Includes any vulnerability that can result in loss of confidentiality, availability, or integrity.
+ **Medium (Category II)**

  Includes any vulnerability that can result in loss of confidentiality, availability, or integrity but the risk can be mitigated.
+ **Low (Category III)**

  Includes any vulnerability that degrades measures to protect against loss of confidentiality, availability, or integrity.

Amazon EC2 provides the following methods to create STIG hardened instances:
+ You can launch Windows instances that are pre-configured for STIG hardening from specialized public AWS Windows AMIs. For more information, see [STIG Hardened AWS Windows Server AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/windows-ami-reference/ami-windows-stig.html) in the *AWS Windows AMI reference*.
+ You can create a customized AMI to launch pre-configured instances that are built with EC2 Image Builder STIG hardening components. For more information, see [STIG hardening components](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/ib-stig.html) in the *Image Builder User Guide*.
+ You can use the AWSEC2-ConfigureSTIG Systems Manager command document to apply STIG settings to an existing EC2 instance. The Systems Manager STIG command document scans for misconfigurations and runs a remediation script to install and update the DoD certificates and to remove unnecessary certificates to maintain STIG compliance. There are no additional charges for using the STIG Systems Manager document.
