**Looking for an automated solution?** Instead of following the
manual steps in this user guide, you can build a Spot placement score tracker dashboard that
automatically captures and stores the scores in Amazon CloudWatch. For more information, see
[Guidance for Building a Spot Placement Score Tracker Dashboard on\
AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/building-a-spot-placement-score-tracker-dashboard-on-aws).

## Calculate using instance attributes

###### To calculate a Spot placement score by specifying instance attributes

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Spot Requests**.

03. Choose the down arrow next to **Request Spot Instances** and choose
     **Calculate Spot Placement Score**.

04. Choose **Enter requirements**.

05. For **Target capacity**, enter your desired capacity in
     terms of the number of **instances** or
     **vCPUs**, or the amount of **memory**
    **(MiB)**.

06. For **Instance type requirements**, to specify your
     compute requirements and let Amazon EC2 identify the optimal instance types with
     these requirements, choose **Specify instance attributes that match**
    **your compute requirements**.

07. For **vCPUs**, enter the desired minimum and maximum
     number of vCPUs. To specify no limit, select **No**
    **minimum**, **No maximum**, or both.

08. For **Memory (GiB)**, enter the desired minimum and
     maximum amount of memory. To specify no limit, select **No**
    **minimum**, **No maximum**, or both.

09. For **CPU architecture**, select the required instance
     architecture.

10. (Optional) For **Additional instance attributes**, you
     can optionally specify one or more attributes to express your compute
     requirements in more detail. Each additional attribute adds a further
     constraint to your request. You can omit the additional attributes; when
     omitted, the default values are used. For a description of each attribute
     and their default values, see [get-spot-placement-scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-spot-placement-scores.html).

11. (Optional) To view the instance types with your specified attributes,
     expand **Preview matching instance types**. To exclude
     instance types from being used in the placement evaluation, select the
     instances and then choose **Exclude selected instance**
    **types**.

12. Choose **Load placement scores**, and review the results.

13. (Optional) To display the Spot placement score for specific Regions, for
     **Regions to evaluate**, select the Regions to
     evaluate, and then choose **Calculate placement**
    **scores**.

14. (Optional) To display the Spot placement score for the Availability Zones in the
     displayed Regions, select the **Provide placement scores per**
    **Availability Zone** checkbox. A list of scored Availability
     Zones is useful if you want to launch all of your Spot capacity into a
     single Availability Zone.

15. (Optional) To edit your compute requirements and get a new placement
     score, choose **Edit**, make the necessary adjustments, and
     then choose **Calculate placement scores**.

## Calculate using instance types

###### To calculate a Spot placement score by specifying instance types

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Spot Requests**.

03. Choose the down arrow next to **Request Spot Instances** and
     choose **Calculate Spot Placement Score**.

04. Choose **Enter requirements**.

     **vCPUs**, or the amount of **memory**
    **(MiB)**.

06. For **Instance type requirements**, to specify the
     instance types to use, choose **Manually select instance**
    **types**.

07. Choose **Select instance types**, select the instance
     types to use, and then choose **Select**. To quickly find
     instance types, you can use the filter bar to filter the instance types by
     different properties.

08. Choose **Load placement scores**, and review the results.

09. (Optional) To display the Spot placement score for specific Regions, for
     **Regions to evaluate**, select the Regions to
     evaluate, and then choose **Calculate placement**
    **scores**.

10. (Optional) To display the Spot placement score for the Availability Zones in the
     displayed Regions, select the **Provide placement scores per**
    **Availability Zone** checkbox. A list of scored Availability
     Zones is useful if you want to launch all of your Spot capacity into a

     score, choose **Edit**, make the necessary adjustments, and
     then choose **Calculate placement scores**.

## Calculate using the AWS CLI

###### To calculate the Spot placement score

1. (Optional) To generate all of the possible parameters that can be
    specified for the Spot placement score configuration, use the [get-spot-placement-scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-spot-placement-scores.html) command and the
    `--generate-cli-skeleton` parameter.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-spot-placement-scores \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --generate-cli-skeleton
```

The following is example output.

       },
       "DryRun": true,
       "MaxResults": 0,
       "NextToken": ""
}

```

2. Create a JSON configuration file using the output from the previous step,
    and configure it as follows:
1. For `TargetCapacity`, enter your desired Spot capacity
       in terms of the number of instances or vCPUs, or the amount of
       memory (MiB).

2. For `TargetCapacityUnitType`, enter the unit for the
       target capacity. If you omit this parameter, it defaults to
       `units`.

      Valid values: `units` (which translates to number of
       instances) \| `vcpu` \| `memory-mib`

3. For `SingleAvailabilityZone`, specify `true`
       for a response that returns a list of scored Availability Zones. A
       list of scored Availability Zones is useful if you want to launch
       all of your Spot capacity into a single Availability Zone. If you
       omit this parameter, it defaults to `false`, and the
       response returns a list of scored
       Regions.

4. (Optional) For `RegionNames`, specify the Regions to use as a filter. You must specify the Region
       code, for example, `us-east-1`.

      With a Region filter, the response returns only the Regions that you specify. If you specified
       `true` for `SingleAvailabilityZone`, the
       response returns only the Availability Zones in the specified
       Regions.

5. You can include either `InstanceTypes` or
       `InstanceRequirements`, but not both in the same
       configuration.

      Specify one of the following in your JSON configuration:

- To specify a list of instance types, specify the instance
types in the `InstanceTypes` parameter. Specify
at least three different instance types. If you specify only
one or two instance types, Spot placement score returns a low score. For
the list of instance types, see [Amazon EC2 Instance\
Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types).

- To specify the instance attributes so that Amazon EC2 will
identify the instance types that match those attributes,
specify the attributes that are located in the
`InstanceRequirements` structure.

You must provide values for `VCpuCount`,
`MemoryMiB`, and
`CpuManufacturers`. You can omit the other
attributes; when omitted, the default values are used. For a
description of each attribute and their default values, see
[get-spot-placement-scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-spot-placement-scores.html).

For example configurations, see [Example configurations](#sps-example-configs).
3. To get the Spot placement score for the requirements that you specified in the JSON file,
    use the [get-spot-placement-scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-spot-placement-scores.html) command, and specify the name and
    path to your JSON file by using the `--cli-input-json`
    parameter.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 get-spot-placement-scores \
       --region us-east-1 \
       --cli-input-json file://file_name.json
```

Example output if `SingleAvailabilityZone` is set to
    `false` or omitted (if omitted, it defaults to
    `false`) – a scored list of
    Regions is
    returned.

```json

"SpotPlacementScores": [
       {
           "Region": "us-east-1",
           "Score": 7
       },
       {
           "Region": "us-west-1",
           "Score": 5
       },
      ...
```

Example output if `SingleAvailabilityZone` is set to
    `true` – a scored list of Availability Zones is
    returned.

```json

"SpotPlacementScores": [
       {
           "Region": "us-east-1",
           "AvailabilityZoneId": "use1-az1",
           "Score": 8
       },
       {
           "Region": "us-east-1",
           "AvailabilityZoneId": "usw2-az3",
           "Score": 6
       },
      ...
```

### Example configurations

When using the AWS CLI, you can use the following example configurations.

###### Example configurations

- [Example: Specify instance types and target capacity](#example-config-instance-type-override)

- [Example: Specify instance types, and target capacity in terms of memory](#example-config-instance-type-memory-unit-override)

- [Example: Specify attributes for attribute-based instance type selection](#example-config-attribute-based-instance-type-selection)

- [Example: Specify attributes for attribute-based instance type selection and return a scored list of Availability Zones](#example-config-sps-singleAZ)

#### Example: Specify instance types and target capacity

The following example configuration specifies three different instance
types and a target Spot capacity of 500 Spot Instances.

```JSON

{
    "InstanceTypes": [
        "m5.4xlarge",
        "r5.2xlarge",
        "m4.4xlarge"
    ],
    "TargetCapacity": 500
}
```

#### Example: Specify instance types, and target capacity in terms of memory

The following example configuration specifies three different instance
types and a target Spot capacity of 500,000 MiB of memory, where the number
of Spot Instances to launch must provide a total of 500,000 MiB of memory.

```JSON

{
    "InstanceTypes": [
        "m5.4xlarge",
        "r5.2xlarge",
        "m4.4xlarge"
    ],
    "TargetCapacity": 500000,
    "TargetCapacityUnitType": "memory-mib"
}
```

#### Example: Specify attributes for attribute-based instance type selection

The following example configuration is configured for attribute-based
instance type selection, and is followed by a text explanation of the
example configuration.

```JSON

{
    "TargetCapacity": 5000,
    "TargetCapacityUnitType": "vcpu",
    "InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata": {
        "ArchitectureTypes": ["arm64"],
        "VirtualizationTypes": ["hvm"],
        "InstanceRequirements": {
            "VCpuCount": {
                "Min": 1,
                "Max": 12
            },
            "MemoryMiB": {
                "Min": 512
            }
        }
    }
}
```

###### **`InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata`**

To use attribute-based instance type selection, you must include the
`InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata` structure in your
configuration, and specify the desired attributes for the Spot Instances.

In the preceding example, the following required instance attributes are
specified:

- `ArchitectureTypes` – The architecture type of
the instance types must be `arm64`.

- `VirtualizationTypes` – The virtualization type
of the instance types must be `hvm`.

- `VCpuCount` – The instance types must have a
minimum of 1 and a maximum of 12 vCPUs.

- `MemoryMiB` – The instance types must have a
minimum of 512 MiB of memory. By omitting the `Max`
parameter, you are indicating that there is no maximum limit.

Note that there are several other optional attributes that you can
specify. For the list of attributes, see [get-spot-placement-scores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-spot-placement-scores.html).

###### `TargetCapacityUnitType`

The `TargetCapacityUnitType` parameter specifies the unit
for the target capacity. In the example, the target capacity is
`5000` and the target capacity unit type is
`vcpu`, which together specify a desired target capacity
of 5000 vCPUs, where the number of Spot Instances to launch must provide a total
of 5000 vCPUs.

#### Example: Specify attributes for attribute-based instance type selection and return a scored list of Availability Zones

The following example configuration is configured for attribute-based
instance type selection. By specifying `"SingleAvailabilityZone":
							true`, the response will return a list of scored Availability
Zones.

```JSON

{
    "TargetCapacity": 1000,
    "TargetCapacityUnitType": "vcpu",
    "SingleAvailabilityZone": true,
    "InstanceRequirementsWithMetadata": {
        "ArchitectureTypes": ["arm64"],
        "VirtualizationTypes": ["hvm"],
        "InstanceRequirements": {
            "VCpuCount": {
                "Min": 1,
                "Max": 12
            },
            "MemoryMiB": {
                "Min": 512
            }
        }
    }
}
```
