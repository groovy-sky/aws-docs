# Get the status of a Spot Instance request

To help you track your Spot Instance requests and plan your use of Spot Instances, use the request
status provided by Amazon EC2. For example, the request status can provide the reason why
your Spot request isn't fulfilled yet, or list the constraints that are preventing the
fulfillment of your Spot request.

At each step of the process—also called the Spot request
_lifecycle_—specific events determine successive request
states.

The following illustration shows how Spot Instance requests work. Notice that the request type
(one-time or persistent) determines whether the request is opened again when Amazon EC2
interrupts a Spot Instance or if you stop a Spot Instance. If the request is persistent, the request is
opened again after your Spot Instance is interrupted. If the request is persistent and you stop
your Spot Instance, the request only opens after you start your Spot Instance.

## Get request status information

You can get status information for your Spot Instance request.

Console

###### To get request status information

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Spot Requests** and
    select the Spot request.

3. To check the status, on the **Description** tab, check the
    **Status** field.

AWS CLI

###### To get request status information

Use the following [describe-spot-instance-requests](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-spot-instance-requests.md) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests --spot-instance-request-ids sir-0e54a519c9EXAMPLE
```

PowerShell

###### To get request status information

Use the [Get-EC2SpotInstanceRequest](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2spotinstancerequest.md) cmdlet.

```powershell

Get-EC2SpotInstanceRequest -SpotInstanceRequestId sir-0e54a519c9EXAMPLE
```

## Spot request status codes

Spot request status information is composed of a status code, the update time, and
a status message. Together, these help you determine the disposition of your Spot
request.

The following are the Spot request status codes:

`az-group-constraint`

Amazon EC2 cannot launch all the instances you requested in the same
Availability Zone.

`bad-parameters`

One or more parameters for your Spot request are not valid (for
example, the AMI you specified does not exist). The status message
indicates which parameter is not valid.

`canceled-before-fulfillment`

The user canceled the Spot request before it was fulfilled.

`capacity-not-available`

There is not enough capacity available for the instances that you
requested.

`constraint-not-fulfillable`

The Spot request can't be fulfilled because one or more constraints
are not valid (for example, the Availability Zone does not exist). The
status message indicates which constraint is not valid.

`fulfilled`

The Spot request is `active`, and Amazon EC2 is launching your
Spot Instances.

`instance-stopped-by-price`

Your instance was stopped because the Spot price exceeded your maximum
price.

`instance-stopped-by-user`

Your instance was stopped because a user stopped the instance or ran the shutdown
command from the instance.

`instance-stopped-no-capacity`

Your instance was stopped due to EC2 capacity management needs.

`instance-terminated-by-price`

Your instance was terminated because the Spot price exceeded your
maximum price. If your request is persistent, the process restarts, so
your request is pending evaluation.

`instance-terminated-by-schedule`

Your Spot Instance was terminated at the end of its scheduled duration.

`instance-terminated-by-service`

Your instance was terminated from a stopped state.

`instance-terminated-by-user` or
`spot-instance-terminated-by-user`

You terminated a Spot Instance that had been fulfilled, so the request state is
`closed` (unless it's a persistent request) and the
instance state is `terminated`.

`instance-terminated-launch-group-constraint`

One or more of the instances in your launch group was terminated, so
the launch group constraint is no longer fulfilled.

`instance-terminated-no-capacity`

Your instance was terminated due to standard capacity management
processes.

`launch-group-constraint`

Amazon EC2 cannot launch all the instances that you requested at the same
time. All instances in a launch group are started and terminated
together.

`limit-exceeded`

The limit on the number of EBS volumes or total volume storage was
exceeded. For more information, see [Quotas for Amazon EBS](../../../ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-resource-quotas.md) in the _Amazon EBS User Guide_.

`marked-for-stop`

The Spot Instance is marked for stopping.

`marked-for-termination`

The Spot Instance is marked for termination.

`not-scheduled-yet`

The Spot request is not evaluated until the scheduled date.

`pending-evaluation`

After you make a Spot Instance request, it goes into the
`pending-evaluation` state while the system evaluates the
parameters of your request.

`pending-fulfillment`

Amazon EC2 is trying to provision your Spot Instances.

`placement-group-constraint`

The Spot request can't be fulfilled yet because a Spot Instance can't be added
to the placement group at this time.

`price-too-low`

The request can't be fulfilled yet because your maximum price is below
the Spot price. In this case, no instance is launched and your request
remains `open`.

`request-canceled-and-instance-running`

You canceled the Spot request while the Spot Instances are still running. The
request is `cancelled`, but the instances remain
`running`.

`schedule-expired`

The Spot request expired because it was not fulfilled before the
specified date.

`system-error`

There was an unexpected system error. If this is a recurring issue,
please contact AWS Support for assistance.

## EC2 Spot Instance Request Fulfillment event

When a Spot Instance request is fulfilled, Amazon EC2 sends an EC2 Spot Instance Request Fulfillment event to
Amazon EventBridge. You can create a rule to take an action whenever this event occurs, such
as invoking a Lambda function or notifying an Amazon SNS topic.

The following is example data for this event.

```json

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "01234567-1234-0123-1234-012345678901",
    "detail-type": "EC2 Spot Instance Request Fulfillment",
    "source": "aws.ec2",
    "account": "123456789012",
    "time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "resources": ["arn:aws:ec2:us-east-2:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0"],
    "detail": {
        "spot-instance-request-id": "sir-0e54a519c9EXAMPLE",
        "instance-id": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
    }
}
```
