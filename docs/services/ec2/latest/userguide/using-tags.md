# Tag your Amazon EC2 resources

To help you manage your instances, images, and other Amazon EC2 resources, you can assign your own
metadata to each resource in the form of _tags_. Tags enable you to
categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or
environment. This is useful when you have many resources of the same type—you can
quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags that you've assigned to it. This
topic describes tags and shows you how to create them.

###### Warning

Tag keys and their values are returned by many different API calls. Denying access to
`DescribeTags` doesn’t automatically deny access to tags returned by
other APIs. As a best practice, we recommend that you do not include sensitive data in
your tags.

## Tag basics

A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a
_key_ and an optional _value_, both of which
you define.

Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose,
owner, or environment. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's
Amazon EC2 instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level.

The following diagram illustrates how tagging works. In this example, you've assigned two
tags to each of your instances—one tag with the key `Owner` and
another with the key `Stack`. Each tag also has an associated value.

![Tag example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/Tag_Example.png)

We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type.
Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can
search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. For more information about how to
implement an effective resource tagging strategy, see the [Tagging Best \
Practices AWS Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html).

Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EC2 and are interpreted strictly as a string
of characters. Also, tags are not automatically assigned to your resources. You can edit
tag keys and values, and you can remove tags from a resource at any time. You can set
the value of a tag to an empty string, but you can't set the value of a tag to null. If
you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag on that resource, the new value
overwrites the old value. If you delete a resource, any tags for the resource are also
deleted.

###### Note

After you delete a resource, its tags might remain visible in the console, API,
and CLI output for a short period. These tags will be gradually disassociated from
the resource and be permanently deleted.

## Tag your resources

When you use the Amazon EC2 console, you can apply tags to resources by using the
**Tags** tab on the relevant resource screen, or you can use the
**Tags Editor** in the AWS Resource Groups console. Some resource screens
enable you to specify tags for a resource when you create the resource; for example, a
tag with a key of `Name` and a value that you specify. In most cases, the
console applies the tags immediately after the resource is created (rather than during
resource creation). The console might organize resources according to the
`Name` tag, but this tag doesn't have any semantic meaning to the Amazon EC2
service.

If you're using the Amazon EC2 API, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK, you can use the
`CreateTags` EC2 API action to apply tags to existing resources.
Additionally, some resource-creating actions enable you to specify tags for a resource
when the resource is created. If tags cannot be applied during resource creation, we
roll back the resource creation process. This ensures that resources are either created
with tags or not created at all, and that no resources are left untagged at any time. By
tagging resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom
tagging scripts after resource creation. For more information about enabling users to tag
resources on creation, see [Grant permission to tag Amazon EC2 resources during creation](supported-iam-actions-tagging.md).

You can apply tag-based resource-level permissions in your IAM policies to the Amazon EC2 API
actions that support tagging on creation to implement granular control over the users
and groups that can tag resources on creation. Your resources are properly secured from
creation—tags are applied immediately to your resources, therefore any tag-based
resource-level permissions controlling the use of resources are immediately effective.
Your resources can be tracked and reported on more accurately. You can enforce the use
of tagging on new resources, and control which tag keys and values are set on your
resources.

You can also apply resource-level permissions to the `CreateTags` and
`DeleteTags` Amazon EC2 API actions in your IAM policies to control which
tag keys and values are set on your existing resources. For more information, see [Example: Tag resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ExamplePolicies_EC2.html#iam-example-taggingresources).

For more information about tagging your resources for billing, see [Using cost allocation tags](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.md) in the
_AWS Billing User Guide_.

## Tag restrictions

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

- Maximum number of tags per resource – 50

- For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only
one value.

- Maximum key length – 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- Maximum value length – 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8

- Allowed characters

- Although EC2 allows for any character in its tags, other AWS services are more restrictive.
The allowed characters across all AWS services are: letters ( `a-z`,
`A-Z`), numbers ( `0-9`), and spaces
representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: `+ - = . _ :
  								/ @`.

- If you enable instance tags in instance metadata, instance tag _keys_ can only use letters ( `a-z`,
`A-Z`), numbers ( `0-9`), and the following
characters: `+ - = . , _ : @`. Instance tag _keys_ can't contain spaces or
`/`, and can't comprise only `.` (one period),
`..` (two periods), or `_index`. For more
information, see [View tags for your EC2 instances using instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/work-with-tags-in-IMDS.html).

- Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

- The `aws:` prefix is reserved for AWS use. If a tag has a tag key
with this prefix, then you can't edit or delete the tag's key or value. Tags
with the `aws:` prefix do not count against your tags per resource
limit.

You can't terminate, stop, or delete a resource based solely on its tags; you must specify
the resource identifier. For example, to delete snapshots that you tagged with a tag key
called `DeleteMe`, you must use the `DeleteSnapshots` action with
the resource identifiers of the snapshots, such as `snap-1234567890abcdef0`.

When you tag public or shared resources, the tags you assign are available only to
your AWS account; no other AWS account will have access to those tags. For tag-based
access control to shared resources, each AWS account must assign its own set of tags to
control access to the resource.

## Tags and access management

If you're using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can control which users in your AWS account
have permission to create, edit, or delete tags. For more information, see [Grant permission to tag Amazon EC2 resources during creation](supported-iam-actions-tagging.md).

You can also use resource tags to implement attribute-based control (ABAC). You
can create IAM policies that allow operations based on the tags for the resource.
For more information, see [Control access using attribute-based access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-policies-for-amazon-ec2.html#control-access-with-tags).

## Tag your resources for billing

You can use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this,
sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included. For more
information about setting up a cost allocation report with tags, see [Monthly cost allocation\
report](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/configurecostallocreport.md) in the _AWS Billing User Guide_. To see the cost of your
combined resources, you can organize your billing information based on resources that
have the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific
application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of
that application across several services. For more information, see [Using cost allocation tags](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.md) in the
_AWS Billing User Guide_.

###### Note

If you've just enabled reporting, data for the current month is available for
viewing after 24 hours.

Cost allocation tags can indicate which resources are contributing to costs, but
deleting or deactivating resources doesn't always reduce costs. For example, snapshot
data that is referenced by another snapshot is preserved, even if the snapshot that
contains the original data is deleted. For more information, see [Amazon Elastic Block Store\
volumes and snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/checklistforunwantedcharges.html#checkebsvolumes) in the _AWS Billing User Guide_.

###### Note

Elastic IP addresses that are tagged do not appear on your cost allocation report.
