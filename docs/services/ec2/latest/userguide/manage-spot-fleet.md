# Describe a Spot Fleet request, its instances, and event history
<a name="manage-spot-fleet"></a>

**Important**
Spot Fleet uses a legacy API with no planned investment. We recommend using EC2 Fleet or an Auto Scaling group instead. For more information, see [Which is the best fleet method to use?](which-fleet-method-to-use.md).

You can describe your Spot Fleet configuration, the instances in your Spot Fleet, and the event history of your Spot Fleet.
