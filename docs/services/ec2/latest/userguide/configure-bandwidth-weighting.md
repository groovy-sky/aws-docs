# EC2 instance bandwidth weighting configuration
<a name="configure-bandwidth-weighting"></a>

Some instance types support configurable bandwidth weighting, where you can select baseline bandwidth weighting that favors either network processing or EBS operations. Default settings for baseline bandwidth are determined by your instance type. You can configure the bandwidth weighting during launch, or modify your instance settings with the following weighting preferences:
+ **default** – This option uses the standard bandwidth configuration for your instance type.
+ **vpc-1** – This option increases the baseline bandwidth available for networking and decreases the baseline bandwidth for EBS operations.
+ **ebs-1** – This option increases the baseline bandwidth available for EBS operations, and decreases the baseline bandwidth for networking.

## Bandwidth weighting considerations
<a name="config-bw-considerations"></a>

The following are some considerations that might affect your bandwidth weighting strategy.
+ Setting bandwidth weighting preferences only affects bandwidth specifications. The network packets per second (PPS) and EBS input/output operations per second (IOPS) specifications don't change.
+ The combined bandwidth specification between networking and EBS does not change. When you select a bandwidth weighting configuration, the baseline bandwidth available for the selected option increases, and the baseline bandwidth for the remaining option is reduced by the same absolute amount. For all instances except Flex instances, the available burst bandwidth remains the same for your selected option, and is reduced for the remaining option. For Flex instances up to 4xlarge, burst bandwidth remains unchanged. For Flex instances 8xlarge and larger, burst bandwidth increases by the same amount as the baseline bandwidth.
+ It's important to understand how changes in bandwidth allocation can affect I/O performance for EBS. For EC2 instances that have `vpc-1` configuration (increased networking bandwidth), you might experience lower IOPS for EBS volumes if you reach the EBS bandwidth limit before you've reached the IOPS limit. This is more noticeable with larger I/O sizes.

  For example, on an instance type that normally supports 240,000 IOPS with 16 KiB I/O size, if you select `vpc-1` weighting, that might reduce the achievable IOPS due to the adjusted EBS baseline bandwidth limit.

  When planning your workload, consider your I/O size and patterns. Smaller I/O sizes are less likely to be affected by bandwidth limitations, while larger I/O sizes or sequential workloads might see more impact from bandwidth changes. Always test your specific workload to ensure optimal performance with your chosen configuration.
+ The networking multi-flow bandwidth specification for traffic that goes through an internet gateway or a local gateway is adjusted to 50% of the baseline bandwidth of the configured option or 5 Gbps, where applicable. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance network bandwidth](ec2-instance-network-bandwidth.md).

  The following example is based on an instance type that has a default baseline bandwidth of 40 Gbps, and a default border bandwidth of 20 Gbps. If you choose `vpc-1` bandwidth weighting for this instance, the weighted baseline bandwidth changes to 50 Gbps, and the border bandwidth changes to 25 Gbps.
+ This feature is available in all commercial regions, aligned with EC2 instance availablilty and support.
+ This feature adds no additional cost to your EC2 instance.

## Configure bandwidth weighting for your instance
<a name="config-bw-how-to"></a>

You can configure bandwidth weighting either at launch or by modifying existing instances from the EC2 console, API/SDKs or CLI.

### Configure bandwidth weighting when you launch an instance
<a name="config-bw-launch-instance"></a>

To configure bandwidth settings when you launch an instance, select one of the tabs for instructions.

You can also specify bandwidth weighting in a launch template. To create a launch template, see [Create an Amazon EC2 launch template](create-launch-template.md). The parameter to set is in the same location as it is for launching an instance directly from the console. Expand the **Advanced details** section, and set the **Instance bandwidth configuration**.

To launch an instance with your launch template, see [Launch EC2 instances using a launch template](launch-instances-from-launch-template.md).
