# Hibernate an Amazon EC2 instance

You can initiate hibernation on an On-Demand Instance or Spot Instance if the instance is an EBS-backed
instance, is [enabled for hibernation](enabling-hibernation.md), and
meets the [hibernation prerequisites](hibernating-prerequisites.md). If
an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs.

Console

###### To hibernate an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select an instance, and choose **Instance**
**state**, **Hibernate instance**. If
    **Hibernate instance** is disabled, the
    instance is already hibernated or stopped, or it can't be
    hibernated. For more information, see [Prerequisites for EC2 instance hibernation](hibernating-prerequisites.md).

4. When prompted for confirmation, choose
    **Hibernate**. It can take a few minutes for
    the instance to hibernate. The instance state first changes to
    **Stopping**, and then changes to
    **Stopped** when the instance has
    hibernated.

AWS CLI

###### To hibernate an instance

Use the [stop-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.html) command and specify the
`--hibernate` parameter.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 stop-instances \
    --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --hibernate
```

PowerShell

###### To hibernate an instance

Use the [Stop-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Stop-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet.

```powershell

Stop-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -Hibernate $true
```

You can check whether hibernation was initiated on an instance.

Console

###### To view if hibernation was initiated on an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select the instance and, on the **Details** tab,
    in the **Instance details** section, check the
    value for **State transition message**.

**Client.UserInitiatedHibernate: User initiated**
**hibernate** indicates that you initiated hibernation on
    the On-Demand Instance or Spot Instance.

AWS CLI

###### To view if hibernation was initiated on an instance

Use the [describe-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) command and specify the
`state-reason-code` filter to see the instances on which
hibernation was initiated.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=state-reason-code,Values=Client.UserInitiatedHibernate"
```

The following field in the output indicates that hibernation was initiated
on the On-Demand Instance or Spot Instance.

```json

"StateReason": {
    "Code": "Client.UserInitiatedHibernate"
}
```

PowerShell

###### To view if hibernation was initiated on an instance

Use the [Get-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet and specify the
`state-reason-code` filter to see the instances on which
hibernation was initiated.

```powershell

Get-EC2Instance `
    -Filter @{Name="state-reason-code";Value="Client.UserInitiatedHibernate"}
```
