# Option 2: Automatically connect an instance to an RDS database using the RDS console

The objective of Option 2 is to explore the automatic connect feature in the RDS console
that automatically configures the connection between your EC2 instance and RDS
database to allow traffic from the EC2 instance to the RDS database. In Option 3,
you'll learn how to manually configure the connection.

###### Tasks

- [Before you begin](#option2-before-you-begin)

- [Task 1 (Optional): Launch an EC2 instance](#option2-task1-launch-ec2-instance)

- [Task 2: Create an RDS database and automatically connect it to your EC2 instance](#option2-task2-create-rds-database)

- [Task 3: Verify the connection configuration](#option2-task3-verify-connection-configuration)

- [Task 4 (Optional): Clean up](#option2-task3-cleanup)

## Before you begin

You'll need the following to complete this tutorial:

- An EC2 instance that is in the same VPC as the RDS database. You can either use an
existing EC2 instance or follow the steps in Task 1 to create a new
instance.

- Permissions to call the following operations:

- `ec2:AssociateRouteTable`

- `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress`

- `ec2:CreateRouteTable`

- `ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`

- `ec2:CreateSubnet`

- `ec2:DescribeInstances`

- `ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces`

- `ec2:DescribeRouteTables`

- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`

- `ec2:DescribeSubnets`

- `ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute`

- `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress`

## Task 1 ( _Optional_): Launch an EC2 instance

###### Note

Launching an instance is not the focus of this tutorial. If you already have an Amazon EC2
instance and would like to use it in this tutorial, you can skip this task.

The objective of this task is to launch an EC2 instance so that you can complete Task 2
where you configure the connection between your EC2 instance and your Amazon RDS database. The
steps in this task configure the EC2 instance as follows:

- Instance name: `tutorial-instance-2`

- AMI: Amazon Linux 2

- Instance type: `t2.micro`

- Auto-assign public IP: Enabled

- Security group with the following three rules:

- Allow SSH from your IP address

- Allow HTTPS traffic from anywhere

- Allow HTTP traffic from anywhere

###### Important

In a production environment, you should configure your instance to meet your specific
needs.

###### To launch an EC2 instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the **EC2 Dashboard**, choose **Launch**
**instance**.

3. Under **Name and tags**, for **Name**, enter a name to
    identify your instance. For this tutorial, name the instance
    `tutorial-instance-2`. While the instance name
    is not mandatory, when you select your instance in the RDS console, the
    name will help you easily identify it.

4. Under **Application and OS Images**, choose an AMI that meets your web
    server needs. This tutorial uses **Amazon**
**Linux**.

5. Under **Instance type**, for **Instance type**, select
    an instance type that meets your web server needs. This tutorial uses
    `t2.micro`.

###### Note

Depending on when you created your account, you might be eligible to
use Amazon EC2 under the Free Tier.

If your created your AWS account before July 15,
2025 and it's less than 12 months old, you can use Amazon EC2 under the
Free Tier by selecting the **t2.micro** instance type,
or the **t3.micro** instance type in Regions where
**t2.micro** is unavailable. Be aware that when you
launch a **t3.micro** instance, it defaults to [Unlimited mode](burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode.md), which might incur
additional charges based on CPU usage. If an instance type can be used
under the Free Tier, it is labeled **Free tier**
**eligible**.

If you created your AWS account on or after July 15, 2025, you can
use **t3.micro**, **t3.small**,
**t4g.micro**, **t4g.small**,
**c7i-flex.large**, and
**m7i-flex.large** instance types for 6 months or
until your credits are used up.

For more information, see [Free Tier benefits before and after July 15, 2025](ec2-free-tier-usage.md#ec2-free-tier-comparison).

6. Under **Key pair (login)**, for **Key pair name**,
    choose your key pair.

7. Under **Network settings**, do the following:
1. For **Network** and
       **Subnet**, if you haven’t made changes to
       your default VPC or subnets, you can keep the default settings.

      If you have made changes to your default VPC or subnets, check the following:
      1. The instance must be in the same VPC as the RDS database to use the automatic
          connection configuration. By default you have only one
          VPC.

      2. The VPC that you’re launching your instance into must have an internet gateway
          attached to it so that you can access your web server
          from the internet. Your default VPC is automatically set
          up with an internet gateway.

      3. To ensure that your instance receives a public IP address, for **Auto-assign**
         **public IP**, check that **Enable** is
          selected. If **Disable** is selected, choose
          **Edit** (to the right of **Network**
         **Settings**), and then, for **Auto-assign public**
         **IP**, choose **Enable**.
2. To connect to your instance by using SSH, you need a security group rule that authorizes
       SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) traffic from your computer’s public IPv4
       address. By default, when you launch an instance, a new security group
       is created with a rule that allows inbound SSH traffic from
       anywhere.

      To make sure that only your IP address can connect to your instance,
       under **Firewall (security groups)**, from the
       drop-down list next to the **Allow SSH traffic from**
       checkbox, choose **My IP**.

3. To allow traffic from the internet to your instance, select the
       following checkboxes:

- **Allow HTTPs traffic from the internet**

- **Allow HTTP traffic from the**
**internet**
8. In the **Summary** panel, review your instance configuration and then
    choose **Launch instance**.

9. Choose **View all instances** to close the confirmation page and return
    to the console. Your instance will first be in a `pending`
    state, and will then go into the `running` state.

If the instance fails to launch or the state immediately goes to `terminated`
    instead of `running`, see [Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance launch issues](troubleshooting-launch.md).

For more information about launching an instance, see [Launch an EC2 instance using the launch instance wizard in the console](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md).

## Task 2: Create an RDS database and automatically connect it to your EC2 instance

The objective of this task is to create an RDS database and use the automatic connection feature
in the RDS console to automatically configure the connection between your EC2 instance and your
RDS database. The steps in this task configure the DB instance as follows:

- Engine type: MySQL

- Template: Free tier

- DB instance identifier: `tutorial-database`

- DB instance class: `db.t3.micro`

###### Important

In a production environment, you should configure your instance to meet your
specific needs.

###### To create an RDS database and automatically connect it to an EC2 instance

01. Open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. From the Region selector (at top right), choose the AWS Region in which you created the
     EC2 instance. The EC2 instance and the RDS database must be in the same
     Region.

03. On the dashboard, choose **Create database**.

04. Under **Choose a database creation method**, check that
     **Standard create** is selected. If you choose
     **Easy create**, the automatic connection feature
     is not available.

05. Under **Engine options**, for **Engine type**, choose
     **MySQL**.

06. Under **Templates**, choose a sample template to meet your needs. For
     this tutorial, choose **Free tier** to create an RDS
     database at no cost. However, note that the Free Tier is only available if
     your account qualifies for the Free Tier. You can read more by choosing the
     **Info** link in the **Free tier**
     box.

07. Under **Settings**, do the following:
    1. For **DB instance identifier**, enter a name for the database. For
        this tutorial, enter
        `tutorial-database`.

    2. For **Master username**, leave the default name,
        which is `admin`.

    3. For **Master password**, enter a password that you can remember for
        this tutorial, and then, for **Confirm**
       **password**, enter the password again.
08. Under **Instance configuration**, for **DB instance**
    **class**, leave the default, which is
     **db.t3.micro**. If your
     account qualifies for the Free Tier, you can use this instance for free.
     For more information, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free).

09. Under **Connectivity**, for **Compute resource**,
     choose **Connect to an EC2 compute resource**. This is
     the automatic connection feature in the RDS console .

10. For **EC2 instance**, choose the EC2 instance that you want to connect
     to. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can either choose the
     instance that you created in the previous task, which you named
     `tutorial-instance`, or choose another existing
     instance. If you don't see your instance in the list, choose the refresh
     icon to the right of **Connectivity**.

    When you use the automatic connection feature, a security group is added to this EC2
     instance, and another security group is added to the RDS database. The
     security groups are automatically configure to allow traffic between the
     EC2 instance and the RDS database. In the next task, you'll verify that
     the security groups were created and assigned to the EC2 instance and
     RDS database.

11. Choose **Create database**.

    On the **Databases** screen, the **Status** of the new
     database is **Creating** until the database is ready to
     use. When the status changes to **Available**, you can
     connect to the database. Depending on the database class and the amount
     of storage, it can take up to 20 minutes before the new database is
     available.

To learn more, see [Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](../../../amazonrds/latest/userguide/user-createdbinstance.md#USER_CreateDBInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_.

![This animation shows how to create an RDS database, and then use the automatic connection functionality to connect it to an EC2 instance. For the text version of this animation, see the steps in the preceding procedure.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/tutorial-create-rds-connect-ec2.gif)

## Task 3: Verify the connection configuration

The objective of this task is to verify that the two security groups were created and
assigned to the instance and database.

When you use the automatic connection feature in the console to configure the
connectivity, the security groups are automatically created and assigned to the
instance and database, as follows:

- Security group
**rds-ec2- `x`** is created
and added to the RDS database. It has one inbound rule that references
the **ec2-rds- `x`** security
group as its source. This allows traffic from the EC2 instance with the
**ec2-rds- `x`**
security group to reach the RDS database.

- Security group
**ec2-rds- `x`** is created
and added to the EC2 instance. It has one outbound rule that references
the **rds-ec2- `x`** security
group as its destination. This allows traffic from the EC2 instance to
reach the RDS database with the
**rds-ec2- `x`**
security group.

###### To verify the connection configuration using the console

01. Open the Amazon RDS console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

02. In the navigation page, choose **Databases**.

03. Choose the RDS database that you created for this tutorial.

04. On the **Connectivity & security** tab, under
     **Security**, **VPC security**
    **groups**, verify that a security group called
     **rds-ec2- `x`** is
     displayed.

05. Choose the **rds-ec2- `x`** security group. The
     **Security Groups** screen in the EC2 console
     opens.

06. Choose the **rds-ec2- `x`**
     security group to open it.

07. Choose the **Inbound rules** tab.

08. Verify that the following security group rule exists, as
     follows:

- Type: **MYSQL/Aurora**

- Port range: **3306**

- Source: **`sg-0987654321example` /**
**ec2-rds- `x`** –
This is the security group that is assigned to the EC2 instance
that you verified in the preceding steps.

- Description: **Rule to allow connections from EC2 instances with**
**`sg-1234567890example`**
**attached**

09. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

10. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

11. Choose the EC2 instance that you selected to connect to the RDS database in the previous
     task, and choose the **Security** tab.

12. Under **Security details**, **Security groups**,
     verify that a security group called
     **ec2-rds- `x`** is in
     the list. `x` is a number.

13. Choose the **ec2-rds- `x`**
     security group to open it.

14. Choose the **Outbound rules** tab.

15. Verify that the following security group rule exists, as
     follows:

- Type: **MYSQL/Aurora**

- Port range: **3306**

- Destination: **`sg-1234567890example` /**
**rds-ec2- `x`**

- Description: **Rule to allow connections to**
**`database-tutorial` from any**
**instances this security group is attached**
**to**

By verifying that these security groups and security group rules exist and that they are
assigned to the RDS database and EC2 instance as described in this
procedure, you can verify that the connection was automatically
configured by using the automatic connection feature.

![This animation shows how to verify the connection configuration. For the text version of this animation, see the steps in the preceding procedure.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/tutorial-verify-automatic-connection.gif)

You have completed Option 2 of this tutorial. You can now either complete Option 3, which teaches you how to
manually configure the security groups that were automatically created in Option
2.

## Task 4 ( _Optional_): Clean up

###### Warning

**Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.**

After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered.
All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently
deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost.
For more information, see [How instance termination works](how-ec2-instance-termination-works.md).

Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to
retain after the termination to persistent storage.

Now that you have completed the tutorial, it is good practice to clean up (delete) any resources you
no longer want to use. Cleaning up AWS resources prevents your account from incurring
any further charges.

If you launched an EC2 instance specifically for this tutorial, you can terminate it to stop incurring any charges associated with it.

###### To terminate an instance using the console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance that you created for this tutorial, and choose **Instance**
**state**, **Terminate instance**.

4. Choose **Terminate** when prompted for confirmation.

If you created an RDS database specifically for this tutorial, you can delete it to stop
incurring any charges associated with it.

###### To delete an RDS database using the console

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.

3. Select the RDS database that you created for this tutorial, and choose
    **Actions**, **Delete**.

4. Enter `delete me` in the box, and then choose **Delete**.
