## Related services

The following AWS services are used in the automated upgrade process:

- **AWS Systems Manager**. AWS Systems Manager is a powerful,
unified interface for centrally managing your AWS resources. For more
information, see the _[AWS Systems Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide)_.

- AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) is Amazon software that can be installed and
configured on an Amazon EC2 instance, an on-premises server, or a virtual machine
(VM). SSM Agent makes it possible for Systems Manager to update, manage, and configure
these resources. The agent processes requests from the Systems Manager service in the
AWS Cloud, and then runs them as specified in the request. For more
information, see [Working with SSM\
Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) in the _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

- **AWS Systems Manager SSM runbooks**. An SSM runbook
defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances. SSM
runbooks use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or YAML, and they include
steps and parameters that you specify. This topic uses two Systems Manager SSM
runbooks for automation. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager\
Automation runbook reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-runbook-reference.html) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

## Execution options

When you select **Automation** on the Systems Manager console, select
**Execute**. After you select an Automation document, you are
then prompted to choose an automation execution option. You choose from the
following options. In the steps for the paths provided later in this topic, we use
the **Simple execution** option.

###### Simple execution

Choose this option if you want to update a single instance but do not want to
go through each automation step to audit the results. This option is explained
in further detail in the upgrade steps that follow.

**Rate control**

Choose this option if you want to apply the upgrade to more than one instance. You
define the following settings.

- **Parameter**

This setting, which is also set in Multi-Account and Region settings,
defines how your automation branches out.

- **Targets**

Select the target to which you want to apply the automation. This setting
is also set in Multi-Account and Region settings.

- **Parameter Values**

Use the values defined in the automation document parameters.

- **Resource Group**

In AWS, a resource is an entity you can work with. Examples include
Amazon EC2 instances, AWS CloudFormation stacks, or Amazon S3 buckets. If
you work with multiple resources, it might be useful to manage them as a
group as opposed to moving from one AWS service to another for every task.
In some cases, you may want to manage large numbers of related resources,
such as EC2 instances that make up an application layer. In this case, you
will likely need to perform bulk actions on these resources at one
time.

- **Tags**

Tags help you categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for
example, by purpose, owner, or environment. This categorization is useful
when you have many resources of the same type. You can quickly identify a
specific resource using the assigned tags.

- **Rate Control**

Rate Control is also set in Multi-Account and Region settings. When you
set the rate control parameters, you define how many of your fleet to apply
the automation to, either by target count or by percentage of the
fleet.

**Multi-Account and Region**

In addition to the parameters specified under Rate Control that are also used in
the Multi-Account and Region settings, there are two additional settings:

- **Accounts and organizational units**
**(OUs)**

Specify multiple accounts on which you want to run the automation.

- **AWS Regions**

Specify multiple AWS Regions where you want to run the
automation.

###### Manual execution

This option is similar to **Simple execution**, but allows
you to step through each automation step and audit the results.

## Upgrade Windows Server

The `AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeWindows` runbook creates an
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from a Windows Server instance in your account and
upgrades this AMI to a supported version of your choice. This multi-step process can
take up to two hours to complete.

There are two AMIs included in the automated upgrade process:

- **Current running instance**. The first AMI
is the current running instance, which is not upgraded. This AMI is used to
launch another instance to run the in-place upgrade. When the process is
complete, this AMI is deleted from your account, unless you specifically
request to keep the original instance. This setting is handled by the
parameter `KeepPreUpgradeImageBackUp` (default value is
`false`, which means the AMI is deleted by default).

- **Upgraded AMI**. This AMI is the outcome of
the automation process.

The final result is one AMI, which is the upgraded instance of the AMI.

When the upgrade is complete, you can test your application functionality by
launching the new AMI in your Amazon VPC. After testing, and before you perform another
upgrade, schedule application downtime before completely switching to the upgraded
instance.

### Prerequisites

In order to automate your Windows Server upgrade with the AWS Systems Manager Automation
document, you must perform the following tasks:

- Create an IAM role with the specified IAM policies to allow Systems Manager to
perform automation tasks on your Amazon EC2 instances and verify that you
meet the prerequisites to use Systems Manager. For more information, see [Creating\
a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the
_AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

- [Select the option for how\
you want the automation to be run](#automated-execution-option). The options for execution
are **Simple execution**, **Rate**
**control**, **Multi-account and Region**,
and **Manual execution**. For more information about
these options, see [Execution options](#automated-execution-option).

- Verify that SSM Agent is installed on your instance. For more
information see [Installing and configuring SSM Agent on Amazon EC2 instances for Windows\
Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent-windows.html).

- Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later must be installed on your
instance.

- For instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain,
we recommend specifying a `SubnetId` that does not have
connectivity to your domain controllers to help avoid hostname
conflicts.

- The instance subnet must have outbound connectivity to the internet,
which provides access to AWS services such as Amazon S3 and access to
download patches from Microsoft. This requirement is met if either the
subnet is a public subnet and the instance has a public IP address, or
if the subnet is a private subnet with a route that sends internet
traffic to a public NAT device.

- This Automation works with instances running Windows Server 2008 R2,
Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server
2019.

- Verify that the instance has 20 GB of free disk space in the boot
disk.

- If the instance does not use a Windows license provided by AWS, then
specify an Amazon EBS snapshot ID that includes Windows Server 2012 R2
installation media. To do this:

1. Verify that the Amazon EC2 instance is running Windows Server 2012
    or later.

2. Create a 6 GB Amazon EBS volume in the same Availability Zone where
    the instance is running. Attach the volume to the instance.
    Mount it, for example, as drive D.

3. Right-click the ISO and mount it to an instance as, for
    example, drive E.

4. Copy the content of the ISO from drive E:\ to drive D:\

5. Create an Amazon EBS snapshot of the 6 GB volume created in step 2
    above.

### Windows Server upgrade limitations

This automation doesn't support upgrading Windows domain controllers,
clusters, or Windows desktop operating systems. In addition, this automation
doesn't support Amazon EC2 instances for Windows Server with the following roles
installed:

- Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH)

- Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RDCB)

- Remote Desktop Virtualization Host (RDVH)

- Remote Desktop Web Access (RDWA)

### Steps to perform an automated upgrade of Windows Server

Follow these steps to upgrade your Windows Server instance using the [AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeWindows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awsec2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeWindows.html) automation runbook.

01. Open Systems Manager from the **AWS Management**
    **Console**.

02. From the left navigation pane, under **Change**
    **Management**, choose
     **Automation**.

03. Choose **Execute automation**.

04. Search for the automation document called
     `AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeWindows`.

05. When the document name appears, select it. When you select it, the
     document details appear.

06. Choose **Execute automation** to input the parameters
     for this document. Leave **Simple execution** selected
     at the top of the page.

07. Enter the requested parameters based on the following guidance.

- `InstanceID`

**Type:** String

(Required) The instance running Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012
R2, 2016, or 2019 with the SSM agent installed.

- `InstanceProfile`.

**Type:** String

(Required) The IAM instance profile. This is the IAM role used
to perform the Systems Manager automation against the Amazon EC2 instance
and AWS AMIs. For more information, see [Configure EC2 instance permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-permissions.html#instance-profile-add-permissions) in the
_AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

- `TargetWindowsVersion`

**Type:** String

(Required) Select the target Windows version.

- `SubnetId`

**Type:** String

(Required) This is the subnet for the upgrade process and
where your source EC2 instance resides. Verify that the subnet
has outbound connectivity to AWS services, including Amazon
S3, and also to Microsoft (in order to download patches).

- `KeepPreUpgradedBackUp`

**Type:** String

(Optional) If this parameter is set to `true`, the
automation retains the image created from the instance. The
default setting is `false`.

- `RebootInstanceBeforeTakingImage`

**Type:** String

(Optional) The default is `false` (no reboot). If
this parameter is set to `true`, Systems Manager reboots the
instance before creating an AMI for the upgrade.

08. After you have entered the parameters, choose
     **Execute**. When the automation begins, you can
     monitor the execution progress.

09. When the automation completes, you will see the AMI ID. You can launch
     the AMI to verify that the Windows OS is upgraded.

    ###### Note

    It is not necessary for the automation to run all of the steps.
    The steps are conditional based on the behavior of the automation
    and instance. Systems Manager might skip some steps that are not
    required.

    Additionally, some steps may time out. Systems Manager attempts to upgrade
    and install all of the latest patches. Sometimes, however, patches
    time out based on a definable timeout setting for the given step.
    When this happens, the Systems Manager automation continues to the next step
    to ensure that the internal OS is upgraded to the target Windows
    Server version.

10. After the automation completes, you can launch an Amazon EC2 instance using
     the AMI ID to review your upgrade. For more information about how to
     create an Amazon EC2 instance from an AWS AMI, see [How do I launch an EC2 instance from a custom AMI?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/launch-instance-custom-ami)

## Upgrade SQL Server

The [AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awsec2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer.html) script creates
an AMI from an Amazon EC2 instance running SQL Server in your account, and then upgrades
the AMI to a later version of SQL Server. This multi-step process can take up to two
hours to complete.

In this workflow, the automation creates an AMI from the instance and then
launches the new AMI in the subnet you provide. The automation then performs an
in-place upgrade of SQL Server. After the upgrade is complete, the automation
creates a new AMI before terminating the upgraded instance.

There are two AMIs included in the automated upgrade process:

- **Current running instance**. The first AMI
is the current running instance, which is not upgraded. This AMI is used to
launch another instance to run the in-place upgrade. When the process is
complete, this AMI is deleted from your account, unless you specifically
request to keep the original instance. This setting is handled by the
parameter `KeepPreUpgradeImageBackUp` (default value is
`false`, which means the AMI is deleted by default).

- **Upgraded AMI**. This AMI is the outcome of
the automation process.

The final result is one AMI, which is the upgraded instance of the AMI.

When the upgrade is complete, you can test your application functionality by
launching the new AMI in your Amazon VPC. After testing, and before you perform another
upgrade, schedule application downtime before completely switching to the upgraded
instance.

### Prerequisites

In order to automate your SQL Server upgrade with the AWS Systems Manager Automation
document, you must perform the following tasks:

- Create an IAM role with the specified IAM policies to allow Systems Manager to
perform automation tasks on your Amazon EC2 instances and verify that you
meet the prerequisites to use Systems Manager. For more information, see [Creating\
a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the
_AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.

- [Select the option for how\
you want the automation to be run](#automated-execution-option). The options for execution
are **Simple execution**, **Rate**
**control**, **Multi-account and Region**,
and **Manual execution**. For more information about
these options, see [Execution options](#automated-execution-option).

- The Amazon EC2 instance must use Windows Server 2008 R2 or later and SQL
Server 2008 or later.

- Verify that SSM Agent is installed on your instance. For more
information, see [Working with SSM Agent on Amazon EC2 instances for Windows\
Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent-windows.html).

- Verify that the instance has enough free disk space:

- If you are upgrading from Windows Server 2008 R2 to 2012 R2,
or from Windows Server 2012 R2 to a later operating system,
verify that you have 20 GB of free disk space in the instance
boot disk.

- If you are upgrading from Windows Server 2008 R2 to 2016 or
later, verify that the instance has 40 GB of free disk space in
the instance boot disk.

- For instances that use a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) SQL Server
version, the following additional prerequisites apply:

- Provide an Amazon EBS snapshot ID that includes the target SQL
Server installation media. To do this:

1. Verify that the Amazon EC2 instance is running Windows
    Server 2008 R2 or later.

2. Create a 6 GB Amazon EBS volume in the same Availability
    Zone where the instance is running. Attach the volume to
    the instance. Mount it, for example, as drive D.

3. Right-click the ISO and mount it to an instance as,
    for example, drive E.

4. Copy the content of the ISO from drive E:\ to drive
    D:\

5. Create an Amazon EBS snapshot of the 6 GB volume created in
    step 2.

### SQL Server automated upgrade limitations

The following limitations apply when using the [AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awsec2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer.html) runbook to perform an
automated upgrade:

- The upgrade can be performed on only a SQL Server using Windows
authentication.

- Verify that no security patch updates are pending on the instances.
Open **Control Panel**, then choose **Check for**
**updates**.

- SQL Server deployments in HA and mirroring mode are not
supported.

### Steps to perform an automated upgrade of SQL Server

Follow these steps to upgrade your SQL Server using the [AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awsec2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer.html) automation runbook.

01. If you haven't already, download the SQL Server 2016 .iso file and
     mount it to the source server.

02. After the .iso file is mounted, copy all of the component files and
     place them on any volume of your choice.

03. Take an Amazon EBS snapshot of the volume and copy the snapshot ID onto a
     clipboard for later use. For more information, see [Create Amazon EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html) in the **Amazon EBS User Guide**.

04. Attach the instance profile to the Amazon EC2 source instance. This allows
     Systems Manager to communicate with the EC2 instance and run commands on it after
     it is added to the AWS Systems Manager service. For this example, we named the
     role `SSM-EC2-Profile-Role` with the
     `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore ` policy attached to the
     role.

05. In the AWS Systems Manager console, in the left navigation pane, choose
     **Managed Instances**. Verify that your EC2
     instance is in the list of managed instance. If you don't see your
     instance after a few minutes, see
     [Where Are My Instances?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-remote-commands.html#where-are-instances) in the
     _AWS Systems Manager User Guide_.

06. In the left navigation pane, under **Change**
    **Management** choose **Automation**.

07. Choose **Execute automation**.

08. Search for the automation document called
     `AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer`.

09. Choose the `AWSEC2-CloneInstanceAndUpgradeSQLServer` SSM
     document, and then choose **Next**.

10. Ensure that the **Simple execution** option is
     selected.

11. Enter the requested parameters based on the following guidance.

- `InstanceId`

**Type:** String

(Required) The instance running SQL Server 2008 R2 (or later).

- `IamInstanceProfile`

**Type:** String

(Required) The IAM instance profile.

- `SQLServerSnapshotId`

**Type:** String

(Required) The Snapshot ID for the target SQL Server
installation media. This parameter is not required for SQL
Server license-included instances.

- `SubnetId`

**Type:** String

(Required) This is the subnet for the upgrade process and
where your source EC2 instance resides. Verify that the subnet
has outbound connectivity to AWS services, including Amazon
S3, and also to Microsoft (in order to download patches).

- `KeepPreUpgradedBackUp`

**Type:** String

(Optional) If this parameter is set to `true`, the
automation retains the image created from the instance. The
default setting is `false`.

- `RebootInstanceBeforeTakingImage`

**Type:** String

(Optional) The default is `false` (no reboot). If
this parameter is set to `true`, Systems Manager reboots the
instance before creating an AMI for the upgrade.

- `TargetSQLVersion`

**Type:** String

(Optional) The target SQL Server version. The default is
`2016`.

12. After you have entered the parameters, choose
     **Execute**. When the automation begins, you can
     monitor the execution progress.

13. When **Execution status** shows
     **Success**, expand **Outputs** to
     view the AMI information. You can use the AMI ID to launch your SQL
     Server instance for the VPC of your choice.

14. Open the Amazon EC2 console. In the left navigation pane, choose
     **AMIs**. You should see the new AMI.

15. To verify that the new SQL Server version has been successfully
     installed, choose the new AMI and choose
     **Launch**.

16. Choose the type of instance that you want for the AMI, the VPC and
     subnet that you want to deploy to, and the storage that you want to use.
     Because you're launching the new instance from an AMI, the volumes are
     presented to you as an option to include within the new EC2 instance you
     are launching. You can remove any of these volumes, or you can add
     volumes.

17. Add a tag to help you identify your instance.

18. Add the security group or groups to the instance.

19. Choose **Launch Instance**.

20. Choose the tag name for the instance and select
     **Connect** under the **Actions**
     dropdown.

21. Verify that the new SQL Server version is the database engine on the
     new instance.
