# Enable stop protection for your EC2 instances

To prevent an instance from being accidentally stopped, you can enable stop protection
for the instance. Stop protection also protects your instance from accidental
termination.

The `DisableApiStop` attribute of the Amazon EC2 [`ModifyInstanceAttribute`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceAttribute.html) API controls whether the instance
can be stopped by using the Amazon EC2 console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon EC2 API. You can set the
value of this attribute when you launch the instance, while the instance is running, or
while the instance is stopped.

###### Considerations

- Enabling stop protection does not prevent you from accidentally stopping an
instance by initiating a shutdown from the instance using an operating system
command such as **shutdown** or
**poweroff**.

- Enabling stop protection does not prevent AWS from stopping the instance
when there is a [scheduled event](monitoring-instances-status-check-sched.md) to stop the instance.

- Enabling stop protection does not prevent Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from terminating an
instance when the instance is unhealthy or during scale-in events. You can
control whether an Auto Scaling group can terminate a particular instance when
scaling in by using [instance scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html).

- Stop protection not only prevents your instance from being accidentally
stopped, but also from accidental termination when using the console, AWS CLI, or
API. However, it does not automatically set the
`DisableApiTermination` attribute. Note that when the
`DisableApiStop` attribute is set to `false`, the
`DisableApiTermination` attribute setting determines whether the
instance can be terminated using the console, AWS CLI, or API. For more
information see [Terminate Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html).

- You can't enable stop protection for an instance with an instance store root
volume.

- You can't enable stop protection for Spot Instances.

- The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model when you enable or disable
stop protection. This means that the result of running commands to set the stop
protection attribute might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands
you run. For more information, see [Eventual\
consistency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Developer_
_Guide_.

## Enable stop protection for an instance at launch

You can enable stop protection for an instance when launching the instance.

Console

###### To enable stop protection for an instance at launch

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the dashboard, choose **Launch**
**instance**.

3. Configure your instance in the [new launch instance\
    wizard](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md).

4. In the wizard, enable stop protection by choosing
    **Enable** for **Stop**
**protection** under **Advanced**
**details**.

AWS CLI

###### To enable stop protection for an instance at launch

Use the [run-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command to launch the instance. Add the
following parameter.

```nohighlight

--disable-api-stop
```

PowerShell

###### To enable stop protection for an instance at launch

Use the [New-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet to launch the instance. Add the
following parameter.

```powershell

-DisableApiStop $true
```

## Enable stop protection for a running or stopped instance

You can enable stop protection for an instance while the instance is running or
stopped.

Console

###### To enable stop protection for an instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select the instance, and then choose
    **Actions** > **Instance**
**settings** > **Change stop**
**protection**.

4. Select the **Enable** checkbox, and then
    choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

###### To enable stop protection for an instance

Use the [modify-instance-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --disable-api-stop
```

PowerShell

###### To enable stop protection for an instance

Use the [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute.html) cmdlet.

```powershell

Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute `
    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -DisableApiStop $true
```

## Disable stop protection for a running or stopped instance

You can disable stop protection for a running or stopped instance using one of the
following methods.

Console

###### To disable stop protection for a running or stopped instance

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Instances**.

3. Select the instance, and then choose
    **Actions**, **Instance**
**settings**, **Change stop**
**protection**.

4. Clear the **Enable** checkbox, and then
    choose **Save**.

AWS CLI

###### To disable stop protection for a running or stopped instance

Use the [modify-instance-attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
    --no-disable-api-stop
```

PowerShell

###### To disable stop protection for an instance

Use the [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute.html) cmdlet.

    -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 `
    -DisableApiStop $false
