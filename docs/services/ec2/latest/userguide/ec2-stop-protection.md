# Enable stop protection for your EC2 instances
<a name="ec2-stop-protection"></a>

To prevent an instance from being accidentally stopped, you can enable stop protection for the instance. Stop protection also protects your instance from accidental termination.

The `DisableApiStop` attribute of the Amazon EC2 [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceAttribute.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceAttribute.html) API controls whether the instance can be stopped by using the Amazon EC2 console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon EC2 API. You can set the value of this attribute when you launch the instance, while the instance is running, or while the instance is stopped.

**Considerations**
+ Enabling stop protection does not prevent you from accidentally stopping an instance by initiating a shutdown from the instance using an operating system command such as **shutdown** or **poweroff**.
+ Enabling stop protection does not prevent AWS from stopping the instance when there is a [scheduled event](monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.md) to stop the instance.
+ Enabling stop protection does not prevent Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from terminating an instance when the instance is unhealthy or during scale-in events. You can control whether an Auto Scaling group can terminate a particular instance when scaling in by using [instance scale-in protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html).
+ Stop protection not only prevents your instance from being accidentally stopped, but also from accidental termination when using the console, AWS CLI, or API. However, it does not automatically set the `DisableApiTermination` attribute. Note that when the `DisableApiStop` attribute is set to `false`, the `DisableApiTermination` attribute setting determines whether the instance can be terminated using the console, AWS CLI, or API. For more information see [Terminate Amazon EC2 instances](terminating-instances.md).
+ You can't enable stop protection for an instance with an instance store root volume.
+ You can't enable stop protection for Spot Instances.
+ The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model when you enable or disable stop protection. This means that the result of running commands to set the stop protection attribute might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. For more information, see [Eventual consistency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Developer Guide*.
