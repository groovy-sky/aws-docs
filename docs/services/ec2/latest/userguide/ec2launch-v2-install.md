## Automatically install and update EC2Launch v2 with AWS Systems Manager Distributor Quick Setup

With AWS Systems Manager Distributor Quick Setup, you can set up automatic updates for EC2Launch v2. The
following process sets up a Systems Manager Association on your instance that automatically updates
the EC2Launch v2 agent at a frequency that you specify. The Association that the Distributor
Quick Setup creates can include instances within an AWS account and Region, or instances
within an AWS Organization. For more information about setting up an organization,
see [Tutorial: Creating and configuring an organization](../../../organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-tutorials-basic.md) in the _AWS Organizations User_
_Guide_.

Before you begin, make sure that your instances meet all of the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

To set up automatic updates with Distributor Quick Setup, your instances must meet
the following prerequisites.

- You have at least one running instance that supports EC2Launch v2. See supported
operating systems for [EC2Launch v2](ec2launch-v2.md).

[Setting up Systems Manager](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up-ec2.md) in the _AWS Systems Manager User_
_Guide_.

- EC2Launch v2 must be the only launch agent installed on your instance. If you have more
than one launch agent installed, your Distributor Quick Setup configuration will fail.
Before you configure EC2Launch v2 with a Distributor Quick Setup, uninstall
EC2Config or EC2Launch v1 launch agents, if they exist.

### Configure Distributor Quick Setup for EC2Launch v2

To create a configuration for EC2Launch v2 with Distributor Quick Setup, use the following

## EC2Launch v2 downloads on Amazon S3

To install the latest version of EC2Launch v2, download the installer from the following location:

- [https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-ec2launch-v2/windows/amd64/latest/AmazonEC2Launch.msi](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-ec2launch-v2/windows/amd64/latest/AmazonEC2Launch.msi)

## Configure install options

When you install or upgrade EC2Launch v2, you can configure installation options
with the EC2Launch v2 install dialog or with the **msiexec** command
in a command line shell.

The first time the EC2Launch v2 installer runs on an instance, it initializes
launch agent settings on your instance as follows:

- It creates the local path and writes the launch agent file to it.
This is sometimes referred to as a _clean install_.

- It creates the `EC2LAUNCH_TELEMETRY` environment variable
if it doesn't already exist, and sets it based on your configuration.

For configuration details, select the tab that matches the configuration method
that you'll use.

Amazon EC2Launch Setup dialog

When you install or upgrade EC2Launch v2, you can configure the following
installation options through the EC2Launch v2 install dialog.

###### **Basic Install** options

**Send Telemetry**

When you include this feature in the setup dialog, the installer sets
the `EC2LAUNCH_TELEMETRY` environment variable to a value of
`1`. If you disable **Send Telemetry**,
the installer sets the environment variable to a value of `0`.

When the EC2Launch v2 agent runs, it reads the `EC2LAUNCH_TELEMETRY`
environment variable to determine whether to upload telemetry data. If the value
equals `1`, it uploads the data. Otherwise, it doesn't upload.

**Default configuration**

The default configuration for EC2Launch v2 is to overwrite the
local launch agent if it exists already. The first time you run
an install on an instance, the default configuration performs a
clean install. If you disable the default configuration on the
initial install, the installation fails.

If you run the install again on the instance, you can disable the
default configuration to perform an upgrade that doesn't replace the
`%ProgramData%/Amazon/EC2Launch/config/agent-config.yml`
file.

###### Example: Upgrade EC2Launch v2 with telemetry

The following example shows the EC2Launch v2 setup dialog configured to upgrade
the current installation and enable telemetry. This configuration performs an
install without replacing the agent configuration file, and sets the
`EC2LAUNCH_TELEMETRY` environment variable to a value of `1`.

![EC2Launch v2 upgrade configuration.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/ec2launchv2-clean-default-config.png)

Command line

When you install or upgrade EC2Launch v2, you can configure the following installation
options with the **msiexec** command in a command line shell.

###### `ADDLOCAL` parameter values

**Basic** (required)

Install the launch agent. If this value is not present in the
`ADDLOCAL` parameter, the installation ends.

**Clean**

When you include the `Clean` value in the
`ADDLOCAL` parameter, the installer writes the agent configuration
file to the following location:
`%ProgramData%/Amazon/EC2Launch/config/agent-config.yml`.
If the agent configuration file already exists, it overwrites the file.

When you leave the `Clean` value out of the `ADDLOCAL`
parameter, the installer performs an upgrade that doesn't replace the agent
configuration file.

**Telemetry**

When you include the `Telemetry` value in the `ADDLOCAL`
parameter, the installer sets the `EC2LAUNCH_TELEMETRY` environment
variable to a value of `1`.

When you leave the `Telemetry` value out of the `ADDLOCAL`
parameter, the installer sets the environment variable to a value of `0`.

When the EC2Launch v2 agent runs, it reads the `EC2LAUNCH_TELEMETRY`
environment variable to determine whether to upload telemetry data. If the value
equals `1`, it uploads the data. Otherwise, it doesn't upload.

**Example: install EC2Launch v2 with telemetry**

```sh

& msiexec /i "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\EC2Launchv2\AmazonEC2Launch.msi" ADDLOCAL="Basic,Clean,Telemetry" /q
```
