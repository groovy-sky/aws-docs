# Amazon CloudWatch alarm action scenarios

You can use the Amazon EC2 console to create alarm actions that stop or terminate an Amazon EC2
instance when certain conditions are met. In the following screen capture of the console page
where you set the alarm actions, we've numbered the settings. We've also numbered the settings
in the scenarios that follow, to help you create the appropriate actions.
