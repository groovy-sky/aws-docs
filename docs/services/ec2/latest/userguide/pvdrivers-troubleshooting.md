## Windows Server 2012 R2 loses network and storage connectivity after an instance reboot

###### Important

This issue occurs only with AMIs made available before September 2014.

Windows Server 2012 R2 Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) made available before
September 10, 2014 can lose network and storage connectivity after an instance
reboot. The error in the AWS Management Console system log states: “Difficulty detecting PV
driver details for Console Output.” The connectivity loss is caused by the Plug and
Play Cleanup feature. This features scans for and disables inactive system devices
every 30 days. The feature incorrectly identifies the EC2 network device as inactive
and removes it from the system. When this happens, the instance loses network
connectivity after a reboot.

For systems that you suspect could be affected by this issue, you can download and
run an in-place driver upgrade. If you are unable to perform the in-place driver
upgrade, you can run a helper script. The script determines if your instance is
affected. If it is affected, and the Amazon EC2 network device has not been removed, the
script disables the Plug and Play Cleanup scan. If the network device was removed,
the script repairs the device, disables the Plug and Play Cleanup scan, and enables
your instance to reboot with network connectivity enabled.

### Choose how to fix problems

There are two methods for restoring network and storage connectivity to an
instance affected by this issue. Choose one of the following methods:

MethodPrerequisitesProcedure OverviewMethod 1 - Enhanced networkingEnhanced networking is only available in a virtual private
cloud (VPC) which requires a C3 instance type. If the server
does not currently use the C3 instance type, then you must
temporarily change it.You change the server instance type to a C3 instance.
Enhanced networking then enables you to connect to the affected
instance and fix the problem. After you fix the problem, you
change the instance back to the original instance type. This
method is typically faster than Method 2 and less likely to
result in user error. You will incur additional charges as long
as the C3 instance is running.Method 2 - Registry configurationAbility to create or access a second server. Ability to
change Registry settings.You detach the root volume from the affected instance, attach
it to a different instance, connect, and make changes in the
Registry. You will incur additional charges as long as the
additional server is running. This method is slower than Method
1, but this method has worked in situations where Method 1
failed to resolve the problem.

### Method 1 - Enhanced networking

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

03. Locate the affected instance. Select the instance and choose
     **Instance state**, and then choose **Stop**
    **instance**.

    ###### Warning

    When you stop an instance, the data on instance store volumes is lost.
    To preserve this data, back it up to persistent storage.

04. After the instance is stopped, create a backup. Select the instance
     and choose **Actions**, then **Image and**
    **templates**, and then choose **Create**
    **image**.

05. [Change](ec2-instance-resize.md) the instance type to
     any C3 instance type.

06. [Start](stop-start.md) the instance.

07. Connect to the instance using Remote Desktop and then
     [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/AWSPV/Latest/AWSPVDriver.zip) the AWS PV Drivers Upgrade package to the
     instance.

08. Extract the contents of the folder and run
     `AWSPVDriverSetup.msi`.

    After running the MSI, the instance automatically reboots and then
     upgrades the drivers. The instance will not be available for up to 15
     minutes.

09. After the upgrade is complete and the instance passes both health
     checks in the Amazon EC2 console, connect to the instance using Remote
     Desktop and verify that the new drivers were installed. In Device
     Manager, under **Storage Controllers**, locate
     **AWS PV Storage Host Adapter**. Verify that the
     driver version is the same as the latest version listed in the Driver
     Version History table. For more information, see [AWS PV driver package history](xen-drivers-overview.md#pv-driver-history).

10. Stop the instance and change the instance back to its original
     instance type.

11. Start the instance and resume normal use.

### Method 2 - Registry configuration

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

03. Locate the affected instance. Select the instance, choose
     **Instance state**, and then choose **Stop**
    **instance**.

    ###### Warning

    When you stop an instance, the data on instance store volumes is lost.
    To preserve this data, back it up to persistent storage.

04. Choose **Launch instances** and create a temporary
     Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2012 instance in the same
     Availability Zone as the affected instance. Do not create a Windows
     Server 2012 R2 instance.

    ###### Important

    If you do not create the instance in the same Availability Zone as
    the affected instance you will not be able to attach the root volume
    of the affected instance to the new instance.

05. In the navigation pane, choose **Volumes**.

06. Locate the root volume of the affected instance. Detach the volume and
     then attach the volume to the temporary instance that you created
     earlier. Attach it with the default device name (xvdf).

07. Use Remote Desktop to connect to the temporary instance, and then use
     the Disk Management utility to make the volume available for use.

08. On the temporary instance, open the **Run** dialog
     box, type `regedit`, and press Enter.

09. In the Registry Editor navigation pane, choose
     **HKEY\_Local\_Machine**, and then from the
     **File** menu choose **Load**
    **Hive**.

10. In the **Load Hive** dialog box, navigate to
     _Affected Volume_\\Windows\\System32\\config\\System
     and type a temporary name in the **Key Name** dialog
     box. For example, enter OldSys.

11. In the navigation pane of the Registry Editor, locate the following
     keys:

    **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\ `your_temporary_key_name`\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Class\\4d36e97d-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318**

    **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\ `your_temporary_key_name`\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Class\\4d36e96a-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318**

12. For each key, double-click **UpperFilters**, enter a
     value of XENFILT, and then choose **OK**.

    ![Registry key for affected volume.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/troubleshooting-server2012R2-regedit.png)

13. Locate the following key:

    **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\ `your_temporary_key_name`\\ControlSet001\\Services\\XENBUS\\Parameters**

14. Create a new string (REG\_SZ) with the name ActiveDevice and the
     following value:

    **PCI\\VEN\_5853&DEV\_0001&SUBSYS\_00015853&REV\_01**

15. Locate the following key:

    **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\ `your_temporary_key_name`\\ControlSet001\\Services\\XENBUS**

16. Change the **Count** from 0 to 1.

17. Locate and delete the following keys:

    **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\ `your_temporary_key_name`\\ControlSet001\\Services\\xenvbd\\StartOverride**

    **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE**
    **\ `your_temporary_key_name`\\ControlSet001\\Services\\xenfilt\\StartOverride**

18. In the Registry Editor navigation pane, choose the temporary key that
     you created when you first opened the Registry Editor.

19. From the **File** menu, choose **Unload**
    **Hive**.

20. In the Disk Management Utility, choose the drive you attached earlier,
     open the context (right-click) menu, and choose
     **Offline**.

21. In the Amazon EC2 console, detach the affected volume from the
     temporary instance and reattach it to your Windows Server 2012 R2
     instance with the device name /dev/sda1. You must specify this device
     name to designate the volume as a root volume.

22. [Start](stop-start.md) the instance.

23. Connect to the instance using Remote Desktop and then
     [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-windows-drivers-downloads/AWSPV/Latest/AWSPVDriver.zip) the AWS PV Drivers Upgrade package to the
     instance.

24. Extract the contents of the folder and run
     `AWSPVDriverSetup.msi`.

    After running the MSI, the instance automatically reboots and then
     upgrades the drivers. The instance will not be available for up to 15
     minutes.

25. After the upgrade is complete and the instance passes both health
     checks in the Amazon EC2 console, connect to the instance using Remote
     Desktop and verify that the new drivers were installed. In Device
     Manager, under **Storage Controllers**, locate
     **AWS PV Storage Host Adapter**. Verify that the
     driver version is the same as the latest version listed in the Driver
     Version History table. For more information, see [AWS PV driver package history](xen-drivers-overview.md#pv-driver-history).

26. Delete or stop the temporary instance you created in this
     procedure.

### Run the remediation script

If you are unable to perform an in-place driver upgrade or migrate to a newer
instance you can run the remediation script to fix the problems caused by the
Plug and Play Cleanup task.

###### To run the remediation script

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance for which you want to run the remediation script.
    Choose **Instance state**, and then choose
    **Stop instance**.

###### Warning

When you stop an instance, the data on instance store volumes is lost.
To preserve this data, back it up to persistent storage.

4. After the instance is stopped, create a backup. Select the instance,
    choose **Actions**, then **Image and**
**templates**, and then choose **Create**
**image**.

5. Choose **Instance state**, and then choose
    **Start instance**.

6. Connect to the instance by using Remote Desktop and
    then [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/Scripts/RemediateDriverIssue.zip) the RemediateDriverIssue.zip folder to the
    instance.

7. Extract the contents of the folder.

8. Run the remediation script according to the instructions in the
    Readme.txt file. The file is located in the folder where you extracted
    RemediateDriverIssue.zip.

## TCP offloading

###### Important

This issue does not apply to instances running AWS PV or Intel network
drivers.

By default, TCP offloading is enabled for the Citrix PV drivers in Windows AMIs.
If you encounter transport-level errors or packet transmission errors (as visible on
the Windows Performance Monitor)—for example, when you're running certain SQL
workloads—you may need to disable this feature.

###### Warning

Disabling TCP offloading may reduce the network performance of your
instance.

###### To disable TCP offloading for Windows Server 2012 and 2008

01. Connect to your instance and log in as the local administrator.

02. If you're using Windows Server 2012, press **Ctrl+Esc**
     to access the **Start** screen, and then choose
     **Control Panel**. If you're using Windows Server 2008,
     choose **Start** and select **Control**
    **Panel**.

03. Choose **Network and Internet**, then **Network**
    **and Sharing Center**.

04. Choose **Change adapter settings**.

05. Right-click **Citrix PV Ethernet Adapter #0** and select
     **Properties**.

    ![Local area connection properties.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/citrix-local-area-conn.png)

06. In the **Local Area Connection Properties** dialog box,
     choose **Configure** to open the **Citrix PV**
    **Ethernet Adapter #0 Properties** dialog box.

07. On the **Advanced** tab, disable each of the properties,
     except for **Correct TCP/UDP Checksum Value**. To disable a
     property, select it from **Property** and choose
     **Disabled** from **Value**.

08. Choose **OK**.

09. Run the following commands from a Command Prompt window.

    ```nohighlight

    netsh int ip set global taskoffload=disabled
    netsh int tcp set global chimney=disabled
    netsh int tcp set global rss=disabled
    netsh int tcp set global netdma=disabled
    ```

10. Reboot the instance.

## Time synchronization

Prior to the release of the 2013.02.13 Windows AMI, the Citrix Xen guest agent
could set the system time incorrectly. This can cause your DHCP lease to expire. If
you have issues connecting to your instance, you might need to update the
agent.

To determine whether you have the updated Citrix Xen guest agent, check whether
the `C:\Program Files\Citrix\XenGuestAgent.exe` file is from
March 2013. If the date on this file is earlier than that, update the Citrix Xen
guest agent service. For more information, see [Upgrade your Citrix Xen guest agent service](upgrading-pv-drivers.md#citrix-pv-guest-agent-upgrade).

## Workloads that leverage more than 20,000 disk IOPS experience degradation due to CPU bottlenecks

You can be affected by this issue if you are using Windows instances running AWS
PV drivers that leverage more than 20,000 IOPS, and you experience bug check code
`0x9E: USER_MODE_HEALTH_MONITOR`.

Disk reads and writes (IOs) in the AWS PV drivers occur in two phases: **IO preparation** and **IO**
**completion**. By default, the preparation phase runs on a single
arbitrary core. The completion phase runs on core `0`. The amount of
computation required to process an IO varies based on it size and other properties.
Some IOs use more computation in the preparation phase, and others in the completion
phase. When an instance drives more than 20,000 IOPS, the preparation or completion
phase may result in a bottleneck, where the CPU upon which it runs is at 100%
capacity. Whether or not the preparation or completion phase becomes a bottleneck
depends on the properties of the IOs used by the application.

Starting with AWS PV drivers 8.4.0, the load of the preparation phase and the
completion phase can be distributed across multiple cores, eliminating bottlenecks.
Each application uses different IO properties. Therefore, applying one of the
following configurations may raise, lower, or not impact the performance of your
application. After you apply any of these configurations, monitor the application to
verify that it is meeting your desired performance.

1. ###### Prerequisites

Before you begin this troubleshooting procedure, verify the following
    prerequisites:

- Your instance uses AWS PV drivers version 8.4.0 or later. To
upgrade, see [Upgrade PV drivers on EC2 Windows instances](upgrading-pv-drivers.md).

- You have RDP access to the instance. For steps to connect to your
Windows instance using RDP, see [Connect to your Windows instance using an RDP client](connect-rdp.md).

- You have administrator access on the instance.

2. ###### Observe CPU load on your instance

You can use Windows Task Manager to view the load on each CPU to determine
    potential bottlenecks to disk IO.

01. Verify that your application is running and handling traffic
     similar to your production workload.

02. Connect to your instance using RDP.

03. Choose the **Start** menu on your
     instance.

04. Enter `Task Manager` in the **Start**
     menu to open Task Manager.

05. If Task Manager displays the Summary View, choose **More**
    **details** to expand the detailed view.

06. Choose the **Performance** tab.

07. Select **CPU** in the left pane.

08. Right-click on the graph in the main pane and select
     **Change graph to** > **Logical**
    **processors** to display each individual core.

09. Depending on how many cores are on your instance, you may see
     lines displaying CPU load over time, or you may just see a
     number.

- If you see graphs displaying load over time, look for CPUs
where the box is almost entirely shaded.

- If you see a number on each core, look for cores that
consistently show 95% or greater.

10. Note whether core `0` or a different core is
     experiencing a heavy load.

3. ###### Choose which configuration to apply

Configuration nameWhen to apply this configurationNotes[Default configuration](#default-config)Workload is driving less than 20,000 IOPS, or other
configurations did not improve performance or
stability.

For this configuration, IO occurs on a few cores,
which may benefit smaller workloads by increasing cache
locality and reducing context switching.

[Allow driver to choose whether to distribute completion](#allow-driver)Workload is driving more than 20,000 IOPS and moderate or
high load is observed on core `0`.This configuration is recommended for all Xen instances
using PV 8.4.0 or later and leveraging more than 20,000
IOPS, whether or not problems are encountered.[Distribute both preparation and completion](#distribute-both)Workload is driving more than 20,000 IOPS, and either
allowing the driver to choose the distribution did not
improve performance, or a core other than `0` is
experiencing a high load.This configuration enables distribution of both IO
preparation and IO completion.

###### Note

We recommend that you do not distribute IO preparation without also
distributing IO completion (setting `DpcRedirection` without
setting `NotifierDistributed`) because the completion phase
is sensitive to overload by the preparation phase when the preparation
phase is running in parallel.

###### Registry key values

- _NotifierDistributed_

Value `0` or not present — The completion phase
will run on core `0`.

Value `1` — The driver chooses to run the
completion phase or core `0` or one additional core per
attached disk.

Value `2` — The driver runs the completion phase
on one additional core per attached disk.

- _DpcRedirection_

Value `0` or not present — The preparation phase
will run on a single, arbitrary core.

Value `1` — The preparation phase is distributed
across multiple cores.

###### Default configuration

Apply the default configuration with AWS PV driver versions prior to
8.4.0, or if performance or stability degradation is observed after
applying one of the other configurations in this section.

1. Connect to your instance using RDP.

2. Open a new PowerShell command prompt as an administrator.

3. Run the following commands to remove the
    `NotifierDistributed` and `DpcRedirection`
    registry keys.

```powershell

Remove-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\xenvbd\Parameters -Name NotifierDistributed
```

```powershell

Remove-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\xenvbd\Parameters -Name DpcRedirection
```

4. Reboot your instance.

###### Allow driver to choose whether to distribute completion

Set `NotiferDistributed` registry key to allow the PV
storage driver to choose whether or not to distribute IO
completion.

1. Connect to your instance using RDP.

2. Open a new PowerShell command prompt as an administrator.

3. Run the following command to set the
    `NotiferDistributed` registry key.

```powershell

Set-ItemProperty -Type DWORD -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\xenvbd\Parameters -Value 0x00000001 -Name NotifierDistributed
```

4. Reboot your instance.

###### Distribute both preparation and completion

Set `NotifierDistributed` and `DpcRedirection`
registry keys to always distribute both the preparation and completion
phases.

1. Connect to your instance using RDP.

2. Open a new PowerShell command prompt as an administrator.

3. Run the following commands to set the
    `NotifierDistributed` and `DpcRedirection`
    registry keys.

```powershell

Set-ItemProperty -Type DWORD -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\xenvbd\Parameters -Value 0x00000002 -Name NotifierDistributed
```

```powershell

Set-ItemProperty -Type DWORD -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\xenvbd\Parameters -Value 0x00000001 -Name DpcRedirection
```

4. Reboot your instance.
