## Allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP
<a name="snp-allocate-dh"></a>

Before you can launch instances with AMD SEV-SNP on a Dedicated Host, you must allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP support enabled. You allocate a Dedicated Host by instance family (for example, m6a, r6a, or c6a), and then you can run any supported instance type from that family on the host. You can allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP in any commercial AWS Region.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP enabled**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dedicated Hosts**.

1. Choose **Allocate Dedicated Host**.

1. For **AMD SEV-SNP**, choose **Enable**.

1. Configure the remaining host settings as needed, and then choose **Allocate**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP enabled**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-hosts.html) command with the `--instance-type` and `--cpu-options` parameters.

```
aws ec2 allocate-hosts \
    --instance-type "{{m6a.large}}" \
    --availability-zone "{{us-east-1a}}" \
    --auto-placement "off" \
    --cpu-options AmdSevSnp=enabled \
    --quantity 1
```

The following is example output.

```
{
    "HostIds": [
        "h-0123456789abcdef0"
    ]
}
```

------

**Note**
When you allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP enabled, the host enters a `configuring` state while AWS applies the latest firmware. This can take from a few minutes up to 2 hours. You are charged during the `configuring` state.

## Launch instances on a AMD SEV-SNP Dedicated Host
<a name="snp-launch-instance"></a>

You can launch an instance with AMD SEV-SNP enabled once the Dedicated Host is configured.

**Note**
You can also launch instances without AMD SEV-SNP enabled on a Dedicated Host that was allocated with AMD SEV-SNP. Both AMD SEV-SNP and non-AMD SEV-SNP instances can run alongside each other on the same host.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To launch an instance with AMD SEV-SNP on a Dedicated Host**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command with the `--cpu-options` and `--placement` options. Replace {{h-0123456789abcdef0}} with the ID of your allocated Dedicated Host.

```
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --instance-type {{m6a.xlarge}} \
    --image-id {{ami-0123456789example}} \
    --cpu-options AmdSevSnp=enabled \
    --placement HostId={{h-0123456789abcdef0}}
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To launch an instance with AMD SEV-SNP on a Dedicated Host**
Use the [New-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet with the `-CpuOption` and `-Placement_HostId` parameters.

```
New-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceType {{m6a.xlarge}} `
    -ImageId {{ami-0123456789example}} `
    -CpuOption @{AmdSevSnp="enabled"} `
    -Placement_HostId {{h-0123456789abcdef0}}
```

## Update firmware on a AMD SEV-SNP Dedicated Host
<a name="snp-firmware"></a>

When you allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP enabled, AWS applies the latest available firmware to the host. Firmware updates can include security patches and feature improvements from AMD.

To apply firmware updates, allocate a new host (which receives the latest firmware), move your instances to the new host, and then release the old host.

1. Allocate a new Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP enabled. The new host receives the latest available firmware. For more information, see [Allocate a Dedicated Host with AMD SEV-SNP](#snp-allocate-dh).

1. Stop the running instances on the old Dedicated Host.

   ```
   aws ec2 stop-instances \
       --instance-ids {{i-0123456789example}}
   ```

1. Modify the instance placement to target the new Dedicated Host. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-placement.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-placement.html) command.

   ```
   aws ec2 modify-instance-placement \
       --instance-id {{i-0123456789example}} \
       --host-id {{h-09876543210abcdef}}
   ```

1. Start the instances on the new Dedicated Host.

   ```
   aws ec2 start-instances \
       --instance-ids {{i-0123456789example}}
   ```

1. Release the old Dedicated Host. Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/release-hosts.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/release-hosts.html) command.

   ```
   aws ec2 release-hosts \
       --host-ids {{h-0123456789abcdef0}}
   ```

**Note**
You receive maintenance notifications for your Dedicated Hosts the same way you receive them for other Dedicated Host maintenance events. When you receive a notification, follow the preceding steps to move to a new host with updated firmware.

## Launch an instance with AMD SEV-SNP on shared tenancy
<a name="snp-shared-tenancy"></a>

You can launch an instance with AMD SEV-SNP on shared tenancy in US East (Ohio) and Europe (Ireland).

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To launch an instance with AMD SEV-SNP on shared tenancy**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command with the `--cpu-options` option.

```
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --instance-type {{m6a.xlarge}} \
    --image-id {{ami-0123456789example}} \
    --cpu-options AmdSevSnp=enabled
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To launch an instance with AMD SEV-SNP on shared tenancy**
Use the [New-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet with the `-CpuOption` parameter.

```
New-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceType {{m6a.xlarge}} `
    -ImageId {{ami-0123456789example}} `
    -CpuOption @{AmdSevSnp="enabled"}
```

## Check if an EC2 instance is enabled for AMD SEV-SNP
<a name="snp-work-check"></a>

You can find instances that are enabled for AMD SEV-SNP. The Amazon EC2 console does not display this information.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To check whether AMD SEV-SNP is enabled for an instance**
Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) command.

```
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --instance-ids {{i-1234567890abcdef0}} \
    --query Reservations[].Instances[].CpuOptions
```

The following is example output. If `AmdSevSnp` is not present in `CpuOptions`, then AMD SEV-SNP is disabled.

```
[
    {
        "AmdSevSnp": "enabled",
        "CoreCount": 1,
        "ThreadsPerCore": 2
    }
]
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To check whether AMD SEV-SNP is enabled for an instance**
Use the [Get-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet.

```
(Get-EC2Instance `
    -InstanceId {{i-1234567890abcdef0}}).Instances.CpuOptions
```

The following is example output. If the value of `AmdSevSnp` is not present, then AMD SEV-SNP is disabled.

```
AmdSevSnp CoreCount ThreadsPerCore
--------- --------- --------------
enabled   1         2
```

------
#### [ AWS CloudTrail ]

In the AWS CloudTrail event for the instance launch request, the following property indicates that AMD SEV-SNP is enabled for the instance.

```
"cpuOptions": {"AmdSevSnp": "enabled"}
```
