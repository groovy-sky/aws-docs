<a name="ec2-fleet-configuration-strategies"></a>

When planning your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet, we recommend that you consider the following options when deciding how to configure your fleet.

****

| Configuration option | Question | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fleet request type | Do you want a fleet that submits a one-time request for the desired target capacity, or a fleet that maintains target capacity over time? | [EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet request types](ec2-fleet-request-type.md) |
| Spot Instances | Do you plan to include Spot Instances in your fleet? Review the Spot best practices and use them when you plan your fleet so that you can provision the instances at the lowest possible price. | [Best practices for Amazon EC2 Spot](spot-best-practices.md) |
| Spending limit for your fleet | Do you want to limit how much you'll pay for your fleet per hour? | [Set a spending limit for your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet](ec2-fleet-control-spending.md) |
| Instance types and attribute-based instance type selection | Do you want to specify the instance types in your fleet, or let Amazon EC2 select the instance types that meet your application requirements? | [Specify attributes for instance type selection for EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet](ec2-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.md) |
| Instance weighting | Do you want to assign weights to each instance type to represent their compute capacity and performance, so that Amazon EC2 can select any combination of available instance types to fulfil your desired target capacity? | [Use instance weighting to manage cost and performance of your EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet](ec2-fleet-instance-weighting.md) |
| Allocation strategies | Do you want to decide whether to optimize for available capacity, price, or instance types to use for the Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in your fleet? | [Use allocation strategies to determine how EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet fulfills Spot and On-Demand capacity](ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.md) |
| Capacity Rebalancing | Do you want your fleet to automatically replace at-risk Spot Instances? | [Use Capacity Rebalancing in EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet to replace at-risk Spot Instances](ec2-fleet-capacity-rebalance.md) |
| On-Demand Capacity Reservation | Do you want to reserve capacity for the On-Demand Instances in your fleet? | [Use Capacity Reservations to reserve On-Demand capacity in EC2 Fleet](ec2-fleet-on-demand-capacity-reservations.md) |
