# Data persistence for Amazon EC2 instance store volumes

Instance store volumes are attached only at instance launch. You can't attach instance
store volumes after launch. You can’t detach an instance store volume from one instance and
attach it to a different instance.

An instance store volume exists only during the lifetime of the instance to which it is
attached. You can’t configure an instance store volume to persist beyond the lifetime of its
associated instance.

The data on an instance store volume persists even if the instance is rebooted. However,
the data does not persist if the instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated. When the
instance is stopped, hibernated, or terminated, every block of the instance store volume is
cryptographically erased.

Therefore, do not rely on instance store volumes for valuable, long-term data. If you
need to retain the data stored on an instance store volume beyond the lifetime of the instance,
you need to manually copy that data to more persistent storage, such as an Amazon EBS volume, an
Amazon S3 bucket, or an Amazon EFS file system.

There are some events that can result in your data not persisting throughout the
lifetime of the instance. The following table indicates whether data on instance store
volumes is persisted during specific events, for both virtualized and bare metal
instances.

\\* If the new instance type supports instance store, the instance gets the number
of instance store volumes supported by the new instance type, but the data does not
transfer to the new instance. If the new instance type does not support instance
store, the instance does not get the instance store volumes.

\\*\\* The data is not included in the EBS-backed AMI, and it is not included on
instance store volumes attached to instances launched from that AMI.

\\*\\*\\* The data is included in the AMI bundle that is uploaded to Amazon S3. When you
launch an instance from that AMI, the instance gets the instance store volumes
bundled in the AMI with the data they contained at the time the AMI was created.

† Termination protection and stop protection do not protect instances against
instance stops or terminations as a result of shutdowns initiated through the
operating system on the instance. Data stored on instance store volumes does not
persist in both instance stop and termination events.
