# AMI billing information fields

The following fields provide billing information associated with an AMI:

Platform details

The platform details associated with the billing code of the AMI. For
example, `Red Hat Enterprise Linux`.

Usage operation

The operation of the Amazon EC2 instance and the billing code that
is associated with the AMI. For example, `RunInstances:0010`.
**Usage operation** corresponds to the [lineitem/Operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/Lineitem-columns.html#Lineitem-details-O-Operation) column on your AWS Cost and Usage Report
(CUR) and in the [AWS Price List\
API](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/price-changes.md).

You can view these fields on the **Instances** or **AMIs**
page in the Amazon EC2 console, or in the response that is returned by the [describe-images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html) or
[Get-EC2Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Image.html) command.

## Sample data: usage operation by platform

The following table lists some of the platform details and usage operation values that can
be displayed on the **Instances** or **AMIs**
pages in the Amazon EC2 console, or in the response that is returned by the [describe-images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html) or
[Get-EC2Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Image.html)
command.

1 If two software licenses are associated with an AMI, the **Platform**
**details** field shows both.

2 If you are running Spot Instances, the [lineitem/Operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/Lineitem-columns.html#Lineitem-details-O-Operation) on your AWS Cost and Usage Report might be
different from the **Usage operation** value that is listed here. For
example, if `lineitem/Operation` displays
`RunInstances:0010:SV006`, it means that Amazon EC2 is running Red Hat Enterprise
Linux Spot Instance-hour in US East (N. Virginia) in Zone 6.

3 This appears as RunInstances (Linux/UNIX) in
your usage reports.
