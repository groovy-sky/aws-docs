# Run commands when you launch an EC2 instance with user data input

When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance, you can pass user data to the instance that
is used to perform automated configuration tasks, or to run scripts after the instance
starts.

If you're interested in more complex automation scenarios, you might consider CloudFormation.
For more information, see [Deploying applications \
on Amazon EC2 with CloudFormation](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/deploying-applications.md) in the _AWS CloudFormation User Guide_.

On Linux instances, you can pass two types of user data to Amazon EC2: shell
scripts and cloud-init directives. You can also pass this data into the launch instance
wizard as plain text, as a file (this is useful for launching instances with the
command line tools), or as base64-encoded text (for API calls).

On Windows instances, the launch agents handle your user data scripts.

###### Considerations

- User data is treated as opaque data: what you give is what you get back. It is up
to the instance to interpret it.

- User data must be base64-encoded. The Amazon EC2 console can perform the base64-encoding
for your or accept base64-encoded input. If you retrieve the user data using instance
metadata or the console, it's base64-decoded for you automatically.

- User data is limited to 16 KB, in raw form, before it is base64-encoded. The size
of a string of length _n_ after base64-encoding is
ceil( _n_/3)\*4.

- User data is an instance attribute. If you create an AMI from an instance, the
instance user data is not included in the AMI.

## User data in the AWS Management Console

You can specify instance user data when you launch the instance. If the root volume of
the instance is an EBS volume, you can also stop the instance and update its user
data.

### Specify instance user data at launch with the Launch Wizard

You can specify user data when you launch an instance with the Launch Wizard in the EC2 console. To
specify user data on launch, follow the procedure for
[launching an instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md).
The **User data** field is located in the [Advanced details](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-advanced-details) section of the launch instance wizard.
Enter your PowerShell script in the **User data** field, and then
complete the instance launch procedure.

In the following screenshot of the **User data** field, the example script
creates a file in the Windows temporary folder, using the current date and time in
the file name. When you include `<persist>true</persist>`,
the script is run every time you reboot or start the instance. If you leave the
**User data has already been base64 encoded** checkbox empty,
the Amazon EC2 console performs the base64 encoding for you.

![Advance Details user data text field.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/configure_ec2config_userdata.png)

For more information, see Specify instance user data at launch with the Launch Wizard. For a Linux example that
uses the AWS CLI, see [User data and the AWS CLI](#user-data-api-cli). For a Windows example that
uses the Tools for Windows PowerShell, see [User data and the Tools for Windows PowerShell](#user-data-powershell).

### View and update the instance user data

You can view the instance user data for any instance, and you can update the
instance user data for a stopped instance.

###### To update the user data for an instance using the console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance and choose **Actions**,
    **Instance state**, **Stop**
**instance**.

###### Warning

When you stop an instance, the data on instance store volumes is lost.
To preserve this data, back it up to persistent storage.

4. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Stop**. It can
    take a few minutes for the instance to stop.

5. With the instance still selected, choose **Actions**,
    **Instance settings**, **Edit user**
**data**. You can't change the user data if the instance is
    running, but you can view it.

6. In the **Edit user data** dialog box, update the user
    data, and then choose **Save**. To run user data scripts
    every time you reboot or start the instance, add
    `<persist>true</persist>`, as shown in the
    following example:

![Edit User Data dialog box.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/view-change-user-data.png)

7. Start the instance. If you enabled user data execution for subsequent
    reboots or starts, the updated user data scripts are run as part of the
    instance start process.

## How Amazon EC2 handles user data for Linux instances

The following examples use user data to run commands that set up a LAMP server
when the instance launches. In each example, the following tasks are performed:

- The distribution software packages are updated.

- The web server, `php`, and `mariadb`
packages are installed.

- The `httpd` service is started and turned on.

- The user `ec2-user` is added to the apache group.

- The appropriate ownership and file permissions are set for the web directory
and the files contained within it.

- A simple web page is created to test the web server and PHP engine.

- [User data and the AWS CLI](#user-data-api-cli)

- [Combine shell scripts and cloud-init directives](#user-data-mime-multi)

### Prerequisites

The examples in this topic assume the following:

- Your instance has a public DNS name that is reachable from the internet.

- The security group associated with your instance is configured to allow SSH (port 22)
traffic so that you can connect to the instance to view the output log files.

- Your instance is launched using an Amazon Linux AMI. The commands and directives
might not work for other Linux distributions. For more information about other
distributions, such as their support for cloud-init, see documentation for
the specific distribution.

### User data and shell scripts

If you are familiar with shell scripting, this is the easiest and most complete
way to send instructions to an instance at launch. Adding these tasks at boot time
adds to the amount of time it takes to boot the instance. You should allow a few
minutes of extra time for the tasks to complete before you test that the user script
has finished successfully.

###### Important

By default, user data scripts and cloud-init directives run only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance.
You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you restart your instance.
For more information, see [How can I utilize user data to automatically run a script with every restart of my Amazon EC2 Linux instance?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/execute-user-data-ec2)
in the AWS Knowledge Center.

User data shell scripts must start with the `#!` characters and the path to the
interpreter you want to read the script (commonly **/bin/bash)**. For
an introduction on shell scripting, see the [Bash Reference\
Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) on the _GNU Operating System_
website.

Scripts entered as user data are run as the root user, so do not use the
**sudo** command in the script. Remember that any files you
create will be owned by the root user; if you need a non-root user to have file access,
you should modify the permissions accordingly in the script. Also, because the
script is not run interactively, you cannot include commands that require user
feedback (such as **yum update** without the `-y`
flag).

If you use an AWS API, including the AWS CLI, in a user data script, you must use an
instance profile when launching the instance. An instance profile provides the
appropriate AWS credentials required by the user data script to issue the API
call. For more information, see [Use instance profiles](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-use-switch-role-ec2-instance-profiles.md) in the IAM User Guide. The permissions you
assign to the IAM role depend on which services you are calling with the API. For
more information, see [IAM roles for Amazon EC2](iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md).

The cloud-init output log file captures console output so it is easy to debug your
scripts following a launch if the instance does not behave the way you intended. To
view the log file, [connect to the instance](connect-to-linux-instance.md)
and open `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.

When a user data script is processed, it is copied to and run from
`/var/lib/cloud/instances/instance-id/`.
The script is not deleted after it is run. Be sure to delete the user data scripts from
`/var/lib/cloud/instances/instance-id/`
before you create an AMI from the instance. Otherwise, the script will exist in this
directory on any instance launched from the AMI.

### Update the instance user data

To update the instance user data, you must first stop the instance. If the instance is
running, you can view the user data but you cannot modify it.

###### Warning

When you stop an instance, the data on instance store volumes is lost.
To preserve this data, back it up to persistent storage.

###### To modify instance user data

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

3. Select the instance and choose **Instance state**, **Stop**
**instance**. If this option is disabled, either the instance is already
    stopped or its root volume is an instance store volume.

4. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Stop**. It can take
    a few minutes for the instance to stop.

5. With the instance still selected, choose **Actions**,
    **Instance settings**, **Edit user data**.

6. Modify the user data as needed, and then choose **Save**.

7. Start the instance. The new user data is visible on your instance after you start it;
    however, user data scripts are not run.

### User data and cloud-init directives

The cloud-init package configures specific aspects of a new Amazon Linux instance when it is
launched; most notably, it configures the `.ssh/authorized_keys`
file for the ec2-user so you can log in with your own private key. For more
information about the configuration tasks that the cloud-init package performs for
Amazon Linux instances, see the following documentation:

- Amazon Linux 2023 – [Customized cloud-init](../../../linux/al2023/ug/cloud-init.md)

- Amazon Linux 2 – [Using cloud-init on Amazon Linux 2](../../../linux/al2/ug/amazon-linux-cloud-init.md)

The cloud-init user directives can be passed to an instance at launch the same way that a
script is passed, although the syntax is different. For more information about
cloud-init, see [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

###### Important

By default, user data scripts and cloud-init directives run only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance.
You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you restart your instance.
For more information, see [How can I utilize user data to automatically run a script with every restart of my Amazon EC2 Linux instance?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/execute-user-data-ec2)
in the AWS Knowledge Center.

Adding these tasks at boot time adds to the amount of time it takes to boot an
instance. You should allow a few minutes of extra time for the tasks to complete
before you test that your user data directives have completed.

###### To pass cloud-init directives to an Amazon Linux instance

1. Follow the procedure for [launching an\
    instance](ec2-launch-instance-wizard.md). The **User data** field is located in
    the [Advanced details](ec2-instance-launch-parameters.md#liw-advanced-details) section of the launch instance
    wizard. Enter your cloud-init directive text in the **User**
**data** field, and then complete the instance launch
    procedure.

In the examples below, the directives create and configure a web server on Amazon Linux. The
    `#cloud-config` line at the top is required in order to
    identify the commands as cloud-init directives.
AL2023

```yaml

#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: all

packages:
- httpd
- mariadb105-server
- php8.1
- php8.1-mysqlnd

runcmd:
- systemctl start httpd
- systemctl enable httpd
- [ sh, -c, "usermod -a -G apache ec2-user" ]
- [ sh, -c, "chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www" ]
- chmod 2775 /var/www
- [ find, /var/www, -type, d, -exec, chmod, 2775, {}, \; ]
- [ find, /var/www, -type, f, -exec, chmod, 0664, {}, \; ]
- [ sh, -c, 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php' ]
```

AL2

```yaml

#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: all

packages:
- httpd
- mariadb-server

runcmd:
- [ sh, -c, "amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2" ]
- systemctl start httpd
- systemctl enable httpd
- [ sh, -c, "usermod -a -G apache ec2-user" ]
- [ sh, -c, "chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www" ]
- chmod 2775 /var/www
- [ find, /var/www, -type, d, -exec, chmod, 2775, {}, \; ]
- [ find, /var/www, -type, f, -exec, chmod, 0664, {}, \; ]
- [ sh, -c, 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php' ]
```

2. Allow enough time for the instance to launch and run the directives in
    your user data, and then check to see that your directives have completed
    the tasks you intended.

For this example, in a web browser, enter the URL of the PHP test file the directives
    created. This URL is the public DNS address of your instance followed by a
    forward slash and the file name.

```nohighlight

http://my.public.dns.amazonaws.com/phpinfo.php
```

You should see the PHP information page. If you are unable to see the PHP information page,
    check that the security group you are using contains a rule to allow HTTP (port 80) traffic.
    For more information, see [Configure security group rules](changing-security-group.md#add-remove-security-group-rules).

3. (Optional) If your directives did not accomplish the tasks you were
    expecting them to, or if you just want to verify that your directives
    completed without errors, [connect \
    to the instance](connect-to-linux-instance.md), examine the output log file
    ( `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`), and look for
    error messages in the output. For additional debugging information, you can
    add the following line to your directives:

```nohighlight

output : { all : '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log' }
```

This directive sends **runcmd** output to
    `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.

### User data and the AWS CLI

You can use the AWS CLI to specify, modify, and view the user data for your instance. For information
about viewing user data from your instance using instance metadata, see [Access instance metadata for an EC2 instance](instancedata-data-retrieval.md).

On Windows, you can use the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell instead of using the AWS CLI. For more information, see
[User data and the Tools for Windows PowerShell](#user-data-powershell) .

###### Example: Specify user data at launch

To specify user data when you launch your instance, use the [run-instances](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.md)
command with the `--user-data` parameter. With **run-instances**, the AWS CLI performs base64 encoding of
the user data for you.

The following example shows how to specify a script as a string on the command line:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abcd1234 --count 1 --instance-type m3.medium \
    --key-name my-key-pair --subnet-id subnet-abcd1234 --security-group-ids sg-abcd1234 \
    --user-data echo user data
```

The following example shows how to specify a script using a text file. Be sure to use the
`file://` prefix to specify the file.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abcd1234 --count 1 --instance-type m3.medium \
    --key-name my-key-pair --subnet-id subnet-abcd1234 --security-group-ids sg-abcd1234 \
    --user-data file://my_script.txt
```

The following is an example text file with a shell script.

```nohighlight

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
```

###### Example: Modify the user data of a stopped instance

You can modify the user data of a stopped instance using the [modify-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.md)
command. With **modify-instance-attribute**, the AWS CLI does not perform base64 encoding of the user data for you.

- On a **Linux** computer, use the base64 command to encode the user data.

```nohighlight

base64 my_script.txt >my_script_base64.txt
```

- On a **Windows** computer, use the certutil command to encode the user data.
Before you can use this file with the AWS CLI, you must remove the first (BEGIN CERTIFICATE) and last
(END CERTIFICATE) lines.

```nohighlight

certutil -encode my_script.txt my_script_base64.txt
notepad my_script_base64.txt
```

Use the `--attribute` and `--value` parameters to use the encoded text file
to specify the user data. Be sure to use the `file://` prefix to specify the file.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --attribute userData --value file://my_script_base64.txt
```

###### Example: Clear the user data of a stopped instance

To delete the existing user data, use the [modify-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.md)
command as follows:

```nohighlight

aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --user-data Value=
```

###### Example: View user data

To retrieve the user data for an instance, use the [describe-instance-attribute](../../../cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instance-attribute.md) command.
With **describe-instance-attribute**, the AWS CLI does not perform base64 decoding of the user data for you.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --attribute userData
```

The following is example output with the user data base64 encoded.

```json

{
    "UserData": {
        "Value": "IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKeXVtIHVwZGF0ZSAteQpzZXJ2aWNlIGh0dHBkIHN0YXJ0CmNoa2NvbmZpZyBodHRwZCBvbg=="
    },
    "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0"
}
```

- On a **Linux** computer , use the `--query` option to get the encoded user data and the
base64 command to decode it.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --attribute userData --output text --query "UserData.Value" | base64 --decode
```

- On a **Windows** computer, use the `--query` option to get the coded user data and the certutil command to
decode it. Note that the encoded output is stored in a file and the decoded output
is stored in another file.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --attribute userData --output text --query "UserData.Value" >my_output.txt
certutil -decode my_output.txt my_output_decoded.txt
type my_output_decoded.txt
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
```

### Combine shell scripts and cloud-init directives

By default, you can include only one content type in user data at a time. However, you can use the
`text/cloud-config` and `text/x-shellscript` content-types in a mime-multi part
file to include both a shell script and cloud-init directives in your user data.

The following shows the mime-multi part format.

```nohighlight

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="//"
MIME-Version: 1.0

--//
Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset="us-ascii"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cloud-config.txt"

#cloud-config
cloud-init directives

--//
Content-Type: text/x-shellscript; charset="us-ascii"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="userdata.txt"

#!/bin/bash
shell script commands
--//--
```

For example, the following user data includes cloud-init directives and a bash shell script.
The cloud-init directives creates a file ( `/test-cloudinit/cloud-init.txt`),
and writes `Created by cloud-init` to that file. The bash shell script creates a file
( `/test-userscript/userscript.txt`) and writes `Created by bash shell script`
to that file.

```nohighlight

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="//"
MIME-Version: 1.0

--//
Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset="us-ascii"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cloud-config.txt"

#cloud-config
runcmd:
- [ mkdir, /test-cloudinit ]
write_files:
- path: /test-cloudinit/cloud-init.txt
content: Created by cloud-init

--//
Content-Type: text/x-shellscript; charset="us-ascii"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="userdata.txt"

#!/bin/bash
mkdir test-userscript
touch /test-userscript/userscript.txt
echo "Created by bash shell script" >> /test-userscript/userscript.txt
--//--
```

## How Amazon EC2 handles user data for Windows instances

On Windows instances, the launch agent performs the tasks related to user data. For more
information, see the following:

- [EC2Launch v2](ec2launch-v2.md)

- [EC2Launch](ec2launch.md)

- [EC2Config service](ec2config-service.md)

For examples of the assembly of a `UserData` property in a CloudFormation template, see
[Base64 Encoded UserData Property](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/quickref-general.md#scenario-userdata-base64) and [Base64 Encoded UserData Property with AccessKey and SecretKey](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/quickref-general.md#scenario-userdata-base64-with-keys).

For an example of running commands on an instance within an Auto Scaling group that works with lifecycle
hooks, see [Tutorial:\
Configure user data to retrieve the target lifecycle state through instance\
metadata](../../../autoscaling/ec2/userguide/tutorial-lifecycle-hook-instance-metadata.md) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide_.

- [User data and the Tools for Windows PowerShell](#user-data-powershell)

### User data scripts

For `EC2Config` or `EC2Launch` to run scripts, you must enclose
the script within a
special tag when you add it to user data. The tag that you use depends on whether the
commands run in a Command Prompt window (batch commands) or use Windows
PowerShell.

If you specify both a batch script and a Windows PowerShell script, the batch script
runs first and the Windows PowerShell script runs next, regardless of the order in which
they appear in the instance user data.

If you use an AWS API, including the AWS CLI, in a user data script, you must use an
instance profile when launching the instance. An instance profile provides the
appropriate AWS credentials required by the user data script to make the API call. For
more information, see [Instance profiles](iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md#ec2-instance-profile). The permissions you assign to the IAM role
depend on which services you are calling with the API. For more information, see
[IAM roles for Amazon EC2](iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.md).

###### Script type

- [Syntax for batch scripts](#user-data-batch-scripts)

- [Syntax for Windows PowerShell scripts](#user-data-powershell-scripts)

- [Syntax for YAML configuration scripts](#user-data-yaml-scripts)

- [Base64 encoding](#user-data-base64-encoding)

#### Syntax for batch scripts

Specify a batch script using the `script` tag. Separate the commands using line
breaks as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

<script>
    echo Current date and time >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log
    echo %DATE% %TIME% >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log
</script>
```

By default, user data scripts run one time when you launch the instance.
To run the user data scripts every time you reboot or start the instance, add
`<persist>true</persist>` to the user data.

```nohighlight

<script>
    echo Current date and time >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log
    echo %DATE% %TIME% >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log
</script>
<persist>true</persist>
```

###### EC2Launch v2 agent

To run an XML user data script as a detached process with the EC2Launch v2
**executeScript** task in the `UserData` stage,
add `<detach>true</detach>` to the user data.

###### Note

The detach tag is not supported by previous launch agents.

```nohighlight

<script>
    echo Current date and time >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log
    echo %DATE% %TIME% >> %SystemRoot%\Temp\test.log
</script>
<detach>true</detach>
```

#### Syntax for Windows PowerShell scripts

The AWS Windows AMIs include the [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://aws.amazon.com/powershell), so you can specify these cmdlets in user data. If you
associate an IAM role with your instance, you don't need to specify credentials to
the cmdlets, as applications that run on the instance use the role's credentials to
access AWS resources (for example, Amazon S3 buckets).

Specify a Windows PowerShell script using the `<powershell>` tag.
Separate the commands using line breaks. The `<powershell>` tag is
case-sensitive.

For example:

```nohighlight

<powershell>
    $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp\" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
    New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
```

By default, the user data scripts run one time when you launch the instance.
To run the user data scripts every time you reboot or start the instance, add
`<persist>true</persist>` to the user data.

```nohighlight

<powershell>
    $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp\" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
    New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<persist>true</persist>
```

You can specify one or more PowerShell arguments with the
`<powershellArguments>` tag. If no arguments
are passed, EC2Launch and EC2Launch v2 add the following argument by default:
`-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.

**Example:**

```nohighlight

<powershell>
    $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
    New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<powershellArguments>-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -NoProfile -NonInteractive</powershellArguments>
```

###### EC2Launch v2 agent

To run an XML user data script as a detached process with the EC2Launch v2
**executeScript** task in the `UserData` stage,
add `<detach>true</detach>` to the user data.

###### Note

The detach tag is not supported by previous launch agents.

```nohighlight

<powershell>
    $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp\" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
    New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<detach>true</detach>
```

#### Syntax for YAML configuration scripts

If you are using EC2Launch v2 to run scripts, you can use the YAML format. To view
configuration tasks, details, and examples for EC2Launch v2, see [EC2Launch v2 task configuration](ec2launch-v2-settings.md#ec2launch-v2-task-configuration).

Specify a YAML script with the `executeScript` task.

**Example YAML syntax to run a PowerShell script**

```yaml

version: 1.0
tasks:
- task: executeScript
  inputs:
  - frequency: always
    type: powershell
    runAs: localSystem
    content: |-
      $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp\" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
      New-Item $file -ItemType file
```

**Example YAML syntax to run a batch script**

```yaml

version: 1.1
tasks:
- task: executeScript
  inputs:
  - frequency: always
    type: batch

#### Base64 encoding

If you're using the Amazon EC2 API or a tool that does not perform base64 encoding of
the user data, you must encode the user data yourself. If not, an error is logged
about being unable to find `script` or `powershell` tags to
run. The following is an example that encodes using Windows PowerShell.

```nohighlight

$UserData = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($Script))
```

The following is an example that decodes using PowerShell.

```nohighlight

$Script = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($UserData))
```

For more information about base64 encoding, see [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4648.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4648.txt).

### Compressed user data

EC2Launch v2 supports zipped user data as a method to submit user data that's larger than
the 16 KB limit imposed by IMDS. To use this feature, compress your user data script into
a `.zip` archive and pass it to your EC2 instance. When EC2Launch v2 detects
compressed user data, it automatically unzips the compressed user data script and runs it.

As with standard user data, if you're using the Amazon EC2 API or a tool that does not perform
base64 encoding of the user data, you must encode the compressed user data yourself. For more
information about the user data size limit and base64 encoding, see
[Access instance metadata for an EC2 instance](instancedata-data-retrieval.md).

### User data execution

By default, all AWS Windows AMIs have user data execution enabled for the initial
launch. You can specify that user data scripts are run the next time the instance
reboots or restarts. Alternatively, you can specify that user data scripts are run every
time the instance reboots or restarts.

###### Note

User data is not enabled to run by default after the initial launch. To enable
user data to run when you reboot or start the instance, see [Run scripts during subsequent reboots or starts](#user-data-scripts-subsequent).

User data scripts are run from the local administrator account when a random password
is generated. Otherwise, user data scripts are run from the System account.

#### Instance launch scripts

Scripts in the instance user data are run during the initial launch of the
instance. If the `persist` tag is found, user data execution is enabled
for subsequent reboots or starts. The log files for EC2Launch v2, EC2Launch, and
EC2Config contain the output from the standard output and standard error
streams.

###### EC2Launch v2

The log file for EC2Launch v2 is
`C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2Launch\log\agent.log`.

###### Note

The `C:\ProgramData` folder might be hidden. To view the
folder, you must show hidden files and folders.

The following information is logged when the user data is run:

- `Info: Converting user-data to yaml format` – If the user
data was provided in XML format

- `Info: Initialize user-data state` – The start of user
data execution

- `Info: Frequency is: always` – If the user data task is
running on every boot

- `Info: Frequency is: once` – If the user data task is
running just once

- `Stage: postReadyUserData execution completed` – The end
of user data execution

###### EC2Launch

The log file for EC2Launch is
`C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Log\UserdataExecution.log`.

The `C:\ProgramData` folder might be hidden. To view the
folder, you must show hidden files and folders.

The following information is logged when the user data is run:

- `Userdata execution begins` – The start of user data
execution

- `<persist> tag was provided: true` – If the persist
tag is found

- `Running userdata on every boot` –
If the persist tag is found

- `<powershell> tag was provided.. running powershell
  								content` – If the powershell tag is found

- `<script> tag was provided.. running script content`
– If the script tag is found

- `Message: The output from user scripts` – If user data
scripts are run, their output is logged

###### EC2Config

The log file for EC2Config is `C:\Program
							Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Logs\Ec2Config.log`. The following
information is logged when the user data is run:

- `Ec2HandleUserData: Message: Start running user scripts`
– The start of user data execution

- `Ec2HandleUserData: Message: Re-enabled userdata execution`
– If the persist tag is found

- `Ec2HandleUserData: Message: Could not find <persist> and
  								</persist>` – If the persist tag is not found

- `Ec2HandleUserData: Message: The output from user scripts`
– If user data scripts are run, their output is logged

#### Run scripts during subsequent reboots or starts

When you update instance user data, the updated user data content is automatically
reflected in the instance metadata the next time you reboot or start the instance.
However, depending on the installed launch agent, additional configuration may
be required to configure user data scripts to run on subsequent reboots or starts.

If you choose the **Shutdown with Sysprep** option, user data
scripts run the next time the instance starts or reboots, even if you did not
enable user data execution for subsequent reboots or starts.

For instructions to enable user data execution, select the tab that matches your
launch agent.

EC2Launch v2

Unlike EC2Launch v1, EC2Launch v2 evaluates the user data task on every boot.
It is not necessary to manually schedule the user data task. The user data runs
based on the included frequency or persist options.

For XML user data scripts

To run user data scripts on every boot, add the
`<persist>true</persist>` flag to the user data.
If the persist flag is not included, the user data script only runs
on the initial boot.

For YAML user data

- To run a task in user data on the initial boot, set the task
`frequency` to `once`.

- To run a task in user data on every boot, set the task
`frequency` to `always`.

EC2Launch

1. Connect to your Windows instance.

2. Open a PowerShell command window and run one of the following commands:

###### Run once

To run user data once on the next boot, use the `-Schedule`
    flag.

```sh

C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts\InitializeInstance.ps1 -Schedule
```

###### Run on all subsequent boots

To run user data on all subsequent boots, use the `-SchedulePerBoot`
    flag.

```sh

C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts\InitializeInstance.ps1 -SchedulePerBoot
```

3. Disconnect from your Windows instance. To run updated scripts the next
    time the instance is started, stop the instance and update the user data.

EC2Config

1. Connect to your Windows instance.

2. Open `C:\Program
   										Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Ec2ConfigServiceSetting.exe`.

3. For **User Data**, select **Enable UserData**
**execution for next service start**.

4. Disconnect from your Windows instance. To run updated scripts the next
    time the instance is started, stop the instance and update the user data.

### User data and the Tools for Windows PowerShell

You can use the Tools for Windows PowerShell to specify, modify, and view the user data for your instance.
For information about viewing user data from your instance using instance metadata, see
[Access instance metadata for an EC2 instance](instancedata-data-retrieval.md). For information about user data
and the AWS CLI, see [User data and the AWS CLI](#user-data-api-cli).

###### Example: Specify instance user data at launch

Create a text file with the instance user data. To run user data scripts every
time you reboot or start the instance, add
`<persist>true</persist>`, as shown in the following
example.

```nohighlight

<powershell>
    $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp\" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
    New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<persist>true</persist>
```

To specify instance user data when you launch your instance, use the [New-EC2Instance](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/new-ec2instance.md) command. This
command does not perform base64 encoding of the user data for you. Use the following
commands to encode the user data in a text file named
`script.txt`.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> $Script = Get-Content -Raw script.txt
PS C:\> $UserData = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($Script))
```

Use the `-UserData` parameter to pass the user data to the
**New-EC2Instance** command.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> New-EC2Instance -ImageId ami-abcd1234 -MinCount 1 -MaxCount 1 -InstanceType m3.medium \
    -KeyName my-key-pair -SubnetId subnet-12345678 -SecurityGroupIds sg-1a2b3c4d \
    -UserData $UserData
```

###### Example: Update instance user data for a stopped instance

You can modify the user data of a stopped instance using the [Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/edit-ec2instanceattribute.md) command.

Create a text file with the new script. Use the following commands to encode the user
data in the text file named `new-script.txt`.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> $NewScript = Get-Content -Raw new-script.txt
PS C:\> $NewUserData = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($NewScript))
```

Use the `-UserData` and `-Value` parameters to specify the user
data.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> Edit-EC2InstanceAttribute -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 -Attribute userData -Value $NewUserData
```

###### Example: View instance user data

To retrieve the user data for an instance, use the [Get-EC2InstanceAttribute](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2instanceattribute.md) command.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> (Get-EC2InstanceAttribute -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 -Attribute userData).UserData
```

The following is example output. Note that the user data is encoded.

```nohighlight

PHBvd2Vyc2hlbGw+DQpSZW5hbWUtQ29tcHV0ZXIgLU5ld05hbWUgdXNlci1kYXRhLXRlc3QNCjwvcG93ZXJzaGVsbD4=
```

Use the following commands to store the encoded user data in a variable and then
decode it.

```nohighlight

PS C:\> $UserData_encoded = (Get-EC2InstanceAttribute -InstanceId i-1234567890abcdef0 -Attribute userData).UserData
PS C:\> [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($UserData_encoded))
```

The following is example output.

```nohighlight

<powershell>
    $file = $env:SystemRoot + "\Temp\" + (Get-Date).ToString("MM-dd-yy-hh-mm")
    New-Item $file -ItemType file
</powershell>
<persist>true</persist>
```

###### Example: Rename the instance to match the tag value

You can use the [Get-EC2Tag](../../../powershell/latest/reference/items/get-ec2tag.md)
command to read the tag value, rename the instance on first boot to match the tag
value, and reboot. To run this command successfully, you must have a role with
`ec2:DescribeTags` permissions attached to the instance because tag
information is retrieved by the API call. For more information on settings
permissions by using IAM roles, see [Attach an IAM role to an instance](attach-iam-role.md).

You can also rename the instance using tags in instance metadata, if your instance
is configured to access tags from the instance metadata. For more information, see
[View tags for your EC2 instances using instance metadata](work-with-tags-in-imds.md).
