# Get the ARN of an organization or organizational unit

The organization and the organizational unit ARNs contain the 12-digit management account
number. If you don't know the management account number, you can describe the
organization and the organizational unit to get the ARN for each. In the following
examples, `123456789012` is the account ID of the management account.

###### Required permissions

Before you can get the ARNs, you must have the permission to describe organizations and
organizational units. The following policy provides the necessary permission.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "organizations:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

AWS CLI

###### To get the ARN of an organization

Use the [describe-organization](../../../cli/latest/reference/organizations/describe-organization.md) command. Add the

###### To get the ARN of an organizational unit

Use the [describe-organizational-unit](../../../cli/latest/reference/organizations/describe-organizational-unit.md) command. Use the
`--query` parameter to return only the organizational unit
ARN.

    --organizational-unit-id ou-a123-b4567890 \
    --query 'OrganizationalUnit.Arn'
