# Get the ARN of an organization or organizational unit
<a name="get-org-ou-ARN"></a>

The organization and the organizational unit ARNs contain the 12-digit management account number. If you don't know the management account number, you can describe the organization and the organizational unit to get the ARN for each. In the following examples, `123456789012` is the account ID of the management account.

**Required permissions**
Before you can get the ARNs, you must have the permission to describe organizations and organizational units. The following policy provides the necessary permission.
