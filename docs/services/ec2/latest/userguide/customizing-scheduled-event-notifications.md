# Customize scheduled event notifications for your EC2 instances
<a name="customizing_scheduled_event_notifications"></a>

You can customize scheduled event notifications to include tags in the email notification. This makes it easier to identify the affected resource (instances or Dedicated Hosts) and to prioritize actions for the upcoming event.

When you customize event notifications to include tags, you can choose to include:
+ All of the tags that are associated with the affected resource
+ Only specific tags that are associated with the affected resource

For example, suppose that you assign `application`, `costcenter`, `project`, and `owner` tags to all of your instances. You can choose to include all of the tags in event notifications. Alternatively, if you'd like to see only the `owner` and `project` tags in event notifications, then you can choose to include only those tags.

After you select the tags to include, the event notifications will include the resource ID (instance ID or Dedicated Host ID) and the tag key and value pairs that are associated with the affected resource.
