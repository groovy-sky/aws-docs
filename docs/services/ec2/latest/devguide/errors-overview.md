# Error codes for the Amazon EC2 API
<a name="errors-overview"></a>

Amazon EC2 has two types of error codes:
+ **Client errors**. These errors are usually caused by something the client did. Common causes include specifying an incorrect or invalid parameter in the request, or using an action or resource on behalf of a user that doesn't have permission to use the action or resource. These errors are accompanied by a 400-series HTTP response code.
+ **Server errors**. These errors are usually caused by an AWS server-side issue. These errors are accompanied by a 500-series HTTP response code.

## Common client error codes
<a name="CommonErrors"></a>

This section lists the client error codes that all Amazon EC2 API actions can return.

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| AuthFailure | The provided credentials could not be validated. You might not be authorized to carry out the request; for example, trying to associate an Elastic IP address that is not yours, or trying to use an AMI for which you do not have permissions. Ensure that your account is authorized to use Amazon EC2, that your credit card details are correct, and that you are using the correct credentials. |
| Blocked | Your account is currently blocked. Contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) if you have questions. |
| DryRunOperation | The user has the required permissions, so the request would have succeeded, but the DryRun parameter was used. |
| IdempotentParameterMismatch | The request uses the same client token as a previous, but non-identical request. Do not reuse a client token with different requests, unless the requests are identical. |
| IncompleteSignature | The request signature does not conform to AWS standards. |
| InvalidAction | The action or operation requested is not valid. Verify that the action is typed correctly. |
| InvalidCharacter | A specified character is invalid. |
| InvalidClientTokenId | The X.509 certificate or credentials provided do not exist in our records. |
| InvalidPaginationToken | The specified pagination token is not valid or is expired. |
| InvalidParameter | A parameter specified in a request is not valid, is unsupported, or cannot be used. The returned message provides an explanation of the error value. For example, if you are launching an instance, you can't specify a security group and subnet that are in different VPCs. |
| InvalidParameterCombination | Indicates an incorrect combination of parameters, or a missing parameter. For example, trying to terminate an instance without specifying the instance ID. |
| InvalidParameterDependency | Indicates an incorrect combination of parameters, or a missing parameter. For example, trying to terminate an instance without specifying the instance ID. |
| InvalidParameterValue | A value specified in a parameter is not valid, is unsupported, or cannot be used. Ensure that you specify a resource by using its full ID. The returned message provides an explanation of the error value. |
| InvalidQueryParameter | The AWS query string is malformed or does not adhere to AWS standards. |
| MalformedQueryString | The query string contains a syntax error. |
| MissingAction | The request is missing an action or a required parameter. |
| MissingAuthenticationToken | The request must contain valid credentials. |
| MissingParameter | The request is missing a required parameter. Ensure that you have supplied all the required parameters for the request; for example, the resource ID. |
| OptInRequired | You are not authorized to use the requested service. Ensure that you have subscribed to the service you are trying to use. If you are new to AWS, your account might take some time to be activated while your credit card details are being verified. |
| PendingVerification | Your account is pending verification. Until the verification process is complete, you may not be able to carry out requests with this account. If you have questions, contact [Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).  |
| RequestExpired | The request reached the service more than 15 minutes after the date stamp on the request or more than 15 minutes after the request expiration date (such as for presigned URLs), or the date stamp on the request is more than 15 minutes in the future. If you're using temporary security credentials, this error can also occur if the credentials have expired. For more information, see [Temporary security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) in the IAM User Guide. |
| TagPolicyViolation | You attempted to create or update a resource with tags that are not compliant with the tag policy requirements for this account. For more information, see [Grant permission to tag resources during creation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/supported-iam-actions-tagging.html)  |
| UnauthorizedOperation | You are not authorized to perform this operation. Check your IAM policies, and ensure that you are using the correct credentials. For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-iam.html). If the returned message is encoded, you can decode it using the DecodeAuthorizationMessage action. For more information, see [DecodeAuthorizationMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_DecodeAuthorizationMessage.html) in the AWS Security Token Service API Reference. |
| UnknownParameter | An unknown or unrecognized parameter was supplied. Requests that could cause this error include supplying a misspelled parameter or a parameter that is not supported for the specified API version. |
| UnsupportedInstanceAttribute | The specified attribute cannot be modified. |
| <a name="UnsupportedOperation"></a> UnsupportedOperation  | The specified request includes an unsupported operation. For example, you can't stop an instance that's instance store-backed. Or you might be trying to launch an instance type that is not supported by the specified AMI. The returned message provides details of the unsupported operation. |
| UnsupportedProtocol | SOAP has been deprecated and is no longer supported. |
| ValidationError | The input fails to satisfy the constraints specified by an AWS service. |

| HostAlreadyCoveredByReservation | The specified Dedicated Host is already covered by a reservation. |
| HostLimitExceeded | You've reached the limit on the number of Dedicated Hosts that you can allocate. For more information, see [Dedicated Hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html). |
| IdempotentInstanceTerminated | The request to launch an instance uses the same client token as a previous request for which the instance has been terminated. |
| InaccessibleStorageLocation | The specified Amazon S3 URL cannot be accessed. Check the access permissions for the URL. |
| InaccessibleStorageLocationException | The specified Amazon S3 bucket can't be accessed. An S3 bucket must be available before generating an account status report for declarative policies (you can create a new one or use an existing one), you must own the bucket, it must be in the same Region in which the request was made, and it must have an appropriate bucket policy. For a sample S3 policy, see [ Sample Amazon S3 policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport.html#API_StartDeclarativePoliciesReport_Examples). |
| <a name="IncorrectInstanceState"></a> IncorrectInstanceState  | The instance is in an incorrect state for the requested action. For example, some instance attributes, such as user data, can only be modified if the instance is in a 'stopped' state. If you are associating an Elastic IP address with a network interface, ensure that the instance that the interface is attached to is not in the 'pending' state. |
| IncorrectModificationState | A new modification action on an EBS Elastic Volume cannot occur because the volume is currently being modified. |
| <a name="IncorrectSpotRequestState"></a> IncorrectSpotRequestState  | The Spot Instance request is in an incorrect state for the request. Spot request status information can help you track your Amazon EC2 Spot Instance requests. For more information, see [Spot request status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-request-status.html). |
| <a name="IncorrectState"></a> IncorrectState  | The resource is in an incorrect state for the request. This error can occur if you are trying to attach a volume that is still being created or detach a volume that is not in the 'available' state. Verify that the volume is in the 'available' state. If you are creating a snapshot, ensure that the previous request to create a snapshot on the same volume has completed. If you are deleting a virtual private gateway, ensure that it's detached from the VPC. |
| IncorrectStateException | The resource is in an incorrect state for the request. This error can occur if you're trying to cancel the generation of an account status report for declarative policies that already has the `complete`, `cancelled`, or `error` status. Cancelation is only possible for reports with a `running` status. This error can also occur when you're trying to get a summary for a report that has not yet reached the `completed` status. This error can also occur if you start report generation while another report is being generated. Only one report per organization can be generated at a time. For more information, see [Generating the account status report for declarative policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative_status-report.html). |
| IncompatibleHostRequirements | There are no available or compatible Dedicated Hosts available on which to launch or start the instance. |
| InstanceCreditSpecification.NotSupported | The specified instance does not use CPU credits for CPU usage; only T2 instances use CPU credits for CPU usage. |
| <a name="InstanceEventStartTimeCannotChange"></a> InstanceEventStartTimeCannotChange  | The specified scheduled event start time does not meet the requirements for rescheduling a scheduled event. For more information, see [Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html). |
| <a name="InstanceLimitExceeded"></a>InstanceLimitExceeded  | You've reached the limit on the number of instances you can run concurrently. This error can occur if you are launching an instance or if you are creating a Capacity Reservation. Capacity Reservations count towards your On-Demand Instance limits. If your request fails due to limit constraints, increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the required instance type and try again. For more information, see [EC2 On-Demand instance limits](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#EC2_On-Demand_Instance_limits). |
| InsufficientCapacityOnHost | There is not enough capacity on the Dedicated Host to launch or start the instance. |

### Common causes of client errors
<a name="api-error-common-causes"></a>

There are a number of reasons that you might encounter an error while performing a request. Some errors can be prevented or easily solved by following these guidelines:
+ **Specify the Region**: Some resources can't be shared between AWS Regions. If you are specifying a resource that's located in a Region other than the current Region, specify its Region in the request. If the resource cannot be found, you get the following error: `Client.Invalid`*Resource*`.NotFound`; for example, `Client.InvalidInstanceID.NotFound`.
+ **Allow for eventual consistency**: Some errors are caused because a previous request has not yet propagated thorough the system. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).
+ **Use a sleep interval between request rates**: Amazon EC2 API requests are throttled to help maintain the performance of the service. If your requests have been throttled, you get the following error: `Client.RequestLimitExceeded`. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).
+ **Use the full ID of the resource**: When specifying a resource, ensure that you use its full ID, and not its user-supplied name or description. For example, when specifying a security group in a request, use its ID in the form sg-*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*.
+ **Check your services**: Ensure that you have signed up for all the services you are attempting to use. You can check which services you're signed up for by going to the **My Account** section of the [AWS home page](https://aws.amazon.com/).
+ **Check your permissions**: Ensure that you have the required permissions to carry out the request. If you are not authorized, you get the following error: `Client.UnauthorizedOperation`. For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-iam.html).
+ **Check your VPC**: Some resources cannot be shared between VPCs; for example, security groups.
+ **Check your credentials**: Ensure that you entered the credentials correctly. If you have more than one account, verify that you are using the correct credentials for the specific account. If the provided credentials are incorrect, you might get the following error: `Client.AuthFailure`.

## Server error codes
<a name="api-error-codes-table-server"></a>

This section lists server error codes that can be returned.

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  BandwidthLimitExceeded  | You've reached the limit on the network bandwidth that is available to an Amazon EC2 instance. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 instance network bandwidth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-network-bandwidth.html). |
|  InsufficientAddressCapacity  | Not enough available addresses to satisfy your minimum request. Reduce the number of addresses you are requesting or wait for additional capacity to become available. |
| InsufficientCapacity | There is not enough capacity to fulfill your import instance request. You can wait for additional capacity to become available.  |
|  InsufficientInstanceCapacity  | There is not enough capacity to fulfill your request. This error can occur if you launch a new instance, restart a stopped instance, create a new Capacity Reservation, or modify an existing Capacity Reservation. Reduce the number of instances in your request, or wait for additional capacity to become available. You can also try launching an instance by selecting different instance types (which you can resize at a later stage). The returned message might also give specific guidance about how to solve the problem. |
| InsufficientHostCapacity | There is not enough capacity to fulfill your Dedicated Host request. Reduce the number of Dedicated Hosts in your request, or wait for additional capacity to become available.  |
|  InsufficientReservedInstanceCapacity  | Not enough available Reserved Instances to satisfy your minimum request. Reduce the number of Reserved Instances in your request or wait for additional capacity to become available. |
| InsufficientVolumeCapacity | There is not enough capacity to fulfill your EBS volume provision request. You can try to provision a different volume type, EBS volume in a different availability zone, or you can wait for additional capacity to become available.  |
| ServerInternal | An internal error has occurred. Retry your request, but if the problem persists, contact us with details by posting a message on [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/). |
| InternalFailure | The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure. |
| RequestLimitExceeded | The maximum request rate permitted by the Amazon EC2 APIs has been exceeded for your account. For best results, use an increasing or variable sleep interval between requests. For more information, see [Query API request rate](query-api-troubleshooting.md#api-request-rate). |
| ServiceUnavailable | The request has failed due to a temporary failure of the server. |
| InternalError | An internal error has occurred. Retry your request, but if the problem persists, contact us with details by posting a message on [AWS re:Post](https://repost.aws/). |
| Unavailable | The server is overloaded and can't handle the request. |

```

## Eventual consistency
<a name="api-eventual-consistency"></a>

The Amazon EC2 API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that when you run an API command, the result may not be immediately visible to subsequent API commands, which can result in an error.

For more information about eventual consistency and how to manage it, see [Eventual consistency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/eventual-consistency.html).
