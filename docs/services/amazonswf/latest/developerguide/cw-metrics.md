# Amazon SWF Metrics for CloudWatch

Amazon SWF now provides metrics for CloudWatch that you can use to track your workflows and activities
and set alarms on threshold values that you choose. You can view metrics using the AWS Management Console.
For more information, see [Viewing Amazon SWF Metrics for CloudWatch using the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/cw-metrics-console.html).

## Reporting Units for Amazon SWF Metrics

### Metrics that Report a Time Interval

Some of the Amazon SWF metrics for CloudWatch are _time intervals_, always measured in
milliseconds. The CloudWatch unit is reported as `Time`. These metrics generally
correspond to stages of your workflow execution for which you can set workflow and activity
timeouts, and have similar names.

For example, the `DecisionTaskStartToCloseTime` metric measures the time it
took for the decision task to complete after it began executing, which is the same time
period for which you can set a `DecisionTaskStartToCloseTimeout` value.

For a diagram of each of these workflow stages and to learn when they occur over the
workflow and activity lifecycles, see [Amazon SWF Timeout Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-timeout-types.html).

### Metrics that Report a Count

Some of the Amazon SWF metrics for CloudWatch report results as a _count_. For
example, `WorkflowsCanceled`, records a result as either _one_
or _zero_, indicating whether or not the workflow was canceled. A value
of zero doesn't indicate that the metric was not reported, only that the condition described
by the metric did not occur.

Some of the Amazon SWF metrics for CloudWatch that report a `Count` in CloudWatch are a
_count per second_. For instance, `ProvisionedRefillRate`,
which is reported as a `Count` in CloudWatch, represents a _rate_ of
the `Count` of requests per second.

For count metrics, minimum and maximum will always be either zero or one, but average
will be a value ranging from zero to one.

## API and Decision Event Metrics

You can monitor both API and Decision events in CloudWatch to provide insight into your usage
and capacity. See [deciders](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-actors.html#swf-dev-actors-deciders) in the [Basic workflow concepts in Amazon SWF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-basic.html) section, and the [Decision](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_Decision.html) topic in the [Amazon Simple Workflow Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference).

You can also monitor these limits to alarm when you are approaching your Amazon SWF throttling
limits. See [Amazon SWF throttling quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-limits.html#swf-throttling-limits) for
a description of these limits and their default settings. These limits are designed to prevent
incorrect workflows from consuming excessive system resources. To request an increase to your
limits see: [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dg-limits.html#swf-dg-limits-how-to-increase).

As a best practice, you should configure CloudWatch alarms at around 60% of your API or decision
events capacity. This will allow you to either adjust your workflow, or request a service
limit increase, before Amazon SWF throttling is enabled. Depending on the [burstiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstiness) of your calls, you can
configure different alarms to notify when you are approaching your service limits:

- If your traffic has significant spikes, set an alarm at 60% of your
`ProvisionedBucketSize` limits.

- If your calls have a relatively steady rate, set an alarm at 60% of your
`ProvisionedRefillRate` limit for your related API and decision events.

## Amazon SWF non-ASCII resource names and CloudWatch dimensions

Amazon SWF allows non-ASCII characters in resource names such as TaskList and DomainName.
However, the dimension values of CloudWatch metrics can only contain printable ASCII characters. To
ensure that Amazon SWF uses dimension values that are compatible with [CloudWatch requirements](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-dimension.md), Amazon SWF resource names that do
not meet these requirements are converted and will have a checksum appended as follows:

- Any non-ASCII character is replaced with `?`.

- The input string or converted string will, if necessary, be truncated. This ensures
that when the checksum is appended, the new string length will not exceed the CloudWatch
maximum.

- Because any non-ASCII characters are converted to `?`, some CloudWatch metric dimension values that were different before conversion may
appear to be the same after conversion. To help differentiate between them, an underscore
( `_`) followed by the first 16 characters of the SHA256 checksum of the
original resource name is appended to the resource name.

Conversion examples:

- `test àpple` would be converted to
`test ?pple_82cc5b8e3a771d12`

- `àòà` would be converted to `???_2fec5edbb2c05c22`.

- The TaskList names `àpplé` and `âpplè` would both be converted
to `?ppl?`, and would be identical. Appending the checksum returns distinct
values, `?ppl?_f39a36df9d85a69d` and
`?ppl?_da3efb4f11dd0f7f`.

###### Tip

You can generate your own SHA256 checksum. For example, to use the `shasum`
command line tool:

**echo -n "<the original resource name>" \| shasum -a 256 \| cut -c1-16**
