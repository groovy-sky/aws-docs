<a name="swf-api-by-category"></a>

This section lists the reference topics for Amazon SWF actions in the Amazon SWF application programming interface (API). These are listed by *functional category*.

For an *alphabetic* list of actions, see the [Amazon Simple Workflow Service API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/).

**Topics**
+ [Actions Related to Activities](#swf-api-activities)
+ [Actions Related to Deciders](#swf-api-deciders)
+ [Actions Related to Workflow Executions](#swf-api-executions)
+ [Actions Related to Administration](#swf-api-administration)

## Actions Related to Activities
<a name="swf-api-activities"></a>

Activity workers use `PollForActivityTask` to get new activity tasks. After a worker receives an activity task from Amazon SWF, it performs the task and responds using `RespondActivityTaskCompleted` if successful or `RespondActivityTaskFailed` if unsuccessful.

The following are actions that are performed by activity workers.
+ `[PollForActivityTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_PollForActivityTask.html)`
+ `[RespondActivityTaskCompleted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_RespondActivityTaskCompleted.html)`
+ `[RespondActivityTaskFailed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_RespondActivityTaskFailed.html)`
+ `[RespondActivityTaskCanceled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_RespondActivityTaskCanceled.html)`
+ `[RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat.html)`

## Actions Related to Deciders
<a name="swf-api-deciders"></a>

Deciders use `PollForDecisionTask` to get decision tasks. After a decider receives a decision task from Amazon SWF, it examines its workflow execution history and decides what to do next. It calls `RespondDecisionTaskCompleted` to complete the decision task and provides zero or more next decisions.

The following are actions that are performed by deciders.
+ `[PollForDecisionTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_PollForDecisionTask.html)`
+ `[RespondDecisionTaskCompleted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_RespondDecisionTaskCompleted.html)`

## Actions Related to Workflow Executions
<a name="swf-api-executions"></a>

The following actions operate on a workflow execution.
+ `[RequestCancelWorkflowExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_RequestCancelWorkflowExecution.html)`
+ `[StartWorkflowExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_StartWorkflowExecution.html)`
+ `[SignalWorkflowExecution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_SignalWorkflowExecution.html)`
