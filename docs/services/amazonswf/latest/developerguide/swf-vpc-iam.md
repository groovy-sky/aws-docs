# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Endpoint Policies for Amazon SWF
<a name="swf-vpc-iam"></a>

You can create an Amazon VPC endpoint policy for Amazon SWF in which you specify the following:
+ The **principal** that can perform actions.
+ The actions that can be performed.
+ The resources on which the actions can be performed.

The following example adds a specific IAM role to a policy:

```
"Principal": {
   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole"
}
```
+ For more information about creating endpoint policies, see [Controlling Access to Services with VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html).
+ For information about how you can use IAM to control access to your AWS and Amazon SWF resources, see [Identity and Access Management in Amazon Simple Workflow Service](swf-dev-iam.md).
