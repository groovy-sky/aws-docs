# Registering a Workflow Type with Amazon SWF
<a name="swf-dg-register-workflow"></a>

The example discussed in this section registers a workflow type using the Amazon SWF API. The name and version that you specify during registration form a unique identifier for the workflow type. The specified domain must have already been registered using the `[RegisterDomain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/API_RegisterDomain.html)` API action.

The timeout parameters in the following example are duration values specified in seconds. For the `defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout` parameter, you can use the duration specifier `NONE` to indicate no timeout. However, you can't specify a value of `NONE` for `defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout`; there is a one-year maximum limit on the time that a workflow execution can run. Exceeding this limit always causes the workflow execution to time out. If you specify a value for `defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout` that is greater than one year, the registration will fail.

```

RegisterWorkflowType
{
  "domain" : "867530901",
  "name" : "customerOrderWorkflow",
  "version" : "1.0",
  "description" : "Handle customer orders",
  "defaultTaskStartToCloseTimeout" : "600",
  "defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout" : "3600",
  "defaultTaskList" : { "name": "mainTaskList" },
  "defaultChildPolicy" : "TERMINATE"
}
```
