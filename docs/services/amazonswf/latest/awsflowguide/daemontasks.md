# Daemon Tasks

The AWS Flow Framework for Java allows the marking of certain tasks as `daemon`. This allows you to create tasks
that do some background work that should get canceled when all other work is done. For example, a health monitoring
task should be canceled when the rest of the workflow is complete. You can accomplish this by setting the
`daemon` flag on an asynchronous method or an instance of `TryCatchFinally`. In the following
example, the asynchronous method `monitorHealth()` is marked as `daemon`.

```

public class MyWorkflowImpl implements MyWorkflow {
  MyActivitiesClient activitiesClient = new MyActivitiesClientImpl();

  @Override
  public void startMyWF(int a, String b) {
    activitiesClient.doUsefulWorkActivity();
    monitorHealth();
  }

  @Asynchronous(daemon=true)
  void monitorHealth(Promise<?>... waitFor) {
    activitiesClient.monitoringActivity();
  }
}
```

In the above example, when `doUsefulWorkActivity` completes, `monitoringHealth` will be
automatically canceled. This will in turn cancel the whole execution branch rooted at this asynchronous method. The
semantics of cancellation are the same as in `TryCatchFinally`. Similarly, you can mark a
`TryCatchFinally` daemon by passing a Boolean flag to the constructor.

```

public class MyWorkflowImpl implements MyWorkflow {
    MyActivitiesClient activitiesClient = new MyActivitiesClientImpl();

    @Override
    public void startMyWF(int a, String b) {
        activitiesClient.doUsefulWorkActivity();
        new TryFinally(true) {
            @Override
            protected void doTry() throws Throwable {
                activitiesClient.monitoringActivity();
            }

            @Override
            protected void doFinally() throws Throwable {
                // clean up
            }
        };
    }
}
```

A daemon task started within a `TryCatchFinally` is scoped to the context it is created in—that
is, it will be scoped to either the `doTry()`, `doCatch()`, or `doFinally()`
methods. For example, in the following example the startMonitoring asynchronous method is marked daemon and called
from `doTry()`. The task created for it will be canceled as soon as the other tasks
( `doUsefulWorkActivity` in this case) started within `doTry()` are complete.

```

public class MyWorkflowImpl implements MyWorkflow {
    MyActivitiesClient activitiesClient = new MyActivitiesClientImpl();

    @Override
    public void startMyWF(int a, String b) {
        new TryFinally() {
            @Override
            protected void doTry() throws Throwable {
                activitiesClient.doUsefulWorkActivity();
                startMonitoring();
            }

            @Override
            protected void doFinally() throws Throwable {
                // Clean up
            }
        };
    }

    @Asynchronous(daemon = true)
    void startMonitoring(){
      activitiesClient.monitoringActivity();
    }
```
