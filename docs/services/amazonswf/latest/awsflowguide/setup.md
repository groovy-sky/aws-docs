<a name="setup"></a>

The AWS Flow Framework for Java is included with the [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/). If you have not already set up the AWS SDK for Java, visit [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html) in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide for information about installing and configuring the SDK itself.

The Amazon SWF build tools are open source—to view or download the code or to build the tools yourself, visit the repository at [https://github.com/aws/aws-swf-build-tools](https://github.com/aws/aws-swf-build-tools).

Amazon provides [Amazon SWF build tools](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazonaws/aws-swf-build-tools) in the Maven Central Repository.

To set up the flow framework for Maven, add the following dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
    <artifactId>aws-swf-build-tools</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
