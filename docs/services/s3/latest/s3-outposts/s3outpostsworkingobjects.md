# Working with S3 on Outposts objects

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily store and
retrieve objects on premises for applications that require local data access, local data
processing, and data residency. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts
( `OUTPOSTS`), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store
data durably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts. You communicate with your Outpost bucket
by using an access point
and endpoint connection over a virtual private cloud (VPC). You can use the same APIs and
features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3 buckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging.
You can use S3 on Outposts through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API.

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3 on Outposts. Every object is contained in a bucket.
You must use access points to access any object in an Outpost bucket. When you specify the bucket for object operations, you use the
access point Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the access point alias. For more information about access point aliases, see [Using a bucket-style alias for your S3 on Outposts bucket access point](s3-outposts-access-points-alias.md).

The following example shows the
ARN format for S3 on Outposts access points, which includes the AWS Region code for the Region that the Outpost is homed to, the AWS account ID,
the Outpost ID, and the access point name:

```nohighlight

arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name
```

For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see [Resource ARNs for S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/s3-outposts/S3OutpostsIAM.html#S3OutpostsARN).

Object ARNs use the following format, which includes the AWS Region that the Outpost is
homed to, AWS account ID, Outpost ID, bucket name, and object key:

```nohighlight

arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:​outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/object/myobject
```

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, object data is always stored on the Outpost. When AWS installs an Outpost rack, your data stays local to
your Outpost to meet data-residency requirements. Your objects never leave your
Outpost and are not in an AWS Region. Because the AWS Management Console is hosted in-Region, you can't use the console to upload or manage objects in
your Outpost. However, you can use the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs to upload and manage your objects through your access points.
