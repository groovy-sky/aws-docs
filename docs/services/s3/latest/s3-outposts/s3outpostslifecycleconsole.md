# Creating and managing a lifecycle rule by using the AWS Management Console

You can use S3 Lifecycle to optimize storage capacity for Amazon S3 on Outposts. You can create lifecycle rules to expire objects as they age or are replaced by newer versions. You can create, enable, disable, or delete a lifecycle
rule.

For more information about S3 Lifecycle, see [Creating and managing a lifecycle configuration for your Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket](s3outpostslifecyclemanaging.md).

###### Note

The AWS account that creates the bucket owns it and is the only one that can create,
enable, disable, or delete a lifecycle rule.

To create and manage a lifecycle rule for an S3 on Outposts by using the AWS Management Console, see the
following topics.

## Creating a lifecycle rule

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Outposts**
    **buckets**.

03. Choose the Outposts bucket that you want to create a lifecycle rule
     for.

04. Choose the **Management** tab, and then choose
     **Create Lifecycle rule**.

05. Enter a value for **Lifecycle rule name**.

06. Under **Rule scope**, choose one of the following
     options:

- To limit the scope to specific filters, choose **Limit**
**the scope of this rule using one or more filters**. Then,
add a prefix filter, tags, or object size.

- To apply the rule to all objects in the bucket, choose
**Apply to all objects in the bucket**.

07. Under **Lifecycle rule actions**, choose one of the following
     options:

- **Expire current versions of objects** – For
versioning-enabled buckets, S3 on Outposts adds a delete marker and
retains the objects as noncurrent versions. For buckets that don't use
S3 Versioning, S3 on Outposts permanently deletes the objects.

- **Permanently delete noncurrent versions of objects** – S3 on Outposts permanently deletes noncurrent
versions of objects.

- **Delete expired object delete markers or incomplete multipart**
**uploads** – S3 on Outposts permanently deletes expired
object delete markers or incomplete multipart uploads.

If you limit the scope of your Lifecycle rule by using object tags,
you can't choose **Delete expired object delete**
**markers**. You also can't choose **Delete expired**
**object delete markers** if you choose **Expire**
**current object versions**.

###### Note

Size-based filters can't be used with delete markers and incomplete
multipart uploads.

08. If you chose **Expire current versions of objects** or
     **Permanently delete noncurrent versions of objects**,
     configure the rule trigger based on a specific date or the object's age.

09. If you chose **Delete expired object delete markers**, to
     confirm that you want to delete expired object delete markers, select
     **Delete expired object delete markers**.

10. Under **Timeline Summary**, review your Lifecycle rule, and choose **Create rule**.
