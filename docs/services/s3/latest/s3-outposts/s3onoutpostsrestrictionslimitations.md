# How is Amazon S3 on Outposts different from Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 on Outposts delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment. Using
S3 on Outposts helps you to meet local processing, data residency, and demanding performance
needs by keeping data close to on-premises applications. Because it uses Amazon S3 APIs and
features, S3 on Outposts makes it easy to store, secure, tag, report on, and control access to
the data on your Outposts and extend AWS infrastructure to your on-premises facility for a
consistent hybrid experience.

For more information about how S3 on Outposts is unique, see the following topics.

## S3 on Outposts specifications

- The maximum Outposts bucket size is 50 TB.

- The maximum object size is 5 TB in Outposts buckets.

- The maximum number of Outposts buckets is 100 per AWS account.

- Outposts buckets can be accessed only by using access points and endpoints.

- The maximum number of access points per Outposts bucket is 10.

- Access point policies are limited to 20 KB in size.

- The Outpost owner can manage access within your organization in AWS Organizations by
using AWS Resource Access Manager. All accounts that need access to the Outpost must be within the
same organization as the owner account in AWS Organizations.

- The S3 on Outposts bucket owner account is always the owner of all objects in
the bucket.

- Only the S3 on Outposts bucket owner account can perform operations on the
bucket.

- Object size limitations are consistent with Amazon S3.

- All objects stored on S3 on Outposts are stored in the `OUTPOSTS`
storage class.

- By default, all objects stored in the `OUTPOSTS` storage class are
stored by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys
(SSE-S3). You can also explicitly choose to store objects by using server-side
encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).

- If there is not enough space to store an object on your Outpost, the API
returns an insufficient capacity exception (ICE).
