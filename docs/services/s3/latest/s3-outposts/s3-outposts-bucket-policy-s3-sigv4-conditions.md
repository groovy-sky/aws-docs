# AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4) authentication-specific policy keys

The following table shows the condition keys related to AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4)
authentication that you can use with Amazon S3 on Outposts. In a bucket policy, you can add these
conditions to enforce specific behavior when requests are authenticated by using Signature
Version 4. For example policies, see [Bucket policy examples that use Signature Version 4-related condition keys](#s3-outposts-bucket-policy-sig-v4-condition-key-example). For more
information about authenticating requests using Signature Version 4, see [Authenticating requests (AWS Signature Version 4)](../api/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_

Applicable keysDescription

`s3-outposts:authType`

S3 on Outposts supports various methods of authentication. To restrict
incoming requests to use a specific authentication method, you can use
this optional condition key. For example, you can use this condition key
to allow only the HTTP `Authorization` header to be used in
request authentication.

Valid values:

`REST-HEADER`

`REST-QUERY-STRING`

`s3-outposts:signatureAge`

The length of time, in milliseconds, that a signature is valid in an
authenticated request.

This condition works only for presigned URLs.

In Signature Version 4, the signing key is valid for up to seven days.
Therefore, the signatures are also valid for up to seven days. For more
information, see [Introduction to signing requests](../api/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md#signing-request-intro) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_. You can use this condition to
further limit the signature age.

Example value: `600000`

`s3-outposts:x-amz-content-sha256`

You can use this condition key to disallow unsigned content in your
bucket.

When you use Signature Version 4, for requests that use the
`Authorization` header, you add the
`x-amz-content-sha256` header in the signature
calculation and then set its value to the hash payload.

You can use this condition key in your bucket policy to deny any
uploads where the payloads are not signed. For example:

- Deny uploads that use the `Authorization` header to
authenticate requests but don't sign the payload. For more
information, see [Transferring payload in a single chunk](../api/sig-v4-header-based-auth.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

- Deny uploads that use presigned URLs. Presigned URLs always
have an `UNSIGNED_PAYLOAD`. For more information, see
[Authenticating requests](../api/sigv4-query-string-auth.md#query-string-auth-v4-signing) and [Authentication methods](../api/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

Valid value: `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`

## Bucket policy examples that use Signature Version 4-related condition keys

To use the following examples, replace the `user input
                    placeholders` with your own information.

###### Example: `s3-outposts:signatureAge`

The following bucket policy denies any S3 on Outposts presigned URL request on objects
in `example-outpost-bucket` if the signature is more than 10 minutes old.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Deny a presigned URL request if the signature is more than 10 minutes old",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": {"AWS":"444455556666"},
            "Action": "s3-outposts:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-east-1:111122223333:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outpost-bucket/object/*",
            "Condition": {
                "NumericGreaterThan": {"s3-outposts:signatureAge": 600000},
                "StringEquals": {"s3-outposts:authType": "REST-QUERY-STRING"}
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Example: `s3-outposts:authType`

The following bucket policy allows only requests that use the
`Authorization` header for request authentication. Any presigned URL
requests will be denied since presigned URLs use query parameters to provide request
and authentication information. For more information, see [Authentication\
methods](../api/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
         {
               "Sid": "Allow only requests that use the Authorization header for request authentication. Deny presigned URL requests.",
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Principal": {"AWS":"111122223333"},
               "Action": "s3-outposts:*",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-east-1:111122223333:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outpost-bucket/object/*",

                           "s3-outposts:authType": "REST-HEADER"
                     }
               }
         }
   ]
}

```

###### Example: `s3-outposts:x-amz-content-sha256`

The following bucket policy denies any uploads with unsigned payloads, such as uploads
that are using presigned URLs. For more information, see [Authenticating requests](../api/sigv4-query-string-auth.md#query-string-auth-v4-signing) and [Authentication\
methods](../api/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
         {
               "Sid": "Deny uploads with unsigned payloads.",
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Principal": {"AWS":"111122223333"},
