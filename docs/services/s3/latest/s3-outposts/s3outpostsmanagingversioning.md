# Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket

When enabled, S3 Versioning saves multiple distinct copies of an object in the same bucket. You can use
S3 Versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your
Outposts buckets. S3 Versioning helps you recover from unintended user actions and application
failures.

Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets have three versioning states:

- **Unversioned** – If you’ve never enabled or
suspended S3 Versioning on your bucket, it is unversioned and returns no S3 Versioning
status. For more information about S3 Versioning, see Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket.

- **Enabled** – Enables S3 Versioning for the
objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.
Objects that already existed in the bucket at the time that you enable versioning
have a version ID of `null`. If you modify these (or any other) objects
with other operations, such as [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md), the new objects
get a unique version ID.

- **Suspended** – Suspends S3 Versioning for the
objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket after versioning is suspended
receive the version ID `null`. For more information, see [Adding objects to versioning-suspended buckets](../userguide/addingobjectstoversionsuspendedbuckets.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

After you enable S3 Versioning for an S3 on Outposts bucket, it can never return to an
unversioned state. However, you can suspend versioning. For more information about
S3 Versioning, see Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket.

For each object in your bucket, you have a current version and zero or more noncurrent
versions. To reduce storage costs, you can configure your bucket S3 Lifecycle rules to expire
noncurrent versions after a specified time period. For more information, see [Creating and managing a lifecycle configuration for your Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket](s3outpostslifecyclemanaging.md).

The following examples show you how to enable or suspend versioning for an existing
S3 on Outposts bucket by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). To create a bucket
with S3 Versioning enabled, see [Creating an S3 on Outposts bucket](s3outpostscreatebucket.md).

###### Note

The AWS account that creates the bucket owns it and is the only one that can commit
actions to it. Buckets have configuration properties, such as Outpost, tag, default
encryption, and access point settings. The access point settings include the virtual private cloud (VPC), the access point policy for
accessing the objects in the bucket, and other metadata. For more information, see [S3 on Outposts specifications](s3onoutpostsrestrictionslimitations.md#S3OnOutpostsSpecifications).

###### To edit the S3 Versioning settings for your bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Outposts**
**buckets**.

3. Choose the Outposts bucket that you want to enable S3 Versioning
    for.

4. Choose the **Properties** tab.

5. Under **Bucket Versioning**, choose
    **Edit**.

6. Edit the S3 Versioning settings for the bucket by choosing one of the
    following options:

- To suspend S3 Versioning and stop the creation of new object
versions, choose **Suspend**.

- To enable S3 Versioning and save multiple distinct copies of each
object, choose **Enable**.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

To enable or suspend S3 Versioning for your bucket by using the AWS CLI, use the
`put-bucket-versioning` command, as shown in the following examples.
To use these examples, replace each `user input
                        placeholder` with your own information.

For more information, see [put-bucket-versioning](../../../cli/latest/reference/s3control/put-bucket-versioning.md) in the _AWS CLI Reference_.

###### Example: To enable S3 Versioning

```nohighlight

aws s3control put-bucket-versioning --account-id 123456789012 --bucket arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outposts-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

###### Example: To suspend S3 Versioning

```nohighlight

aws s3control put-bucket-versioning --account-id 123456789012 --bucket arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outposts-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Suspended
```
