# Adding tags for S3 on Outposts buckets

You can add tags for your Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets to track storage costs and other criteria
for individual projects or groups of projects.

###### Note

The AWS account that creates the bucket owns it and is the only one that can change its
tags.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Outposts buckets**.

3. Choose the Outposts bucket whose tags you want to edit.

4. Choose the **Properties** tab.

5. Under **Tags**, choose **Edit**.

6. Choose **Add new tag**, and enter the **Key** and optional **Value**.

Add any tags that you would like to associate with an Outposts bucket to track other
    criteria for individual projects or groups of projects.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

The following AWS CLI example applies a tagging configuration to an S3 on Outposts bucket by
using a JSON document in the current folder that specifies tags
( `tagging.json`). To use this example,
replace each `user input placeholder` with your own
information.

```nohighlight

aws s3control put-bucket-tagging --account-id 123456789012 --bucket arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outposts-bucket --tagging file://tagging.json

tagging.json

{
   "TagSet": [
     {
       "Key": "organization",
       "Value": "marketing"
     }
   ]
}
```

The following AWS CLI example applies a tagging configuration to an S3 on Outposts bucket
directly from the command line.

```nohighlight

aws s3control put-bucket-tagging --account-id 123456789012 --bucket arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:123456789012:outpost/op-01ac5d28a6a232904/bucket/example-outposts-bucket --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=organization,Value=marketing}]'
```
