# Creating an S3 on Outposts bucket

With Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts and easily store and
retrieve objects on premises for applications that require local data access, local data
processing, and data residency. S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts
( `OUTPOSTS`), which uses the Amazon S3 APIs, and is designed to store
data durably and redundantly across multiple devices and servers on your AWS Outposts. You communicate with your Outpost bucket
by using an access point
and endpoint connection over a virtual private cloud (VPC). You can use the same APIs and
features on Outpost buckets as you do on Amazon S3 buckets, including access policies, encryption, and tagging.
You can use S3 on Outposts through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. For more information, see [What is Amazon S3 on Outposts?](s3onoutposts.md)

###### Note

The AWS account that creates the bucket owns it and is the only one that can commit
actions to it. Buckets have configuration properties, such as Outpost, tag, default
encryption, and access point settings. The access point settings include the virtual private cloud (VPC), the access point policy for
accessing the objects in the bucket, and other metadata. For more information, see [S3 on Outposts specifications](s3onoutpostsrestrictionslimitations.md#S3OnOutpostsSpecifications).

If you want to create a bucket that uses AWS PrivateLink to provide bucket and endpoint
management access through _interface VPC endpoints_ in your virtual
private cloud (VPC), see [AWS PrivateLink for S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-outposts-privatelink-interface-endpoints.html).

The following examples show you how to create an S3 on Outposts bucket by using the
AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDK for Java.

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Outposts buckets**.

03. Choose **Create Outposts bucket**.

04. For **Bucket name**, enter a Domain Name System (DNS)-compliant name
     for your bucket.

    The bucket name must:

- Be unique within the AWS account, the Outpost, and the AWS Region that the
Outpost is homed to.

- Be 3–63 characters long.

- Not contain uppercase characters.

- Start with a lowercase letter or number.

After you create the bucket, you can't change its name. For information about
naming buckets, see [General purpose bucket naming rules](../userguide/bucketnamingrules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Important

Avoid including sensitive information such as account numbers in the
bucket name. The bucket name is visible in the URLs that point to the
objects in the bucket.

05. For **Outpost**, choose the Outpost where you want the bucket to
     reside.

06. Under **Bucket Versioning**, set the S3 Versioning state for your
     S3 on Outposts bucket to one of the following options:

- **Disable** (default) – The bucket remains
unversioned.

- **Enable** – Enables S3 Versioning for the objects in
the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

For more information about S3 Versioning, see [Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket](s3outpostsmanagingversioning.md).

07. (Optional) Add any **optional tags** that you would like to associate
     with the Outposts bucket. You can use tags to track criteria for individual projects or
     groups of projects, or to label your buckets by using cost-allocation tags.

    By default, all objects stored in your Outposts bucket are stored by using
     server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). You can also
     explicitly choose to store objects by using server-side encryption with
     customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C). To change the encryption type, you must use
     the REST API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs.

08. In the **Outposts access point settings** section, enter the access point
     name.

    S3 on Outposts access points simplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets in
     S3 on Outposts. Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to Outposts
     buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations. For more information, see
     [Access points](s3outpostsworkingbuckets.md#S3OutpostsAP).

    Access point names must be unique within the account for this Region and Outpost, and
     comply with the [access point restrictions and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-restrictions-limitations.html).

09. Choose the **VPC** for this Amazon S3 on Outposts access point.

    If you don't have a VPC, choose **Create VPC**. For more information,
     see [Creating access points restricted to a virtual private cloud (VPC)](../userguide/access-points-vpc.md) in the
     _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

    A virtual private cloud (VPC) enables you to launch AWS
     resources into a virtual network that you define. This virtual network closely resembles
     a traditional network that you would operate in your own data center, with the benefits
     of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

10. (Optional for an existing VPC) Choose an **Endpoint subnet** for your endpoint.

    A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. If you don't have the subnet that you
     want, choose **Create subnet**. For more information, see [Networking for S3 on Outposts](s3outpostsnetworking.md).

11. (Optional for an existing VPC) Choose an **Endpoint security group** for your endpoint.

    A [security group](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-security-groups.md) acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound
     traffic.

12. (Optional for an existing VPC) Choose the **Endpoint access type**:

- **Private** – To be used with the VPC.

- **Customer owned IP** – To be used with a
customer-owned IP address pool (CoIP pool) from within your on-premises
network.

13. (Optional) Specify the **Outpost access point policy**. The console
     automatically displays the **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)** for the access point,
     which you can use in the policy.

14. Choose **Create Outposts bucket**.

    ###### Note

    It can take up to 5 minutes for your Outpost endpoint to be created and your
    bucket to be ready to use. To configure additional bucket settings, choose
    **View details**.

###### Example

The following example creates an S3 on Outposts bucket ( `s3-outposts:CreateBucket`)
by using the AWS CLI. To run this command, replace the `user input
                placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3control create-bucket --bucket example-outposts-bucket --outpost-id op-01ac5d28a6a232904
```

###### Example

For examples of how to create an S3 Outposts bucket with the AWS SDK for Java, see [CreateOutpostsBucket.java](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/javav2/example_code/s3/src/main/java/com/example/s3/outposts/CreateOutpostsBucket.java) in the _AWS SDK for Java 2.x Code Examples_.
