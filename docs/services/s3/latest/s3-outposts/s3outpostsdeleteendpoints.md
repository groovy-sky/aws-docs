# Deleting an Amazon S3 on Outposts endpoint

To route requests to an Amazon S3 on Outposts access point, you must create and configure an
S3 on Outposts endpoint. In order to create an endpoint, you will need an active connection with your service link to your Outposts home region. Each virtual private cloud (VPC) on your Outpost can have one associated endpoint. For more information about endpoint quotas, see [S3 on Outposts network requirements](s3onoutpostsrestrictionslimitations.md#S3OnOutpostsConnectivityRestrictions). You must create an endpoint to be able to
access your Outposts buckets and perform object operations. For more information, see [Endpoints](s3outpostsworkingbuckets.md#S3OutpostsEP).

The following examples show you how to delete your S3 on Outposts endpoints by using the
AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDK for Java.

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Outposts access**
**points**.

3. On the **Outposts access points** page, choose the **Outposts endpoints** tab.

4. Under **Outposts endpoints**, choose the endpoint that you want to delete, and choose **Delete**.

The following AWS CLI example deletes an endpoint for an Outpost. To run this command,
replace the `user input placeholders` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3outposts delete-endpoint --endpoint-id example-endpoint-id --outpost-id op-01ac5d28a6a232904
```

The following SDK for Java example deletes an endpoint for an Outpost. To use this example,
replace the `user input placeholders` with
your own information.

```Java

import com.amazonaws.arn.Arn;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3outposts.AmazonS3Outposts;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3outposts.AmazonS3OutpostsClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3outposts.model.DeleteEndpointRequest;

public void deleteEndpoint(String endpointArnInput) {
    String outpostId = "op-01ac5d28a6a232904";
    AmazonS3Outposts s3OutpostsClient = AmazonS3OutpostsClientBuilder
                .standard().build();

    Arn endpointArn = Arn.fromString(endpointArnInput);
    String[] resourceParts = endpointArn.getResource().getResource().split("/");
    String endpointId = resourceParts[resourceParts.length - 1];
    DeleteEndpointRequest deleteEndpointRequest = new DeleteEndpointRequest()
                .withEndpointId(endpointId)
                .withOutpostId(outpostId);
    s3OutpostsClient.deleteEndpoint(deleteEndpointRequest);
    System.out.println("Endpoint with id " + endpointId + " is deleted.");
}
```
