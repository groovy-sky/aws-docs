# POST Object restore

## Description

This operation performs the following types of requests:

- `select` – Perform a select query on an archived object

- `restore an archive` – Restore an archived object

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
`s3:RestoreObject` and `s3:GetObject` actions. The bucket
owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more
information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\
Resources](../userguide/s3-access-control.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

## Querying Archives with Select Requests

You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived
objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed
comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your
archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview
about select requests, see [Querying Archived Objects](../userguide/querying-glacier-archives.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

When making a select request, do the following:

- Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in
the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being
queried. The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write
to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the
output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see
[Querying Archived\
Objects](../userguide/querying-glacier-archives.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

For more information about the `S3` structure in the request body, see the
following:

- [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md)

- [Managing Access with\
ACLs](../userguide/s3-acls-usingacls.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_

- [Protecting Data\
Using Server-Side Encryption](../userguide/serv-side-encryption.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_

- Define the SQL expression for the `SELECT` type of restoration for your query
in the request body's `SelectParameters` structure. You can use
expressions like the following examples.

- The following expression returns all records from the specified object.

```SQL

SELECT * FROM Object
```

- Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can
specify columns with positional headers.

```SQL

SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100
```

- If you have headers and you set the `fileHeaderInfo` in the `CSV`
structure in the request body to `USE`, you can specify
headers in the query. (If you set the `fileHeaderInfo` field
to `IGNORE`, the first row is skipped for the query.) You
cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.

```SQL

SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s
```

For more information about using SQL with Amazon Glacier Select restore, see [SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and\
Amazon Glacier Select](../userguide/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

When making a select request, you can also do the following:

- To expedite your queries, specify the `Expedited` tier. For more information
about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.

- Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being
queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.

The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

- The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until
explicitly deleted—manually or through a lifecycle policy.

- You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't
deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.

- Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select
request doesn’t return error response `409`.

## Restoring Archives

Objects in the GLACIER
and DEEP\_ARCHIVE
storage
classes
are archived. To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request.
This restores a
temporary
copy of the archived object.
In
a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to
exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object
remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP\_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored
from.

To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't
provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which
storage class the
object is being restored from and which data access tier you
specify.

When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of
the following data
access tier options in the `Tier` element of the request
body:

- **`Expedited`** \- Expedited retrievals
allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when
occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but
the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals
are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it.
Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the
DEEP\_ARCHIVE storage class.

- **`Standard`** \- Standard retrievals
allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is
the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP\_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do
not specify the retrieval option.
Standard
retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class
and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP\_ARCHIVE storage
class.

- **`Bulk`** \- Bulk retrievals are
Amazon Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts,
even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day.
Bulk
retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class
and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP\_ARCHIVE storage
class.

For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for
`Expedited` data access, see [Restoring Archived Objects](../userguide/restoring-objects.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed
while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing
another restore request to the same object, setting a new `Tier` request
element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that
is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any
other parameters, such as the `Days` request element. For more information,
see [Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore](../userguide/restoring-objects.md#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

To get the status of object restoration, you can send a `HEAD` request.
Operations return the `x-amz-restore` header, which provides information
about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to
notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon S3 Event\
Notifications](../userguide/notificationhowto.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the
current time and charges only for the request—there are no data transfer charges.

You cannot update
the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for
the object.

If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
about lifecycle configuration, see [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](../api/api-putbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md) and [Object Lifecycle Management](../userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.md) in
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

No`FileHeaderInfo`

Describes the first line in the input data. It is one of the ENUM values.

- `NONE`: First line is not a header.

- `IGNORE`: First line is a header, but you can't use the header values to
indicate the column in an expression. You can use column
position (such as \_1, \_2, …) to indicate the column
( `SELECT s._1 FROM OBJECT s`).

## Responses

A successful operation returns either the `200 OK` or `202 Accepted`
status code.

- If the object copy is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns `202
  							Accepted` in the response.

- If the object copy is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` in the
response.

### Response Headers

This implementation of the operation uses only response headers that are common to most
responses. For more information, see [Common Response Headers](restcommonresponseheaders.md).

### Response Elements

This operation does not return response elements.

### Special Errors

## Examples

### Restore an Object for Two Days Using the Expedited Retrieval Option

The following restore request restores a copy of the `photo1.jpg` object from
Amazon Glacier for a period of two days using the expedited retrieval option.

```nohighlight

POST /photo1.jpg?restore HTTP/1.1
Host: examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com

Authorization: authorization string
Content-Length: content length

<RestoreRequest>
  <Days>2</Days>
  <GlacierJobParameters>
    <Tier>Expedited</Tier>
  </GlacierJobParameters>
</RestoreRequest>
```

If the `examplebucket` does not have a restored copy of the object, Amazon S3
returns the following `202 Accepted` response.

```

HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
x-amz-id-2: GFihv3y6+kE7KG11GEkQhU7/2/cHR3Yb2fCb2S04nxI423Dqwg2XiQ0B/UZlzYQvPiBlZNRcovw=
