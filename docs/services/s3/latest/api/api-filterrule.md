# FilterRule

Specifies the Amazon S3 object key name to filter on. An object key name is the name assigned to an
object in your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify whether to filter on the suffix or prefix of the object key
name. A prefix is a specific string of characters at the beginning of an object key name, which you can
use to organize objects. For example, you can start the key names of related objects with a prefix, such
as `2023-` or `engineering/`. Then, you can use `FilterRule` to find
objects in a bucket with key names that have the same prefix. A suffix is similar to a prefix, but it is
at the end of the object key name instead of at the beginning.
