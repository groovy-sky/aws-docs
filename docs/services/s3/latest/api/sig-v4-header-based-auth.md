# Signature Calculations for the Authorization Header: Transferring Payload in a Single Chunk (AWS Signature Version 4)

When using the `Authorization` header to authenticate requests, the header value includes,
among other things, a signature. The signature calculations vary depending on the
choice you make for transferring the payload ( [Overview](sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.md#sigv4-auth-header-overview)). This section explains signature calculations when you choose to transfer the
payload in a single chunk. The example section (see [Examples: Signature Calculations](#example-signature-calculations)) shows signature calculations
and resulting `Authorization` headers that you can use as a test suite to verify your
code.

###### Important

When transferring payload in a single chunk, you can optionally choose to include the
payload hash in the signature calculations, referred as _signed payload_ (if you
don't include it, the payload is considered _unsigned_). The signing procedure
discussed in the following section applies to both, but note the following
differences:

- Signed payload option – You include the
payload hash when constructing the canonical request (that then
becomes part of StringToSign, as explained in the signature
calculation section). You also specify the same value as the
`x-amz-content-sha256` header value when sending the
request to S3.

- Unsigned payload option – You include the literal
string `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` when constructing a canonical
request, and set the same value as the `x-amz-content-sha256`
header value when sending the request to Amazon S3.

When you send your request to Amazon S3, the `x-amz-content-sha256` header value
informs Amazon S3 whether the payload is signed or not. Amazon S3 can then create the signature accordingly for verification.

In both cases, because the `x-amz-content-sha256` header value is already part of your `HashedPayload`, you are not required to include the `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a canonical header.

## Calculating a Signature

To calculate a signature, you first need a string to sign. You then calculate
a `HMAC-SHA256` hash of the string to sign by using a signing key. The following
diagram illustrates the process, including the various components of the string
that you create for signing

When Amazon S3 receives an authenticated request, it computes the signature and
then compares it with the signature that you provided in the request. For that
reason, you must compute the signature by using the same method that is used by
Amazon S3. The process of putting a request in an agreed-upon form for signing is
called canonicalization.

![AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 signature process diagram showing canonical request, StringToSign, and signature steps.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/API/images/sigV4-using-auth-header.png)

The following table describes the functions that are shown in the diagram.
You need to implement code for these functions.

FunctionDescription`Lowercase()`Convert the string to lowercase.`Hex()`Lowercase base 16 encoding.`SHA256Hash()`Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) cryptographic hash function.`HMAC-SHA256()`Computes HMAC by using the SHA256 algorithm with the signing key provided. This is the final signature.`Trim()`Remove any leading or trailing whitespace. `UriEncode()`

URI encode every byte. UriEncode() must enforce the following rules:

- URI encode every byte except the unreserved
characters: 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '-', '.',
'\_', and '~'.

- The space character is a reserved character and must be
encoded as "%20" (and not as "+").

- Each URI encoded byte is formed by a '%' and the
two-digit hexadecimal value of the byte.

- Letters in the hexadecimal value must be uppercase, for
example "%1A".

- Encode the forward slash character, '/', everywhere
except in
the object key name. For example, if the object key name is
`photos/Jan/sample.jpg`, the forward
slash in the key name is not encoded.

###### Important

The standard UriEncode functions provided by your development platform may not work
because of differences in implementation and
related ambiguity in the underlying RFCs. We recommend that you write your own custom UriEncode
function to ensure that your encoding will
work.

To see an example of a UriEncode function in Java, see
[Java Utilities](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/util/SdkHttpUtils.java)
on the GitHub website.

### Task 1: Create a Canonical Request

This section provides an overview of creating a canonical request.

The following is the canonical request format that Amazon S3 uses to calculate
a signature. For signatures to match, you must create a canonical request in
this format:

```nohighlight

<HTTPMethod>\n
<CanonicalURI>\n
<CanonicalQueryString>\n
<CanonicalHeaders>\n
<SignedHeaders>\n
<HashedPayload>
```

Where:

- `HTTPMethod` is one of the HTTP
methods, for example GET, PUT, HEAD, and DELETE.

- `CanonicalURI` is the URI-encoded
version of the absolute path component of the
URI—everything starting with the "/" that follows the
domain name and up to the end of the string or to the question
mark character ('?') if you have query string parameters. The URI in the
following example, `/examplebucket/myphoto.jpg`, is the absolute path
and you don't encode the "/" in the absolute path:

```nohighlight

http://s3.amazonaws.com/examplebucket/myphoto.jpg
```

###### Note

You do not normalize URI paths for requests to Amazon
S3. For example, you may have a bucket with an object
named "my-object//example//photo.user". Normalizing the
path changes the object name in the request to
"my-object/example/photo.user". This is an incorrect
path for that object.

- `CanonicalQueryString` specifies the
URI-encoded query string parameters. You URI-encode name and
values individually. You must also sort the parameters in the
canonical query string alphabetically by key name. The sorting
occurs after encoding. The query string in the following URI example is
`prefix=somePrefix&marker=someMarker&max-keys=20`:

```

http://s3.amazonaws.com/examplebucket?prefix=somePrefix&marker=someMarker&max-keys=20
```

The canonical query string is as follows (line breaks are added
to this example for readability):

```

UriEncode("marker")+"="+UriEncode("someMarker")+"&"+
UriEncode("max-keys")+"="+UriEncode("20") + "&" +
UriEncode("prefix")+"="+UriEncode("somePrefix")
```

When a request targets a subresource, the corresponding query
parameter value will be an empty string (""). For example, the
following URI identifies the `ACL` subresource on the
`examplebucket` bucket:

```

http://s3.amazonaws.com/examplebucket?acl
```

The CanonicalQueryString in this case is as follows:

```

UriEncode("acl") + "=" + ""
```

If the URI does not include a '?', there is no query string in
the request, and you set the canonical query string to an empty
string (""). You will still need to include the "\\n".

- `CanonicalHeaders` is a list of
request headers with their values. Individual header name and
value pairs are separated by the newline character ("\\n").
Header names must be in lowercase. You must sort the header
names alphabetically to construct the string, as shown in the
following example:

```nohighlight

Lowercase(<HeaderName1>)+":"+Trim(<value>)+"\n"
Lowercase(<HeaderName2>)+":"+Trim(<value>)+"\n"
...
Lowercase(<HeaderNameN>)+":"+Trim(<value>)+"\n"
```

The `Lowercase()` and `Trim()` functions
used in this example are described in the preceding section.

The `CanonicalHeaders` list must
include the following:

- HTTP `host` header.

- If the `Content-MD5` header is present in
the request, you must add it to the
`CanonicalHeaders` list.

- Any `x-amz-*` headers that you plan to
include in your request must also be added. For example,
if you are using temporary security credentials, you
need to include `x-amz-security-token` in your
request. You must add this header in the list of
`CanonicalHeaders`.

###### Note

- The `x-amz-content-sha256`
header is required for all AWS Signature Version 4 requests. It provides a hash of the
request payload. However, you are not required to include the `x-amz-content-sha256` as a canonical header because S3 will automatically use its value when calculating the payload hash sent in the request.

- If there is no payload, you must provide the
hash of an empty string.

- If you do not want S3 to check against the hash of the request, you can use the literal string `"UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD"` instead.

The following are example `CanonicalHeaders`
strings. The header names are in lowercase and sorted.

###### Example 1

```

host:s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-content-sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
x-amz-date:20130708T220855Z
```

###### Example 2

```

host:s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-content-sha256:UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD
x-amz-date:20130708T220855Z
```

###### Example 3

```

host:s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-date:20130708T220855Z
```

###### Note

For the purpose of calculating an authorization signature, the
host header and all `x-amz-*` headers, excluding `x-amz-content-sha256`, are required.
However, in order to prevent data tampering, you should
consider including all the headers in the signature
calculation.

Signing the `x-amz-content-sha256` header is optional because S3 will use its value when calculating the received request payload hash.

- `SignedHeaders` is an alphabetically
sorted, semicolon-separated list of lowercase request header
names. The request headers in the list are the same headers that
you included in the `CanonicalHeaders` string. In the previous examples, the value of
`SignedHeaders` would be as
follows:

###### Examples 1 and 2

```

host;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date
```

###### Example 3

```

host;x-amz-date
```

- `HashedPayload` is the hexadecimal
value of the SHA256 hash of the request payload.

```nohighlight

Hex(SHA256Hash(<payload>)
```

If there is no payload in the request, you compute a hash of
the empty string as follows:

```

Hex(SHA256Hash(""))
```

The hash returns the following value:

```

e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
```

For example, when you upload an object by using a PUT request,
you provide object data in the body. When you retrieve an object
by using a GET request, you compute the empty string hash.

### Task 2: Create a String to Sign

This section provides an overview of creating a string to sign. For
step-by-step instructions, see [Task 2: Create a\
String to Sign](../../../../general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-string-to-sign.md) in the _AWS General Reference_.

The string to sign is a concatenation of the following strings:

```nohighlight

"AWS4-HMAC-SHA256" + "\n" +
timeStampISO8601Format + "\n" +
<Scope> + "\n" +
Hex(SHA256Hash(<CanonicalRequest>))
```

The constant string `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256` specifies the hash
algorithm that you are using, HMAC-SHA256. The `timeStamp` is the
current UTC time in ISO 8601 format (for example,
`20130524T000000Z`).

`Scope` binds the resulting signature to a specific date, an AWS Region, and a
service. Thus, your resulting signature will work only in the specific
Region and for a specific service. The signature is valid for seven days
after the specified date.

```nohighlight

date.Format(<YYYYMMDD>) + "/" + <region> + "/" + <service> + "/aws4_request"
```

For Amazon S3, the service string is `s3`. For a list of
`region` strings, see [Regions and Endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#s3_region) in the
_AWS General Reference_. The Region column in this table
provides the list of valid Region strings.

The following scope restricts the resulting signature to the `us-east-1`
Region and Amazon S3.

```

20130606/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request
```

###### Note

`Scope` must use the same date that you use to compute
the signing key, as discussed in the following section.

### Task 3: Calculate Signature

In AWS Signature Version 4, instead of using your AWS access keys to sign a request, you
first create a signing key that is scoped to a specific Region and service.
For more information about signing keys, see [Introduction to Signing Requests](sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md#signing-request-intro).

```nohighlight

DateKey              = HMAC-SHA256("AWS4"+"<SecretAccessKey>", "<YYYYMMDD>")
DateRegionKey        = HMAC-SHA256(<DateKey>, "<aws-region>")
DateRegionServiceKey = HMAC-SHA256(<DateRegionKey>, "<aws-service>")
SigningKey           = HMAC-SHA256(<DateRegionServiceKey>, "aws4_request")
```

###### Note

Some use cases can process signature keys for up to 7 days. For more information see [Share an Object with Others](../dev/shareobjectpresignedurl.md).

For a list of Region strings, see [Regions and\
Endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#s3_region) in the _AWS General Reference_.

Using a signing key enables you to keep your AWS credentials in one safe
place. For example, if you have multiple servers that communicate with Amazon S3,
you share the signing key with those servers; you don’t have to keep a copy
of your secret access key on each server. Signing key is valid for up to
seven days. So each time you calculate signing key you will need to share
the signing key with your servers. For more information, see [Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)](sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md).

The final signature is the HMAC-SHA256 hash of the string to sign, using
the signing key as the key.

```

HMAC-SHA256(SigningKey, StringToSign)
```

For step-by-step instructions on creating a signature, see [Task 3: Create a\
Signature](../../../../general/latest/gr/sigv4-calculate-signature.md) in the _AWS General Reference_.

### Examples: Signature Calculations

You can use the examples in this section as a reference to check signature
calculations in your code. The calculations shown in the examples use the following data:

- Example access keys.

ParameterValue`AWSAccessKeyId``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED``AWSSecretAccessKey``wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

- Request timestamp of 20130524T000000Z ( `Fri, 24 May 2013
  										00:00:00 GMT`).

- Bucket name `examplebucket`.

- The bucket is assumed to be in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. The credential
`Scope` and the `Signing Key` calculations
use `us-east-1` as the Region specifier.
For information about other Regions, see [Regions and Endpoints](../../../../general/latest/gr/rande.md#s3_region)
in the _AWS General Reference_.

- You can use either path-style or virtual hosted–style
requests. The following examples show how to sign a virtual
hosted–style request, for example:

```

https://examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/photo1.jpg
```

For more information, see [Virtual Hosting of\
Buckets](../userguide/virtualhosting.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

#### Example: GET Object

The following example gets the first 10 bytes of an object (test.txt) from
`examplebucket`. For more information about the API
action, see [GetObject](api-getobject.md).

```nohighlight

GET /test.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Authorization: SignatureToBeCalculated
Range: bytes=0-9
x-amz-content-sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
x-amz-date: 20130524T000000Z
```

Because this GET request does not provide any body content, the
`x-amz-content-sha256` value can either be the hash of the empty
request body or the literal string `"UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD"`. The following steps show signature calculations and
construction of the `Authorization` header using the hash of an empty string.

1. ###### StringToSign

1. ###### CanonicalRequest

      ```

      GET
      /test.txt

      host:examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com
      range:bytes=0-9
      x-amz-content-sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
      x-amz-date:20130524T000000Z

      host;range;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date

      ```

      In the canonical request string, the last line is the
       hash of the empty request body. The third line is empty
       because there are no query parameters in the request.

2. ###### StringToSign

```

4. ###### Authorization header

The resulting `Authorization` header is as follows:

```

AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_REDACTED/20130524/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request,SignedHeaders=host;range;x-amz-content-sha256;x-amz-date,Signature=f0e8bdb87c964420e857bd35b5d6ed310bd44f0170aba48dd91039c6036bdb41
```

#### Example: PUT Object

This example PUT request creates an object ( `test$file.text`) in
`examplebucket` . The example assumes the
following:

- You are requesting `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY` as the
storage class by adding the `x-amz-storage-class`
request header. For information about storage classes, see
[Storage Classes](../userguide/usingmetadata.md#storage-class-intro) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

- The content of the uploaded file is a string, `"Welcome to
  										Amazon S3."` The value of `x-amz-content-sha256` in the
request is based on this string.

For information about the API action, see [PutObject](api-putobject.md).

```nohighlight

PUT test$file.text HTTP/1.1
Host: examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Fri, 24 May 2013 00:00:00 GMT
Authorization: SignatureToBeCalculated
x-amz-date: 20130524T000000Z
x-amz-storage-class: REDUCED_REDUNDANCY

<Payload>
```

The following steps show signature calculations.

1. ###### StringToSign

1. ###### CanonicalRequest

      ```

      PUT

      ```

      In the canonical request, the third line is empty
       because there are no query parameters in the request. The `x-amz-content-sha256` canonical header may optionally be signed since its payload hash is already provided at the bottom of the request.
       The last line is the hash of the body, which should be the same as the `x-amz-content-sha256 header`
       value sent to S3 in the HTTP request.

```

#### Example: GET Bucket Lifecycle

The following GET request retrieves the lifecycle configuration of
`examplebucket`. For information about the API action,
see [GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration](api-getbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md).

```nohighlight

GET ?lifecycle HTTP/1.1

```

Because the request does not provide any body content, the
`x-amz-content-sha256` header value is the hash of the
empty request body. The following steps show signature
calculations.

1. ###### StringToSign

#### Example: Get Bucket (List Objects)

The following example retrieves a list of objects from
`examplebucket` bucket. For information about the API
action, see [ListObjects](api-listobjects.md).

```nohighlight
