# DeleteBucketWebsite

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3 returns a `200 OK`
response upon successfully deleting a website configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a
`200 OK` response if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on
the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a `404` response if the bucket specified in the request does not
exist.

This DELETE action requires the `S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only the
bucket owner can delete the website configuration attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant
other users permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the
`S3:DeleteBucketWebsite` permission.

For more information about hosting websites, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).
