This section discusses how to upload files directly to Amazon S3 through a browser using HTTP POST
requests. It also contains information about how to use the AWS Amplify JavaScript library
for browser-based file uploads to Amazon S3.

## Browser-Based Uploads Using HTTP POST

Amazon S3 supports HTTP POST requests so that users can upload content directly to Amazon S3. By
using POST, end users can authenticate requests without having to pass data through a
secure intermediary node that protects your credentials. Thus, HTTP POST has the
potential to reduce latency.

The following figure shows an Amazon S3 upload using a POST request.

1. The user accesses your page from a web browser.

2. Your webpage contains an
    HTML
    form that contains all the information necessary for the user to upload
    content to Amazon S3.

3. The user uploads content to Amazon S3 through the web browser.

The process for sending browser-based POST requests is as follows:

1. Create a security policy specifying conditions that restrict what you want to allow in the
    request, such as the bucket name where objects can be uploaded, and key name
    prefixes that you want to allow for the object that is being created.

2. Create a signature that is based on the policy. For authenticated requests, the form must
    include a valid signature and the policy.

3. Create an HTML form that your users can access in order to upload objects to
    your Amazon S3 bucket.

The following section describes how to create a signature to authenticate a request.
For information about creating forms and security policies, see [Creating an HTML Form (Using AWS Signature Version 4)](sigv4-httppostforms.md).

## Calculating a Signature

For authenticated requests, the HTML form must include fields for a security policy
and a signature.

- A security policy (see [POST Policy](sigv4-httppostconstructpolicy.md)) controls what is allowed in
the request.

- The security policy is the `StringToSign` (see [Introduction to Signing Requests](sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md#signing-request-intro)) in
your signature calculation.

###### To Calculate a signature

1. Create a policy using UTF-8 encoding.

2. Convert the UTF-8-encoded policy bytes to base64. The result is the
    `StringToSign`.

3. Create a signing key.

4. Use the signing key to sign the `StringToSign` using HMAC-SHA256 signing
    algorithm.
