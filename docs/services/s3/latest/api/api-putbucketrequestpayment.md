# PutBucketRequestPayment

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Sets the request payment configuration for a bucket. By default, the bucket owner pays for downloads
from the bucket. This configuration parameter enables the bucket owner (only) to specify that the person
requesting the download will be charged for the download. For more information, see [Requester Pays\
Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html).

The following operations are related to `PutBucketRequestPayment`:

- [CreateBucket](api-createbucket.md)

- [GetBucketRequestPayment](api-getbucketrequestpayment.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

PUT /?requestPayment HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Content-MD5: ContentMD5
x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm: ChecksumAlgorithm
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<RequestPaymentConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
   <Payer>string</Payer>
</RequestPaymentConfiguration>
```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_PutBucketRequestPayment_RequestSyntax)**

The bucket name.

Required: Yes

**[Content-MD5](#API_PutBucketRequestPayment_RequestSyntax)**

The Base64 encoded 128-bit `MD5` digest of the data. You must use this header as a
message integrity check to verify that the request body was not corrupted in transit. For more
information, see [RFC 1864](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt).

For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_PutBucketRequestPayment_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm](#API_PutBucketRequestPayment_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any
additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or
`x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm`
parameter.

Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in XML format.

**[RequestPaymentConfiguration](#API_PutBucketRequestPayment_RequestSyntax)**

Root level tag for the RequestPaymentConfiguration parameters.

Required: Yes

**[Payer](#API_PutBucketRequestPayment_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies who pays for the download and request fees.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Requester | BucketOwner`

Required: Yes
