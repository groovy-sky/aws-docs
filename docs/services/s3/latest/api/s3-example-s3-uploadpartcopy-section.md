# Use `UploadPartCopy` with an AWS SDK or CLI

The following code examples show how to use `UploadPartCopy`.

Action examples are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. You can see this action in
context in the following code example:

- [Perform a multipart copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_MultipartCopy_section.html)

CLI

**AWS CLI**

**To upload part of an object by copying data from an existing object as the data source**

The following `upload-part-copy` example uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as a data source.

```nohighlight

aws s3api upload-part-copy \
    --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
    --key "Map_Data_June.mp4" \
    --copy-source "amzn-s3-demo-bucket/copy_of_Map_Data_June.mp4" \
    --part-number 1 \
    --upload-id "bq0tdE1CDpWQYRPLHuNG50xAT6pA5D.m_RiBy0ggOH6b13pVRY7QjvLlf75iFdJqp_2wztk5hvpUM2SesXgrzbehG5hViyktrfANpAD0NO.Nk3XREBqvGeZF6U3ipiSm"

```

Output:

```nohighlight

{
    "CopyPartResult": {
        "LastModified": "2019-12-13T23:16:03.000Z",
        "ETag": "\"711470fc377698c393d94aed6305e245\""
    }
}
```

                    logger.error("Error during upload part copy: " + exception.getMessage());
                } else {
                    // Successfully completed the upload part copy.
                    System.out.println("Upload Part Copy completed successfully. ETag: " + uploadPartCopyResponse.copyPartResult().eTag());
