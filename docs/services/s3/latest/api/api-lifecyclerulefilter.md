# LifecycleRuleFilter

The `Filter` is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle Rule applies to. A
`Filter` can have exactly one of `Prefix`, `Tag`,
`ObjectSizeGreaterThan`, `ObjectSizeLessThan`, or `And` specified. If
the `Filter` element is left empty, the Lifecycle Rule applies to all objects in the
bucket.

## Contents

**And**

This is used in a Lifecycle Rule Filter to apply a logical AND to two or more predicates. The
Lifecycle Rule will apply to any object matching all of the predicates configured inside the And
operator.
