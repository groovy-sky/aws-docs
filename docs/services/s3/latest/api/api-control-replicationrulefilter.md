# ReplicationRuleFilter

A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule applies. A
`Filter` element must specify exactly one `Prefix`,
`Tag`, or `And` child element.

## Contents

**And**

A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset of objects
that the rule applies to. This element is required only if you specify more than one
filter. For example:

- If you specify both a `Prefix` and a `Tag` filter, wrap
these filters in an `And` element.

- If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the `Tag` elements
in an `And` element.

Required: No

**Prefix**

An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects that the rule applies
to.

###### Important

When you're using XML requests, you must
replace special characters (such as carriage returns) in object keys with their equivalent XML entity codes.
For more information, see [XML-related object key constraints](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-xml-related-constraints) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
