# ListVectors

List vectors in the specified vector index. To specify the vector index, you can either
use both the vector bucket name and the vector index name, or use the vector index Amazon
Resource Name (ARN).

`ListVectors` operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster
performance on a large number of vectors in a vector index, applications can request a
parallel `ListVectors` operation by providing the `segmentCount` and
`segmentIndex` parameters.

Permissions

You must have the `s3vectors:ListVectors` permission to use this
operation. Additional permissions are required based on the request parameters you
specify:

- With only `s3vectors:ListVectors` permission, you can list
vector keys when `returnData` and `returnMetadata` are
both set to false or not specified..

- If you set `returnData` or `returnMetadata` to
true, you must have both `s3vectors:ListVectors` and
`s3vectors:GetVectors` permissions. The request fails with a
`403 Forbidden` error if you request vector data or metadata
without the `s3vectors:GetVectors` permission.

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[indexArn](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The Amazon resource Name (ARN) of the vector index.

Type: String

Pattern: `arn:aws[-a-z0-9]*:s3vectors:[a-z0-9-]+:[0-9]{12}:bucket/[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-.]{1,61}[a-z0-9]/index/[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-.]{1,61}[a-z0-9]`

Required: No

**[indexName](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the vector index.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 63.

Required: No

**[maxResults](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The maximum number of vectors to return on a page.

If you don't specify `maxResults`, the `ListVectors` operation
uses a default value of 500.

If the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before reaching the `maxResults`
value, the operation stops and returns the vectors that are retrieved up to that point,
along with a `nextToken` that you can use in a subsequent request to retrieve
the next set of results.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 1000.

Required: No

**[nextToken](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

Pagination token from a previous request. The value of this field is empty for an
initial request.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**[returnData](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

If true, the vector data of each vector will be included in the response. The default
value is `false`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[returnMetadata](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

If true, the metadata associated with each vector will be included in the response. The
default value is `false`.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[segmentCount](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

For a parallel `ListVectors` request, `segmentCount` represents
the total number of vector segments into which the `ListVectors` operation will
be divided. The value of `segmentCount` corresponds to the number of application
workers that will perform the parallel `ListVectors` operation. For example, if
you want to use four application threads to list vectors in a vector index, specify a
`segmentCount` value of 4.

If you specify a `segmentCount` value of 1, the `ListVectors`
operation will be sequential rather than parallel.

If you specify `segmentCount`, you must also specify
`segmentIndex`.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 16.

Required: No

**[segmentIndex](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

For a parallel `ListVectors` request, `segmentIndex` is the index
of the segment from which to list vectors in the current request. It identifies an
individual segment to be listed by an application worker.

Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For example, if you want
to use four application threads to list vectors in a vector index, then the first thread
specifies a `segmentIndex` value of 0, the second thread specifies 1, and so on.

The value of `segmentIndex` must be less than the value provided for
`segmentCount`.

If you provide `segmentIndex`, you must also provide
`segmentCount`.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 15.

Required: No

**[vectorBucketName](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the vector bucket.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 63.

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-type: application/json

{
   "nextToken": "string",
   "vectors": [
      {
         "data": { ... },
         "key": "string",
         "metadata": JSON value
      }
   ]
}
```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The following data is returned in JSON format by the service.

**[nextToken](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_ResponseSyntax)**

Pagination token to be used in the subsequent request. The field is empty if no further
pagination is required.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.

**[vectors](#API_S3VectorBuckets_ListVectors_ResponseSyntax)**

Vectors in the current segment.

Type: Array of [ListOutputVector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_S3VectorBuckets_ListOutputVector.html) objects

## Errors

**AccessDeniedException**

Access denied.

HTTP Status Code: 403

**InternalServerException**

The request failed due to an internal server error.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**NotFoundException**

The request was rejected because the specified resource can't be found.

HTTP Status Code: 404

**RequestTimeoutException**

The request timed out. Retry your request.

HTTP Status Code: 408

**ServiceUnavailableException**

The service is unavailable. Wait briefly and retry your request. If it continues to
fail, increase your waiting time between retries.

HTTP Status Code: 503

**TooManyRequestsException**

The request was denied due to request throttling.

HTTP Status Code: 429

**ValidationException**

The requested action isn't valid.

**fieldList**

A list of specific validation failures that are encountered during input processing. Each entry
in the list contains a path to the field that failed validation and a detailed message that
explains why the validation failed. To satisfy multiple constraints, a field can appear multiple times in this list if it
failed. You can use the information to identify and fix
the specific validation issues in your request.

HTTP Status Code: 400
