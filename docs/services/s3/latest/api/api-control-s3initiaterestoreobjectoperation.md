# S3InitiateRestoreObjectOperation

Contains the configuration parameters for
a
POST Object restore job. S3 Batch Operations passes every object to the
underlying
`RestoreObject`
API
operation. For more information about the parameters for this operation,
see [RestoreObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPOSTrestore.html#RESTObjectPOSTrestore-restore-request).

## Contents

**ExpirationInDays**

This argument specifies how long the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive object remains
available in Amazon S3. S3 Initiate Restore Object jobs that target S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive
objects require `ExpirationInDays` set to 1 or greater.

Conversely, do _not_ set `ExpirationInDays` when creating
S3 Initiate Restore Object jobs that target S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and
Deep Archive Access tier objects. Objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering archive access tiers are
not subject to restore expiry, so specifying `ExpirationInDays` results in
restore request failure.

S3 Batch Operations jobs can operate either on S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class
objects or on S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access storage tier
objects, but not both types in the same job. If you need to restore objects of both types
you _must_ create separate Batch Operations jobs.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 1.

Required: No

**GlacierJobTier**

S3 Batch Operations supports `STANDARD` and `BULK` retrieval tiers, but
not the `EXPEDITED` retrieval tier.

Type: String

Valid Values: `BULK | STANDARD`

Required: No
