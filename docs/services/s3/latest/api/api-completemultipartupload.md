# CompleteMultipartUpload

Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the [UploadPart](api-uploadpart.md) operation or the
[UploadPartCopy](api-uploadpartcopy.md)
operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this
`CompleteMultipartUpload` operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request,
Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the
CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list is
complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list.
For each part in the list, you must provide the `PartNumber` value and the `ETag`
value that are returned after that part was uploaded.

The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to finalize. After
Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a `200
        OK` response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to
keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial `200 OK` response
has been sent. This means that a `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an error.
The error response might be embedded in the `200 OK` response. If you call this API operation
directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it
appropriately. If you use AWS SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and
apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as
appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use
exceptions, they return an error).

Note that if `CompleteMultipartUpload` fails, applications should be prepared to retry
any failed requests (including 500 error responses). For more information, see [Amazon S3 Error Best\
Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html).

###### Important

You can't use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for the
CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if you don't provide a `Content-Type` header,
`CompleteMultipartUpload` can still return a `200 OK` response.

For more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
         `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- For information
about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you provide an [additional checksum value](api-checksum.md) in your `MultipartUpload` requests and the
object is encrypted with AWS Key Management Service, you must have permission to use the
`kms:Decrypt` action for the `CompleteMultipartUpload` request to
succeed.

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use.
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md).

If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
`kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt` permissions in IAM
identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS key.

Special errors

- Error Code: `EntityTooSmall`

- Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed object size.
Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part.

- HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request

- Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be found. The part might not
have been uploaded, or the specified ETag might not have matched the uploaded part's
ETag.

- HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request

- Error Code: `InvalidPartOrder`

- Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The parts list must be
specified in order by part number.

- HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request

- Error Code: `NoSuchUpload`

- Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be
invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `
                  Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

The following operations are related to `CompleteMultipartUpload`:

- [CreateMultipartUpload](api-createmultipartupload.md)

- [UploadPart](api-uploadpart.md)

- [AbortMultipartUpload](api-abortmultipartupload.md)

- [ListParts](api-listparts.md)

- [ListMultipartUploads](api-listmultipartuploads.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `
                     Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming\
rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Required: Yes

**[If-Match](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

Uploads the object only if the ETag (entity tag) value provided during the WRITE operation matches
the ETag of the object in S3. If the ETag values do not match, the operation returns a `412
        Precondition Failed` error.

If a conflicting operation occurs during the upload S3 returns a `409
        ConditionalRequestConflict` response. On a 409 failure you should fetch the object's ETag,
re-initiate the multipart upload with `CreateMultipartUpload`, and re-upload each
part.

Expects the ETag value as a string.

For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232), or [Conditional requests](../userguide/conditional-requests.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[If-None-Match](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

Uploads the object only if the object key name does not already exist in the bucket specified.
Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error.

If a conflicting operation occurs during the upload S3 returns a `409
        ConditionalRequestConflict` response. On a 409 failure you should re-initiate the multipart
upload with `CreateMultipartUpload` and re-upload each part.

Expects the '\*' (asterisk) character.

For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232), or [Conditional requests](../userguide/conditional-requests.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-crc32](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32` checksum of the object. For more information, see
[Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-crc32c](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32C` checksum of the object. For more information, see
[Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-crc64nvme](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data
that was originally sent. This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 64-bit `CRC64NVME`
checksum of the object. The `CRC64NVME` checksum is always a full object checksum. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3\
User Guide](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md).

**[x-amz-checksum-sha1](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 160-bit `SHA1` digest of the object. For more information, see
[Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-sha256](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the data received is the same data that was originally sent.
This header specifies the Base64 encoded, 256-bit `SHA256` digest of the object. For more information, see
[Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[x-amz-checksum-type](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

This header specifies the checksum type of the object, which determines how part-level checksums are
combined to create an object-level checksum for multipart objects. You can use this header as a data
integrity check to verify that the checksum type that is received is the same checksum that was
specified. If the checksum type doesn’t match the checksum type that was specified for the object during
the `CreateMultipartUpload` request, it’ll result in a `BadDigest` error. For more
information, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Valid Values: `COMPOSITE | FULL_OBJECT`

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_CompleteMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**
