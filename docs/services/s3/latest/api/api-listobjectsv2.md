# ListObjectsV2

Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket with each request. You can use the
request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a bucket. A `200
        OK` response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the
contents of the response and handle it appropriately. For more information about listing objects, see
[Listing object\
keys programmatically](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ListingKeysUsingAPIs.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_. To get a list of your
buckets, see [ListBuckets](api-listbuckets.md).

###### Note

- **General purpose bucket** \- For general purpose buckets,
`ListObjectsV2` doesn't return prefixes that are related only to in-progress
multipart uploads.

- **Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets,
`ListObjectsV2` response includes the prefixes that are related only to in-progress
multipart uploads.

- **Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
                 `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- To use this
operation, you must have READ access to the bucket. You must have permission to perform the
`s3:ListBucket` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can
grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access\
Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use.
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md).

Sorting order of returned objects

- **General purpose bucket** \- For general purpose buckets,
`ListObjectsV2` returns objects in lexicographical order based on their key
names.

- **Directory bucket** \- For directory buckets,
`ListObjectsV2` does not return objects in lexicographical order.

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `
                  Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

###### Important

This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recommend that you use this revised
API operation for application development. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the
prior version of this API operation, [ListObjects](api-listobjects.md).

The following operations are related to `ListObjectsV2`:

- [GetObject](api-getobject.md)

- [PutObject](api-putobject.md)

- [CreateBucket](api-createbucket.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /?list-type=2&continuation-token=ContinuationToken&delimiter=Delimiter&encoding-type=EncodingType&fetch-owner=FetchOwner&max-keys=MaxKeys&prefix=Prefix&start-after=StartAfter HTTP/1.1

x-amz-optional-object-attributes: OptionalObjectAttributes

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `
                     Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming\
rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Required: Yes

**[continuation-token](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

`ContinuationToken` indicates to Amazon S3 that the list is being continued on this bucket
with a token. `ContinuationToken` is obfuscated and is not a real key. You can use this
`ContinuationToken` for pagination of the list results.

**[delimiter](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

A delimiter is a character that you use to group keys.

`CommonPrefixes` is filtered out from results if it is not lexicographically greater than
the `StartAfter` value.

###### Note

- **Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, `/` is the only supported delimiter.

- **Directory buckets** \- When you query
`ListObjectsV2` with a delimiter during in-progress multipart uploads, the
`CommonPrefixes` response parameter contains the prefixes that are associated with
the in-progress multipart uploads. For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload\
Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**[encoding-type](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the [object keys](../userguide/object-keys.md) in the response. Responses are
encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser
can't parse certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that
aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the
response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see [Object key\
naming guidelines](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-guidelines).

###### Note

When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will
be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object
`test_file(3).png` will appear as `test_file%283%29.png`.

Valid Values: `url`

**[fetch-owner](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

The owner field is not present in `ListObjectsV2` by default. If you want to return the
owner field with each key in the result, then set the `FetchOwner` field to
`true`.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, the bucket
owner is returned as the object owner for all objects.

**[max-keys](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000
key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.

**[prefix](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, only prefixes that end in a delimiter ( `/`) are supported.

**[start-after](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

StartAfter is where you want Amazon S3 to start listing from. Amazon S3 starts listing after this specified
key. StartAfter can be any key in the bucket.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-optional-object-attributes](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the optional fields that you want returned in the response. Fields that you do not specify
are not returned.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `RestoreStatus`

**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_ListObjectsV2_RequestSyntax)**

Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the list objects request in V2
style. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response.

The response returns the following HTTP headers.

**[x-amz-request-charged](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request. For more
information, see [Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](../userguide/requesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon Simple_
_Storage Service user guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

The following data is returned in XML format by the service.

**[ListBucketResult](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

Root level tag for the ListBucketResult parameters.

Required: Yes

**[CommonPrefixes](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

All of the keys (up to 1,000) that share the same prefix are grouped together. When counting the
total numbers of returns by this API operation, this group of keys is considered as one item.

A response can contain `CommonPrefixes` only if you specify a delimiter.

`CommonPrefixes` contains all (if there are any) keys between `Prefix` and the
next occurrence of the string specified by a delimiter.

`CommonPrefixes` lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by
`Prefix`.

For example, if the prefix is `notes/` and the delimiter is a slash ( `/`) as
in `notes/summer/july`, the common prefix is `notes/summer/`. All of the keys that
roll up into a common prefix count as a single return when calculating the number of returns.

###### Note

- **Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, only prefixes that end in a delimiter ( `/`) are supported.

- **Directory buckets** \- When you query
`ListObjectsV2` with a delimiter during in-progress multipart uploads, the
`CommonPrefixes` response parameter contains the prefixes that are associated with
the in-progress multipart uploads. For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload\
Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: Array of [CommonPrefix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CommonPrefix.html) data types

**[Contents](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

Metadata about each object returned.

Type: Array of [Object](api-object.md) data types

**[ContinuationToken](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

If `ContinuationToken` was sent with the request, it is included in the response. You
can use the returned `ContinuationToken` for pagination of the list response.

Type: String

**[Delimiter](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

Causes keys that contain the same string between the `prefix` and the first occurrence of
the delimiter to be rolled up into a single result element in the `CommonPrefixes`
collection. These rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the response. Each rolled-up result
counts as only one return against the `MaxKeys` value.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, `/` is the only supported delimiter.

Type: String

**[EncodingType](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode object key names in the XML response.

If you specify the `encoding-type` request parameter, Amazon S3 includes this element in the
response, and returns encoded key name values in the following response elements:

`Delimiter, Prefix, Key,` and `StartAfter`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `url`

**[IsTruncated](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

Set to `false` if all of the results were returned. Set to `true` if more keys
are available to return. If the number of results exceeds that specified by `MaxKeys`, all of
the results might not be returned.

Type: Boolean

**[KeyCount](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

`KeyCount` is the number of keys returned with this request. `KeyCount` will
always be less than or equal to the `MaxKeys` field. For example, if you ask for 50 keys,
your result will include 50 keys or fewer.

Type: Integer

**[MaxKeys](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000
key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.

Type: Integer

**[Name](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

The bucket name.

Type: String

**[NextContinuationToken](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

`NextContinuationToken` is sent when `isTruncated` is true, which means there
are more keys in the bucket that can be listed. The next list requests to Amazon S3 can be continued with
this `NextContinuationToken`. `NextContinuationToken` is obfuscated and is not a
real key

Type: String

**[Prefix](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, only prefixes that end in a delimiter ( `/`) are supported.

Type: String

**[StartAfter](#API_ListObjectsV2_ResponseSyntax)**

If StartAfter was sent with the request, it is included in the response.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Type: String

## Errors

**NoSuchBucket**

The specified bucket does not exist.

HTTP Status Code: 404

## Examples

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets: Listing keys by using the prefix and delimiter parameters

This example illustrates the use of the `prefix` and the `delimiter`
parameters in the request. For this example, we assume that you have the
following keys in your bucket:

- `sample.jpg`

- `photos/2006/January/sample.jpg`

- `photos/2006/February/sample2.jpg`

- `photos/2006/February/sample3.jpg`

- `photos/2006/February/sample4.jpg`

The following `GET` request specifies the `delimiter` parameter with a
value of `/`.

```

GET /?list-type=2&delimiter=/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
x-amz-date: 20160430T235931Z
Authorization: authorization string

```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets

The key `sample.jpg` does not contain the delimiter character, and Amazon S3 returns it in
the `Contents` element in the response. However, all of the other keys contain the
delimiter character. Amazon S3 groups these keys and returns a single `CommonPrefixes` element
with the `Prefix` value `photos/`. The `Prefix` element is a
substring that starts at the beginning of these keys and ends at the first occurrence of the
specified delimiter.

```

<ListBucketResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Name>example-bucket</Name>

  </Contents>
  <CommonPrefixes>
    <Prefix>photos/</Prefix>
  </CommonPrefixes>
</ListBucketResult>

```

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets

The following request specifies the `delimiter` parameter with the value
`/`, and the `prefix` parameter with the value
`photos/2006/`.

```

GET /?list-type=2&prefix=photos/2006/&delimiter=/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
x-amz-date: 20160501T000433Z
Authorization: authorization string

```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets

In response, Amazon S3 returns only the keys that start with the specified prefix. Further, Amazon S3 uses
the delimiter character to group keys that contain the same substring until the first occurrence of
the delimiter character after the specified prefix. For each such key group, Amazon S3 returns one
`CommonPrefixes` element in the response. The keys grouped under this
`CommonPrefixes` element are not returned elsewhere in the response. The
`Prefix` value returned in the `CommonPrefixes` element is a substring that
starts at the beginning of the key and ends at the first occurrence of the specified delimiter after
the prefix.

###### Note

If you created folders by using the Amazon S3 console, you will see an additional 0-byte object
with a key of `photos/2006/`. This object is created because of the way that the
console supports folder structures. For more information, see [Organizing objects in the Amazon S3 console using\
folders](../userguide/using-folders.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

```

```

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets: Using a continuation token

In this example, the initial request returns more than 1,000 keys. In response to this request,
Amazon S3 returns the `IsTruncated` element with the value set to `true` and with a
`NextContinuationToken` element.

```
