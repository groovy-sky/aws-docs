# ReplicationRuleAndOperator

A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the subset of objects to which the
rule applies. This element is required only if you specify more than one filter.

For example:

- If you specify both a `Prefix` and a `Tag` filter, wrap these filters in
an `And` tag.

- If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the `Tag` elements in an
`And` tag.

## Contents

**Prefix**

An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.

Type: String

Required: No

**Tags**

An array of tags containing key and value pairs.

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) data types

Required: No
