# Making requests using the REST API

This section contains information on how to make requests to Amazon S3 endpoints by using the
REST API. For a list of Amazon S3 endpoints, see
[Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html) in the
_AWS General Reference_.

## Constructing S3 hostnames for REST API requests

Amazon S3 endpoints follow the structure shown below:

```nohighlight

s3.Region.amazonaws.com
```

Amazon S3 access points endpoints and dual-stack endpoints also follow the
standard structure:

- **Amazon S3 access points**
‐ `s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com`

- **Dual-stack** ‐
`s3.dualstack.Region.amazonaws.com`

For a complete list of Amazon S3 Regions and endpoints, see [Amazon S3 endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html) in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

## Virtual hosted‐style and path‐style requests

When making requests by using the REST API, you can use virtual hosted–style or
path-style URIs for the Amazon S3 endpoints. For more information, see [Path-style requests](../userguide/virtualhosting.md#path-style-access).

###### Example Virtual hosted–Style request

Following is an example of a virtual hosted–style request to delete the
`puppy.jpg` file from the bucket named
`examplebucket` in the US West (Oregon) Region. For more information about
virtual hosted-style requests, see [Path-style requests](../userguide/virtualhosting.md#virtual-hosted-style-access).

```nohighlight

DELETE /puppy.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: examplebucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
x-amz-date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
Authorization: authorization string
```

###### Example Path-style request

Following is an example of a path-style version of the same request.

```nohighlight

DELETE /examplebucket/puppy.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
x-amz-date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
Authorization: authorization string

```

You will receive an HTTP response code 307 Temporary Redirect error
and a message indicating what the correct URI is for your resource if you try
to access a bucket outside the US East (N. Virginia) region with path-style syntax that uses either of the following:

For more information about path-style requests, see [Path-style requests](../userguide/virtualhosting.md#path-style-access).

###### Important

Update (September 23, 2020) – To make sure that customers have the time that they need to transition to virtual-hosted–style URLs,
we have decided to delay the deprecation of path-style URLs. For more information,
see [Amazon S3 Path Deprecation Plan – The Rest of the Story](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story) in the _AWS News Blog_.

## Making requests to dual-stack endpoints by using the REST API

When using the REST API, you can directly access a dual-stack endpoint by using a virtual
hosted–style or a path style endpoint name (URI). All Amazon S3 dual-stack endpoint
names include the region in the name. Unlike the standard IPv4-only endpoints, both
virtual hosted–style and a path-style endpoints use region-specific endpoint
names.

###### Example Virtual hosted–Style dual-stack endpoint request

You can use a virtual hosted–style endpoint in your REST request as shown in the
following example that retrieves the `puppy.jpg` object from
the bucket named `examplebucket` in the US West (Oregon)
Region.

```nohighlight

GET /puppy.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: examplebucket.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
x-amz-date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
Authorization: authorization string
```

###### Example Path-style dual-stack endpoint request

Or you can use a path-style endpoint in your request as shown in the following
example.

```nohighlight

GET /examplebucket/puppy.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
x-amz-date: Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:00:00 GMT
Authorization: authorization string
```
