# EncryptionConfiguration

The encryption configuration for a vector bucket or index. By default, if you don't specify, all
new vectors in Amazon S3 vector buckets use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
keys (SSE-S3), specifically `AES256`. You can optionally override bucket level encryption settings, and set a specific encryption configuration for a vector index at the time of index creation.

## Contents

**kmsKeyArn**

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) customer managed key ID to use for the encryption
configuration. This parameter is allowed if and only if `sseType` is set to
`aws:kms`.

To specify the KMS key, you must use the format of the KMS key
Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

For example, specify Key ARN in the following format:
`arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.

Pattern: `(arn:aws[-a-z0-9]*:kms:[-a-z0-9]*:[0-9]{12}:key/.+)`

Required: No

**sseType**

The server-side encryption type to use for the encryption configuration of the vector
bucket. By default, if you don't specify, all new vectors in Amazon S3 vector buckets use
server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), specifically
`AES256`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `AES256 | aws:kms`

Required: No
