# MetricsConfiguration

Specifies a metrics configuration for the CloudWatch request metrics (specified by the metrics
configuration ID) from an Amazon S3 bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configuration, note that
this is a full replacement of the existing metrics configuration. If you don't include the elements you
want to keep, they are erased. For more information, see [PutBucketMetricsConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTMetricConfiguration.html).
