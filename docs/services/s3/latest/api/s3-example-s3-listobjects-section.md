# Use `ListObjects` with a CLI

The following code examples show how to use `ListObjects`.

Action examples are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. You can see this action in
context in the following code example:

- [Create a web page that lists Amazon S3 objects](s3-example-s3-scenario-listobjectsweb-section.md)

CLI

**AWS CLI**

The following example uses the `list-objects` command to display the names of all the objects in the specified bucket:

```nohighlight

aws s3api list-objects --bucket text-content --query 'Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}'

```

The example uses the `--query` argument to filter the output of
`list-objects` down to the key value and size for each object

For more information about objects, see Working with Amazon S3 Objects in the _Amazon S3 Developer Guide_.
