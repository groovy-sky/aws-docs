# CreateBucketConfiguration

The configuration information for the bucket.

## Contents

**Bucket**

Specifies the information about the bucket that will be created.

###### Note

This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.

Type: [BucketInfo](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_BucketInfo.html) data type

Required: No

**Location**

Specifies the location where the bucket will be created.

**Directory buckets** \- The location type is Availability Zone or Local Zone. To
use the Local Zone location type, your account must be enabled
for Local Zones. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `403 Forbidden` error with the error code
`AccessDenied`. To learn more,
see [Enable\
accounts for Local Zones](../userguide/opt-in-directory-bucket-lz.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.

Type: [LocationInfo](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_LocationInfo.html) data type

Required: No

**LocationConstraint**

Specifies the Region where the bucket will be created. You might choose a Region to optimize
latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you
will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region.

If you don't specify a Region, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1)
by default. Configurations using the value `EU` will create a bucket in
`eu-west-1`.

For a list of the valid values for all of the AWS Regions, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region).

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Type: String

Valid Values: `af-south-1 | ap-east-1 | ap-northeast-1 | ap-northeast-2 | ap-northeast-3 | ap-south-1 | ap-south-2 | ap-southeast-1 | ap-southeast-2 | ap-southeast-3 | ap-southeast-4 | ap-southeast-5 | ca-central-1 | cn-north-1 | cn-northwest-1 | EU | eu-central-1 | eu-central-2 | eu-north-1 | eu-south-1 | eu-south-2 | eu-west-1 | eu-west-2 | eu-west-3 | il-central-1 | me-central-1 | me-south-1 | sa-east-1 | us-east-2 | us-gov-east-1 | us-gov-west-1 | us-west-1 | us-west-2`

Required: No

**Tags**

An array of tags that you can apply to the bucket that you're creating. Tags are key-value pairs of metadata used to categorize and organize your buckets, track costs, and control access.

You must have the `s3:TagResource` permission to create a general
purpose bucket with tags or the `s3express:TagResource` permission to create a directory bucket with tags.

When creating buckets with tags, note that tag-based conditions using `aws:ResourceTag` and `s3:BucketTag` condition keys are applicable only after ABAC is enabled on the bucket. To learn more, see [Enabling ABAC in general purpose buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/buckets-tagging-enable-abac.html).

Type: Array of [Tag](api-tag.md) data types

Required: No
