# Use `DeleteBucketPolicy` with an AWS SDK or CLI

The following code examples show how to use `DeleteBucketPolicy`.

C++

**SDK for C++**

###### Note

There's more on GitHub. Find the complete example and learn how to set up and run in the
[AWS Code\
Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/cpp/example_code/s3).

```cpp

bool AwsDoc::S3::deleteBucketPolicy(const Aws::String &bucketName,
                                    const Aws::S3::S3ClientConfiguration &clientConfig) {
    Aws::S3::S3Client client(clientConfig);

    Aws::S3::Model::DeleteBucketPolicyRequest request;
    request.SetBucket(bucketName);

    Aws::S3::Model::DeleteBucketPolicyOutcome outcome = client.DeleteBucketPolicy(request);

    if (!outcome.IsSuccess()) {
        const Aws::S3::S3Error &err = outcome.GetError();
        std::cerr << "Error: deleteBucketPolicy: " <<
                  err.GetExceptionName() << ": " << err.GetMessage() << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Policy was deleted from the bucket." << std::endl;
