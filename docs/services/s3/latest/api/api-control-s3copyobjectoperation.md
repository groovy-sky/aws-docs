# S3CopyObjectOperation

Contains
the configuration parameters for a PUT Copy object operation. S3 Batch Operations passes every
object to the underlying
`CopyObject`
API
operation. For more information about the parameters for this operation,
see [CopyObject](restobjectcopy.md).

## Contents

**AccessControlGrants**

###### Note

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: Array of [S3Grant](api-control-s3grant.md) data types

Required: No

**BucketKeyEnabled**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with
server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to `true`
causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

Specifying this header with an _Copy_ action doesn’t affect
_bucket-level_ settings for S3 Bucket Key.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [the Copy operation in Batch Operations](../userguide/directory-buckets-objects-batch-ops.md). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**CannedAccessControlList**

###### Note

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: String

Valid Values: `private | public-read | public-read-write | aws-exec-read | authenticated-read | bucket-owner-read | bucket-owner-full-control`

Required: No

**ChecksumAlgorithm**

Indicates the algorithm
that
you want Amazon S3 to use to create the checksum. For more
information,
see [Checking object\
integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`

Required: No

**MetadataDirective**

Type: String

Valid Values: `COPY | REPLACE`

Required: No

**ModifiedSinceConstraint**

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**NewObjectMetadata**

If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon S3 copies all the metadata from the original
objects. If you specify an empty set, the new objects will have no tags. Otherwise, Amazon S3
assigns the supplied tags to the new objects.

Type: [S3ObjectMetadata](api-control-s3objectmetadata.md) data type

Required: No

**NewObjectTagging**

Specifies a list of tags to add to the destination objects after they are copied.
If `NewObjectTagging` is not specified, the tags of the source objects are copied to destination objects by default.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- Tags aren't supported by directory buckets.
If your source objects have tags and your destination bucket is a directory bucket, specify an empty tag set in the `NewObjectTagging` field
to prevent copying the source object tags to the directory bucket.

Type: Array of [S3Tag](api-control-s3tag.md) data types

Required: No

**ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus**

The legal hold status to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: String

Valid Values: `OFF | ON`

Required: No

**ObjectLockMode**

The retention mode to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations job.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: String

Valid Values: `COMPLIANCE | GOVERNANCE`

Required: No

**ObjectLockRetainUntilDate**

The date when the applied object retention configuration expires on all objects in the
Batch Operations job.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: Timestamp

Required: No

**RedirectLocation**

If the destination bucket is configured as a website, specifies an optional metadata property for website redirects,
`x-amz-website-redirect-location`. Allows webpage redirects if the object copy is
accessed through a website endpoint.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.

Required: No

**RequesterPays**

###### Note

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**SSEAwsKmsKeyId**

Specifies the AWS KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same
account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- If you specify `SSEAlgorithm` with `KMS`, you must specify the `
         SSEAwsKmsKeyId` parameter with the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the AWS KMS
symmetric encryption customer managed key to use. Otherwise, you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported. To encrypt new object copies in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk)).
The [AWS managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#aws-managed-cmk) ( `aws/s3`) isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk) per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.
After you specify a customer managed key for SSE-KMS as the bucket default encryption, you can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.
Then, when you specify server-side encryption settings for new object copies with SSE-KMS, you must make sure the encryption key is the same customer managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default encryption configuration.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2000.

Required: No

**StorageClass**

Specify the storage class for the destination objects in a `Copy` operation.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.

Type: String

Valid Values: `STANDARD | STANDARD_IA | ONEZONE_IA | GLACIER | INTELLIGENT_TIERING | DEEP_ARCHIVE | GLACIER_IR`

Required: No

**TargetKeyPrefix**

Specifies the folder prefix
that
you
want
the objects to be
copied
into. For example, to copy objects into a folder named
`Folder1` in the destination bucket, set the
`TargetKeyPrefix`
property
to `Folder1`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.

Required: No

**TargetResource**

Specifies the destination bucket
Amazon Resource Name
(ARN)
for the batch copy operation.

- **General purpose buckets** \- For example, to copy objects to a general purpose bucket named
`destinationBucket`, set the `TargetResource` property to
`arn:aws:s3:::destinationBucket`.

- **Directory buckets** \- For example, to copy objects to a directory bucket named
`destinationBucket` in the Availability Zone identified by the AZ ID `usw2-az1`, set the `TargetResource` property to
`arn:aws:s3express:region:account_id:/bucket/destination_bucket_base_name--usw2-az1--x-s3`. A directory bucket as a destination bucket can be in Availability Zone or Local Zone.

###### Note

Copying objects across different AWS Regions isn't supported when the source or destination bucket is in AWS Local Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the same parent AWS Region. Otherwise,
you get an HTTP `400 Bad Request` error with the error code `InvalidRequest`.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.

Pattern: `arn:[^:]+:(s3|s3express):.*`

Required: No

**UnModifiedSinceConstraint**

Type: Timestamp

Required: No
