# Appendix: OPTIONS object

## Description

A browser can send this preflight request to Amazon S3 to determine if it can send an actual
request with the specific origin, HTTP method, and headers.

Amazon S3 supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) by enabling you to add a
`cors` subresource on a bucket. When a browser sends this preflight
request, Amazon S3 responds by evaluating the rules that are defined in the
`cors` configuration.

If `cors` is not enabled on the bucket, then Amazon S3 returns a `403
				Forbidden` response.

For more information about CORS, go to [Enabling\
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

## Responses

### Response Headers

HeaderDescription`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

The origin you sent in your request. If the origin in your request is not allowed,

`Access-Control-Max-Age`

How long, in seconds, the results of the preflight request can be cached.

Type: String

## Examples

### Example : Send a preflight OPTIONS request to a `cors` enabled bucket

actual PUT request from http://www.example.com origin to the Amazon S3 bucket named
`examplebucket`.
