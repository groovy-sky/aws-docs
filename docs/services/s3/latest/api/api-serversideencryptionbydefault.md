# ServerSideEncryptionByDefault

Describes the default server-side encryption to apply to new objects in the bucket. If a PUT Object
request doesn't specify any server-side encryption, this default encryption will be applied. For more
information, see [PutBucketEncryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTencryption.html).

###### Note

- **General purpose buckets** \- If you don't specify a customer managed key
at configuration, Amazon S3 automatically creates an AWS KMS key ( `aws/s3`) in your AWS
account the first time that you add an object encrypted with SSE-KMS to a bucket. By default, Amazon S3
uses this KMS key for SSE-KMS.

- **Directory buckets** -
Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket's lifetime.
The [AWS managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) ( `aws/s3`) isn't supported.

- **Directory buckets** -
For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS.

## Contents

**SSEAlgorithm**

Server-side encryption algorithm to use for the default encryption.

###### Note

For directory buckets, there are only two supported values for server-side encryption: `AES256` and `aws:kms`.

Type: String

Valid Values: `AES256 | aws:fsx | aws:kms | aws:kms:dsse`

Required: Yes

**KMSMasterKeyID**

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) customer managed key ID to use for the default encryption.

###### Note

- **General purpose buckets** \- This parameter is allowed if and
only if `SSEAlgorithm` is set to `aws:kms` or
`aws:kms:dsse`.

- **Directory buckets** \- This parameter is allowed if and
only if `SSEAlgorithm` is set to `aws:kms`.

You can specify the key ID, key alias, or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key.

- Key ID: `1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key ARN:
`arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab`

- Key Alias: `alias/alias-name`

If you are using encryption with cross-account or AWS service operations, you must use a fully
qualified KMS key ARN. For more information, see [Using\
encryption for cross-account operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html#bucket-encryption-update-bucket-policy).

###### Note

- **General purpose buckets** \- If you're specifying a customer
managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key
alias instead, then AWS KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior can
result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket
owner. Also, if you use a key ID, you can run into a LogDestination undeliverable error when
creating a VPC flow log.

- **Directory buckets** -
When you specify an [AWS KMS customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.

###### Important

Amazon S3 only supports symmetric encryption KMS keys. For more information, see [Asymmetric keys in\
AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No
