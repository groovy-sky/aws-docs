# LifecycleRule

A lifecycle rule for individual objects in an Amazon S3 bucket.

For more information see, [Managing your storage lifecycle](../userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

## Contents

**Status**

If 'Enabled', the rule is currently being applied. If 'Disabled', the rule is not currently being
applied.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Enabled | Disabled`

Required: Yes

**AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload**

Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete multipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait before
permanently removing all parts of the upload. For more information, see [Aborting\
Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: [AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload.html) data type

Required: No

**Expiration**

Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the object in the form of date, days and, whether the
object has a delete marker.

Type: [LifecycleExpiration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_LifecycleExpiration.html) data type

Required: No

**Filter**

The `Filter` is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle Rule applies to. A
`Filter` must have exactly one of `Prefix`, `Tag`,
`ObjectSizeGreaterThan`, `ObjectSizeLessThan`, or `And` specified.
`Filter` is required if the `LifecycleRule` does not contain a
`Prefix` element.

For more information about `Tag` filters, see [Adding filters to Lifecycle rules](../userguide/intro-lifecycle-filters.md)
in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

`Tag` filters are not supported for directory buckets.

Type: [LifecycleRuleFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_LifecycleRuleFilter.html) data type

Required: No

**ID**

Unique identifier for the rule. The value cannot be longer than 255 characters.

Type: String

Required: No

**NoncurrentVersionExpiration**

Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the
noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning
enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in
the object's lifetime.

###### Note

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket
lifecycle configurations.

Type: [NoncurrentVersionExpiration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_NoncurrentVersionExpiration.html) data type

Required: No

**NoncurrentVersionTransitions**

Specifies the transition rule for the lifecycle rule that describes when noncurrent objects
transition to a specific storage class. If your bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is
suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3 transition noncurrent object versions to a
specific storage class at a set period in the object's lifetime.

###### Note

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket
lifecycle configurations.

Type: Array of [NoncurrentVersionTransition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_NoncurrentVersionTransition.html) data types

Required: No

**Prefix**

_This member has been deprecated._

The general purpose bucket prefix that identifies one or more objects to which the rule applies. We recommend using `Filter` instead of `Prefix` for new PUTs. Previous configurations where a prefix is defined will continue to operate as before.

###### Important

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using
XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

Type: String

Required: No

**Transitions**

Specifies when an Amazon S3 object transitions to a specified storage class.

###### Note

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket
lifecycle configurations.

Type: Array of [Transition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Transition.html) data types

Required: No
