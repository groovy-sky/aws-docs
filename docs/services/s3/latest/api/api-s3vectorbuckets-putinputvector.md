# PutInputVector

The attributes of a vector to add to a vector index.

## Contents

**data**

The vector data of the vector.

Vector dimensions must match the dimension count that's configured for the vector
index.

- For the `cosine` distance metric, zero vectors (vectors containing all
zeros) aren't allowed.

- For both `cosine` and `euclidean` distance metrics, vector
data must contain only valid floating-point values. Invalid values such as NaN (Not a
Number) or Infinity aren't allowed.

Type: [VectorData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_S3VectorBuckets_VectorData.html) object

**Note:** This object is a Union. Only one member of this object can be specified or returned.

Required: Yes

**key**

The name of the vector. The key uniquely identifies the vector in a vector index.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.
