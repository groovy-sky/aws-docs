**AccessKeyId**

A unique identifier that's associated with a secret access key. The access key ID and the secret
access key are used together to sign programmatic AWS requests cryptographically.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**Expiration**

Temporary security credentials expire after a specified interval. After temporary credentials
expire, any calls that you make with those credentials will fail. So you must generate a new set of
temporary credentials. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original
specified interval.

Type: Timestamp

Required: Yes

**SecretAccessKey**

A key that's used with the access key ID to cryptographically sign programmatic AWS requests.
Signing a request identifies the sender and prevents the request from being altered.

security credentials.
