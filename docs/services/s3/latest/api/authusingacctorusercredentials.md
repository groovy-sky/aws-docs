# Making requests using AWS account or IAM user credentials

You can use your AWS account or IAM user security credentials to send authenticated
requests to Amazon S3. This section provides examples of how you can send authenticated requests
using the AWS SDK for Java, AWS SDK for .NET, and AWS SDK for PHP. For a list of available AWS SDKs, go to [Sample Code and Libraries](https://aws.amazon.com/code).

Each of these AWS SDKs uses an SDK-specific credentials provider chain to find and use
credentials and perform actions on behalf of the credentials owner. What all these credentials
provider chains have in common is that they all look for your local AWS credentials file.

For more information, see the topics below:

## To create a local AWS credentials file

The easiest way to configure credentials for your AWS SDKs is to use an AWS credentials
file. If you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you may already have a local AWS credentials file
configured. Otherwise, use the following procedure to set up a credentials file:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Create a new user with permissions limited to the services and actions that you want
    your code to have access to. For more information about creating a new user, see [Creating IAM users\
    (Console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console), and follow the instructions through step 8.

3. Choose **Download .csv** to save a local copy of your AWS
    credentials.

4. On your computer, navigate to your home directory, and create an
    `.aws` directory. On Unix-based systems, such as Linux or OS X, this is
    in the following location:

```

~/.aws
```

On Windows, this is in the following location:

```

%HOMEPATH%\.aws
```

5. In the `.aws` directory, create a new file named
    `credentials`.

6. Open the credentials `.csv` file that you downloaded from the IAM
    console, and copy its contents into the `credentials` file using the
    following format:

```

[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

7. Save the `credentials` file, and delete the `.csv`
    file that you downloaded in step 3.

Your shared credentials file is now configured on your local computer, and it's ready to be
used with the AWS SDKs.

## Sending authenticated requests using the AWS SDKs

Use the AWS SDKs to send authenticated requests. For more information about sending authenticated requests, see [AWS security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html) or [IAM Identity Center Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-sso.html).

Java

For information about authenticating requests using the AWS SDK for Java, see [Using shared config and credentials files to globally configure AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html) and [Authentication and access using AWS SDKs and tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access.html) in the AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide.

.NET

To send authenticated requests using your AWS account or IAM user credentials:

- Create an instance of the `AmazonS3Client` class.

- Run one of the `AmazonS3Client` methods to send requests to Amazon S3. The
client generates the necessary signature from the credentials that you provide and
includes it in the request it sends to Amazon S3.

For more information, see [Making requests using AWS account or IAM user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/AuthUsingAcctOrUserCredentials.html) >.

###### Note

- You can create the `AmazonS3Client` client without providing your security
credentials. Requests sent using this client are anonymous requests, without a signature.
Amazon S3 returns an error if you send anonymous requests for a resource that is not publicly
available.

- You can create an AWS account and create the required users. You can also manage credentials
for those users. You need these credentials to perform the task in the following
example. For more information, see [Configure\
AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/net-dg-config-creds.html) in the _SDK for .NET Developer_
_Guide_.

You can then also configure your application to actively retrieve profiles and credentials, and then explicitly
use those credentials when creating an AWS service client. For more information, see
[Accessing credentials and \
profiles in an application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/creds-locate.html) in the _SDK for .NET Developer Guide_.

The following C# example shows how to perform the preceding tasks. For
information about setting up and running the code examples, see [Getting Started\
with the AWS SDK for .NET](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/net-dg-setup.html) in the _AWS SDK for .NET Developer_
_Guide_.

###### Example

```

using Amazon;
using Amazon.S3;
using Amazon.S3.Model;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Amazon.DocSamples.S3
{
    class MakeS3RequestTest
    {
        private const string bucketName = "*** bucket name ***";
        // Specify your bucket region (an example region is shown).
        private static readonly RegionEndpoint bucketRegion = RegionEndpoint.USWest2;
        private static IAmazonS3 client;

        public static void Main()
        {
            using (client = new AmazonS3Client(bucketRegion))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Listing objects stored in a bucket");
                ListingObjectsAsync().Wait();
            }
        }

        static async Task ListingObjectsAsync()
        {
            try
            {
                ListObjectsRequest request = new ListObjectsRequest
                {
                    BucketName = bucketName,
                    MaxKeys = 2
                };
                do
                {
                    ListObjectsResponse response = await client.ListObjectsAsync(request);
                    // Process the response.
                    foreach (S3Object entry in response.S3Objects)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine("key = {0} size = {1}",
                            entry.Key, entry.Size);
                    }

                    // If the response is truncated, set the marker to get the next
                    // set of keys.
                    if (response.IsTruncated)
                    {
                        request.Marker = response.NextMarker;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        request = null;
                    }
                } while (request != null);
            }
            catch (AmazonS3Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error encountered on server. Message:'{0}' when writing an object", e.Message);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Unknown encountered on server. Message:'{0}' when writing an object", e.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}

```

PHP

The following PHP example shows how the client makes a request using your security
credentials to list all of the buckets for your account.

###### Example

```PHP

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\Exception\S3Exception;
use Aws\S3\S3Client;

$bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'region' => 'us-east-1',
    'version' => 'latest',
]);

// Retrieve the list of buckets.
$result = $s3->listBuckets();

try {
    // Retrieve a paginator for listing objects.
    $objects = $s3->getPaginator('ListObjects', [
        'Bucket' => $bucket
    ]);

    echo "Keys retrieved!" . PHP_EOL;

    // Print the list of objects to the page.
    foreach ($objects as $object) {
        echo $object['Key'] . PHP_EOL;
    }
} catch (S3Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}

```

###### Note

You can create the `S3Client` client without providing your security
credentials. Requests sent using this client are anonymous requests, without a signature.
Amazon S3 returns an error if you send anonymous requests for a resource that is not
publicly available. For more information, see [Creating Anonymous Clients](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/guide_credentials_anonymous.html) in the [AWS SDK for PHP\
Documentation](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdk-for-php).

Ruby

Before you can use version 3 of the AWS SDK for Ruby to make calls to Amazon S3, you must set the AWS
access credentials that the SDK uses to verify your access to your buckets and objects. If you
have shared credentials set up in the AWS credentials profile on your local system, version 3 of
the SDK for Ruby can use those credentials without your having to declare them in your code. For more
information about setting up shared credentials, see [Making requests using AWS account or IAM user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/AuthUsingAcctOrUserCredentials.html).

The following Ruby code snippet uses the credentials in a shared AWS credentials file on a
local computer to authenticate a request to get all of the object key names in a specific
bucket. It does the following:

1. Creates an instance of the `Aws::S3::Client` class.

2. Makes a request to Amazon S3 by enumerating objects in a bucket using the `list_objects_v2`
    method of `Aws::S3::Client`. The client generates the necessary signature value
    from the credentials in the AWS credentials file on your computer, and includes it in the
    request it sends to Amazon S3.

3. Prints the array of object key names to the terminal.

###### Example

```ruby

# Prerequisites:
#  - An existing Amazon S3 bucket.

require 'aws-sdk-s3'

# @param s3_client [Aws::S3::Client] An initialized Amazon S3 client.
# @param bucket_name [String] The bucket's name.
# @return [Boolean] true if all operations succeed; otherwise, false.
# @example
#   s3_client = Aws::S3::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2')
#   exit 1 unless list_bucket_objects?(s3_client, 'amzn-s3-demo-bucket')
def list_bucket_objects?(s3_client, bucket_name)
  puts "Accessing the bucket named '#{bucket_name}'..."
  objects = s3_client.list_objects_v2(
    bucket: bucket_name,
    max_keys: 50
  )

  if objects.count.positive?
    puts 'The object keys in this bucket are (first 50 objects):'
    objects.contents.each do |object|
      puts object.key
    end
  else
    puts 'No objects found in this bucket.'
  end

  true
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error while accessing the bucket named '#{bucket_name}': #{e.message}"
  false
end

# Example usage:
def run_me
  region = 'us-west-2'
  bucket_name = 'BUCKET_NAME'
  s3_client = Aws::S3::Client.new(region: region)

  exit 1 unless list_bucket_objects?(s3_client, bucket_name)
end

run_me if $PROGRAM_NAME == __FILE__

```

If you don't have a local AWS credentials file, you can still create the
`Aws::S3::Client` resource and run code against Amazon S3 buckets and objects.
Requests that are sent using version 3 of the SDK for Ruby are anonymous, with no signature by
default. Amazon S3 returns an error if you send anonymous requests for a resource that's not publicly
available.

You can use and expand the previous code snippet for SDK for Ruby applications, as in the
following more robust example.

```ruby

# Prerequisites:
#  - An existing Amazon S3 bucket.

require 'aws-sdk-s3'

# @param s3_client [Aws::S3::Client] An initialized Amazon S3 client.
# @param bucket_name [String] The bucket's name.
# @return [Boolean] true if all operations succeed; otherwise, false.
# @example
#   s3_client = Aws::S3::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2')
#   exit 1 unless list_bucket_objects?(s3_client, 'amzn-s3-demo-bucket')
def list_bucket_objects?(s3_client, bucket_name)
  puts "Accessing the bucket named '#{bucket_name}'..."
  objects = s3_client.list_objects_v2(
    bucket: bucket_name,
    max_keys: 50
  )

  if objects.count.positive?
    puts 'The object keys in this bucket are (first 50 objects):'
    objects.contents.each do |object|
      puts object.key
    end
  else
    puts 'No objects found in this bucket.'
  end

  true
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error while accessing the bucket named '#{bucket_name}': #{e.message}"
  false
end

# Example usage:
def run_me
  region = 'us-west-2'
  bucket_name = 'BUCKET_NAME'
  s3_client = Aws::S3::Client.new(region: region)

  exit 1 unless list_bucket_objects?(s3_client, bucket_name)
end

run_me if $PROGRAM_NAME == __FILE__

```

Go

###### Example

The following example uses AWS credentials automatically loaded by the SDK for Go from the shared credentials file.

```go

package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
	"github.com/aws/smithy-go"
)

// main uses the AWS SDK for Go V2 to create an Amazon Simple Storage Service
// (Amazon S3) client and list up to 10 buckets in your account.
// This example uses the default settings specified in your shared credentials
// and config files.
func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	sdkConfig, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Couldn't load default configuration. Have you set up your AWS account?")
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	s3Client := s3.NewFromConfig(sdkConfig)
	count := 10
	fmt.Printf("Let's list up to %v buckets for your account.\n", count)
	result, err := s3Client.ListBuckets(ctx, &s3.ListBucketsInput{})
	if err != nil {
		var ae smithy.APIError
		if errors.As(err, &ae) && ae.ErrorCode() == "AccessDenied" {
			fmt.Println("You don't have permission to list buckets for this account.")
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("Couldn't list buckets for your account. Here's why: %v\n", err)
		}
		return
	}
	if len(result.Buckets) == 0 {
		fmt.Println("You don't have any buckets!")
	} else {
		if count > len(result.Buckets) {
			count = len(result.Buckets)
		}
		for _, bucket := range result.Buckets[:count] {
			fmt.Printf("\t%v\n", *bucket.Name)
		}
	}
}
