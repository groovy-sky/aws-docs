# PutPublicAccessBlock

###### Note

This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

Creates or modifies the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an
AWS account. This operation may be restricted when the account is managed by
organization-level Block Public Access policies. You might get an Access Denied (403) error
when the account is managed by organization-level Block Public Access policies.
Organization-level policies override account-level settings, preventing direct
account-level modifications. For this operation, users must have the
`s3:PutAccountPublicAccessBlock` permission. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 block public access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html).

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[x-amz-account-id](#API_control_PutPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID for the AWS account whose `PublicAccessBlock` configuration
you want to set.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in XML format.

**[PublicAccessBlockConfiguration](#API_control_PutPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

Root level tag for the PublicAccessBlockConfiguration parameters.

Required: Yes

**[BlockPublicAcls](#API_control_PutPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for buckets in
this account. Setting this element to `TRUE` causes the following
behavior:

- `PutBucketAcl` and `PutObjectAcl` calls fail if the
specified ACL is public.

- PUT Object calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

- PUT Bucket calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing policies or ACLs.

This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[BlockPublicPolicy](#API_control_PutPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for buckets in this account.
Setting this element to `TRUE` causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy
if the specified bucket policy allows public access.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[IgnorePublicAcls](#API_control_PutPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets in this account. Setting
this element to `TRUE` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this
account and any objects that they contain.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't
prevent new public ACLs from being set.

This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**[RestrictPublicBuckets](#API_control_PutPublicAccessBlock_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for buckets in this
account. Setting this element to `TRUE` restricts access to buckets with public
policies to only AWS service principals and authorized users within this
account.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect previously stored bucket policies, except that
public and cross-account access within any public bucket policy, including non-public
delegation to specific accounts, is blocked.

This property is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

Type: Boolean

Required: No
