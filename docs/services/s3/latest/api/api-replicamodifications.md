# ReplicaModifications

A filter that you can specify for selection for modifications on replicas. Amazon S3 doesn't replicate
replica modifications by default. In the latest version of replication configuration (when
`Filter` is specified), you can specify this element and set the status to
`Enabled` to replicate modifications on replicas.

###### Note

If you don't specify the `Filter` element, Amazon S3 assumes that the replication
configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, this element is not allowed.
