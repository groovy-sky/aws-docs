# ListBucket (SOAP API)

###### Note

SOAP APIs for Amazon S3 are not available for new customers, and are approaching End of Life (EOL) on October 31, 2025. We recommend that you use either the REST API or the AWS SDKs.

The `ListBucket` operation returns information about some of the items in the
bucket.

For a general introduction to the list operation, see the [Listing Object Keys](../userguide/listingkeysusingapis.md).

## Requests

This example lists up to 1000 keys in the "quotes" bucket that have the prefix
"notes."

### Syntax

```

<ListBucket xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01">
  <Bucket>quotes</Bucket>
  <Prefix>notes/</Prefix>
  <Delimiter>/</Delimiter>
  <MaxKeys>1000</MaxKeys>
  <AWSAccessKeyId>AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE</AWSAccessKeyId>
  <Timestamp>2006-03-01T12:00:00.183Z</Timestamp>
  <Signature>Iuyz3d3P0aTou39dzbqaEXAMPLE=</Signature>
</ListBucket>

```

### Parameters

Name  Description  Required `prefix`

Limits the response to keys which begin with the indicated
prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different
sets of keys in a way similar to how a file system uses
folders.

###### Important

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using
XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

Type: String

Default: None

No `marker`

Indicates where in the bucket to begin listing. The list
will only include keys that occur lexicographically after
marker. This is convenient for pagination: To get the next page
of results use the last key of the current page as the
marker.

Type: String

Default: None

No `max-keys`

The maximum number of keys you'd like to see in the
response body. The server might return fewer than this many
keys, but will not return more.

Type: String

Default: None

No `delimiter`

Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix
and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a
single result element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These
rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the
response.

Type: String

Default: None

No

## Success Response

This response assumes the bucket contains the following keys:

```

notes/todos.txt
notes/2005-05-23/customer_mtg_notes.txt
notes/2005-05-23/phone_notes.txt
notes/2005-05-28/sales_notes.txt
```

### Syntax

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListBucketResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Name>backups</Name>
  <Prefix>notes/</Prefix>
  <MaxKeys>1000</MaxKeys>
  <Delimiter>/</Delimiter>
  <IsTruncated>false</IsTruncated>
  <Contents>
    <Key>notes/todos.txt</Key>
    <LastModified>2006-01-01T12:00:00.000Z</LastModified>
    <ETag>&quot;828ef3fdfa96f00ad9f27c383fc9ac7f&quot;</ETag>
    <Size>5126</Size>
    <StorageClass>STANDARD</StorageClass>
    <Owner>
      <ID>75aa57f09aa0c8caeab4f8c24e99d10f8e7faeebf76c078efc7c6caea54ba06a</ID>
      <DisplayName>webfile</DisplayName>
    </Owner>
    <StorageClass>STANDARD</StorageClass>
  </Contents>
  <CommonPrefixes>
    <Prefix>notes/2005-05-23/</Prefix>
  </CommonPrefixes>
  <CommonPrefixes>
    <Prefix>notes/2005-05-28/</Prefix>
  </CommonPrefixes>
  </ListBucketResult>
```

As you can see, many of the fields in the response echo the request parameters.
`IsTruncated`, `Contents`, and
`CommonPrefixes` are the only response elements that can
contain new information.

### Response Elements

Name  Description `Contents`

Metadata about each object returned.

Type: XML metadata

Ancestor: ListBucketResult

`CommonPrefixes`

A response can contain `CommonPrefixes` only if you specify a `delimiter`. When you do, `CommonPrefixes` contains all (if there are any) keys between `Prefix` and the next occurrence of the string specified by `delimiter`. In effect, `CommonPrefixes` lists keys that act like subdirectories in the directory specified by `Prefix`. For example, if `prefix` is `notes/` and `delimiter` is a slash (/), in `notes/summer/july`, the common prefix is `notes/summer/`.

Type: String

Ancestor: ListBucketResult

`Delimiter`

Causes keys that contain the same string between the prefix
and the first occurrence of the delimiter to be rolled up into a
single result element in the CommonPrefixes collection. These
rolled-up keys are not returned elsewhere in the
response.

Type: String

Ancestor: ListBucketResult

`IsTruncated`

Specifies whether (true) or not (false) all of the results
were returned. All of the results may not be returned if the
number of results exceeds that specified by `MaxKeys`.

Type: String

Ancestor: boolean

`Marker`

Indicates where in the bucket to begin listing.

Type: String

Ancestor: ListBucketResult

`MaxKeys`

The maximum number of keys returned in the response
body.

Type: String

Ancestor: ListBucketResult

`Name`

Name of the bucket.

Type: String

Ancestor: ListBucketResult

`Prefix`

Keys that begin with the indicated prefix.

Type: String

Ancestor: ListBucketResult

## Response Body

For information about the list response, see [Listing Keys Response](../userguide/listingkeysusingapis.md).

## Access Control

To list the keys of a bucket you need to have been granted `READ` access on
the bucket.
