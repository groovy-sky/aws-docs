# Rule

Specifies lifecycle rules for an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Put Bucket Lifecycle Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTlifecycle.html) in
the _Amazon S3 API Reference_. For examples, see [Put Bucket Lifecycle Configuration Examples](api-putbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md#API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration_Examples).

## Contents

**Prefix**

Object key prefix that identifies one or more objects to which this rule applies.

###### Important

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using
XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

Type: String

Required: Yes

**Status**

If `Enabled`, the rule is currently being applied. If `Disabled`, the rule is
not currently being applied.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Enabled | Disabled`

Required: Yes

**AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload**

Specifies the days since the initiation of an incomplete multipart upload that Amazon S3 will wait before
permanently removing all parts of the upload. For more information, see [Aborting\
Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: [AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload](api-abortincompletemultipartupload.md) data type

Required: No

**Expiration**

Specifies the expiration for the lifecycle of the object.

Type: [LifecycleExpiration](api-lifecycleexpiration.md) data type

Required: No

**ID**

Unique identifier for the rule. The value can't be longer than 255 characters.

Type: String

Required: No

**NoncurrentVersionExpiration**

Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the
noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning
enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in
the object's lifetime.

###### Note

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket
lifecycle configurations.

Type: [NoncurrentVersionExpiration](api-noncurrentversionexpiration.md) data type

Required: No

**NoncurrentVersionTransition**

Container for the transition rule that describes when noncurrent objects transition to the
`STANDARD_IA`, `ONEZONE_IA`, `INTELLIGENT_TIERING`,
`GLACIER_IR`, `GLACIER`, or `DEEP_ARCHIVE` storage class. If your
bucket is versioning-enabled (or versioning is suspended), you can set this action to request that Amazon S3
transition noncurrent object versions to the `STANDARD_IA`, `ONEZONE_IA`,
`INTELLIGENT_TIERING`, `GLACIER_IR`, `GLACIER`, or
`DEEP_ARCHIVE` storage class at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

Type: [NoncurrentVersionTransition](api-noncurrentversiontransition.md) data type

Required: No

**Transition**

Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. For more information about Amazon S3
lifecycle configuration rules, see [Transitioning Objects Using\
Amazon S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
