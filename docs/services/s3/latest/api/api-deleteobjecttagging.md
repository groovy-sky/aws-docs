###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Removes the entire tag set from the specified object. For more information about managing object

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:DeleteObjectTagging`
action.

To delete tags of a specific object version, add the `versionId` query parameter in the
request. You will need permission for the `s3:DeleteObjectVersionTagging` action.

The following operations are related to `DeleteObjectTagging`:

- [PutObjectTagging](api-putobjecttagging.md)

- [GetObjectTagging](api-getobjecttagging.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

DELETE /{Key+}?tagging&versionId=VersionId HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_DeleteObjectTagging_RequestSyntax)**

The bucket name containing the objects from which to remove the tags.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
