# DeleteBucketMetricsConfiguration

Deletes a metrics configuration for the Amazon CloudWatch request metrics (specified by the metrics
configuration ID) from the bucket. Note that this doesn't include the daily storage metrics.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
         `. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported.
For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Permissions

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
`s3:PutMetricsConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The
bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\
Resources](../userguide/s3-access-control.md).

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- The
`s3:PutMetricsConfiguration` permission is required in a policy. For more information
about general purpose buckets permissions, see [Using Bucket Policies and User\
Policies](../dev/using-iam-policies.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to
this API operation, you must have the `s3express:PutMetricsConfiguration` permission in
an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the AWS account that owns the resource.
For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](../userguide/s3-express-security-iam.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

For information about CloudWatch request metrics for Amazon S3, see [Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](../dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.md).

The following operations are related to `DeleteBucketMetricsConfiguration`:

- [GetBucketMetricsConfiguration](api-getbucketmetricsconfiguration.md)

- [PutBucketMetricsConfiguration](api-putbucketmetricsconfiguration.md)

- [ListBucketMetricsConfigurations](api-listbucketmetricsconfigurations.md)

- [Monitoring\
Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](../dev/cloudwatch-monitoring.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

DELETE /?metrics&id=Id HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_DeleteBucketMetricsConfiguration_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the bucket containing the metrics configuration to delete.

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
                  `. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must also follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_

Required: Yes

**[id](#API_DeleteBucketMetricsConfiguration_RequestSyntax)**

The ID used to identify the metrics configuration. The ID has a 64 character limit and can only
contain letters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores.

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_DeleteBucketMetricsConfiguration_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

###### Note

For directory buckets, this header is not supported in this API operation. If you specify this header, the request fails with the HTTP status code
`501 Not Implemented`.

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

```

HTTP/1.1 204

```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 204 response with an empty HTTP body.

## Examples

### Sample Request

the `ExampleMetrics` value for the `FilterId` dimension.

            Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
