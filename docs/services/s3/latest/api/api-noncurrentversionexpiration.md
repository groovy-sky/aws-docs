# NoncurrentVersionExpiration

Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the
noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning
enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in
the object's lifetime.

###### Note

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket
lifecycle configurations.

## Contents

versions to retain. Amazon S3 will permanently delete any additional noncurrent versions beyond the specified
number to retain. For more information about noncurrent versions, see [Lifecycle configuration elements](../userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.
