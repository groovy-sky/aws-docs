# EncryptionConfiguration

Specifies encryption-related information for an Amazon S3 bucket that is a destination for
replicated objects. If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified
KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then AWS KMS resolves the key within the
requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key
that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.

###### Note

This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

## Contents

**ReplicaKmsKeyID**

Specifies the ID of the customer managed AWS KMS key that's stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
for the destination bucket. This ID is either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
KMS key or the alias ARN for the KMS key. Amazon S3 uses this KMS key to encrypt
replica objects. Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys. For more information,
see [Symmetric encryption\
KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#symmetric-cmks) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer_
_Guide_.
