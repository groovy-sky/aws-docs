# PutBucketLogging

###### Important

End of support notice: As of October 1, 2025, Amazon S3 has discontinued support for Email Grantee Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you attempt to use an Email Grantee ACL in a request after October 1, 2025,
the request will receive an `HTTP 405` (Method Not Allowed) error.

This change affects the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and South America (São Paulo).

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can view and modify the
logging parameters. All logs are saved to buckets in the same AWS Region as the source bucket. To set
the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL\_CONTROL to all logs. You use the `Grantee`
request element to grant access to other people. The `Permissions` request element specifies
the kind of access the grantee has to the logs.

###### Important

If the target bucket for log delivery uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object
Ownership, you can't use the `Grantee` request element to grant access to others.
Permissions can only be granted using policies. For more information, see [Permissions for server access log delivery](../userguide/enable-server-access-logging.md#grant-log-delivery-permissions-general) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Grantee Values

You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (by using request
elements) in the following ways. For examples of how to specify these grantee values in JSON
format, see the AWS CLI example in [Enabling Amazon S3 server\
access logging](../userguide/enable-server-access-logging.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- By the person's ID:

`<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                    xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
                    </Grantee>`

`DisplayName` is optional and ignored in the request.

- By Email address:

` <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                    xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress></Grantee>`

The grantee is resolved to the `CanonicalUser` and, in a response to a
`GETObjectAcl` request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

- By URI:

`<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                    xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`

To enable logging, you use `LoggingEnabled` and its children request elements. To disable
logging, you use an empty `BucketLoggingStatus` request element:

`<BucketLoggingStatus xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01" />`

For more information about server access logging, see [Server Access Logging](../userguide/serverlogs.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

For more information about creating a bucket, see [CreateBucket](api-createbucket.md). For more information about
returning the logging status of a bucket, see [GetBucketLogging](api-getbucketlogging.md).

The following operations are related to `PutBucketLogging`:

- [PutObject](api-putobject.md)

- [DeleteBucket](api-deletebucket.md)

- [CreateBucket](api-createbucket.md)

- [GetBucketLogging](api-getbucketlogging.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_PutBucketLogging_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the bucket for which to set the logging parameters.

Required: Yes

**[Content-MD5](#API_PutBucketLogging_RequestSyntax)**

The MD5 hash of the `PutBucketLogging` request body.

For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_PutBucketLogging_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm](#API_PutBucketLogging_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any
additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or
`x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm`
parameter.

Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in XML format.

**[BucketLoggingStatus](#API_PutBucketLogging_RequestSyntax)**

Root level tag for the BucketLoggingStatus parameters.

Required: Yes

**[LoggingEnabled](#API_PutBucketLogging_RequestSyntax)**

Describes where logs are stored and the prefix that Amazon S3 assigns to all log object keys for a
bucket. For more information, see [PUT Bucket logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTlogging.html) in the
_Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Type: [LoggingEnabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_LoggingEnabled.html) data type

Required: No

## Response Syntax

```

HTTP/1.1 200

```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.

## Examples

### Sample Request

This request enables logging and gives the grantee of the bucket READ access to the logs.

Buckets that use the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership to disable ACLs don't
support target grants. For more information, see [Permissions for server access log delivery](../userguide/enable-server-access-logging.md#grant-log-delivery-permissions-general) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.
