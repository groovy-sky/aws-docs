# MultiRegionAccessPointRoute

A structure for a Multi-Region Access Point that indicates where Amazon S3 traffic can be routed. Routes can be
either active or passive. Active routes can process Amazon S3 requests through the Multi-Region Access Point, but
passive routes are not eligible to process Amazon S3 requests.

Each route contains the Amazon S3 bucket name and the AWS Region that the bucket is located
in. The route also includes the `TrafficDialPercentage` value, which shows
whether the bucket and Region are active (indicated by a value of `100`) or
passive (indicated by a value of `0`).

## Contents

**TrafficDialPercentage**

The traffic state for the specified bucket or AWS Region.

A value of `0` indicates a passive state, which means that no new traffic
will be routed to the Region.

A value of `100` indicates an active state, which means that traffic will be
routed to the specified Region.

When the routing configuration for a Region is changed from active to passive, any
in-progress operations (uploads, copies, deletes, and so on) to the formerly active Region
will continue to run to until a final success or failure status is reached.

If all Regions in the routing configuration are designated as passive, you'll receive an
`InvalidRequest` error.

Type: Integer

Valid Range: Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 100.

Required: Yes

**Bucket**

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for which you'll submit a routing configuration change.
Either the `Bucket` or the `Region` value must be provided. If both
are provided, the bucket must be in the specified Region.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 255.

Required: No

**Region**

The AWS Region to which you'll be submitting a routing configuration change. Either
the `Bucket` or the `Region` value must be provided. If both are
provided, the bucket must be in the specified Region.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.

Required: No
