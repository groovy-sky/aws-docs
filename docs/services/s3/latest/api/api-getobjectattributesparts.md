# GetObjectAttributesParts

A collection of parts associated with a multipart upload.

in the `MaxParts` element.

###### Note

- **General purpose buckets** \- For
`GetObjectAttributes`, if an additional checksum (including
`x-amz-checksum-crc32`, `x-amz-checksum-crc32c`,
`x-amz-checksum-sha1`, or `x-amz-checksum-sha256`) isn't applied to the
object specified in the request, the response doesn't return the `Part` element.

- **Directory buckets** \- For
`GetObjectAttributes`, regardless of whether an additional checksum is applied to the
object specified in the request, the response returns the `Part` element.
