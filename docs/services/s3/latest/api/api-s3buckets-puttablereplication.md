# PutTableReplication

Creates or updates the replication configuration for a specific table. This operation allows you to define table-level replication independently of bucket-level replication, providing granular control over which tables are replicated and where.

Permissions

- You must have the `s3tables:PutTableReplication` permission to use this operation. The IAM role specified in the configuration must have permissions to read from the source table and write to all destination tables.

- You must also have the following permissions:

- `s3tables:GetTable` permission on the source table being replicated.

- `s3tables:CreateTable` permission for the destination.

- `s3tables:CreateNamespace` permission for the destination.

- `s3tables:GetTableMaintenanceConfig` permission for the source
table.

- `s3tables:PutTableMaintenanceConfig` permission for the destination
table.

- You must have `iam:PassRole` permission with condition allowing
roles to be passed to `replication.s3tables.amazonaws.com`.
