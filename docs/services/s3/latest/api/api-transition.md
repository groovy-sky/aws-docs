# Transition

Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. For more information about Amazon S3
lifecycle configuration rules, see [Transitioning Objects Using\
Amazon S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC.

**Days**

Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are transitioned to the specified storage
class. If the specified storage class is `INTELLIGENT_TIERING`, `GLACIER_IR`,
`GLACIER`, or `DEEP_ARCHIVE`, valid values are `0` or positive
integers. If the specified storage class is `STANDARD_IA` or `ONEZONE_IA`, valid
values are positive integers greater than `30`. Be aware that some storage classes have a
minimum storage duration and that you're charged for transitioning objects before their minimum storage
