# Use `DeleteObjects` with an AWS SDK or CLI

The following code examples show how to use `DeleteObjects`.

Action examples are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. You can see this action in
context in the following code examples:

CLI

**AWS CLI**

The following command deletes an object from a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```nohighlight

aws s3api delete-objects --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --delete file://delete.json

```

`delete.json` is a JSON document in the current directory that specifies the object to delete:

```nohighlight

{
  "Objects": [
    {
      "Key": "test1.txt"
    }
  ],
  "Quiet": false
}
```

Output:

```nohighlight

{
    "Deleted": [
        {
            "DeleteMarkerVersionId": "mYAT5Mc6F7aeUL8SS7FAAqUPO1koHwzU",
            "Key": "test1.txt",
            "DeleteMarker": true
        }
    ]

PowerShell

**Tools for PowerShell V4**

**Example 1: This command removes the object "sample.txt" from bucket "test-files". You are prompted for confirmation before the command executes; to suppress the prompt use the -Force switch.**

```powershell

Remove-S3Object -BucketName amzn-s3-demo-bucket -Key sample.txt

```

**Example 2: This command removes the specified version of object "sample.txt" from bucket "test-files", assuming the bucket has been configured to enable object versions.**

```powershell

Remove-S3Object -BucketName amzn-s3-demo-bucket -Key sample.txt -VersionId HLbxnx6V9omT6AQYVpks8mmFKQcejpqt

```

**Example 3: This command removes objects "sample1.txt", "sample2.txt" and "sample3.txt" from bucket "test-files" as a single batch operation. The service response will list all keys processed, regardless of the success or error status of the deletion. To obtain only errors for keys that were not able to be processed by the service add the -ReportErrorsOnly parameter (this parameter can also be specified with the alias -Quiet.**

```powershell

Remove-S3Object -BucketName amzn-s3-demo-bucket -KeyCollection @( "sample1.txt", "sample2.txt", "sample3.txt" )

```

**Example 4: This example uses an inline expression with the -KeyCollection parameter to obtain the keys of the objects to delete. Get-S3Object returns a collection of Amazon.S3.Model.S3Object instances, each of which has a Key member of type string identifying the object.**

```powershell

Remove-S3Object -bucketname "amzn-s3-demo-bucket" -KeyCollection (Get-S3Object "test-files" -KeyPrefix "prefix/subprefix" | select -ExpandProperty Key)

```

**Example 5: This example obtains all objects that have a key prefix "prefix/subprefix" in the bucket and deletes them. Note that the incoming objects are processed one at a time. For large collections consider passing the collection to the cmdlet's -InputObject (alias -S3ObjectCollection) parameter to enable the deletion to occur as a batch with a single call to the service.**

```powershell

Get-S3Object -BucketName "amzn-s3-demo-bucket" -KeyPrefix "prefix/subprefix" | Remove-S3Object -Force

```

**Example 6: This example pipes a collection of Amazon.S3.Model.S3ObjectVersion instances that represent delete markers to the cmdlet for deletion. Note that the incoming objects are processed one at a time. For large collections consider passing the collection to the cmdlet's -InputObject (alias -S3ObjectCollection) parameter to enable the deletion to occur as a batch with a single call to the service.**

```powershell

(Get-S3Version -BucketName "amzn-s3-demo-bucket").Versions | Where {$_.IsDeleteMarker -eq "True"} | Remove-S3Object -Force

```

**Example 7: This script shows how to perform a batch delete of a set of objects (in this case delete markers) by constructing an array of objects to be used with the -KeyAndVersionCollection parameter.**

```powershell

$keyVersions = @()
$markers = (Get-S3Version -BucketName $BucketName).Versions | Where {$_.IsDeleteMarker -eq "True"}
foreach ($marker in $markers) { $keyVersions += @{ Key = $marker.Key; VersionId = $marker.VersionId } }
