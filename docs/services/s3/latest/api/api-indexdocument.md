# IndexDocument

Container for the `Suffix` element.

## Contents

**Suffix**

A suffix that is appended to a request that is for a directory on the website endpoint. (For
example, if the suffix is `index.html` and you make a request to
`samplebucket/images/`, the data that is returned will be for the object with the key name
`images/index.html`.) The suffix must not be empty and must not include a slash
character.

###### Important

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using
XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

Type: String
