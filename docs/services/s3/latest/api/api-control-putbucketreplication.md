# PutBucketReplication

###### Note

This action creates an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To create
an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see [PutBucketReplication](api-putbucketreplication.md)
in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For information about
S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Replicating objects for\
S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

It can take a while to propagate `PUT` or `DELETE` requests for
a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication
configuration that's returned by a `GET` request soon after a
`PUT` or `DELETE` request might return a more recent result
than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the
replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.

Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication
configuration, you provide the following information:

- The name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want S3 on Outposts to
replicate objects

- The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that S3 on Outposts can assume to replicate objects on
your behalf

- Other relevant information, such as replication rules

A replication configuration must include at least one rule and can contain a maximum of
100\. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the
source Outposts bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule
for each subset.

To specify a subset of the objects in the source Outposts bucket to apply a replication
rule to, add the `Filter` element as a child of the `Rule` element.
You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both.
When you add the `Filter` element in the configuration, you must also add the
following elements: `DeleteMarkerReplication`, `Status`, and
`Priority`.

Using `PutBucketReplication` on Outposts requires that both the source and
destination buckets must have versioning enabled. For information about enabling versioning
on a bucket, see [Managing S3 Versioning\
for your S3 on Outposts bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsManagingVersioning.html).

For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see [Replication failure reasons](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/outposts-replication-eventbridge.html#outposts-replication-failure-codes) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects**

Outposts buckets are encrypted at all times. All the objects in the source Outposts
bucket are encrypted and can be replicated. Also, all the replicas in the destination
Outposts bucket are encrypted with the same encryption key as the objects in the source
Outposts bucket.

**Permissions**

To create a `PutBucketReplication` request, you must have
`s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration` permissions for the bucket. The
Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more
information about permissions, see [Setting up IAM with\
S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html) and [Managing access to\
S3 on Outposts buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html).

###### Note

To perform this operation, the user or role must also have the
`iam:CreateRole` and `iam:PassRole` permissions. For more
information, see [Granting a user permissions to\
pass a role to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html).

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketReplication.html#API_control_PutBucketReplication_Examples) section.

The following operations are related to `PutBucketReplication`:

- [GetBucketReplication](api-control-getbucketreplication.md)

- [DeleteBucketReplication](api-control-deletebucketreplication.md)

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[name](#API_control_PutBucketReplication_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the S3 on Outposts bucket to set the configuration for.

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the AWS SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 255.

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-account-id](#API_control_PutBucketReplication_RequestSyntax)**

The AWS account ID of the Outposts bucket.

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 64.

Pattern: `^\d{12}$`

Required: Yes

## Request Body

**[ReplicationConfiguration](#API_control_PutBucketReplication_RequestSyntax)**

Root level tag for the ReplicationConfiguration parameters.

Required: Yes

**[Role](#API_control_PutBucketReplication_RequestSyntax)**

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that S3 on Outposts assumes
when replicating objects. For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration,
see [Setting up\
replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/outposts-replication-how-setup.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: Yes

**[Rules](#API_control_PutBucketReplication_RequestSyntax)**

A container for one or more replication rules. A replication configuration must have at
least one rule and can contain an array of 100 rules at the most.

Type: Array of [ReplicationRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_ReplicationRule.html) data types

Required: Yes

## Response Syntax

```

HTTP/1.1 200

```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.

## Examples

### Sample Request: Add a replication configuration to an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket

The following sample `PUT` request creates a replication subresource on
the specified Outposts bucket named `example-outpost-bucket` and saves
the replication configuration in it. The replication configuration specifies a rule
to replicate objects to the `example-outpost-bucket` bucket. The rule
includes a filter to replicate only the objects that are created with the key name
prefix `TaxDocs` and that have two specific tags.

After you add a replication configuration to your Outposts bucket, S3 on Outposts
assumes the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that's specified in the configuration to replicate
objects on behalf of the Outposts bucket owner. The bucket owner is the
AWS account that created the Outposts bucket.

Filtering by using the `Filter` element is supported in the latest XML
configuration. The earlier version of the XML configuration isn't supported.

For more examples of S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Creating\
replication rules on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-between-outposts.html) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.
