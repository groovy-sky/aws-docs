# ErrorDetails

If an S3 Metadata V1 `CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` or V2
`CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration` request succeeds, but S3 Metadata was
unable to create the table, this structure contains the error code and error message.

###### Note

If you created your S3 Metadata configuration before July 15, 2025, we recommend that you delete
and re-create your configuration by using [CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration](api-createbucketmetadataconfiguration.md) so that you can expire journal table records and create
a live inventory table.

**ErrorCode**

If the V1 `CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` request succeeds, but S3 Metadata was
unable to create the table, this structure contains the error code. The possible error codes and error
messages are as follows:

- `AccessDeniedCreatingResources` \- You don't have sufficient permissions to create the
required resources. Make sure that you have `s3tables:CreateNamespace`,
`s3tables:CreateTable`, `s3tables:GetTable` and
`s3tables:PutTablePolicy` permissions, and then try again. To create a new metadata
table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata
configuration.

- `AccessDeniedWritingToTable` \- Unable to write to the metadata table because of
missing resource permissions. To fix the resource policy, Amazon S3 needs to create a new metadata
table. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket,
and then create a new metadata configuration.

- `DestinationTableNotFound` \- The destination table doesn't exist. To create a new
metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new
metadata configuration.

- `ServerInternalError` \- An internal error has occurred. To create a new metadata
table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata
configuration.

- `TableAlreadyExists` \- The table that you specified already exists in the table
bucket's namespace. Specify a different table name. To create a new metadata table, you must delete
the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

- `TableBucketNotFound` \- The table bucket that you specified doesn't exist in this
AWS Region and account. Create or choose a different table bucket. To create a new metadata table,
you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata
configuration.

If the V2 `CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration` request succeeds, but S3 Metadata was
unable to create the table, this structure contains the error code. The possible error codes and error
messages are as follows:

- `AccessDeniedCreatingResources` \- You don't have sufficient permissions to create
the required resources. Make sure that you have `s3tables:CreateTableBucket`,
`s3tables:CreateNamespace`, `s3tables:CreateTable`,
`s3tables:GetTable`, `s3tables:PutTablePolicy`,
`kms:DescribeKey`, and `s3tables:PutTableEncryption` permissions.
Additionally, ensure that the KMS key used to encrypt the table still exists, is active and
has a resource policy granting access to the S3 service principals
' `maintenance.s3tables.amazonaws.com`' and ' `metadata.s3.amazonaws.com`'.
To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and
then create a new metadata configuration.

- `AccessDeniedWritingToTable` \- Unable to write to the metadata table because of
missing resource permissions. To fix the resource policy, Amazon S3 needs to create a new metadata
table. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket,
and then create a new metadata configuration.

- `DestinationTableNotFound` \- The destination table doesn't exist. To create a new
metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new
metadata configuration.

- `ServerInternalError` \- An internal error has occurred. To create a new metadata
table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata
configuration.

- `JournalTableAlreadyExists` \- A journal table already exists in the AWS managed table bucket's
namespace. Delete the journal table, and then try again. To create a new metadata table, you must delete
the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

- `InventoryTableAlreadyExists` \- An inventory table already exists in the AWS managed table
bucket's namespace. Delete the inventory table, and then try again. To create a new metadata table, you must delete
the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

- `JournalTableNotAvailable` \- The journal table that the inventory table relies on
has a `FAILED` status. An inventory table requires a journal table with an
`ACTIVE` status. To create a new journal or inventory table, you must delete the metadata
configuration for this bucket, along with any journal or inventory tables, and then create a new
metadata configuration.

- `NoSuchBucket` \- The specified general purpose bucket does not exist.
