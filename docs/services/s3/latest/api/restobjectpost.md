# POST Object

## Description

The `POST` operation adds an object to a specified bucket by using HTML forms.
`POST` is an alternate form of `PUT` that enables browser-based
uploads as a way of putting objects in buckets. Parameters that are passed to `PUT`
through HTTP headers are instead passed as form fields to `POST` in the
multipart/form-data encoded message body. To add an object to a bucket, you must have
`WRITE` access on the bucket. Amazon S3 never stores partial objects. If you receive a
successful response, you can be confident that the entire object was stored.

Amazon S3 is a distributed system. Unless you've enabled versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3
receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, only the last version of
the object written is stored.

To ensure that data is not corrupted while traversing the network, use the
`Content-MD5` form field. When you use this form field, Amazon S3 checks the object
against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. Additionally, you
can calculate the MD5 value while posting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned
`ETag` to the calculated MD5 value. The ETag reflects only changes to the
contents of an object, not its metadata.

###### Note

To configure your application to send the request headers before sending the request
body, use the HTTP status code 100 (Continue). For `POST` operations, using this
status code helps you avoid sending the message body if the message is rejected based on the
headers (for example, because of an authentication failure or redirect). For more
information about the HTTP status code 100 (Continue), go to Section 8.2.3 of [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt).

Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. The
encryption setting of an uploaded object depends on the default encryption configuration of
the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that
uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

If the destination bucket has an encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption
with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with an AWS KMS key
(DSSE-KMS), or a customer-provi ded encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding
KMS key or customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded object. When uploading an object,
if you want to change the encryption setting of the uploaded object, you can specify the type
of server-side encryption. You can configure SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, or SSE-C. For more
information, see [Protecting data using\
server-side encryption](../userguide/serv-side-encryption.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

###### Important

When constructing your request, make sure that the `file` field is the last
field in the form.

variable. For example, if a user named Mary uploads the file
`example.jpg` and you specify
`/user/mary/${filename}`, the key name is
`/user/mary/example.jpg`.

For more information, see [Object\
key and metadata](../userguide/usingmetadata.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

Type: String

Default: None

Yes

`policy`

The security policy that describes what is permitted in the request. Requests
without a security policy are considered anonymous and work only on publicly
writable buckets. For more information, see [HTML forms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HTTPPOSTForms.html) and [Upload examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HTTPPOSTExamples.html) in the

Conditional

`success_action_redirect`, `redirect`

The URL to which the client is redirected upon a successful upload.

If `success_action_redirect` is not specified, Amazon S3 returns the
empty document type specified in the `success_action_status`
field.

If Amazon S3 cannot interpret the URL, it acts as if the field is not
present.

If the upload fails, Amazon S3 displays an error and does not redirect the user to
a URL.

Default: None

###### Note

The `redirect` field name is deprecated, and support for the
`redirect` field name will be removed in the future.

No

`success_action_status`

If you don't specify `success_action_redirect`, the status code is
returned to the client when the upload succeeds.

This field accepts the values `200`, `201`, or
`204` (the default).

If the value is set to `200` or `204`, Amazon S3 returns an
empty document with a 200 or 204 status code.

If the value is set to `201`, Amazon S3 returns an XML document with a
201 status code.

If the value is not set or if it is set to a value that is not valid, Amazon S3
returns an empty document with a 204 status code.

Type: String

Default: None

No

`tagging`

The specified set of tags to add to the object. To add tags, use the following
encoding scheme.

```nohighlight

<Tagging>
  <TagSet>
    <Tag>
      <Key>TagName</Key>
      <Value>TagValue</Value>
    </Tag>
    ...
  </TagSet>
</Tagging>

`STANDARD` \| `STANDARD_IA`

No

`x-amz-meta-*`

Headers starting with this prefix are user-defined metadata. Each one is
stored and returned as a set of key-value pairs. Amazon S3 doesn't validate or
interpret user-defined metadata. For more information, see [PutObject](api-putobject.md).

Type: String

Default: None

No

`x-amz-security-token`

The Amazon DevPay security token.

Each request that uses Amazon DevPay requires two `x-amz-security-token`
form fields: one for the product token and one for the user token.

(AWS Signature Version 4) The HMAC-SHA256 hash of the security
policy.

Type: String

Default: None

Conditional

`x-amz-website-redirect-location`

If the bucket is configured as a website, this field redirects requests for
this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3
stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For information about
object metadata, see [Object key and\
metadata](../userguide/usingmetadata.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object
( `anotherPage.html`) in the same bucket:

`x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html`

In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to
another website:

`x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/`

Constraints: The value must be prefixed by `/`,
`http://`, or `https://`. The length of the value is
limited to 2 KB.

No

#### Additional Checksum Request Form Fields

When uploading an object, you can specify various checksums that you would like to
use to verify your data integrity. You can specify one additional checksum algorithm for
Amazon S3 to use. For more information about additional checksum values, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

Name  Description  Required `x-amz-checksum-algorithm`

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object. If a value
is specified, you must include the matching checksum header. Otherwise, your request
will generate a 400 error.

Possible values include `CRC32`, `CRC32C`, `SHA1`,
and `SHA256`.

No`x-amz-checksum-crc32`

Specifies the base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32 checksum of the object.

This parameter is required if the value of
`x-amz-checksum-algorithm` is `CRC32`.

Conditional`x-amz-checksum-crc32c`

Specifies the base64-encoded, 32-bit CRC32C checksum of the object.

This parameter is required if the value of
`x-amz-checksum-algorithm` is `CRC32C`.

Conditional`x-amz-checksum-sha1`

Specifies the base64-encoded, 160-bit SHA-1 digest of the object.

This parameter is required if the value of
`x-amz-checksum-algorithm` is `SHA1`.

Conditional`x-amz-checksum-sha256`

Specifies the base64-encoded, 256-bit SHA-256 digest of the object.

This parameter is required if the value of
`x-amz-checksum-algorithm` is `SHA256`.

Conditional

#### Server-Side Encryption Specific Request Form Fields

Server-side encryption is data encryption at rest. Amazon S3
encrypts your data while writing it to disks in AWS data centers and decrypts your data
when you access it. When uploading an object, you can specify the type of server-side encryption that you want
Amazon S3 to use for encrypting the object.

There are four types of server-side encryption:

- **Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys**
**(SSE-S3)** – Starting May 2022, all Amazon S3 buckets have
encryption configured by default. The default option for server-side encryption is
with SSE-S3. Each object is encrypted with a unique key. As an additional safeguard,
SSE-S3 encrypts the key itself with a root key that it regularly rotates. SSE-S3 uses
one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES-256), to encrypt your data.

- **Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys**
**(SSE-KMS)** – SSE-KMS is provided through an integration of the
AWS KMS service with Amazon S3. With AWS KMS, you have more control over your keys. For
example, you can view separate keys, edit control policies, and follow the keys in
AWS CloudTrail. Additionally, you can create and manage customer managed keys or use
AWS managed keys that are unique to you, your service, and your Region.

- **Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys**
**(DSSE-KMS)** – Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-KMS,
but applies two individual layers of object-level encryption instead of one layer.

- **Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys**
**(SSE-C)** – With SSE-C, you manage the encryption keys, and Amazon S3
manages the encryption as it writes to disks, and the decryption when you access your
objects.

###### Note

If you have server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) blocked for your general purpose bucket, you will get an HTTP 403 Access Denied error when you specify the SSE-C request headers while writing new data to your bucket. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](../userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.md).

For more information, see [Protecting data using server-side encryption](../userguide/serv-side-encryption.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide_.

Depending on which type of server-side encryption you want to use, specify the
following form fields.

- **Use SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or DSSE-KMS** – If you want to use
these types of server-side encryption, specify the following form fields in the
request.

Name  Description  Required `x-amz-server-side-encryption`

Specifies the server-side encryption algorithm to use when Amazon S3 creates
an object. To use SSE-S3, specify `AES256`. To use SSE-KMS,
specify `aws:kms`. To use DSSE-KMS,
specify `aws:kms:dsse`.

Type: String

Valid Value: `aws:kms`, `AES256`, `aws:kms:dsse`

Yes`x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`

If the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header has a valid
value of `aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies the ID of the
AWS KMS key that was used to encrypt the object.

Type: String

Yes, if the value of `x-amz-server-side-encryption` is
`aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse``x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`

If `x-amz-server-side-encryption` has a valid value of
`aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies the encryption context for the
object. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string that
contains JSON-formatted key-value pairs for the encryption context.

Type: String

No`x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`

If `x-amz-server-side-encryption` has a valid value of
`aws:kms` or `aws:kms:dsse`, this header specifies
whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key with SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS. Setting
this header to `true` causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for
object encryption with SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS.

Type: Boolean

No

###### Note

If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms` or
`x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse`, but do not provide
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the
AWS managed key ( `aws/S3`) to protect the data.

- **Use SSE-C** – If you want to manage your own
encryption keys, you must provide all the following form fields in the request.

###### Note

If you use SSE-C, the `ETag` value that Amazon S3 returns in the response
is not the MD5 of the object.

Name  Description  Required `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`

Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object.

Type: String

Default: None

Valid Value: `AES256`

Constraints: Must be accompanied by valid
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` and
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5` fields.

Yes `x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key`

Specifies the customer-provided base64-encoded encryption key for Amazon S3
to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object, and then
it is discarded. Amazon does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm`
header.

Type: String

Default: None

Constraints: Must be accompanied by valid
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` and
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5` fields.

Yes`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5`

Specifies the base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key
according to [RFC 1321](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321). Amazon S3 uses this header for a
message-integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted
without error.

Type: String

Default: None

Constraints: Must be accompanied by valid
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm` and
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key` fields.

Yes
