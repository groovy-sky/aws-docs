# Get an Amazon S3 object from a Multi-Region Access Point by using an AWS SDK

The following code example shows how to get an object from a Multi-Region Access Point.

Kotlin

**SDK for Kotlin**

###### Note

There's more on GitHub. Find the complete example and learn how to set up and run in the
[AWS Code\
Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/kotlin/services/s3).

Configure the S3 client to use the Asymmetric Sigv4 (Sigv4a) signing algorithm.

```kotlin

        suspend fun createS3Client(): S3Client {
            // Configure your S3Client to use the Asymmetric SigV4 (SigV4a) signing algorithm.
            val sigV4aScheme = SigV4AsymmetricAuthScheme(DefaultAwsSigner)
            val s3 = S3Client.fromEnvironment {
                authSchemes = listOf(sigV4aScheme)
            }
            return s3
        }

```

Use the Multi-Region Access Point ARN instead of a bucket name to retrieve the object.

```kotlin

    suspend fun getObjectFromMrap(
        s3: S3Client,
        mrapArn: String,
        keyName: String,
    ): String? {
        val request = GetObjectRequest {
            bucket = mrapArn // Use the ARN instead of the bucket name for object operations.
            key = keyName
        }

        var stringObj: String? = null
        s3.getObject(request) { resp ->
            stringObj = resp.body?.decodeToString()
            if (stringObj != null) {
                println("Successfully read $keyName from $mrapArn")
            }
        }
        return stringObj
    }

```
