# RestoreObject

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

This action performs the following types of requests:

- `restore an archive` \- Restore an archived object

For more information about the `S3` structure in the request body, see the
following:

- [PutObject](api-putobject.md)

- [Managing Access\
with ACLs](../dev/s3-acls-usingacls.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_

- [Protecting Data\
Using Server-Side Encryption](../dev/serv-side-encryption.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_

Permissions

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the `s3:RestoreObject`
action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.
For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](../userguide/using-with-s3-actions.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\
Resources](../userguide/s3-access-control.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Restoring objects

Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in
real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy
of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the
Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the
object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or
Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and
then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier.

To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a
version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier
options in the `Tier` element of the request body:

- `Expedited` \- Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional
urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects
(250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5
minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is
available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available
for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or
S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

- `Standard` \- Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived
objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for
objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier.
They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the
S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard
retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

- `Bulk` \- Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large amounts,
even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for
objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier.
Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from
S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in
the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for
`Expedited` data access, see [Restoring Archived Objects](../dev/restoring-objects.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it
is in progress. For more information, see [Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore](../dev/restoring-objects.md#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

To get the status of object restoration, you can send a `HEAD` request. Operations
return the `x-amz-restore` header, which provides information about the restoration
status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is
initiated or completed. For more information, see [Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications](../dev/notificationhowto.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the
request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and
charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the
restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the
object.

If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action,
the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example,
if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3
deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](api-putbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md) and [Object Lifecycle Management](../dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.md) in
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Responses

A successful action returns either the `200 OK` or `202 Accepted` status
code.

- If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns `202 Accepted` in
the response.

- If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` in the response.

- Special errors:

- _Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress_

- _Cause: Object restore is already in progress._

- _HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict_

- _SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client_

- - _Code: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable_

- _Cause: expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try again later._
_(Returned if there is insufficient capacity to process the Expedited request. This error_
_applies only to Expedited retrievals and not to S3 Standard or Bulk_
_retrievals.)_

- _HTTP Status Code: 503_

- _SOAP Fault Code Prefix: N/A_

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_RestoreObject_RequestSyntax)**

The bucket name containing the object to restore.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/s3onoutposts.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Required: Yes

**[Key](#API_RestoreObject_RequestSyntax)**

Object key for which the action was initiated.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: Yes

**[versionId](#API_RestoreObject_RequestSyntax)**

VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_RestoreObject_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_RestoreObject_RequestSyntax)**

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about
downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays\
Buckets](../dev/objectsinrequesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

**[x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm](#API_RestoreObject_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any
additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum` or
`x-amz-trailer` header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm`
parameter.

Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in XML format.

**[RestoreRequest](#API_RestoreObject_RequestSyntax)**
