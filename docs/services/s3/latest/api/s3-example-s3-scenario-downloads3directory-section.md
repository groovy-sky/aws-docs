The following code example shows how to download and filter the contents of Amazon S3 bucket 'directories'.

Java

**SDK for Java 2.x**

This example show how to use the [S3TransferManager](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/transfer/s3/S3TransferManager.html) in the AWS SDK for Java 2.x to download 'directories' from an Amazon S3 bucket. It also demonstrates how to use [DownloadFilters](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/transfer/s3/config/DownloadFilter.html) in the request.

```java

    /**
     * For standard buckets, S3 provides the illusion of a directory structure through the use of keys. When you upload
     * an object to an S3 bucket, you specify a key, which is essentially the "path" to the object. The key can contain
     * forward slashes ("/") to make it appear as if the object is stored in a directory structure, but this is just a
     * logical representation, not an actual directory.
     * <p><pre>
     * In this example, our S3 bucket contains the following objects:
     *
     * folder1/file1.txt
     * folder1/file2.txt
     * folder1/file3.txt
     * folder2/file1.txt
     * folder2/file2.txt
     * folder2/file3.txt
     * folder3/file1.txt
     * folder3/file2.txt
     * folder3/file3.txt
     *
     * When method `downloadS3Directories` is invoked with
     * `destinationPathURI` set to `/test`, the downloaded
     * directory looks like:
     *
     * |- test
     *    |- folder1
     *    	  |- file1.txt
     *    	  |- file2.txt
     *    	  |- file3.txt
     *    |- folder3
     *    	  |- file1.txt
     *    	  |- file2.txt
     *    	  |- file3.txt
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param transferManager    An S3TransferManager instance.
     * @param destinationPathURI local directory to hold the downloaded S3 'directories' and files.
     * @param bucketName         The S3 bucket that contains the 'directories' to download.
     * @return The number of objects (files, in this case) that were downloaded.
