# SubmitMultiRegionAccessPointRoutes

###### Note

This operation is not supported by directory buckets.

Submits an updated route configuration for a Multi-Region Access Point. This API operation updates the
routing status for the specified Regions from active to passive, or from passive to active.
A value of `0` indicates a passive status, which means that traffic won't be
routed to the specified Region. A value of `100` indicates an active status,
which means that traffic will be routed to the specified Region. At least one Region must
be active at all times.

When the routing configuration is changed, any in-progress operations (uploads, copies,
deletes, and so on) to formerly active Regions will continue to run to their final
completion state (success or failure). The routing configurations of any Regions that
aren’t specified remain unchanged.

###### Note

Updated routing configurations might not be immediately applied. It can take up to 2
minutes for your changes to take effect.

To submit routing control changes and failover requests, use the Amazon S3 failover control
infrastructure endpoints in these five AWS Regions:

- `us-east-1`

- `us-west-2`

- `ap-southeast-2`

- `ap-northeast-1`

- `eu-west-1`

## Examples

### Sample request for initiating failover

In the following example, the request to submit these routing changes to initiate
a failover is sent to the failover control infrastructure in the
`us-east-1` Region. In this example, the `eu-north-1` Region
is set to active, and the `ap-northeast-3` Region is set to passive. In
other words, the `ap-northeast-3` Region is failed over to the
`eu-north-1` Region.

```HTTP

PATCH /v20180820/mrap/instances/<Multi-Region Access Point>/routes HTTP/1.1
Host: example-account-id.s3-control.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

<SubmitMultiRegionAccessPointRoutesRequest>
  <RouteUpdates>
     <Route>
      <Region>eu-north-1</Region>
      <Bucket>example-bucket-eu-north-1</Bucket>
      <TrafficDialPercentage>100</TrafficDialPercentage>
     </Route>
     <Route>
      <Region>ap-northeast-3</Region>
      <Bucket>example-bucket-ap-northeast-3</Bucket>
      <TrafficDialPercentage>0</TrafficDialPercentage>
     </Route>
  </RouteUpdates>
</SubmitMultiRegionAccessPointRoutesRequest>

```

### Sample request for setting a Region to active status

The following request updates the route configuration of the
`eu-north-1` Region to active. The request is sent to the failover
control infrastructure in the `eu-west-1` Region.

```HTTP

PATCH /v20180820/mrap/instances/<Multi-Region Access Point>/routes HTTP/1.1
Host: example-account-id.s3-control.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

<SubmitMultiRegionAccessPointRoutesRequest>
   <RouteUpdates>
    <Route>
      <Region>eu-north-1<Region>
      <Bucket>example-bucket-eu-north-1</Bucket>
      <TrafficDialPercentage>100</TrafficDialPercentage>
    </Route>
   </RouteUpdates>
</SubmitMultiRegionAccessPointRoutesRequest>

```
