# DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration

###### Note

This action deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's lifecycle configuration. To delete
an S3 bucket's lifecycle configuration, see [DeleteBucketLifecycle](api-deletebucketlifecycle.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified Outposts bucket.
Amazon S3 on Outposts removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource
associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and Amazon S3 on Outposts no longer
automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted lifecycle
configuration. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
`s3-outposts:PutLifecycleConfiguration` action. By default, the bucket owner
has this permission and the Outposts bucket owner can grant this permission to
others.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html#API_control_DeleteBucketLifecycleConfiguration_Examples) section.

For more information about object expiration, see [Elements to Describe Lifecycle Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions).

For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`.
