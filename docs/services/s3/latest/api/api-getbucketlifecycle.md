# GetBucketLifecycle

###### Important

For an updated version of this API, see [GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html). If you configured a bucket lifecycle using the
`filter` element, you should see the updated version of this topic. This topic is
provided for backward compatibility.

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Returns the lifecycle configuration information set on the bucket. For information about lifecycle
configuration, see [Object Lifecycle Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html).

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
`s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default. The
bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\
Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
