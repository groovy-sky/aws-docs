# DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration

###### Important

We recommend that you delete your S3 Metadata configurations by using the V2
[DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration.html) API operation. We no longer recommend using
the V1 `DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` API operation.

If you created your S3 Metadata configuration before July 15, 2025, we recommend that you delete
and re-create your configuration by using [CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration](api-createbucketmetadataconfiguration.md) so that you can expire journal table records and create
a live inventory table.

Deletes a V1 S3 Metadata configuration from a general purpose bucket. For more information, see
[Accelerating\
data discovery with S3 Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metadata-tables-overview.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

You can use the V2 `DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration` API operation with V1 or V2
metadata table configurations. However, if you try to use the V1
`DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` API operation with V2 configurations, you
will receive an HTTP `405 Method Not Allowed` error.

Make sure that you update your processes to use the new V2 API operations
( `CreateBucketMetadataConfiguration`, `GetBucketMetadataConfiguration`, and
`DeleteBucketMetadataConfiguration`) instead of the V1 API operations.

Permissions

To use this operation, you must have the
`s3:DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration` permission. For more information, see
[Setting up permissions for configuring metadata tables](../userguide/metadata-tables-permissions.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.
