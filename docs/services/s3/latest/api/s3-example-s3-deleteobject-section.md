CLI

**AWS CLI**

The following command deletes an object named `test.txt` from a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```nohighlight

aws s3api delete-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --key test.txt

```

If bucket versioning is enabled, the output will contain the version ID of the delete marker:

```nohighlight

{
  "VersionId": "9_gKg5vG56F.TTEUdwkxGpJ3tNDlWlGq",
  "DeleteMarker": true
}
```

Create a Lambda handler that removes a delete marker from an S3 object. This handler can be used to efficiently clean up extraneous delete markers in a versioned bucket.

```python

import logging
from urllib import parse
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel("INFO")

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    Removes a delete marker from the specified versioned object.

    :param event: The S3 batch event that contains the ID of the delete marker
                  to remove.
    :param context: Context about the event.
    :return: A result structure that Amazon S3 uses to interpret the result of the
             operation. When the result code is TemporaryFailure, S3 retries the
             operation.
