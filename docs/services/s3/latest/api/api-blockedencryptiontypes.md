# BlockedEncryptionTypes

A bucket-level setting for Amazon S3 general purpose buckets used to prevent the upload of new objects encrypted with the specified server-side encryption type. For example, blocking an encryption type will block `PutObject`, `CopyObject`, `PostObject`, multipart upload, and replication requests to the bucket for objects with the specified encryption type. However, you can continue to read and list any pre-existing objects already encrypted with the specified encryption type. For more information, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](../userguide/blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.md).

This data type is used with the following actions:

- [PutBucketEncryption](api-putbucketencryption.md)

- [GetBucketEncryption](api-getbucketencryption.md)

- [DeleteBucketEncryption](api-deletebucketencryption.md)

Permissions

You must have the `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` permission to block or unblock an encryption type for a bucket.

You must have the `s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration` permission to view a bucket's encryption type.

## Contents
