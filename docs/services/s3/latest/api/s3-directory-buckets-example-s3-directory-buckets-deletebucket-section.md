Delete an S3 directory bucket.

```java

    /**

     *
     * @param s3Client   The S3 client used to interact with S3
     * @param bucketName The name of the directory bucket to delete
     */
    public static void deleteDirectoryBucket(S3Client s3Client, String bucketName) {
        logger.info("Deleting bucket: {}", bucketName);

        try {
            // Create a DeleteBucketRequest
            DeleteBucketRequest deleteBucketRequest = DeleteBucketRequest.builder()
                    .bucket(bucketName)
                    .build();

            // Delete the bucket
            s3Client.deleteBucket(deleteBucketRequest);
            logger.info("Successfully deleted bucket: {}", bucketName);

        } catch (S3Exception e) {
            logger.error("Failed to delete bucket: {} - Error code: {}", e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage(),
                    e.awsErrorDetails().errorCode(), e);
