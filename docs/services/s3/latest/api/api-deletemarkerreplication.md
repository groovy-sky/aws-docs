# DeleteMarkerReplication

Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a `Filter` in your
replication configuration, you must also include a `DeleteMarkerReplication` element. If your
`Filter` includes a `Tag` element, the `DeleteMarkerReplication` `Status` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers
for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see [Basic Rule\
Configuration](../dev/replication-add-config.md#replication-config-min-rule-config).

For more information about delete marker replication, see [Basic Rule Configuration](../dev/delete-marker-replication.md).

###### Note

If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of
delete markers differently. For more information, see [Backward Compatibility](../dev/replication-add-config.md#replication-backward-compat-considerations).
