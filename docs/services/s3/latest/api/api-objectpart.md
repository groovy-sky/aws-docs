# ObjectPart

A container for elements related to an individual part.

## Contents

**ChecksumCRC32**

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the
multipart upload request was created with the `CRC32` checksum algorithm. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumCRC32C**

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32C` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the
multipart upload request was created with the `CRC32C` checksum algorithm. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumCRC64NVME**

The Base64 encoded, 64-bit `CRC64NVME` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if
the multipart upload request was created with the `CRC64NVME` checksum algorithm, or if the
object was uploaded without a checksum (and Amazon S3 added the default checksum, `CRC64NVME`, to
the uploaded object). For more information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumSHA1**

The Base64 encoded, 160-bit `SHA1` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the
multipart upload request was created with the `SHA1` checksum algorithm. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**ChecksumSHA256**

The Base64 encoded, 256-bit `SHA256` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if
the multipart upload request was created with the `SHA256` checksum algorithm. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](../userguide/checking-object-integrity.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: String

Required: No

**PartNumber**

The part number identifying the part. This value is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**Size**

The size of the uploaded part in bytes.

Type: Long

Required: No
