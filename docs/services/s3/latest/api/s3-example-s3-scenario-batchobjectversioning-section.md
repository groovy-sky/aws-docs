# Manage versioned Amazon S3 objects in batches with a Lambda function using an AWS SDK

The following code example shows how to manage versioned S3 objects in batches with a Lambda function.

Python

**SDK for Python (Boto3)**

Shows how to manipulate Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) versioned objects in batches by creating
jobs that call AWS Lambda functions to perform processing. This example creates
a version-enabled bucket, uploads the stanzas from the poem
_You Are Old, Father William_ by Lewis Carroll, and uses
Amazon S3 batch jobs to twist the poem in various ways.

###### Learn how to:

- Create Lambda functions that operate on versioned objects.

- Create a manifest of objects to update.

- Create batch jobs that invoke Lambda functions to update objects.

- Delete Lambda functions.

- Empty and delete a versioned bucket.
