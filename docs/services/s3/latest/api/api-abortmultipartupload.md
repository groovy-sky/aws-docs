# AbortMultipartUpload

This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts
can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be
freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not
succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to
completely free all storage consumed by all parts.

To verify that all parts have been removed and prevent getting charged for the part storage, you
should call the [ListParts](api-listparts.md) API operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.

###### Note

- **Directory buckets** \- If multipart uploads in a
directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart
uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads, use the
`ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the in-progress multipart uploads in the
bucket and use the `AbortMultipartUpload` operation to abort all the in-progress
multipart uploads.

- **Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
                 `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- For information
about permissions required to use the multipart upload, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use.
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md).

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `
                  Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

The following operations are related to `AbortMultipartUpload`:

- [CreateMultipartUpload](api-createmultipartupload.md)

- [UploadPart](api-uploadpart.md)

- [CompleteMultipartUpload](api-completemultipartupload.md)

- [ListParts](api-listparts.md)

- [ListMultipartUploads](api-listmultipartuploads.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

DELETE /Key+?uploadId=UploadId HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-request-payer: RequestPayer
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner
x-amz-if-match-initiated-time: IfMatchInitiatedTime

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_AbortMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

The bucket name to which the upload was taking place.

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `
                     Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming\
rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Required: Yes

**[Key](#API_AbortMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

Key of the object for which the multipart upload was initiated.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1.

Required: Yes

**[uploadId](#API_AbortMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

Upload ID that identifies the multipart upload.

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_AbortMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-if-match-initiated-time](#API_AbortMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

If present, this header aborts an in progress multipart upload only if it was initiated on the
provided timestamp. If the initiated timestamp of the multipart upload does not match the provided
value, the operation returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. If the initiated timestamp
matches or if the multipart upload doesn’t exist, the operation returns a `204 Success (No
        Content)` response.

###### Note

This functionality is only supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_AbortMultipartUpload_RequestSyntax)**

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about
downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays\
Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

```nohighlight

HTTP/1.1 204
x-amz-request-charged: RequestCharged

```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 204 response.

The response returns the following HTTP headers.

**[x-amz-request-charged](#API_AbortMultipartUpload_ResponseSyntax)**

If present, indicates that the requester was successfully charged for the request. For more
information, see [Using Requester Pays buckets for storage transfers and usage](../userguide/requesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon Simple_
_Storage Service user guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

## Errors

**NoSuchUpload**

The specified multipart upload does not exist.

HTTP Status Code: 404
