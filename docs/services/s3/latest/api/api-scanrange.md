# ScanRange

Specifies the byte range of the object to get the records from. A record is processed when its first
byte is contained by the range. This parameter is optional, but when specified, it must not be empty.
See RFC 2616, Section 14.35.1 about how to specify the start and end of the range.

## Contents

**End**

Specifies the end of the byte range. This parameter is optional. Valid values: non-negative
integers. The default value is one less than the size of the object being queried. If only the End
parameter is supplied, it is interpreted to mean scan the last N bytes of the file. For example,
`<scanrange><end>50</end></scanrange>` means scan the last 50
bytes.

Type: Long

Required: No

**Start**

Specifies the start of the byte range. This parameter is optional. Valid values: non-negative
integers. The default value is 0. If only `start` is supplied, it means scan from that point
to the end of the file. For example,
`<scanrange><start>50</start></scanrange>` means scan from byte 50
until the end of the file.

Type: Long

Required: No
