# DeleteBucketCors

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Deletes the `cors` configuration information set for the bucket.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:PutBucketCORS` action.
The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.

For information about `cors`, see [Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.
