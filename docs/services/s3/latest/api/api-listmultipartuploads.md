# ListMultipartUploads

This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart upload is a
multipart upload that has been initiated by the `CreateMultipartUpload` request, but has not
yet been completed or aborted.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- If multipart uploads in a
directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart
uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads, use the
`ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the in-progress multipart uploads in the bucket
and use the `AbortMultipartUpload` operation to abort all the in-progress multipart
uploads.

The `ListMultipartUploads` operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads in the
response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value. You can further limit the
number of uploads in a response by specifying the `max-uploads` request parameter. If there
are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that satisfy your `ListMultipartUploads` request, the
response returns an `IsTruncated` element with the value of `true`, a
`NextKeyMarker` element, and a `NextUploadIdMarker` element. To list the
remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent `ListMultipartUploads` requests. In
these requests, include two query parameters: `key-marker` and `upload-id-marker`.
Set the value of `key-marker` to the `NextKeyMarker` value from the previous
response. Similarly, set the value of `upload-id-marker` to the
`NextUploadIdMarker` value from the previous response.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- The `upload-id-marker`
element and the `NextUploadIdMarker` element aren't supported by directory buckets. To
list the additional multipart uploads, you only need to set the value of `key-marker` to
the `NextKeyMarker` value from the previous response.

For more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload](../dev/uploadobjusingmpu.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
         `. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- For information
about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](../dev/mpuandpermissions.md) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md) API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session token for use.
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](api-createsession.md).

Sorting of multipart uploads in response

- **General purpose bucket** \- In the
`ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads are sorted based on two
criteria:

- Key-based sorting - Multipart uploads are initially sorted in ascending order
based on their object keys.

- Time-based sorting - For uploads that share the same object key, they are
further sorted in ascending order based on the upload initiation time. Among uploads with
the same key, the one that was initiated first will appear before the ones that were
initiated later.

- **Directory bucket** \- In the
`ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads aren't sorted
lexicographically based on the object keys.

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is `
                  Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`.

The following operations are related to `ListMultipartUploads`:

- [CreateMultipartUpload](api-createmultipartupload.md)

- [UploadPart](api-uploadpart.md)

- [CompleteMultipartUpload](api-completemultipartupload.md)

- [ListParts](api-listparts.md)

- [AbortMultipartUpload](api-abortmultipartupload.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

GET /?uploads&delimiter=Delimiter&encoding-type=EncodingType&key-marker=KeyMarker&max-uploads=MaxUploads&prefix=Prefix&upload-id-marker=UploadIdMarker HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner
x-amz-request-payer: RequestPayer

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

**Directory buckets** \- When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format `
                     Bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com`. Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket names must follow the format `
                     bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3` (for example, `
                     amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3`). For information about bucket naming
restrictions, see [Directory bucket naming\
rules](../userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

**Access points** \- When you use this action with an access point for general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form _AccessPointName_- _AccountId_.s3-accesspoint. _Region_.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the AWS SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see [Using access points](../userguide/using-access-points.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

**S3 on Outposts** \- When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the
form `
                     AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com`. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For more information about S3 on Outposts, see [What is S3 on Outposts?](../userguide/s3onoutposts.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Required: Yes

**[delimiter](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

Character you use to group keys.

All keys that contain the same string between the prefix, if specified, and the first occurrence of
the delimiter after the prefix are grouped under a single result element, `CommonPrefixes`.
If you don't specify the prefix parameter, then the substring starts at the beginning of the key. The
keys that are grouped under `CommonPrefixes` result element are not returned elsewhere in the
response.

`CommonPrefixes` is filtered out from results if it is not lexicographically greater than
the key-marker.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, `/` is the only supported delimiter.

**[encoding-type](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the [object keys](../userguide/object-keys.md) in the response. Responses are
encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser
can't parse certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that
aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the
response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see [Object key\
naming guidelines](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-guidelines).

###### Note

When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will
be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object
`test_file(3).png` will appear as `test_file%283%29.png`.

Valid Values: `url`

**[key-marker](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin.

###### Note

- **General purpose buckets** \- For general purpose buckets,
`key-marker` is an object key. Together with `upload-id-marker`, this
parameter specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin.

If `upload-id-marker` is not specified, only the keys lexicographically greater
than the specified `key-marker` will be included in the list.

If `upload-id-marker` is specified, any multipart uploads for a key equal to the
`key-marker` might also be included, provided those multipart uploads have upload IDs
lexicographically greater than the specified `upload-id-marker`.

- **Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets,
`key-marker` is obfuscated and isn't a real object key. The
`upload-id-marker` parameter isn't supported by directory buckets. To list the
additional multipart uploads, you only need to set the value of `key-marker` to the
`NextKeyMarker` value from the previous response.

In the `ListMultipartUploads` response, the multipart uploads aren't sorted
lexicographically based on the object keys.

**[max-uploads](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

Sets the maximum number of multipart uploads, from 1 to 1,000, to return in the response body. 1,000
is the maximum number of uploads that can be returned in a response.

**[prefix](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

Lists in-progress uploads only for those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use
prefixes to separate a bucket into different grouping of keys. (You can think of using
`prefix` to make groups in the same way that you'd use a folder in a file system.)

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, only prefixes that end in a delimiter ( `/`) are supported.

**[upload-id-marker](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

Together with key-marker, specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin. If
key-marker is not specified, the upload-id-marker parameter is ignored. Otherwise, any multipart uploads
for a key equal to the key-marker might be included in the list only if they have an upload ID
lexicographically greater than the specified `upload-id-marker`.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-request-payer](#API_ListMultipartUploads_RequestSyntax)**

Confirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not
specify this parameter in their requests. If either the source or destination S3 bucket has Requester
Pays enabled, the requester will pay for the corresponding charges. For information about
downloading objects from Requester Pays buckets, see [Downloading Objects in Requester Pays\
Buckets](../dev/objectsinrequesterpaysbuckets.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

Valid Values: `requester`

## Examples

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets

The following request lists three multipart uploads. The request specifies the
`max-uploads` request parameter to set the maximum number of multipart uploads to
return in the response body.

```

GET /?uploads&max-uploads=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: example-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:34:56 GMT
Authorization: authorization string

```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets

The following sample response indicates that the multipart upload list was truncated and
provides the `NextKeyMarker` and the `NextUploadIdMarker` elements. You
specify these values in your subsequent requests to read the next set of multipart uploads. That is,
send a subsequent request specifying `key-marker=my-movie2.m2ts` (value of the
`NextKeyMarker` element) and
`upload-id-marker=YW55IGlkZWEgd2h5IGVsdmluZydzIHVwbG9hZCBmYWlsZWQ` (value of the
`NextUploadIdMarker`).

The sample response also shows a case of two multipart uploads in progress with the same key
( `my-movie.m2ts`). That is, the response shows two uploads with the same key. This
response shows the uploads sorted by key, and within each key the uploads are sorted in ascending
order by the time the multipart upload was initiated.

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets: Using the delimiter and the prefix parameters

Assume you have a multipart upload in progress for the following keys in your bucket,
`example-bucket`.

- photos/2006/January/sample.jpg

- photos/2006/February/sample.jpg

- photos/2006/March/sample.jpg

- videos/2006/March/sample.wmv

- sample.jpg

The following list multipart upload request specifies the delimiter parameter with value
"/".

```

GET /?uploads&delimiter=/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:34:56 GMT
Authorization: authorization string

```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets

The following sample response lists multipart uploads on the specified bucket,
`example-bucket`.

The response returns multipart upload for the `sample.jpg` key in an
`<Upload>` element.

However, because all the other keys contain the specified delimiter, a distinct substring, from
the beginning of the key to the first occurrence of the delimiter, from each of these keys is
returned in a <CommonPrefixes> element. The key substrings, `photos/` and
`videos/` in the <CommonPrefixes> element, indicate that there are one or more
in-progress multipart uploads with these key prefixes.

This is a useful scenario if you use key prefixes for your objects to create a logical folder
like structure. In this case, you can interpret the result as the folders `photos/` and
`videos/` have one or more multipart uploads in progress.

```

```

### Sample Request for general purpose buckets

In addition to the delimiter parameter, you can filter results by adding a prefix parameter as
shown in the following request.

```

GET /?uploads&delimiter=/&prefix=photos/2006/ HTTP/1.1
Host: example-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 1 Nov 2010 20:34:56 GMT
Authorization: authorization string

```

### Sample Response for general purpose buckets

In this case, the response will include only multipart uploads for keys that start with the
specified prefix. The value returned in the <CommonPrefixes> element is a substring from the
beginning of the key to the first occurrence of the specified delimiter after the prefix.

```
