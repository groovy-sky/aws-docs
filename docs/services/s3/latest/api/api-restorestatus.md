# RestoreStatus

Specifies the restoration status of an object. Objects in certain storage classes must be restored
before they can be retrieved. For more information about these storage classes and how to work with
archived objects, see [Working with archived objects](../userguide/archived-objects.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets only support `EXPRESS_ONEZONE` (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and `ONEZONE_IA` (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

## Contents

**IsRestoreInProgress**

Specifies whether the object is currently being restored. If the object restoration is in progress,
the header returns the value `TRUE`. For example:

`x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="true"`

If the object restoration has completed, the header returns the value `FALSE`. For
example:

`x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="false",
        RestoreExpiryDate="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"`

If the object hasn't been restored, there is no header response.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**RestoreExpiryDate**

Indicates when the restored copy will expire. This value is populated only if the object has already
been restored. For example:

`x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="false",
        RestoreExpiryDate="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"`

Type: Timestamp

Required: No
