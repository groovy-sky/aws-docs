# Use `HeadBucket` with an AWS SDK or CLI

The following code examples show how to use `HeadBucket`.

Bash

**AWS CLI with Bash script**

###### Note

There's more on GitHub. Find the complete example and learn how to set up and run in the
[AWS Code\
Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/aws-cli/bash-linux/s3).

```bash

###############################################################################
# function bucket_exists
#
# This function checks to see if the specified bucket already exists.
#
# Parameters:
#       $1 - The name of the bucket to check.
#
# Returns:
#       0 - If the bucket already exists.
#       1 - If the bucket doesn't exist.
###############################################################################
function bucket_exists() {
  local bucket_name
  bucket_name=$1

  # Check whether the bucket already exists.
  # We suppress all output - we're interested only in the return code.

  if aws s3api head-bucket \
    --bucket "$bucket_name" \
    >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    return 0 # 0 in Bash script means true.
  else
    return 1 # 1 in Bash script means false.
  fi
}

```

CLI

**AWS CLI**

The following command verifies access to a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```nohighlight

aws s3api head-bucket --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket

```

If the bucket exists and you have access to it, no output is returned. Otherwise, an error message will be shown. For example:

```nohighlight

A client error (404) occurred when calling the HeadBucket operation: Not Found
```

[HeadBucket](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/head-bucket.html)
in _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

PowerShell

**Tools for PowerShell V5**

**Example 1: This command returns the output with HTTP status code 200 OK for existing bucket when user has permission to access it. BucketArn parameter is only supported for S3 directory buckets.**

```powershell

Get-S3HeadBucket -BucketName amzn-s3-demo-bucket

```

**Output:**

```nohighlight

AccessPointAlias   : False
BucketArn          :
BucketLocationName :
BucketLocationType :
BucketRegion       : us-east-2
ResponseMetadata   : Amazon.Runtime.ResponseMetadata
ContentLength      : 0
HttpStatusCode     : OK
```

**Example 2: This command throws error with HTTP status code NotFound for non-existent bucket.**

```powershell

Get-S3HeadBucket -BucketName amzn-s3-non-existing-bucket

```

**Output:**

```nohighlight

Get-S3HeadBucket: Error making request with Error Code NotFound and Http Status Code NotFound. No further error information was returned by the service.
```

**Example 3: This command throws error with HTTP status code Forbidden for existing bucket where user does not have permission to access it.**

```powershell

Get-S3HeadBucket -BucketName amzn-s3-no-access-bucket

```

**Output:**

```nohighlight

Get-S3HeadBucket: Error making request with Error Code Forbidden and Http Status Code Forbidden. No further error information was returned by the service.
```
