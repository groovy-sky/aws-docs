# DeleteBucketReplication

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Deletes the replication configuration from the bucket.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
`s3:PutReplicationConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has these permissions by default
and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\
Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

###### Note

It can take a while for the deletion of a replication configuration to fully propagate.

For information about replication configuration, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

bucket. This removes the replication configuration that is set for the bucket.

```

           DELETE /?replication HTTP/1.1
           Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com

```

### Sample Response

When the `replication` subresource has been deleted, Amazon S3 returns a `204 No
            Content` response. It will not replicate new objects that are stored in the
`examplebucket` bucket.
