# DeleteBucketReplication

###### Note

This operation deletes an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket's replication configuration. To
delete an S3 bucket's replication configuration, see [DeleteBucketReplication](api-deletebucketreplication.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Deletes the replication configuration from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
`s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration` action. The Outposts bucket owner
has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about
permissions, see [Setting up IAM with\
S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsIAM.html) and [Managing access to\
S3 on Outposts buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsBucketPolicy.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

It can take a while to propagate `PUT` or `DELETE` requests for
a replication configuration to all S3 on Outposts systems. Therefore, the replication
configuration that's returned by a `GET` request soon after a
`PUT` or `DELETE` request might return a more recent result
than what's on the Outpost. If an Outpost is offline, the delay in updating the
replication configuration on that Outpost can be significant.

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteBucketReplication.html#API_control_DeleteBucketReplication_Examples) section.

For information about S3 replication on Outposts configuration, see [Replicating objects for S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

The following operations are related to `DeleteBucketReplication`:

- [PutBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketReplication.html)

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

DELETE /v20180820/bucket/name/replication HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3-control.amazonaws.com
x-amz-account-id: AccountId

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[name](#API_control_DeleteBucketReplication_RequestSyntax)**

Specifies the S3 on Outposts bucket to delete the replication configuration for.

For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well.

For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the AWS SDK and CLI, you must specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format `arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/bucket/<my-bucket-name>`. For example, to access the bucket `reports` through Outpost `my-outpost` owned by account `123456789012` in Region `us-west-2`, use the URL encoding of `arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports`. The value must be URL encoded.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 255.

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-account-id](#API_control_DeleteBucketReplication_RequestSyntax)**

The AWS account ID of the Outposts bucket to delete the replication configuration
for.

Length Constraints: Maximum length of 64.

Pattern: `^\d{12}$`

Required: Yes

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

```

HTTP/1.1 200

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.

## Examples

### Sample Request

The following `DELETE` request deletes the `replication`
subresource from the specified S3 on Outposts bucket. This request removes the
replication configuration that is set for the bucket.

```HTTP

DELETE /v20180820/bucket/example-outpost-bucket/replication HTTP/1.1
Host: s3-outposts.<Region>.amazonaws.com
x-amz-outpost-id: op-01ac5d28a6a232904
x-amz-account-id:example-account-id

```
