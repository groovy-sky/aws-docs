```csharp

        /// <summary>
        /// Deletes a CORS configuration from an Amazon S3 bucket.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="client">The initialized Amazon S3 client object used
        /// to delete the CORS configuration from the bucket.</param>
        private static async Task DeleteCORSConfigurationAsync(AmazonS3Client client)
        {
            DeleteCORSConfigurationRequest request = new DeleteCORSConfigurationRequest()
            {
                BucketName = BucketName,
            };
            await client.DeleteCORSConfigurationAsync(request);
