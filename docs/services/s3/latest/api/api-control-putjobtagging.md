# PutJobTagging

Sets the supplied tag-set on an S3 Batch Operations job.

A tag is a key-value pair. You can associate S3 Batch Operations tags with any job by sending
a PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associated with the job. To modify
the existing tag set, you can either replace the existing tag set entirely, or make changes
within the existing tag set by retrieving the existing tag set using [GetJobTagging](api-control-getjobtagging.md), modify that tag set, and use this operation to replace the tag set
with the one you modified. For more information, see [Controlling\
access and labeling jobs using tags](../dev/batch-ops-managing-jobs.md#batch-ops-job-tags) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

- If you send this request with an empty tag set, Amazon S3 deletes the existing
tag set on the Batch Operations job. If you use this method, you are charged for a Tier
1 Request (PUT). For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

- For deleting existing tags for your Batch Operations job, a [DeleteJobTagging](api-control-deletejobtagging.md) request is preferred because it achieves the same
result without incurring charges.

- A few things to consider about using tags:

- Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to 50 tags per job.

- You can associate up to 50 tags with a job as long as they have unique
tag keys.

- A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in length, and tag values
can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length.

- The key and values are case sensitive.

- For tagging-related restrictions related to characters and encodings, see
[User-Defined Tag Restrictions](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.md) in the _AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide_.
