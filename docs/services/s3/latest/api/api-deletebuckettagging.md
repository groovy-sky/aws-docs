# DeleteBucketTagging

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Deletes tags from the general purpose bucket if attribute based access control (ABAC) is not enabled for the bucket. When you [enable ABAC for a general purpose bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/buckets-tagging-enable-abac.html), you can no longer use this operation for that bucket and must use [UntagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_UntagResource.html) instead.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the `s3:PutBucketTagging`
action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant this permission to others.

The following operations are related to `DeleteBucketTagging`:

- [GetBucketTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketTagging.html)

- [PutBucketTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketTagging.html)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
