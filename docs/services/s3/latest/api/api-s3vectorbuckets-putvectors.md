# PutVectors

Adds one or more vectors to a vector index. To specify the vector index, you can either
use both the vector bucket name and the vector index name, or use the vector index Amazon
Resource Name (ARN).

For more information about limits, see [Limitations and\
restrictions](../userguide/s3-vectors-limitations.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

###### Note

When inserting vector data into your vector index, you must provide the vector data
as `float32` (32-bit floating point) values. If you pass higher-precision
values to an AWS SDK, S3 Vectors converts the values to 32-bit floating point before
storing them, and `GetVectors`, `ListVectors`, and
`QueryVectors` operations return the float32 values. Different AWS SDKs
may have different default numeric types, so ensure your vectors are properly formatted
as `float32` values regardless of which SDK you're using. For example, in
Python, use `numpy.float32` or explicitly cast your values.

Permissions

You must have the `s3vectors:PutVectors` permission to use this
operation.

## URI Request Parameters

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

**[indexArn](#API_S3VectorBuckets_PutVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The ARN of the vector index where you want to write vectors.

Type: String

Pattern: `arn:aws[-a-z0-9]*:s3vectors:[a-z0-9-]+:[0-9]{12}:bucket/[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-.]{1,61}[a-z0-9]/index/[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-.]{1,61}[a-z0-9]`

Required: No

**[indexName](#API_S3VectorBuckets_PutVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the vector index where you want to write vectors.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 63.

Required: No

**[vectorBucketName](#API_S3VectorBuckets_PutVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the vector bucket that contains the vector index.

Type: String

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 3. Maximum length of 63.

Required: No

**[vectors](#API_S3VectorBuckets_PutVectors_RequestSyntax)**

The vectors to add to a vector index. The number of vectors in a single request must not
exceed the resource capacity, otherwise the request will be rejected with the error
`ServiceUnavailableException` with the error message "Currently unable to
handle the request".

Type: Array of [PutInputVector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_S3VectorBuckets_PutInputVector.html) objects

Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 500 items.

Required: Yes

## Response Syntax

```

HTTP/1.1 200

```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body.

## Errors

**AccessDeniedException**

Access denied.

HTTP Status Code: 403

**InternalServerException**

The request failed due to an internal server error.

HTTP Status Code: 500

**KmsDisabledException**

The specified AWS KMS key isn't enabled.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**KmsInvalidKeyUsageException**

The request was rejected for one of the following reasons:

- The `KeyUsage` value of the KMS key is incompatible with the API
operation.

- The encryption algorithm or signing algorithm specified for the operation is
incompatible with the type of key material in the KMS key
( `KeySpec`).

For more information, see [InvalidKeyUsageException](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html#API_Encrypt_Errors) in the _AWS Key Management Service API_
_Reference_.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**KmsInvalidStateException**

The key state of the KMS key isn't compatible with the operation.

For more information, see [KMSInvalidStateException](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html#API_Encrypt_Errors) in the _AWS Key Management Service API_
_Reference_.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**KmsNotFoundException**

The KMS key can't be found.

HTTP Status Code: 400

**NotFoundException**

The request was rejected because the specified resource can't be found.

HTTP Status Code: 404

**RequestTimeoutException**

The request timed out. Retry your request.

HTTP Status Code: 408

**ServiceQuotaExceededException**

Your request exceeds a service quota.

HTTP Status Code: 402

**ServiceUnavailableException**

The service is unavailable. Wait briefly and retry your request. If it continues to
fail, increase your waiting time between retries.

HTTP Status Code: 503

**TooManyRequestsException**

The request was denied due to request throttling.

HTTP Status Code: 429

**ValidationException**

The requested action isn't valid.

**fieldList**

A list of specific validation failures that are encountered during input processing. Each entry
in the list contains a path to the field that failed validation and a detailed message that
explains why the validation failed. To satisfy multiple constraints, a field can appear multiple times in this list if it
failed. You can use the information to identify and fix
the specific validation issues in your request.

HTTP Status Code: 400
