# DeleteBucketLifecycle

Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon S3 removes all the lifecycle
configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire,
and Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of rules contained in the deleted
lifecycle configuration.

Permissions

- **General purpose bucket permissions** \- By default, all Amazon S3
resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example,
lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the
AWS account that created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally
grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user
must have the `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permission.

For more information about permissions, see [Managing Access Permissions to Your\
Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

- **Directory bucket permissions** \- You must have the
`s3express:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permission in an IAM identity-based policy
to use this operation. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. The
resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by creating a role or user
for them as long as they are within the same account as the owner and resource.

For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see [Authorizing Regional endpoint APIs with IAM](../userguide/s3-express-security-iam.md) in the _Amazon S3 User_
_Guide_.

###### Note

**Directory buckets** \- For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format `https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
                          `. Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported.
For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](../userguide/endpoint-directory-buckets-az.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](../userguide/s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

HTTP Host header syntax

**Directory buckets** \- The HTTP Host header syntax is
`s3express-control.region.amazonaws.com`.

For more information about the object expiration, see [Elements to\
Describe Lifecycle Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions).

Related actions include:

- [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](api-putbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md)

- [GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

DELETE /?lifecycle HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner

```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_DeleteBucketLifecycle_RequestSyntax)**

The bucket name of the lifecycle to delete.

Required: Yes

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_DeleteBucketLifecycle_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

###### Note

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not supported for directory bucket
lifecycle configurations.

## Request Body

The request does not have a request body.

## Response Syntax

```

HTTP/1.1 204

```

## Response Elements

If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 204 response with an empty HTTP body.

## Examples

### Sample Request

The following DELETE request deletes the lifecycle subresource from the specified general
purpose bucket. This removes lifecycle configuration stored in the subresource.

```

            DELETE /?lifecycle HTTP/1.1
            Host: amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.<Region>.amazonaws.com
            Date: Wed, 14 Dec 2011 05:37:16 GMT
            Authorization: signatureValue

```

### Sample Response

The following successful response shows Amazon S3 returning a 204 No Content response. Objects in
your general purpose bucket no longer expire.

```

            HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
            x-amz-id-2: Uuag1LuByRx9e6j5OnimrSAMPLEtRPfTaOAa==
            x-amz-request-id: 656c76696e672SAMPLE5657374
            Date: Wed, 14 Dec 2011 05:37:16 GMT
            Connection: keep-alive
            Server: AmazonS3

```
