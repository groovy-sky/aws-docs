# ReplicationRule

Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.

## Contents

**Destination**

A container for information about the replication destination and its configurations including
enabling the S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

Type: [Destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Destination.html) data type

Required: Yes

**Status**

Specifies whether the rule is enabled.

Type: String

Valid Values: `Enabled | Disabled`

Required: Yes

**DeleteMarkerReplication**

Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a `Filter` in your
replication configuration, you must also include a `DeleteMarkerReplication` element. If your
`Filter` includes a `Tag` element, the `DeleteMarkerReplication` `Status` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers
for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see [Basic Rule\
Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config).

For more information about delete marker replication, see [Basic Rule Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/delete-marker-replication.html).

###### Note

If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of
delete markers differently. For more information, see [Backward Compatibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations).

Type: [DeleteMarkerReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteMarkerReplication.html) data type

Required: No

**ExistingObjectReplication**

Optional configuration to replicate existing source bucket objects.

###### Note

This parameter is no longer supported. To replicate existing objects, see [Replicating\
existing objects with S3 Batch Replication](../userguide/s3-batch-replication-batch.md) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: [ExistingObjectReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ExistingObjectReplication.html) data type

Required: No

**Filter**

A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule applies. A
`Filter` must specify exactly one `Prefix`, `Tag`, or an
`And` child element.

Type: [ReplicationRuleFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ReplicationRuleFilter.html) data type

Required: No

**ID**

A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.

Type: String

Required: No

**Prefix**

_This member has been deprecated._

An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The
maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string.

###### Important

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using
XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](../userguide/object-keys.md#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

Type: String

Required: No

**Priority**

The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict.
Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or
more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with
the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

For more information, see [Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: Integer

Required: No

**SourceSelectionCriteria**

A container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects that you want to
replicate. You can choose to enable or disable the replication of these objects. Currently, Amazon S3
supports only the filter that you can specify for objects created with server-side encryption using a
customer managed key stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).

Type: [SourceSelectionCriteria](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_SourceSelectionCriteria.html) data type

Required: No
