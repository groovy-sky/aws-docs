# PutBucketPolicy

###### Note

This action puts a bucket policy to an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To put a policy on an
S3 bucket, see [PutBucketPolicy](api-putbucketpolicy.md) in the
_Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Outposts bucket. For more information, see [Using\
Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the
Outposts bucket, the calling identity must have the `PutBucketPolicy`
permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account in
order to use this action.

If you don't have `PutBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403
            Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an
identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405 Method Not
            Allowed` error.

###### Important

As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can
always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability
to perform this action.

For more information about bucket policies, see [Using Bucket Policies and User\
Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html).

All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of `x-amz-outpost-id` to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of `s3-control`. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the `x-amz-outpost-id` derived by using the access point ARN, see the [Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_PutBucketPolicy.html#API_control_PutBucketPolicy_Examples) section.
