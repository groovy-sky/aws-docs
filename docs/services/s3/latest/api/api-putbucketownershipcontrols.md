## Request Syntax

```nohighlight

PUT /?ownershipControls HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Content-MD5: ContentMD5
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner
x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm: ChecksumAlgorithm
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<OwnershipControls xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
   <Rule>
      <ObjectOwnership>string</ObjectOwnership>
   </Rule>
   ...
</OwnershipControls>
```

## URI Request Parameters

The request uses the following URI parameters.

**[Bucket](#API_PutBucketOwnershipControls_RequestSyntax)**

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket whose `OwnershipControls` you want to set.

Required: Yes

**[Content-MD5](#API_PutBucketOwnershipControls_RequestSyntax)**

The MD5 hash of the `OwnershipControls` request body.

For requests made using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or AWS SDKs, this field is calculated automatically.

**[x-amz-expected-bucket-owner](#API_PutBucketOwnershipControls_RequestSyntax)**

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code `403 Forbidden` (access denied).

**[x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm](#API_PutBucketOwnershipControls_RequestSyntax)**

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when you use the SDK. This
header will not provide any additional functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this
header, there must be a corresponding `x-amz-checksum-algorithm
                  ` header
sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code `400 Bad Request`. For more
information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in
the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided `ChecksumAlgorithm`
parameter.

Valid Values: `CRC32 | CRC32C | SHA1 | SHA256 | CRC64NVME`

## Request Body

The request accepts the following data in XML format.

**[OwnershipControls](#API_PutBucketOwnershipControls_RequestSyntax)**

Root level tag for the OwnershipControls parameters.

Required: Yes

**[Rule](#API_PutBucketOwnershipControls_RequestSyntax)**

The container element for an ownership control rule.

Type: Array of [OwnershipControlsRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_OwnershipControlsRule.html) data types

Required: Yes

## Response Syntax
