# SourceSelectionCriteria

A container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects that
you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or disable the replication of these
objects.

## Contents

**ReplicaModifications**

A filter that you can use to specify whether replica modification sync is enabled.
S3 on Outposts replica modification sync can help you keep object metadata synchronized
between replicas and source objects. By default, S3 on Outposts replicates metadata from the
source objects to the replicas only. When replica modification sync is enabled,
S3 on Outposts replicates metadata changes made to the replica copies back to the source
object, making the replication bidirectional.

To replicate object metadata modifications on replicas, you can specify this element and
set the `Status` of this element to `Enabled`.

###### Note

You must enable replica modification sync on the source and destination buckets to
replicate replica metadata changes between the source and the replicas.

Type: [ReplicaModifications](api-control-replicamodifications.md) data type

Required: No

**SseKmsEncryptedObjects**

A filter that you can use to select Amazon S3 objects that are encrypted with server-side
encryption by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys. If you include
`SourceSelectionCriteria` in the replication configuration, this element is
required.

###### Note

This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.

Type: [SseKmsEncryptedObjects](api-control-ssekmsencryptedobjects.md) data type

Required: No
