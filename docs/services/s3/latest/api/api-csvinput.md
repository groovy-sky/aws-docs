# CSVInput

Describes how an uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV)-formatted input object is
formatted.

## Contents

**AllowQuotedRecordDelimiter**

Specifies that CSV field values may contain quoted record delimiters and such records should be
allowed. Default value is FALSE. Setting this value to TRUE may lower performance.

Type: Boolean

Required: No

**Comments**

A single character used to indicate that a row should be ignored when the character is present at
the start of that row. You can specify any character to indicate a comment line. The default character
is `#`.

Default: `#`

Type: String

Required: No

**FieldDelimiter**

A single character used to separate individual fields in a record. You can specify an arbitrary
delimiter.

Type: String

Required: No

**FileHeaderInfo**

Describes the first line of input. Valid values are:

- `NONE`: First line is not a header.

- `IGNORE`: First line is a header, but you can't use the header values to indicate the
column in an expression. You can use column position (such as \_1, \_2, …) to indicate the column
( `SELECT s._1 FROM OBJECT s`).

- `Use`: First line is a header, and you can use the header value to identify a column
in an expression ( `SELECT "name" FROM OBJECT`).

Type: String

Valid Values: `USE | IGNORE | NONE`

Required: No

**QuoteCharacter**

A single character used for escaping when the field delimiter is part of the value. For example, if
the value is `a, b`, Amazon S3 wraps this field value in quotation marks, as follows: `" a ,
        b "`.

Type: String

Default: `"`

Ancestors: `CSV`

Type: String

Required: No

**QuoteEscapeCharacter**

A single character used for escaping the quotation mark character inside an already escaped value.
For example, the value `""" a , b """` is parsed as `" a , b "`.

Type: String

Required: No

**RecordDelimiter**

A single character used to separate individual records in the input. Instead of the default value,
you can specify an arbitrary delimiter.

Type: String

Required: No
