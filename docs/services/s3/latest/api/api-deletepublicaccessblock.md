# DeletePublicAccessBlock

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Removes the `PublicAccessBlock` configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. This
operation removes the bucket-level configuration only. The effective public access behavior
will still be governed by account-level settings (which may inherit from organization-level
policies). To use this operation, you must have the `s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock`
permission. For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources) and [Managing Access\
Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).
