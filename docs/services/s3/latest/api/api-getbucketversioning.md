# GetBucketVersioning

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Returns the versioning state of a bucket.

To retrieve the versioning state of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

This implementation also returns the MFA Delete status of the versioning state. If the MFA Delete
status is `enabled`, the bucket owner must use an authentication device to change the
versioning state of the bucket.

The following operations are related to `GetBucketVersioning`:

- [GetObject](api-getobject.md)

- [PutObject](api-putobject.md)

- [DeleteObject](api-deleteobject.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.

### Example

This example returns the versioning state of `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

```

         GET /?versioning HTTP/1.1

     <VersioningConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
        <Status>Enabled</Status>
     </VersioningConfiguration>

     <VersioningConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
        <Status>Suspended</Status>
     </VersioningConfiguration>

```

### Example
