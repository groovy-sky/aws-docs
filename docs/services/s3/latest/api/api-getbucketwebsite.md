# GetBucketWebsite

###### Note

This operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Returns the website configuration for a bucket. To host website on Amazon S3, you can configure a bucket
as website by adding a website configuration. For more information about hosting websites, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

This GET action requires the `S3:GetBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only the
bucket owner can read the bucket website configuration. However, bucket owners can allow other users to
read the website configuration by writing a bucket policy granting them the
`S3:GetBucketWebsite` permission.

The following operations are related to `GetBucketWebsite`:

- [DeleteBucketWebsite](api-deletebucketwebsite.md)

- [PutBucketWebsite](api-putbucketwebsite.md)

###### Important

You must URL encode any signed header values that contain spaces. For example, if your header value is `my  file.txt`, containing two spaces after `my`, you must URL encode this value to `my%20%20file.txt`.
