# DeleteMarkerReplication

Specifies whether S3 on Outposts replicates delete markers. If you specify a
`Filter` element in your replication configuration, you must also include a
`DeleteMarkerReplication` element. If your `Filter` includes a
`Tag` element, the `DeleteMarkerReplication` element's
`Status` child element must be set to `Disabled`, because
S3 on Outposts does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules.

For more information about delete marker replication, see [How delete operations affect replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html#outposts-replication-what-is-replicated) in the
_Amazon S3 User Guide_.
