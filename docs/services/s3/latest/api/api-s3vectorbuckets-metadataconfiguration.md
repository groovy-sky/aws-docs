# MetadataConfiguration

The metadata configuration for a vector index.

## Contents

**nonFilterableMetadataKeys**

Non-filterable metadata keys allow you to enrich vectors with additional context during
storage and retrieval. Unlike default metadata keys, these keys can’t be used as query
filters. Non-filterable metadata keys can be retrieved but can’t be searched, queried, or
filtered. You can access non-filterable metadata keys of your vectors after finding the
vectors. For more information about non-filterable metadata keys, see [Vectors](../userguide/s3-vectors-vectors.md) and [Limitations and\
restrictions](../userguide/s3-vectors-limitations.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

Type: Array of strings
