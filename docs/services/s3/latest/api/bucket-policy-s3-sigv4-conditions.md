# Amazon S3 Signature Version 4 Authentication Specific Policy Keys

The following table shows the policy keys related Amazon S3 Signature Version 4
authentication that can be in Amazon S3 policies. In a bucket policy, you can add these
conditions to enforce specific behavior when requests are authenticated by using
Signature Version 4. For example policies, see [Bucket policy examples using Signature Version 4 related condition keys](#bucket-policy-sig-v4-condition-key-example).

Applicable KeysDescription

`s3:signatureversion`

Identifies the version of AWS Signature that you want to
support for authenticated requests. For authenticated requests, Amazon S3
supports both Signature Version 4 and Signature Version 2. You can
add this condition in your bucket policy to require a specific
signature version.

Valid values:

`"AWS"` identifies Signature Version 2

`"AWS4-HMAC-SHA256"` identifies Signature Version
4

`s3:authType`

Amazon S3 supports various methods of authentication (see [Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)](sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md). You can
optionally use this condition key to restrict incoming requests to
use a specific authentication method. For example, you can allow
only the HTTP `Authorization` header to be used in
request authentication.

Valid values:

`REST-HEADER`

`REST-QUERY-STRING`

`POST`

`s3:signatureAge`

The length of time, in milliseconds, that a signature is valid
in an authenticated request.

This
condition works for:

- _Presigned URLs_ — where the most restrictive condition wins. For more information, see [Working with presigned URLs](../userguide/using-presigned-url.md).

- _Presigned POST_ — upload files directly to S3 using pre-signed POST. For more information, see [Amazon S3 POST Policy](sigv4-httppostconstructpolicy.md).

In Signature Version 2, this value is always set to 0.

In Signature Version 4, the signing key is valid for up to seven
days. Therefore, the signatures are also valid for up to seven
days. You can use this condition to further limit the signature age.
For more information, see [Introduction to Signing Requests](sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md#signing-request-intro).

Example value: `100`

`s3:x-amz-content-sha256`

You can use this condition key to disallow unsigned content in
your bucket.

When you use Signature Version 4, for requests that use the
`Authorization` header, you add the
`x-amz-content-sha256` header in the signature
calculation and then set its value to the hash payload. Note that
this condition key doesn't support the
`x-amz-content-sha256` header as a query string
parameter.

You can use this condition key in your bucket policy to deny any
uploads where payloads are not signed. For example, you can deny
uploads that use the `Authorization` header to
authenticate requests but don't sign the payload. For more
information, see [Signature Calculations for the Authorization Header: Transferring Payload in a Single Chunk (AWS Signature Version 4)](sig-v4-header-based-auth.md).

Valid value: `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`

## Bucket policy examples using Signature Version 4 related condition keys

The following bucket policy denies any Amazon S3 presigned URL request on objects in
`examplebucket` if the signature is more than ten minutes old.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Sid": "Deny a presigned URL request if the signature is more than 10 min old",
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:*",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket3/*",
         "Condition": {
            "NumericGreaterThan": {
               "s3:signatureAge": 600000
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}

```

The following bucket policy allows only requests that use the `Authorization` header
for request authentication. Any POST or presigned URL requests will be
denied.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
         {
               "Sid": "Allow only requests that use Authorization header for request authentication. Deny POST or presigned URL requests.",
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:*",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket3/*",
               "Condition": {
                     "StringNotEquals": {
                           "s3:authType": "REST-HEADER"
                     }
               }
         }
   ]
}

```

The following bucket policy denies requests that use presigned URLS for request authentication:

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Sid":"DenyUploadsUsingPresignedURL",
         "Effect":"Deny",
         "Principal":"*",
         "Action":"s3:*",
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*",
         "Condition":{
            "StringEquals":{
               "s3:authType":"REST-query-string"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}

```

The following bucket policy denies any uploads with unsigned payloads:

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
         {
               "Sid": "Deny uploads with unsigned payloads that use the Authorization header.",

               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:*",
