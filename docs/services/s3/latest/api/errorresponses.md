# Error responses

This section provides reference information about Amazon S3 errors.

###### Note

- In general, S3 bucket owners are billed for requests with
HTTP `200 OK` successful responses and HTTP `4XX` client error responses. Bucket owners aren't billed for HTTP `5XX` server error responses, such as HTTP `503 Slow Down` errors.
For more information on S3 error codes under HTTP `3XX` and `4XX` status codes that aren't billed, see [Billing for Amazon S3 error responses](../userguide/errorcodebilling.md) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about billing charges if your bucket is configured as a Requester Pays bucket, see [How Requester Pays charges work](../userguide/requesterpaysbuckets.md#ChargeDetails) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

- SOAP support over HTTP is deprecated, but SOAP is still available over HTTPS.
New Amazon S3 features are not supported for SOAP. Instead of using SOAP, we recommend that you use
either the REST API or the AWS SDKs.

## REST error responses

When an error occurs, the header information contains the following:

- Content-Type: application/xml

- An appropriate 3xx, 4xx, or 5xx HTTP status code

The body of the response also contains information about the error. The following sample
error response shows the structure of response elements common to all REST error
responses.

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error>
  <Code>NoSuchKey</Code>
  <Message>The resource you requested does not exist</Message>
  <Resource>/mybucket/myfoto.jpg</Resource>
  <RequestId>4442587FB7D0A2F9</RequestId>
</Error>
```

The following table explains the REST error response elements.

Name  Description `Code`

The error code is a string that uniquely identifies an error
condition. It is meant to be read and understood by programs that
detect and handle errors by type. For more information, see [List of error codes](#ErrorCodeList).

Type: String

Ancestor: `Error`

`Error`

Container for all error elements.

Type: Container

Ancestor: None

`Message`

The error message contains a generic description of the error
condition in English. It is intended for a human audience. Simple
programs display the message directly to the end user if they
encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't care to
handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling
and proper internationalization are more likely to ignore the error
message.

Type: String

Ancestor: `Error`

`RequestId`

ID of the request associated with the error.

Type: String

Ancestor: `Error`

`Resource`

The bucket or object that is involved in the error.

Type: String

Ancestor: `Error`

Many error responses contain additional structured data meant to be read and understood by a
developer diagnosing programming errors. For example, if you send a Content-MD5 header
with a REST PUT request that doesn't match the digest calculated on the server, you
receive a `BadDigest` error. The error response also includes as detail
elements the digest that the server calculated, and the digest that you told the server
to expect. During development, you can use this information to diagnose the error. In
production, a well-behaved program might include this information in its error
log.

For information about general response elements, go to [Error responses](../userguide/usingresterror.md).

## List of error codes

The following table lists Amazon S3 error codes.

Error codeDescriptionHTTP status codeSOAP fault code prefix`AccessControlListNotSupported`The bucket does not allow ACLs.`400 Bad Request`Client`AccessDenied`Access Denied`403 Forbidden`Client`AccessPointAlreadyOwnedByYou`An access point with an identical name already exists in your
account.`409 Conflict`Client`AccountProblem`There is a problem with your AWS account that prevents the operation from completing
successfully. For further assistance, see [Contact Us](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).`403 Forbidden`Client`AllAccessDisabled`All access to this Amazon S3 resource has been disabled. For further assistance, see [Contact Us](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).`403 Forbidden`Client`AmbiguousGrantByEmailAddress`The email address that you provided is associated with more than one account.`400 Bad Request`Client`AuthorizationHeaderMalformed`The authorization header that you provided is not valid.`400 Bad Request`N/A`AuthorizationQueryParametersError`The authorization query parameters that you provided are not valid.`400 Bad Request`N/A`BadDigest`The Content-MD5 or checksum value that you specified did not match what the server

of the system. Specify a different name and try again.`409 Conflict`Client`BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou`The bucket that you tried to create already exists, and you own it. Amazon S3 returns this
error in all AWS Regions except in the US East (N. Virginia) Region
(us-east-1). For legacy compatibility, if you re-create an
existing bucket that you already own in us-east-1, Amazon S3
returns `200 OK` and resets the bucket access control lists
(ACLs).

For Amazon S3 on Outposts, the bucket that you tried to create
already exists in your Outpost and you own it.

`409 Conflict` (in all Regions except
us-east-1)

## List of Amazon S3 Object Lambda error codes

The following table contains special errors that S3 Object Lambda might return. For
information about general Amazon S3 errors and a list of error codes, see [Error responses](errorresponses.md).

Error responses received from the supporting access points during non- `GetObject`
requests are sent to the caller unaltered.

Error codeDescriptionHTTP status code`LambdaInvalidResponse`

Returned to the original caller when
`WriteGetObjectResponse` responds with
`ValidationError` to AWS Lambda.

See the `ValidationError` message for more details. Not
all cases of `ValidationError` result in a
`LambdaInvalidResponse` error.

`400 Bad Request``LambdaInvocationFailed`

Lambda function invocation failed.

Callers might receive the following error when S3 Object Lambda is
unable to successfully invoke the configured Lambda function.

The error message might contain details about an eventual error
returned by the AWS Lambda service when invoking the function (for
example, status code, error code, error message and request
ID).

`400 Bad Request``LambdaNotFound`

The AWS Lambda function was not found.

The
configured Lambda function, version, or alias was not found when
attempting to invoke it. Ensure that the S3 Object Lambda Access
Point configuration points to the correct Lambda function
ARN.

The error message might contain details about an
eventual error returned by the AWS Lambda service when invoking the
function (for example, status code, error code, error message and
request ID).

`404 Not Found``LambdaPermissionError`

The caller is not authorized to invoke the Lambda function.

The caller must have permission to invoke the Lambda function.
Check the policies attached to the caller and ensure that they've
been allowed to use `lambda:Invoke` for the configured
function.

The error message might contain details about an eventual error
returned by the AWS Lambda service when invoking the function (for
example, status code, error code, error message and request
ID).

`403 Forbidden``LambdaResponseNotReceived`

The Lambda function exited without successfully calling
`WriteGetObjectResponse`.

`GetObject`
response data is provided by the Lambda function by calling the
`WriteGetObjectResponse` API operation. The Amazon CloudWatch
logs for the function might provide more insight into why the
function did not successfully call this API operation despite
exiting normally.

`500 Internal Service Error``LambdaRuntimeError`

The Lambda function failed during execution.

An
explicit error was received from the Lambda function. For details
about the failure, check the AWS CloudFormation logs.

`500 Internal Service Error``LambdaTimeout`

The Lambda function did not respond in the allowed
time.

The Lambda function failed to complete its call to
`WriteGetObjectResponse` within 60 seconds.

`500 Internal Service Error``SlowDown`

Reduce your request rate for operations involving
AWS Lambda.

The function invocation was throttled by
AWS Lambda, perhaps because it has reached its configured concurrency
limitation. For more information, see [Managing\
concurrency for a Lambda function](../../../lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.md) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

The error
message might contain details about an eventual error returned by
the AWS Lambda service when invoking the function (for example,
status code, error code, error message and request ID).

`503 Slow Down``ValidationError`

Validation errors might be returned from the
`WriteGetObjectResponse` API operation and can occur
for numerous reasons. See the error message for more details.

`400 Bad Request`
