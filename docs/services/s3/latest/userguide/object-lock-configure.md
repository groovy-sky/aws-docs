# Configuring S3 Object Lock

With Amazon S3 Object Lock, you can store objects in Amazon S3 general purpose buckets by using a
_write-once-read-many_ (WORM) model. You can use S3 Object Lock to
prevent an object from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
For general information about Object Lock capabilities, see [Locking objects with Object Lock](object-lock.md).

Before you lock any objects, you must enable S3 Versioning and Object Lock on a general purpose bucket.
Afterward, you can set a retention period, a legal hold, or both.

To work with Object Lock, you must have certain permissions. For a list of the permissions
related to various Object Lock operations, see [Required permissions](object-lock.md#object-lock-permissions).

###### Important

- After you enable Object Lock on a bucket, you can't disable Object Lock or suspend
versioning for that bucket.

- S3 buckets with Object Lock can't be used as destination buckets for server access
logs. For more information, see [Logging requests with server access logging](serverlogs.md).

## Enable Object Lock when creating a new S3 general purpose bucket

You can enable Object Lock when creating a new S3 general purpose bucket by using the Amazon S3 console,
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API.

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

03. Choose **Create bucket**.

    The **Create bucket** page opens.

04. For **Bucket name**, enter a name for your bucket.

    ###### Note

    After you create a bucket, you can't change its name. For more information about
    naming buckets, see [General purpose bucket naming rules](bucketnamingrules.md).

05. For **Region**, choose the AWS Region where you want the bucket
     to reside.

06. Under **Object Ownership**, choose to disable or enable access
     control lists (ACLs) and control ownership of objects uploaded in your bucket.

07. Under **Block Public Access settings for this bucket**, choose
     the Block Public Access settings that you want to apply to the bucket.

08. Under **Bucket Versioning**, choose
     **Enabled**.

    Object Lock works only with versioned buckets.

09. (Optional) Under **Tags**, you can choose to add tags to your
     bucket. Tags are key-value pairs that are used to categorize storage and allocate
     costs.

10. Under **Advanced settings**, find
     **Object Lock** and choose **Enable**.

    You must acknowledge that enabling Object Lock will permanently allow objects in
     this bucket to be locked.

11. Choose **Create bucket**.

The following `create-bucket` example creates a new S3 bucket named
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` with Object Lock enabled:

```nohighlight

aws s3api create-bucket --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket
```

For more information and examples, see [create-bucket](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

## Enable Object Lock on an existing S3 bucket

You can enable Object Lock for an existing S3 bucket by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API.

###### Note

Object Lock works only with versioned buckets.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

3. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that you
    want to enable Object Lock on.

4. Choose the **Properties** tab.

5. Under **Properties**, scroll down to the **Object**
**Lock** section, and choose **Edit**.

6. Under **Object Lock**, choose **Enable**.

You must acknowledge that enabling Object Lock will permanently allow objects in
    this bucket to be locked.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

The following `put-object-lock-configuration` example command sets a 50-day
Object Lock retention period on a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --object-lock-configuration='{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled", "Rule": { "DefaultRetention": { "Mode": "COMPLIANCE", "Days": 50 }}}'
```

## Set or modify a legal hold on an S3 object

You can set or remove a legal hold on an S3 object by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS CLI, AWS
SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API.

###### Important

- If you want to set a legal hold on an object, the object's bucket must already have
Object Lock enabled.

- When you `PUT` an object version that has an explicit individual
retention mode and period in a bucket, the object version's individual Object Lock
settings override any bucket property retention settings.

For more information, see [Legal holds](object-lock.md#object-lock-legal-holds).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

3. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that
    contains the object that you want to set or modify a legal hold on.

4. In the **Objects** list, select the object that you want to set
    or modify a legal hold on.

5. On the **Object properties** page, find the **Object Lock**
**legal hold** section, and choose **Edit**.

6. Choose **Enable** to set a legal hold or
    **Disable** to remove a legal hold.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

The following `put-object-legal-hold` example sets a legal hold on the
object `my-image.fs` in the bucket
named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object-legal-hold --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key my-image.fs --legal-hold="Status=ON"
```

The following `put-object-legal-hold` example removes a legal hold on the
object `my-image.fs` in the bucket
named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object-legal-hold --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key my-image.fs --legal-hold="Status=OFF"
```

## Set or modify a retention period on an S3 object

You can set or modify a retention period on an S3 object by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS CLI,
AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API.

###### Important

- If you want to set a retention period on an object, the object's bucket must already
have Object Lock enabled.

- When you `PUT` an object version that has an explicit individual
retention mode and period in a bucket, the object version's individual Object Lock
settings override any bucket property retention settings.

- The only way to delete an object under the compliance mode before its retention date expires is to delete the associated AWS account.

For more information, see [Retention periods](object-lock.md#object-lock-retention-periods).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

3. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that
    contains the object that you want to set or modify a retention period on.

4. In the **Objects** list, select the object that you want to set
    or modify a retention period on.

5. On the **Object properties** page, find the **Object Lock**
**retention** section, and choose **Edit**.

6. Under **Retention**, choose **Enable** to set a
    retention period or **Disable** to remove a retention period.

7. If you chose **Enable**, under **Retention**
**mode**, choose either **Governance mode** or
    **Compliance mode**. For more information, see [Retention modes](object-lock.md#object-lock-retention-modes).

8. Under **Retain until date**, choose the date that you want to
    have the retention period end on. During this period, your object is WORM-protected
    and can't be overwritten or deleted. For more information, see [Retention periods](object-lock.md#object-lock-retention-periods).

9. Choose **Save changes**.

The following `put-object-retention` example sets a retention period on the
object `my-image.fs` in the bucket
named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` until January 1, 2025:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object-retention --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key my-image.fs --retention='{ "Mode": "GOVERNANCE", "RetainUntilDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00" }'

## Set or modify a default retention period on an S3 bucket

You can set or modify a default retention period on an S3 bucket by using the Amazon S3
console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API. You specify a duration, in either days or years,
for how long to protect every object version placed in the bucket.

###### Important

- If you want to set a default retention period on a bucket, the bucket must already
have Object Lock enabled.

- When you `PUT` an object version that has an explicit individual
retention mode and period in a bucket, the object version's individual Object Lock
settings override any bucket property retention settings.

- The only way to delete an object under the compliance mode before its retention date expires is to delete the associated AWS account.

For more information, see [Retention periods](object-lock.md#object-lock-retention-periods).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

3. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that you
    want to set or modify a default retention period on.

4. Choose the **Properties** tab.

5. Under **Properties**, scroll down to the **Object**
**Lock** section, and choose **Edit**.

6. Under **Default retention**, choose **Enable**
    to set a default retention or **Disable** to remove a default
    retention.

7. If you chose **Enable**, under **Retention**
**mode**, choose either **Governance mode** or
    **Compliance mode**. For more information, see [Retention modes](object-lock.md#object-lock-retention-modes).

8. Under **Default retention period**, choose the number of days or
    years that you want the retention period to last for. Objects placed in this bucket
    will be locked for this number of days or years. For more information, see [Retention periods](object-lock.md#object-lock-retention-periods).

9. Choose **Save changes**.

The following `put-object-lock-configuration` example command sets a 50-day
Object Lock retention period on the bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` by
using compliance mode:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --object-lock-configuration='{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled", "Rule": { "DefaultRetention": { "Mode": "COMPLIANCE", "Days": 50 }}}'
```

The following `put-object-lock-configuration` example removes the default
retention configuration on a bucket:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --object-lock-configuration='{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled"}'
```
