# Importing objects into a directory bucket

After you create a directory bucket in Amazon S3, you can populate the new bucket with data by
using the import action. Import is a streamlined method for creating S3 Batch Operations jobs to copy
objects from general purpose buckets to directory buckets.

###### Note

The following limitations apply to import jobs:

- The source bucket and the destination bucket must be in the same AWS Region and
account.

- The source bucket cannot be a directory bucket.

- Objects larger than 5GB are not supported and will be omitted from the copy
operation.

- Objects in the Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive, Intelligent-Tiering
Archive Access tier, and Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier storage classes must be
restored before they can be imported.

- Imported objects with MD5 checksum algorithms are converted to use CRC32
checksums.

- Imported objects use the Express One Zone storage class, which has a different pricing
structure than the storage classes used by general purpose buckets. Consider this
difference in cost when importing large numbers of objects.

When you configure an import job, you specify the source bucket or prefix where the existing
objects will be copied from. You also provide an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that has permissions to
access the source objects. Amazon S3 then starts a Batch Operations job that copies the objects and
automatically applies appropriate storage class and checksum settings.

To configure import jobs, you use the Amazon S3 console.

## Using the Amazon S3 console

###### To import objects into a directory bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**, and then choose the
    **Directory** buckets tab. Choose the option button next to the
    directory bucket that you want to import objects into.

3. Choose **Import**.

4. For **Source**, enter the general purpose bucket (or bucket path
    including prefix) that contains the objects that you want to import. To choose an existing
    general purpose bucket from a list, choose **Browse S3**.

5. For **Permission to access and copy source objects**, do one of the
    following to specify an IAM role with the permissions necessary to import your source
    objects:

- To allow Amazon S3 to create a new IAM role on your behalf, choose **Create**
**new IAM role**.

- To choose an existing IAM role from a list, choose **Choose from**
**existing IAM roles**.

- To specify an existing IAM role by entering its Amazon Resource Name (ARN),
choose **Enter IAM role ARN**, then enter the ARN in the
corresponding field.

6. Review the information that's displayed in the **Destination** and
    **Copied object settings** sections. If the information in the
    **Destination** section is correct, choose **Import**
    to start the copy job.

The Amazon S3 console displays the status of your new job on the **Batch**
**Operations** page. For more information about the job, choose the option button
    next to the job name, and then on the **Actions** menu, choose
    **View details**. To open the directory bucket that the objects will be
    imported into, choose **View import destination**.
