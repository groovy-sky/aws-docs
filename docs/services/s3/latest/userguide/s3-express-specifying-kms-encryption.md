# Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) for new object uploads in directory buckets

For directory buckets, to encrypt your data with server-side encryption, you can use either server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
(the default) or server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your
`CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects
are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS for new object uploads](s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.md).

All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and all new objects that are uploaded
to an S3 bucket are automatically encrypted at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) is the default encryption
configuration for every bucket in Amazon S3. If you want to specify a different encryption type for a directory bucket, you can use server-side encryption with
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).
To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk)).
The [AWS managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#aws-managed-cmk) ( `aws/s3`) isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk) per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.
Then, when you specify server-side encryption settings for new objects with SSE-KMS, you must make sure the encryption key is the same customer managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default encryption configuration.
To use a new customer managed key for your data, we recommend copying your existing objects to a new directory bucket with a new customer managed key.

You can apply encryption when you are either uploading a new object or copying an existing
object. If you change an object's encryption, a new object is created to replace the old one.

You can specify SSE-KMS by using the REST API operations, AWS SDKs, and the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

###### Note

- For directory buckets, the encryption overriding behaviors are as follows:

- When you use [CreateSession](../api/api-createsession.md) with the REST API to authenticate and authorize Zonal endpoint API requests except [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) and [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md),
you can override the encryption settings to SSE-S3 or to SSE-KMS only if you specified the bucket’s default encryption with SSE-KMS previously.

- When you use [CreateSession](../api/api-createsession.md) with the AWS CLI or the AWS SDKs to authenticate and authorize Zonal endpoint API requests except [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) and [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md), you can’t override the encryption settings at all.

- When you make [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) requests, you can override the encryption settings to SSE-S3 or to SSE-KMS only if you specified the bucket’s default encryption with SSE-KMS previously. When you make [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md) requests, you can’t override the encryption settings.

- You can use multi-Region AWS KMS keys in Amazon S3. However, Amazon S3 currently treats multi-Region keys
as though they were single-Region keys, and does not use the multi-Region features of the key. For more
information, see
[Using multi-Region keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.md) in _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- If you want to use a KMS key that's owned by a different account, you must have permission
to use the key. For more information about cross-account permissions for KMS keys, see
[Creating KMS keys that other accounts can use](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.md#cross-account-console) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Note

Only 1 [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk) is supported per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. The [AWS managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#aws-managed-cmk) ( `aws/s3`) isn't supported.
After you specify SSE-KMS as your bucket's default encryption configuration with a customer managed key, you can't change the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.

For [Zonal endpoint (object-level) API operations](s3-express-differences.md#s3-express-differences-api-operations) except [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) and [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md),
you authenticate and authorize requests through [CreateSession](../api/api-createsession.md) for low latency.
We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configurations and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your
`CreateSession` requests or `PUT` object requests. Then, new objects
are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings.
To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk)). Then, when a session is created for Zonal endpoint API operations, new objects are automatically encrypted and decrypted with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys during the session. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see [Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS for new object uploads](s3-express-specifying-kms-encryption.md).

In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) and [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md)) using the REST API,
you can't override the values of the encryption settings ( `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`, and `x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled`) from the `CreateSession` request.
You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and
Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the `CreateSession` request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.

###### Note

When you use the AWS CLI or the AWS SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The AWS CLI or the AWS SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the
`CreateSession` request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the `CreateSession` request. Also, in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) and [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md)),
it's not supported to override the values of the encryption settings from the `CreateSession` request.

For [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md),
to encrypt new object copies in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk)).

Then, when you specify server-side encryption settings for new object copies with SSE-KMS, you must make sure the encryption key is the same customer managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default encryption configuration.
For [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md), to encrypt new object part copies in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk)).
You can't specify server-side encryption settings for new object part copies with SSE-KMS in the [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md) request headers. Also, the encryption settings that you provide in the [CreateMultipartUpload](../api/api-createmultipartupload.md) request must match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.

### Amazon S3 REST API operations that support SSE-KMS

The following object-level REST API operations in directory buckets accept the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption`,
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, and
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-context` request headers.

- [CreateSession](../api/api-createsession.md) – When you use Zonal endpoint (object-level) API operations (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy),
you can specify these request headers.

- [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md) – When you upload data by using the
`PUT` API operation, you can specify these request headers.

- [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) – When you copy an object, you have both a
source object and a target object. When you pass SSE-KMS headers with the
`CopyObject` operation, they're applied only to the target object.

- [CreateMultipartUpload](../api/api-createmultipartupload.md) – When you upload large objects
by using the multipart upload API operation, you can specify these headers. You
specify these headers in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request.

The response headers of the following REST API operations return the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption` header when an object is stored by using
server-side encryption.

- [CreateSession](../api/api-createsession.md)

- [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md)

- [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md)

- [POST\
Object](../api/restobjectpost.md)

- [CreateMultipartUpload](../api/api-createmultipartupload.md)

- [UploadPart](../api/api-uploadpart.md)

- [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md)

- [CompleteMultipartUpload](../api/api-completemultipartupload.md)

- [GetObject](../api/api-getobject.md)

- [HeadObject](../api/api-headobject.md)

###### Important

- All `GET` and `PUT` requests for an object protected by
AWS KMS fail if you don't make these requests by using
Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4.

- If your object uses SSE-KMS, don't send encryption request headers for
`GET` requests and `HEAD` requests, or you’ll get an
**`HTTP 400 BadRequest`** error.

### Encryption context ( `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`)

If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, the Amazon S3 API
supports you to optionally provide an explicit encryption context with the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`
header. For directory buckets, an encryption context is a set of key-value pairs that contain contextual information about the data.
The value must match the default encryption context — the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.

For information about the encryption context in directory buckets, see [Encryption context](s3-express-usingkmsencryption.md#s3-express-encryption-context). For general
information about the encryption context, see [AWS Key Management Service Concepts -\
Encryption context](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#encrypt_context) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

### AWS KMS key ID ( `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`)

You can use the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header to
specify the ID of the customer managed key that's used to protect the data.

Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk) per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.
The [AWS managed key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#aws-managed-cmk) ( `aws/s3`) isn't supported. Also, after you specify a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.

You can identify the customer managed key you specified for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration, in the following way:

- You make a `HeadObject` API operation request to find the value of `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` in your response.

To use a new customer managed key for your data, we recommend copying your existing objects to a new directory bucket with a new customer managed key.

For information about the encryption context in directory buckets, see [AWS KMS keys](s3-express-usingkmsencryption.md#s3-express-aws-managed-customer-managed-keys).

### S3 Bucket Keys ( `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-bucket-key-enabled`)

S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for `GET` and `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md), [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md), [the Copy operation in Batch Operations](directory-buckets-objects-batch-ops.md), or
[the import jobs](create-import-job.md). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object. For information about the S3 Bucket Keys in directory buckets, see [Encryption context](s3-express-usingkmsencryption.md#s3-express-encryption-context).

###### Note

When you use the AWS CLI, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.
It's not supported to override the encryption settings values for the `CreateSession` request. Also, in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) and [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md)),
it's not supported to override the values of the encryption settings from the `CreateSession` request.

To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a customer managed key). Then, when a session is created for Zonal endpoint API operations, new objects are automatically encrypted and decrypted with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys during the session.

To use the following example AWS CLI commands, replace the `user input
            placeholders` with your own information.

When you upload a new object or copy an existing object, you can specify the use of
server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys to encrypt your data. To do this, use the `put-bucket-encryption` command to set the directory bucket's default encryption configuration as SSE-KMS
( `aws:kms`). Specifically, add the
`--server-side-encryption aws:kms` header to the request. Use the
`--ssekms-key-id example-key-id` to add your [customer\
managed AWS KMS key](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#customer-cmk) that you created. If you specify `--server-side-encryption
            aws:kms`, you must provide an AWS KMS key ID of your customer managed key. Directory buckets don't use an AWS managed
key. For an example command, see [Using the AWS CLI](s3-express-bucket-encryption.md#s3-express-default-bucket-encryption-cli).

Then, when you upload a new object with the following command, Amazon S3 uses the bucket settings for default encryption to encrypt the object by default.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object --bucket bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 --key example-object-key --body filepath
```

You don't need to add `-\-bucket-key-enabled` explicitly in your Zonal endpoint API operations commands. S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for `GET` and `PUT` operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md), [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md), [the Copy operation in Batch Operations](directory-buckets-objects-batch-ops.md), or
[the import jobs](create-import-job.md). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.

You can copy an object from a source bucket (for example, a general purpose bucket) to a new bucket (for example, a directory bucket) and use SSE-KMS
encryption for the destination objects. To do this, use the `put-bucket-encryption` command to set the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket (for example, a directory bucket) as SSE-KMS
( `aws:kms`). For an example command, see [Using the AWS CLI](s3-express-bucket-encryption.md#s3-express-default-bucket-encryption-cli).
Then, when you copy an object with the following command, Amazon S3 uses the bucket settings for default encryption to encrypt the object by default.

```nohighlight

aws s3api copy-object --copy-source amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example-object-key --bucket bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 --key example-object-key
```

When using AWS SDKs, you can request Amazon S3 to use AWS KMS keys for server-side
encryption. The following examples show how to use SSE-KMS with the AWS SDKs for Java and
.NET. For information about other SDKs, see [Sample code\
and libraries](https://aws.amazon.com/code) on the AWS Developer Center.

###### Note

When you use the AWS SDKs, for `CreateSession`, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.
It's not supported to override the encryption settings values for the `CreateSession` request. Also, in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) and [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md)),
it's not supported to override the values of the encryption settings from the `CreateSession` request.

To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a customer managed key). Then, when a session is created for Zonal endpoint API operations, new objects are automatically encrypted and decrypted with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys during the session.

For more information about using AWS SDKs to set the default encryption configuration of a directory bucket as SSE-KMS,
see [Using the AWS SDKs](s3-express-bucket-encryption.md#s3-express-kms-put-bucket-encryption-using-sdks).

###### Important

When you use an AWS KMS key for server-side encryption in Amazon S3, you must choose a symmetric encryption KMS key.
Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys. For more information about these keys, see
[Symmetric encryption KMS keys](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#symmetric-cmks) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

For more information about creating customer managed keys, see [Programming the AWS KMS API](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/programming-top.md) in
the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
