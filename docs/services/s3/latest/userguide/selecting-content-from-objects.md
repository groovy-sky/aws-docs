# Querying data in place with Amazon S3 Select

###### Important

Amazon S3 Select is no longer available to new customers. Existing customers of Amazon S3 Select can continue to use the feature as usual. [Learn more](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/how-to-optimize-querying-your-data-in-amazon-s3)

With Amazon S3 Select, you can use structured query language (SQL) statements to filter the
contents of an Amazon S3 object and retrieve only the subset of data that you need. By using Amazon S3
Select to filter this data, you can reduce the amount of data that Amazon S3 transfers, which
reduces the cost and latency to retrieve this data.

Amazon S3 Select only allows you to query one object at a time. It works on an object stored in CSV, JSON, or Apache Parquet format.
It also works with an object that is compressed with GZIP or BZIP2 (for CSV and JSON objects
only), and a server-side encrypted object. You can specify the format of the results as
either CSV or JSON, and you can determine how the records in the result are
delimited.

You pass SQL expressions to Amazon S3 in the request. Amazon S3 Select supports a subset of SQL. For
more information about the SQL elements that are supported by Amazon S3 Select, see [SQL reference for Amazon S3 Select](s3-select-sql-reference.md).

You can perform SQL queries by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the `SelectObjectContent` REST
API operation, or the AWS SDKs.

###### Note

The Amazon S3 console limits the
amount of data returned to 40 MB. To retrieve more data, use the AWS CLI or the API.

## Requirements and limits

The following are requirements for using Amazon S3 Select:

- You must have `s3:GetObject` permission for the object you are
querying.

- If the object you are querying is encrypted with server-side encryption with
customer-provided keys (SSE-C), you must use `https`, and you must
provide the encryption key in the request.

The following limits apply when using Amazon S3 Select:

- S3 Select can query only one object per request.

- S3 Select supports querying files up to 5 TB in size.

- The maximum length of a SQL expression is 256 KB.

- The maximum length of a record in the input or result is 1 MB.

- Amazon S3 Select can only emit nested data by using the JSON output format.

- You cannot query an object stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, S3 Glacier Deep Archive, or
Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) storage classes. You also cannot query an object stored in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier.
For more information about storage classes, see [Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes](storage-class-intro.md).

Additional limitations apply when using Amazon S3 Select with a Parquet
object:

- Amazon S3 Select supports only columnar compression using GZIP or
Snappy. Amazon S3 Select doesn't support whole-object compression
for a Parquet object.

- Amazon S3 Select doesn't support Parquet output. You must specify
the output format as CSV or JSON.

- The maximum uncompressed row group size is 512 MB.

- You must use the data types that are specified in the object's schema.

- Selecting on a repeated field returns only the last value.

## Constructing a request

When you construct a request, you provide details of the object that is being queried
by using an `InputSerialization` object. You provide details of how the
results are to be returned by using an `OutputSerialization` object. You also
include the SQL expression that Amazon S3 uses to filter the request.

For more information about constructing an Amazon S3 Select request, see [SelectObjectContent](../api/restobjectselectcontent.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_. You can also see one of the SDK code examples
in the following sections.

### Requests using scan ranges

With Amazon S3 Select, you can scan a subset of an object by specifying a range of
bytes to query. This capability lets you parallelize scanning the whole object by
splitting the work into separate Amazon S3 Select requests for a series of
non-overlapping scan ranges.

Scan ranges don't need to be aligned with record boundaries. An Amazon S3 Select scan
range request runs across the byte range that you specify. A record that starts
within the specified scan range but extends beyond that scan range will be processed
by the query. For example, the following shows an Amazon S3 object that contains a series
of records in a line-delimited CSV format:

```nohighlight

A,B
C,D
D,E
E,F
G,H
I,J
```

Suppose that you're using the Amazon S3 Select `ScanRange` parameter and
_Start_ at (Byte) 1 and _End_ at (Byte) 4.
So the scan range would start at " `,`" and scan until the end of the
record starting at `C`. Your scan range request will return the result
`C, D` because that is the end of the record.

Amazon S3 Select scan range requests support Parquet, CSV (without
quoted delimiters), or JSON objects (in `LINES` mode only). CSV and JSON
objects must be uncompressed. For line-based CSV and JSON objects, when a scan range
is specified as part of the Amazon S3 Select request, all records that start within the
scan range are processed. For Parquet objects, all of the row groups
that start within the scan range requested are processed.

Amazon S3 Select scan range requests are available to use with the AWS CLI, Amazon S3 API, and
AWS SDKs. You can use the `ScanRange` parameter in the Amazon S3 Select
request for this feature. For more information, see [SelectObjectContent](../api/api-selectobjectcontent.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Errors

Amazon S3 Select returns an error code and associated error message when an issue is
encountered while attempting to run a query. For a list of error codes and
descriptions, see the [List of SELECT Object Content Error Codes](../api/errorresponses.md#SelectObjectContentErrorCodeList) section of the _Error Responses_
page in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.
