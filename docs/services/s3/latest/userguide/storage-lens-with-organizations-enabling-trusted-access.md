# Enabling trusted access for S3 Storage Lens

By enabling trusted access, you allow Amazon S3 Storage Lens to access your AWS Organizations
hierarchy, membership, and structure through AWS Organizations API operations. S3 Storage Lens then becomes
a trusted service for your entire organization's structure.

Whenever a dashboard configuration is created, S3 Storage Lens creates service-linked roles in
your organization's management or delegated administrator accounts. The service-linked role
grants S3 Storage Lens permission to perform the following actions:

- Describe organizations

- List accounts

- Verify a list of AWS service access for the organizations

- Get delegated administrators for the organizations

S3 Storage Lens can then ensure that it has access to collect the cross-account metrics for the
accounts in your organization. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon S3 Storage Lens](using-service-linked-roles.md).

After enabling trusted access, you can assign delegated administrator access to accounts
in your organization. When an account is marked as a delegated administrator for a service,
the account receives authorization to access all read-only organization API operations. This
access provides the delegated administrator visibility to the members and structures of your
organization so that they too can create S3 Storage Lens dashboards.

###### Note

- Trusted access can only be enabled by the [management\
account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managedservices/latest/userguide/management-account.html).

- Only the management account and delegated administrators can create S3 Storage Lens
dashboards or configurations for your organization.

public class EnableOrganizationsTrustedAccess {
	private static final String S3_STORAGE_LENS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL = "storage-lens.s3.amazonaws.com";

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
            AWSOrganizations organizationsClient = AWSOrganizationsClient.builder()
                .withCredentials(new ProfileCredentialsProvider())
                .withRegion(Regions.US_EAST_1)
                .build();

            organizationsClient.enableAWSServiceAccess(new EnableAWSServiceAccessRequest()
                .withServicePrincipal(S3_STORAGE_LENS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL));
        } catch (AmazonServiceException e) {
            // The call was transmitted successfully, but AWS Organizations couldn't process
            // it and returned an error response.
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (SdkClientException e) {
            // AWS Organizations couldn't be contacted for a response, or the client
            // couldn't parse the response from AWS Organizations.
