# Creating a vector bucket

You can create a vector bucket using the S3 console or the AWS CLI. All data stored in vector buckets
are always encrypted at rest. By default, vector buckets use SSE-S3 to encrypt vector data.
You can
choose to configure buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) instead. The bucket encryption settings can’t be changed after a
vector bucket is created, so it's important to choose the appropriate encryption method
based on your security requirements and compliance needs. For more information about
security in vector buckets, see [Data protection and encryption in S3 Vectors](s3-vectors-data-encryption.md).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Vector buckets**.

3. Choose **Create vector bucket**.

4. For **Vector bucket name**, enter a name for your bucket.

The bucket name must follow the naming rules:

- Bucket name must be between 3 and 63 characters long.

- Bucket name can only include lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

- Bucket name must be unique within your AWS account for an AWS Region.

For more information about vector bucket naming rules, see [Vector bucket naming rules](s3-vectors-buckets-naming.md).

###### Important

You can't change the vector bucket name after you create the bucket.

5. For **Encryption**, choose one of the following options:

- **Don't specify encryption type** – Amazon S3 automatically applies server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) as the base level of encryption for new vectors. Choose this option for the simplest setup with no additional configuration.

- **Specify encryption type** – Choose a specific encryption method:

- **Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)** – Explicitly choose to use SSE-S3. Amazon S3 encrypts your vector data as it writes it to storage and decrypts it when you access it. AWS manages all encryption keys automatically.

- **Server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS)** – Uses customer managed keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS, giving you more control over your encryption keys, key rotation, and access policies.

If you select SSE-KMS, you have additional options:

- **Choose from your AWS KMS keys** – Select an existing customer managed key from your account.

- **Enter AWS KMS key ARN** – Specify the full ARN of a KMS key (required format).

- **Create a KMS key** – Opens the AWS KMS console to create a new customer managed key.

KMS key requirements:

- The KMS key must be in the same Region as the vector bucket.

- You must specify the full KMS key ARN (key IDs and aliases aren't supported).

- You must grant the S3 Vectors service principal ( `indexing.s3vectors.amazonaws.com`) the `kms:Decrypt` permission to use the key.
For more information about an example AWS KMS key policy, see [Data protection and encryption in S3 Vectors](s3-vectors-data-encryption.md).

For detailed information about encryption options and KMS key setup, see [Using SSE-KMS encryption](s3-vectors-data-encryption.md#s3-vectors-sse-kms-encryption).

###### Important

Encryption settings can't be changed after the vector bucket is created. Choose carefully based on your long-term security and compliance requirements.

6. Under **Tags (Optional)**, you can add tags as key-value pairs to help track and organize vector index costs using AWS Billing and Cost Management. Enter a **Key** and a **Value**. To add another tag, choose **Add Tag**. You can enter up to 50 tags for a vector index. For more information, see [Using tags with S3 vector buckets](s3-vectors-tags.md).

7. Choose **Create vector bucket**.

After creation, you'll see a confirmation message. The new vector bucket appears in your vector buckets list and is ready for creating vector indexes within the bucket.

You can create a vector bucket with SSE-S3 encryption using the following command. To use this example, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3vectors create-vector-bucket \
   --vector-bucket-name "amzn-s3-demo-vector-bucket"
```

To create a vector bucket with SSE-KMS encryption using a customer managed KMS key:

```nohighlight

aws s3vectors create-vector-bucket \
   --vector-bucket-name "amzn-s3-demo-vector-bucket" \
   --encryption-configuration '{"sseType": "aws:kms", "kmsKeyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"}'
```

SDK for Python

```Python

import boto3

# Create a S3 Vectors client in the AWS Region of your choice.
s3vectors = boto3.client("s3vectors", region_name="us-west-2")

#Create a vector bucket
s3vectors.create_vector_bucket(vectorBucketName="media-embeddings")
```
