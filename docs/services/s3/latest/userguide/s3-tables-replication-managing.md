# Managing S3 Tables replication

After you configure S3 Tables replication, you can monitor replica status to verify what's
replicated. You can check replication status in the Amazon S3 console on the source table's
**Management** tab, or by using the AWS CLI. For more information, see [Setting up S3 Tables replication](s3-tables-replication-setting-up.md).This topic explains how to monitor replication and understand the different status values
that indicate whether replication is completed, in progress, or has failed.

## Monitoring replication status

Replication jobs run continuously for your replicated tables. You can query the status of
replication with the GetTableReplicationStatus API or view it in the Amazon S3 console.

### To get the status of replication by using the AWS CLI

The following example gets the replication status using the GetTableReplicationStatus
API.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables get-table-replication-status \
    --table-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket/table/sales-data

```

Expected output:

```nohighlight

{
  "sourceTableARN": "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket/table/sales-data",
  "destinations": [
    {
      "replicationStatus": "COMPLETED",
      "destinationBucketARN": "arn:aws:s3tables:us-west-2:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket",
      "destinationTableARN": "arn:aws:s3tables:us-west-2:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket/table/sales-data",
      "lastSuccessfulReplicatedUpdate": {
        "metadataLocation": "latest_table_metadata.json",
        "timestamp": "2025-11-15T14:30:00Z"
      }
    },
    {
      "replicationStatus": "PENDING",
      "destinationBucketARN": "arn:aws:s3tables:eu-west-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket-eu-bucket",
      "destinationTableARN": "arn:aws:s3tables:eu-west-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket-eu-bucket/table/sales-data",
      "lastSuccessfulReplicatedUpdate": {
        "metadataLocation": "latest_table_metadata.json",
        "timestamp": "2025-11-15T14:25:00Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

For more information, see [get-table-replication-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3tables/get-table-replication-status.html) in the _AWS CLI Command_
_Reference_.

### Understanding the response

The response contains the following elements:

- sourceTableARN – The ARN of the source table
being replicated.

- destinations – An array of destination status
objects, one for each configured replication destination. Each destination object
contains:

- replicationStatus – The current
replication status for this destination (COMPLETED, PENDING, or FAILED).

- destinationBucketARN – The ARN of the
destination table bucket.

- destinationTableARN – The ARN of the
replica table in the destination bucket.

- lastSuccessfulReplicatedUpdate –
Information about the most recent successful replication:

- metadataLocation – The Iceberg
metadata file name that was last successfully replicated. Compare this with the
source table's current metadata location to determine if replication is up to
date.

- timestamp – The time when this
metadata file was replicated to the destination.

- failureMessage (only present when status is
FAILED) – A detailed error message describing why replication failed.

### Replication status values

Replication can have three possible statuses for each destination:

- COMPLETED – All source table snapshots have
been successfully replicated to the destination. The source table's latest metadata
location matches the last replicated metadata location.

- PENDING – Replication is in progress or new
commits are waiting to be replicated. The source table's latest metadata location
differs from the last replicated metadata location.

- FAILED – The last replication job for this
table failed. No new updates are being replicated.
