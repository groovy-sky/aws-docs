# Managing delete markers

## Configuring lifecycle to clean up expired delete markers automatically

An expired object delete marker is one where all object versions are deleted
and only a single delete marker remains. If the lifecycle configuration is set to
delete current versions, or the `ExpiredObjectDeleteMarker` action is
explicitly set, Amazon S3 removes the expired object’s delete marker. For an example,
see [Removing expired object delete markers in a versioning-enabled bucket](lifecycle-configuration-examples.md#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex7).

## Removing delete markers to make an older version current

When you delete an object in a versioning-enabled bucket, all versions remain
in the bucket, and Amazon S3 creates a delete marker for the object. To undelete the
object, you must delete this delete marker. For more information about
versioning and delete markers, see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md).

To delete a delete marker permanently, you must include its version ID in a
`DeleteObject versionId` request. The following figure shows how
a `DeleteObject versionId` request permanently removes a delete
marker.

![Illustration that shows a delete marker deletion using its version ID.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/versioning_DELETE_deleteMarkerVersioned.png)

The effect of removing the delete marker is that a simple `GET`
request will now retrieve the current version ID (121212) of the object.

###### Note

If you use a `DeleteObject` request where the current version
is a delete marker (without specifying the version ID of the delete marker),
Amazon S3 does not delete the delete marker, but instead `PUTs`
another delete marker.

To delete a delete marker with a `NULL` version ID, you must pass
the `NULL` as the version ID in the `DeleteObject`
request. The following figure shows how a simple `DeleteObject`
request made without a version ID where the current version is a delete marker,
removes nothing, but instead adds an additional delete marker with a unique
version ID (7498372).

Use the following steps to recover deleted objects that are not folders from your S3
bucket, including objects that are within those folders.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that you
    want.

3. To see a list of the **versions** of the objects in the bucket, choose
    the **List versions** switch. You'll be able to see the delete markers for
    deleted objects.

4. To undelete an object, you must delete the delete marker.
    Select the check box next to the **delete marker** of the object to recover, and then
    choose **Delete**.

5. Confirm the deletion on the **Delete objects** page.
1. For **Permanently delete objects?** enter `permanently
                    delete`.

2. Choose **Delete objects**.

###### Note

You can't use the Amazon S3 console to undelete folders. You must use the AWS CLI or SDK. For
examples, see [How can I retrieve an\
Amazon S3 object that was deleted in a versioning-enabled bucket?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-undelete-configuration) in the AWS
Knowledge Center.

###### To permanently remove a delete marker

1. Set `versionId` to the ID of the version to the delete
    marker you want to remove.

2. Send a `DELETE Object versionId` request.

###### Example— Removing a delete marker

The following example removes the delete marker for
`photo.gif` version 4857693.

```

DELETE /photo.gif?versionId=4857693 HTTP/1.1
Host: bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2009 22:32:00 GMT
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:0RQf4/cRonhpaBX5sCYVf1bNRuU=
```

When you delete a delete marker, Amazon S3 includes the following in the
response.

```nohighlight

204 NoContent
x-amz-version-id: versionID
x-amz-delete-marker: true
```

For information about using other AWS SDKs, see the [AWSDeveloper Center](https://aws.amazon.com/code).

Python

The following Python code example demonstrates how to remove a
delete marker from an object and thus makes the most recent
non-current version, the current version of the object.

```Python

def revive_object(bucket, object_key):
    """
    Revives a versioned object that was deleted by removing the object's active
    delete marker.
    A versioned object presents as deleted when its latest version is a delete marker.
    By removing the delete marker, we make the previous version the latest version
    and the object then presents as *not* deleted.

    Usage is shown in the usage_demo_single_object function at the end of this module.

    :param bucket: The bucket that contains the object.
    :param object_key: The object to revive.
    """
    # Get the latest version for the object.
    response = s3.meta.client.list_object_versions(
        Bucket=bucket.name, Prefix=object_key, MaxKeys=1
    )

    if "DeleteMarkers" in response:
        latest_version = response["DeleteMarkers"][0]
        if latest_version["IsLatest"]:
            logger.info(
                "Object %s was indeed deleted on %s. Let's revive it.",
                object_key,
                latest_version["LastModified"],
            )
            obj = bucket.Object(object_key)
            obj.Version(latest_version["VersionId"]).delete()
            logger.info(
                "Revived %s, active version is now %s  with body '%s'",
                object_key,
                obj.version_id,
                obj.get()["Body"].read(),
            )
        else:
            logger.warning(
                "Delete marker is not the latest version for %s!", object_key
            )
    elif "Versions" in response:
        logger.warning("Got an active version for %s, nothing to do.", object_key)
    else:
        logger.error("Couldn't get any version info for %s.", object_key)
