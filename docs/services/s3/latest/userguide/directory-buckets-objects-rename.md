# Renaming objects in directory buckets

Using the `RenameObject` operation, you can atomically rename an existing
object in a directory bucket that uses the S3 Express One Zone storage class, without any data
movement. You can rename an object by specifying the existing object’s name as the source
and the new name of the object as the destination within the same directory bucket. The
`RenameObject` API operation will not succeed on objects that end with the
slash ( `/`) delimiter character. For more information, see [Naming Amazon S3\
objects](object-keys.md).

The `RenameObject` operation is typically completed in milliseconds
regardless of the size of the object. This capability accelerates applications like log file
management, media processing, and data analytics. Additionally, `RenameObject` preserves all
object metadata properties, including the storage class, encryption type, creation date,
last modified date, and checksum properties.

###### Note

`RenameObject` is only supported for objects stored in the S3 Express One Zone storage class.

To grant access to the `RenameObject` operation, we recommend that you use the
`CreateSession` operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you
grant the `s3express:CreateSession` permission to the directory bucket in a
bucket policy or an identity-based policy. Then, you make the `CreateSession` API
call on the directory bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your
request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token
expires, you make another `CreateSession` API call to generate a new session
token for use. The AWS CLI and AWS SDKs will create and manage your session including
refreshing the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session
expires. For more information about authorization, see [`CreateSession`](../api/api-createsession.md) in
the _Amazon S3 API Reference_. To learn more about Zonal endpoint API
operations, see [Authorizing Zonal\
endpoint API operations with `CreateSession`](s3-express-create-session.md).

If you don't want to overwrite an existing object, you can add the
`If-None-Match` conditional header with the value `‘*’` in the
`RenameObject` request. Amazon S3 returns a `412 Precondition Failed`
error if the object name already exists. For more information, see [`RenameObject`](../api/api-renameobject.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

`RenameObject` is a Zonal endpoint API operation (object-level or data plane operation) that is logged to
AWS CloudTrail. You can use CloudTrail to gather information on the `RenameObject` operation
performed on your objects in directory buckets. For more information, see [Logging with AWS CloudTrail for directory buckets](s3-express-one-zone-logging.md) and [CloudTrail log file examples for\
directory buckets](s3-express-log-files.md).

S3 Express One Zone is the only storage class that supports `RenameObject`, which is priced the same as `PUT`,
`COPY`, `POST`, and `LIST` requests (per 1,000 requests) in S3 Express One Zone.
For more information, see [Amazon S3\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

## Renaming an object

To rename an object in your directory bucket, you can use the Amazon S3 console, AWS CLI,
AWS SDKs, the REST API or Mountpoint for Amazon S3 (version 1.19.0 or higher).

###### To rename an object in a directory bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Buckets**, and
    then choose the **Directory buckets** tab. Navigate to
    the Amazon S3 directory bucket that contains the object that you want to
    rename.

3. Select the check box for the object that you want to rename.

4. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Rename**
**object**.

5. In the **New object name** box, enter the new name for the
    object.

###### Note

If you specify the same object name as an existing object, the operation will fail and Amazon S3
returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. The object key
name length can't exceed 1,024 bytes. Prefixes included in the
object name count toward the total length.

6. Choose **Rename object**. Amazon S3 renames your
    object.

The `rename-object` examples show how you can use the
AWS CLI to rename an object. To run these commands, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your own
information

The following example shows how to rename an object with a conditional check
on the source object's ETag.

```nohighlight

aws s3api rename-object \
    --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3 \
    --key new-file.txt \
    --rename-source original-file.txt \
    --source-if-match "\"a1b7c3d2e5f6\""
```

This command does the following:

- Renames an object from `original-file.txt` to
`new-file.txt` in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket.

- Only performs the rename if the source object's ETag matches
" `a1b7c3d4e5f6`".

If the ETag doesn't match, the operation will fail with a `412
                        Precondition Failed` error.

The following example shows how to rename an object with a conditional check
on the new specified object name.

```nohighlight

aws s3api rename-object \
    --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3 \
    --key new-file.txt \
    --rename-source amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3/original-file.txt \
    --destination-if-none-match "\"e5f3g7h8i9j0\""
```

This command does the following:

- Renames an object from `original-file.txt` to
`new-file.txt` in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket.

- Only performs the rename operation if the object exists and the object's ETag doesn't match
" `e5f3g7h8i9j0`".

If an object already exists with the new specified name and the matching ETag,
the operation will fail with a `412 Precondition Failed` error.

SDK for Java

You can use the AWS SDK for Java to rename your objects. To use these examples, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your own
information

The following example demonstrates how to create a
`RenameObjectRequest` using the AWS SDK for
Java

```java

String key = "key";
String newKey = "new-key";
String expectedETag = "e5f3g7h8i9j0";
RenameObjectRequest renameRequest = RenameObjectRequest.builder()
    .bucket(amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3)
    .key(newKey)
    .renameSource(key)
    .destinationIfMatch(e5f3g7h8i9j0)
    .build();
```

This code does the following:

- Create a request to rename an object from " `key`" to
" `new-key`" in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket.

- Includes a condition that the rename will only occur if the object's ETag matches
" `e5f3g7h8i9j0`".

- If the ETag doesn't match or the object doesn't exist, the operation will fail.

The following example shows how to create a
`RenameObjectRequest` with a none-match condition
using the AWS SDK for Java.

```java

String key = "key";
String newKey = "new-key";
String noneMatchETag = "e5f3g7h8i9j0";
RenameObjectRequest renameRequest = RenameObjectRequest.builder()
    .bucket(amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3)
    .key(newKey)
    .renameSource(key)
    .destinationIfNoneMatch(noneMatchETag)
    .build();
```

This code does the following:

- Creates a request to rename an object from " `key`" to
" `new-key`" in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket.

- Includes a condition using `.destinationIfNoneMatch(noneMatchETag)` that ensures
the rename will only occur if the destination object's ETag
doesn't match
" `e5f3g7h8i9j0`".

The operation will fail with a `412 Precondition
                                    Failed` error if an object exists with the new specified
name and has the specified ETag.

SDK for Python

You can use the SDK for Python to rename your objects. To use these
examples, replace the `user input
                                    placeholders` with your own information.

The following example demonstrates how to rename an object using
the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

```Python

def basic_rename(bucket, source_key, destination_key):
    try:
        s3.rename_object(
            Bucket=amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3,
            Key=destination_key,
            RenameSource=f"{source_key}"
        )
        print(f"Successfully renamed {source_key} to {destination_key}")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error renaming object: {e}")
```

This code does the following:

- Renames an object from `source_key` to
`destination_key` in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket.

- Prints a success message if the renaming of your object is successful or prints an error
message if it fails.

The following example demonstrate how to rename an object with the `SourceIfMatch` and
`DestinationIfNoneMatch` conditions using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

```Python

def rename_with_conditions(bucket, source_key, destination_key, source_etag, dest_etag):
    try:
        s3.rename_object(
            Bucket=amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3,
            Key=destination_key,
            RenameSource=f"{amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3}/{source_key}",
            SourceIfMatch=source_ETag,
            DestinationIfNoneMatch=dest_ETag
        )
        print(f"Successfully renamed {source_key} to {destination_key} with conditions")
    except ClientError as e:
        print(f"Error renaming object: {e}")
```

This code does the following:

- Performs a conditional rename operation and applies two
conditions, `SourceIfMatch` and
`DestinationIfNoneMatch`. The combination of
these conditions ensures that the object hasn't been
modified and that an object doesn't already exist with the
new specified name.

- Renames an object from `source_key` to
`destination_key` in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket.

- Prints a success message if the renaming of your object is
successful, or prints an error message if it fails or if
conditions aren't met.

SDK for Rust

You can use the SDK for Rust to rename your objects. To use these
examples, replace the `user input
                                    placeholders` with your own information.

The following example demonstrates how to rename an object in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket using the
SDK for Rust.

```Rust

async fn basic_rename_example(client: &Client) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let response = client
        .rename_object()
        .bucket(" amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3")
        .key("new-name.txt")  // New name/path for the object
        .rename_source("old-name.txt")  // Original object name/path
        .send()
        .await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

This code does the following:

- Creates a request to rename an object from " `old-name.tx`" to " `new-name.txt`" in the `amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3` directory bucket.

- Returns a `Result` type to handle potential errors.

You can send REST requests to rename an object. For more information, see [`RenameObject`](../api/api-renameobject.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

Starting with the 1.19.0 version or higher, Mountpoint for Amazon S3 supports
renaming objects in S3 Express One Zone. For more information on Mountpoint, see
[Working with Mountpoint](mountpoint.md).
