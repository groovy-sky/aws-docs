# AWS managed policies for Amazon S3 Express One Zone

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed
to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because
they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining
[customer managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS
managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is
most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for
existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonS3ExpressFullAccess

You can attach the `AmazonS3ExpressFullAccess` policy to your IAM
identities. This policy grants full access to Amazon S3 Express One Zone directory buckets and
operations. It allows all actions under the `s3express` service prefix on all
resources.

This policy is intended for users or roles that need unrestricted access to directory
buckets. This policy covers only Amazon S3 Express One Zone operations. For standard Amazon S3
operations, you need additional policies.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonS3ExpressFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazons3expressfullaccess.md) in the AWS Managed Policy
Reference.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonS3ExpressReadOnlyAccess

You can attach the `AmazonS3ExpressReadOnlyAccess` policy to your IAM
identities. This policy grants permissions that allow `ReadOnly` access to Amazon S3 Express One Zone directory
buckets.

###### Note

The `CreateSession` action supports the `SessionMode` condition key which can be set to
`ReadOnly` or `ReadWrite`. This policy uses `SessionMode`
for a `ReadOnly` session.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonS3ExpressReadOnlyAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/amazons3expressreadonlyaccess.md) in the AWS Managed
Policy Reference.
