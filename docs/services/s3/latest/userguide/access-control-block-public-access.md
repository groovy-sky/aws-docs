# Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage

The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature provides settings for access points, buckets, accounts, and
AWS Organizations to help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources. By default, new buckets, access points,
and objects don't allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies, access point
policies, or object permissions to allow public access. S3 Block Public Access settings
override these policies and permissions so that you can limit public access to these
resources.

With S3 Block Public Access, organization administrators, account administrators, and bucket
owners can easily set up centralized controls to limit public access to their Amazon S3 resources
that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created.

You can manage Block Public Access settings at multiple levels: organization level (using
AWS Organizations), account level, and bucket and access point level. For instructions on configuring public
block access, see [Configuring block public access](#configuring-block-public-access).

When Amazon S3 receives a request to access a bucket or an object, it determines whether the
bucket or the bucket owner's account has a block public access setting applied. If the
account is part of an AWS Organizations with Block Public Access policies, Amazon S3 also checks for
organization-level settings. If the request was made through an access point, Amazon S3 also checks for
block public access settings for the access point. If there is an existing block public access
setting that prohibits the requested access, Amazon S3 rejects the request.

Amazon S3 Block Public Access provides four settings. These settings are independent and can be
used in any combination. Each setting can be applied to an access point, a bucket, or an entire
AWS account. At the organization level, all four settings are applied together as a
unified policy - you cannot select individual settings granularly. If the block public
access settings for the access point, bucket, or account differ, then Amazon S3 applies the most
restrictive combination of the access point, bucket, and account settings. Account-level settings automatically inherit
organization-level policies when present, and S3 takes the most restrictive
policy between bucket-level and effective account-level settings. For
example, if your organization has a Block Public Access policy enabled, but
a specific bucket has Block Public
Access disabled at the bucket level, the bucket will still be protected
because S3 applies the more restrictive organization/account-level
settings. Conversely, if your organization policy is disabled but a
bucket has Block Public Access enabled, that bucket remains protected by
its bucket-level settings.

When Amazon S3 evaluates whether an operation is prohibited by a block public access setting, it
rejects any request that violates an organization policy (which enforces the account BPA
setting) or an access point, bucket, or account setting.

###### Important

Public access is granted to buckets and objects through access control lists (ACLs), access
point policies, bucket policies, or all. To help ensure that all of your
Amazon S3 access points, buckets, and objects have their public access blocked,
we recommend that you turn on all four settings for block public access for your
account. For organizations managing multiple accounts, consider using organization-level
Block Public Access policies for centralized control. Additionally, we recommend that
you also turn on all four settings for each bucket to comply with AWS Security Hub
Foundational Security Best Practices control S3.8. These settings block public access
for all current and future buckets and access points.

Before applying these settings, verify that your applications will work
correctly without public access. If you require some level of public access to your
buckets or objects, for example to host a static website as described at [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](websitehosting.md), you can customize the
individual settings to suit your storage use cases.

Enabling Block Public Access helps protect your resources by preventing public access from
being granted through the resource policies or access control lists (ACLs) that are
directly attached to S3 resources. In addition to enabling Block Public Access,
carefully inspect the following policies to confirm that they don't grant public
access:

- Identity-based policies attached to associated AWS principals (for example, IAM roles)

- Resource-based policies attached to associated AWS resources (for example, AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys)

###### Note

- You can enable block public access settings only for organizations, access points, buckets, and
AWS accounts. Amazon S3 doesn't support block public access settings on a
per-object basis.

- When you apply block public access settings to an account, the settings apply
to all AWS Regions globally. The settings might not take effect in all Regions
immediately or simultaneously, but they eventually propagate to all
Regions.

- When you apply organization-level block public access policies, they
automatically propagate to selected member accounts and override account-level
settings.

## Block public access settings

S3 Block Public Access provides four settings. You can apply these settings in any
combination to individual access points, buckets, or entire AWS accounts. At the organization
level, you can only enable or disable all four settings together using an "all" or
"none" approach - granular control over individual settings is not available. If you
apply a setting to an account, it applies to all buckets and access points that are owned by
that account. Account-level settings automatically inherit from organization policies
when present. Similarly, if you apply a setting to a bucket, it applies to all access points
associated with that bucket.

The policy inheritance and enforcement works as follows:

- Organization-level policies automatically apply to member accounts, enforcing
any existing account-level settings

- Account-level setting inherit from organization policies when present, or use
locally configured settings when no organization policy exists

- Bucket-level settings operate independently but are subject to enforcement
restrictions. S3 applies the most restrictive combination across all applicable
levels - organization/account-level and bucket-level settings. This means a
bucket inherits the baseline protection from its account (which may be
organization-managed), but S3 will enforce whichever configuration is more
restrictive between the bucket's settings and the account's effective
settings.

The following table contains the available settings.

NameDescription`BlockPublicAcls`

Setting this option to `TRUE` causes the following
behavior:

- `PutBucketAcl` and `PutObjectAcl` calls fail if the specified
access control list (ACL) is public.

- `PutObject` calls fail if the request includes a public ACL.

- If this setting is applied to an account, then `PUT Bucket` calls fail if
the request includes a public ACL.

When this setting is set to `TRUE`, the specified operations fail (whether
made through the REST API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs). However, existing
policies and ACLs for buckets and objects aren't modified. This
setting enables you to protect against public access while allowing
you to audit, refine, or otherwise alter the existing policies and
ACLs for your buckets and objects.

###### Note

Access points don't have ACLs associated with them. If you
apply this setting to an access point, it acts as a passthrough to the
underlying bucket. If an access point has this setting enabled, requests
made through the access point behave as though the underlying bucket has
this setting enabled, regardless of whether the bucket actually
has this setting enabled.

`IgnorePublicAcls`

Setting this option to `TRUE` causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on a
bucket and any objects that it contains. This setting enables you to
safely block public access granted by ACLs while still allowing
`PutObject` calls that include a public ACL (as
opposed to `BlockPublicAcls`, which rejects
`PutObject` calls that include a public ACL).
Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing
ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

###### Note

Access points don't have ACLs associated with them. If you
apply this setting to an access point, it acts as a passthrough to the
underlying bucket. If an access point has this setting enabled, requests
made through the access point behave as though the underlying bucket has
this setting enabled, regardless of whether the bucket actually
has this setting enabled.

`BlockPublicPolicy`

Setting this option to `TRUE` for a bucket causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to
`PutBucketPolicy` if the specified bucket policy
allows public access. Setting this option to `TRUE` for a
bucket also causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to
`PutAccessPointPolicy` for all of the bucket's
same-account access points if the specified policy allows public access.

Setting this option to `TRUE` for an access point causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to
`PutAccessPointPolicy` and
`PutBucketPolicy` that are made through the access point if
the specified policy (for either the access point or the underlying bucket)
allows public access.

You can use this setting to allow users to manage access point and bucket
policies without allowing them to publicly share the bucket or the
objects it contains. Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing
access point or bucket policies.

###### Important

To use this setting effectively, we recommend that you apply
it at the _account_ level. A bucket policy
can allow users to alter a bucket's block public access
settings. Therefore, users who have permission to change a
bucket policy could insert a policy that allows them to disable
the block public access settings for the bucket. If this setting
is enabled for the entire account, rather than for a specific
bucket, Amazon S3 blocks public policies even if a user alters the
bucket policy to disable this setting.

`RestrictPublicBuckets`

Setting this option to `TRUE` restricts access to an
access point or bucket with a public policy to only AWS service principals
and authorized users within the bucket owner's account and access point
owner's account. This setting blocks all cross-account access to the
access point or bucket (except by AWS service principals), while still
allowing users within the account to manage the access point or
bucket.

Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing access point or bucket
policies, except that Amazon S3 blocks public and cross-account access
derived from any public access point or bucket policy, including non-public
delegation to specific accounts.

###### Important

- Calls to `GetBucketAcl` and `GetObjectAcl` always return the
effective permissions in place for the specified bucket or object. For
example, suppose that a bucket has an ACL that grants public access, but the
bucket also has the `IgnorePublicAcls` setting enabled. In this
case, `GetBucketAcl` returns an ACL that reflects the access
permissions that Amazon S3 is enforcing, rather than the actual ACL that is
associated with the bucket.

- Block public access settings don't alter existing policies or ACLs.
Therefore, removing a block public access setting causes a bucket or object
with a public policy or ACL to again be publicly accessible.

## Managing block public access at organization level

Organization-level block public access uses AWS Organizations policies to centrally manage S3 public
access controls across your entire organization. When enabled, these policies
automatically apply to selected accounts and override individual account-level
settings.

For additional information on block public access at an organization level, see [S3 policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_s3.html) in the _AWS Organizations user_
_guide_.

## Performing block public access operations on an access point

To perform block public access operations on an access point, use the AWS CLI service
`s3control`.

###### Important

You can't change an access point's block public access settings after creating the access point.
You can specify block public access settings for an access point only when creating the
access point.

## The meaning of "public"

### ACLs

Amazon S3 considers a bucket or object ACL public if it grants any
permissions to members of the predefined `AllUsers` or
`AuthenticatedUsers` groups. For more information
about predefined groups, see [Amazon S3 predefined groups](acl-overview.md#specifying-grantee-predefined-groups).

### Bucket policies

When evaluating a bucket policy, Amazon S3 begins by assuming that the policy is public. It
then evaluates the policy to determine whether it qualifies as non-public. To be
considered non-public, a bucket policy must grant access only to fixed values
(values that don't contain a wildcard or [an AWS Identity and Access Management\
Policy Variable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html)) for one or more of the following:

- An AWS principal, user, role, or service principal (e.g.
`aws:PrincipalOrgID`)

- A set of Classless Inter-Domain Routings (CIDR) blocks, using `aws:SourceIp`.
For more information about CIDR, see [RFC 4632](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4632.txt) on the RFC
Editor website.

###### Note

Bucket policies that grant access conditioned on the `aws:SourceIp` condition
key with very broad IP ranges (for example, 0.0.0.0/1) are evaluated as
"public." This includes values broader than `/8` for IPv4 and
`/32` for IPv6 (excluding RFC1918 private ranges). Block
public access will reject these "public" policies and prevent cross-account
access to buckets that are already using these "public" policies.

- `aws:SourceArn`

- `aws:SourceVpc`

- `aws:SourceVpce`

- `aws:SourceOwner`

- `aws:SourceAccount`

- `aws:userid`, outside the pattern
" `AROLEID:*`"

- `s3:DataAccessPointArn`

###### Note

When used in a bucket policy, this value can contain a wildcard for the access point name
without rendering the policy public, as long as the account ID is fixed. For
example, allowing access to
`arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/*` would
permit access to any access point associated with account `123456789012`
in Region `us-west-2`, without rendering the bucket policy
public. This behavior is different for access point policies. For more information,
see [Access points](#access-control-block-public-access-policy-status-access-points).

- `s3:DataAccessPointAccount`

For more information about bucket policies, see [Bucket policies for Amazon S3](bucket-policies.md).

###### Note

When using [multivalued context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-single-vs-multi-valued-context-keys.html), you must use the `ForAllValues` or
`ForAnyValue` set operators.

###### Example: Public bucket policies

Under these rules, the following example policies are considered
public.

```json

{
		"Principal": "*",
		"Resource": "*",
		"Action": "s3:PutObject",
		"Effect": "Allow"
	}
```

```json

{
		"Principal": "*",
		"Resource": "*",
		"Action": "s3:PutObject",
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Condition": { "StringLike": {"aws:SourceVpc": "vpc-*"}}
	}
```

You can make these policies non-public by including any of the
condition keys listed previously, using a fixed value. For example,
you can make the last policy preceding non-public by setting
`aws:SourceVpc` to a fixed value, like the
following.

```json

{
		"Principal": "*",
		"Resource": "*",
		"Action": "s3:PutObject",
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Condition": {"StringEquals": {"aws:SourceVpc": "vpc-91237329"}}
	}
```

### How Amazon S3 evaluates a bucket policy that contains both public and non-public access grants

This example shows how Amazon S3 evaluates a bucket policy that contains both
public and non-public access grants.

Suppose that a bucket has a policy that grants access to a set of fixed
principals. Under the previously described rules, this policy isn't public.
Thus, if you enable the `RestrictPublicBuckets` setting, the policy
remains in effect as written, because `RestrictPublicBuckets` only
applies to buckets that have public policies. However, if you add a public
statement to the policy, `RestrictPublicBuckets` takes effect on the
bucket. It allows only AWS service principals and authorized users of the
bucket owner's account to access the bucket.

As an example, suppose that a bucket owned by "Account-1" has a policy that
contains the following:

1. A statement that grants access to AWS CloudTrail (which is an AWS service
    principal)

2. A statement that grants access to account "Account-2"

3. A statement that grants access to the public, for example by
    specifying `"Principal": "*"` with no limiting
    `Condition`

This policy qualifies as public because of the third statement. With this
policy in place and `RestrictPublicBuckets` enabled, Amazon S3 allows
access only by CloudTrail. Even though statement 2 isn't public, Amazon S3 disables access
by "Account-2." This is because statement 3 renders the entire policy public, so
`RestrictPublicBuckets` applies. As a result, Amazon S3 disables
cross-account access, even though the policy delegates access to a specific
account, "Account-2." But if you remove statement 3 from the policy, then the
policy doesn't qualify as public, and `RestrictPublicBuckets` no
longer applies. Thus, "Account-2" regains access to the bucket, even if you
leave `RestrictPublicBuckets` enabled.

### Access points

Amazon S3 evaluates block public access settings slightly differently for access points
compared to buckets. The rules that Amazon S3 applies to determine when an access point policy is
public are generally the same for access points as for buckets, except in the following
situations:

- An access point that has a VPC network origin is always considered non-public,
regardless of the contents of its access point policy.

- An access point policy that grants access to a set of access points using
`s3:DataAccessPointArn` is considered public. Note that this
behavior is different than for bucket policies. For example, a bucket policy
that grants access to values of `s3:DataAccessPointArn` that
match `arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/*` is not
considered public. However, the same statement in an access point policy would
render the access point public.

## Using IAM Access Analyzer for S3 to review public buckets

You can use IAM Access Analyzer for S3 to review buckets with bucket ACLs, bucket policies, or access point
policies that grant public access. IAM Access Analyzer for S3 alerts you to buckets that are configured
to allow access to anyone on the internet or other AWS accounts, including
AWS accounts outside of your organization. For each public or shared bucket, you
receive findings that report the source and level of public or shared access.

In IAM Access Analyzer for S3, you can block all public access to a bucket with a
single click. You can also drill down into bucket-level permission settings to configure
granular levels of access. For specific and verified use cases that require public or
shared access, you can acknowledge and record your intent for the bucket to remain
public or shared by archiving the findings for the bucket.

In rare cases, IAM Access Analyzer for S3 and Amazon S3 block public access evaluation might differ on whether a
bucket is public. This behavior occurs because Amazon S3 block public access performs
validation on the existence of actions in addition to evaluating public access. Suppose
that the bucket policy contains an `Action` statement that allows public
access for an action that isn't supported by Amazon S3 (for example,
`s3:NotASupportedAction`). In this case, Amazon S3 block public access
evaluates the bucket as public because such a statement could potentially make the
bucket public if the action later becomes supported. In cases where Amazon S3 block public
access and IAM Access Analyzer for S3 differ in their evaluations, we recommend reviewing the bucket
policy and removing any unsupported actions.

For more information about IAM Access Analyzer for S3, see [Reviewing bucket access using IAM Access Analyzer for S3](access-analyzer.md).

## Permissions

To use Amazon S3 Block Public Access features, you must have the following
permissions.

OperationRequired permissions`GET` bucket policy status`s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus``GET` bucket Block Public Access settings`s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock``PUT` bucket Block Public Access settings`s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock``DELETE` bucket Block Public Access settings`s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock``GET` account Block Public Access settings`s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock``PUT` account Block Public Access settings`s3:PutAccountPublicAccessBlock``DELETE` account Block Public Access settings`s3:PutAccountPublicAccessBlock``PUT` access point Block Public Access settings`s3:CreateAccessPoint`

###### Note

The `DELETE` operations require the same permissions as the `PUT`
operations. There are no separate permissions for the `DELETE`
operations.
