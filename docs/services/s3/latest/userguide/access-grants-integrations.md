# S3 Access Grants integrations

S3 Access Grants can be used with the following AWS services and features. This page will be updated as new integrations become available.

###### Tip

This [AWS workshop for S3 Access Grants](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/77b0af63-6ad2-4c94-bfc0-270eb9358c7a/en-US/0-getting-started) walks you through using S3 Access Grants with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, IAM Identity Center users, Amazon EMR, and AWS Transfer Family.

**Amazon Athena**

**Amazon EMR**

**Amazon EMR on EKS**

**Amazon EMR Serverless application**

**Amazon Redshift**

**Amazon SageMaker AI Studio**

[Adding Amazon S3 data to Amazon SageMaker AI Unified Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/adding-existing-s3-data.html)

Using S3 Access Grants in Amazon SageMaker AI Unified Studio, you can share your Amazon S3 data in multiple projects. To enable granting access to data using S3 Access Grants, an S3 Access Grants instance is required. Amazon SageMaker AI Unified Studio will use an S3 Access Grants instance if one is already available or can create an instance. First, you add your Amazon S3 data and then publish the data to the catalog or share it directly with consumers.

Using S3 Access Grants in Amazon SageMaker AI Studio notebooks is now easier when using the SDK for Python (Boto3) plugin. Set up access grants for IAM principals and AWS IAM Identity Center directory users, beforehand. Although Amazon SageMaker AI Studio does not natively support identity provider directory users, you can write custom Python code, using the plugin that allows these identities to access S3 data via S3 Access Grants. The data access is taking place with the help of the plugin and not through Amazon SageMaker AI.

**AWS Glue**
