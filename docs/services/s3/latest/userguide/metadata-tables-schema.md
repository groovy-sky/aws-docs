# S3 Metadata journal tables schema

The journal table records changes made to your data in near real time, helping you to identify new
data uploaded to your bucket, track recently deleted objects, monitor lifecycle transitions, and more. The
journal table records new objects and updates to your objects and their metadata (those updates that
require either a `PUT` or a `DELETE` operation). Because this table is queryable,
you can audit the changes to your bucket through simple SQL queries.

You can use the journal table for security, auditing, and compliance use cases to track uploaded,
deleted, and changed objects in the bucket. For example, you can query the journal table to answer
questions such as:

- Which objects were deleted in the past 24 hours by S3 Lifecycle?

- Which IP addresses did the most recent `PUT` requests come from?

- Which AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys were used for `PUT` requests in the past 7 days?

- Which objects in your bucket were created by Amazon Bedrock in the last five days?

Amazon S3 Metadata journal tables contain rows and columns. Each row represents a mutation event that has
created, updated, or deleted an object in your general purpose bucket. Most of these events result from
user actions, but some of these events result from actions taken by Amazon S3 on your behalf, such as
S3 Lifecycle expirations or storage class transitions.

S3 Metadata journal tables are eventually consistent with the changes that have occurred in your
general purpose bucket. In some cases, by the time S3 Metadata is notified that an object is created or
updated, that object might already have been overwritten or deleted in the bucket. In such cases, the
objects can no longer be retrieved and some columns might show a NULL value to indicate missing metadata
schema.

The following is an example of a journal table for a general purpose bucket named
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket:`

Journal tables have the following schema:

Column nameRequired?Data type

`bucket`

YesStringThe general purpose bucket name. For more information, see [General purpose bucket naming rules](bucketnamingrules.md).

`key`

YesStringThe object key name (or key) that uniquely identifies the object in the bucket. For
more information, see [Naming Amazon S3 objects](object-keys.md).

`sequence_number`

YesString

The sequence number, which is an ordinal that's included in the records for a given
object. To order records of the same bucket and key, you can sort on
`sequence_number`. For a given bucket and key, a lexicographically larger
`sequence_number` value implies that the record was introduced to the
bucket more recently.

`record_type`

YesString

The type of this record, one of `CREATE`, `UPDATE_METADATA`,
or `DELETE`.

`CREATE` records indicate that a new object (or a new version of the
object) was written to the bucket.

`UPDATE_METADATA` records capture changes to mutable metadata for an
existing object, such as the storage class or tags.

`DELETE` records indicate that this object (or this version of the
object) has been deleted. When versioning is enabled, `DELETE` records
represent either a delete marker or a permanent delete. They are further disambiguated by consulting the optional `is_delete_marker` column.

For more information, see [Deleting object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket](deletingobjectversions.md).

###### Note

A permanent delete carries `NULL` s in all columns, _except_ `bucket`, `key`, `sequence_number`, `record_type`, `record_timestamp`, and `version_id` (i.e. those columns marked as Required).

`record_timestamp`

YesTimestamp NTZ (no time zone)

The timestamp that's associated with this record.

`version_id`

NoString

The object's version ID. When you enable versioning on a bucket, Amazon S3 assigns a
version number to objects that are added to the bucket. For more information, see
[Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md).

Objects that are stored in your bucket before you set the versioning state have a
version ID of null.

`is_delete_marker`

NoBoolean

The object's delete marker status. For DELETE records that are delete markers, this value is
`TRUE`. For permanent deletions, this value is omitted ( `NULL`). Other record types (CREATE and UPDATE\_METADATA) have value `FALSE`. For more information, see
[Working with delete markers](deletemarker.md).

###### Note

Rows that are added for delete markers have a `record_type` value of
`DELETE`, not `UPDATE_METADATA`. If the delete marker is
created as the result of an S3 Lifecycle expiration, the `requester`
value is `s3.amazonaws.com`.

`size`

NoLong

The object size in bytes, not including the size of incomplete multipart uploads or
object metadata. If `is_delete_marker` is `TRUE`, the size is
`0`. For more information, see [System-defined object metadata](usingmetadata.md#SysMetadata).

`last_modified_date`

NoTimestamp NTZ (no time zone)

The object creation date or the last modified date, whichever is the latest. For
multipart uploads, the object creation date is the date when the multipart upload is
initiated. For more information, see [System-defined object metadata](usingmetadata.md#SysMetadata).

`e_tag`

NoString

The entity tag (ETag), which is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes
only to the contents of an object, not to its metadata. The ETag can be an MD5 digest of
the object data. Whether the ETag is an MD5 digest depends on how the object was created
and how it's encrypted. For more information, see [Object](../api/api-object.md) in the
_Amazon S3 API Reference_.

`storage_class`

NoString

The storage class that’s used for storing the object. One of `STANDARD`,
`REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`, `STANDARD_IA`, `ONEZONE_IA`,
`INTELLIGENT_TIERING`, `GLACIER`, `DEEP_ARCHIVE`, or
`GLACIER_IR`. For more information, see [Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes](storage-class-intro.md).

`is_multipart`

NoBoolean

The object's upload type. If the object was uploaded as a multipart upload, this
value is `TRUE`. Otherwise, it's `FALSE`. For more information,
see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md).

`encryption_status`

NoString

The object's server-side encryption status, depending on what kind of encryption key is used:
server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with
AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with customer-provided keys
(SSE-C). If the object is unencrypted, this value is null. Possible values are
`SSE-S3`, `SSE-KMS`, `DSSE-KMS`,
`SSE-C`, or null. For more information, see [Protecting data with encryption](usingencryption.md).

`is_bucket_key_enabled`

NoBoolean

The object's S3 Bucket Key enablement status. If the object uses an S3 Bucket Key
for SSE-KMS, this value is `TRUE`. Otherwise, it's `FALSE`. For
more information, see [Configuring an S3 Bucket Key at the object level](configuring-bucket-key-object.md).

`kms_key_arn`

NoString

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key with which the object is encrypted,
for rows where `encryption_status` is `SSE-KMS` or
`DSSE-KMS`. If the object isn't encrypted with SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS, the
value is null. For more information, see [Using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)](usingkmsencryption.md) and
[Using dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS)](usingdssencryption.md).

###### Note

If a row represents an object version that no longer existed at the time that a
delete or overwrite event was processed, `kms_key_arn` contains a null
value, even if the `encryption_status` column value is
`SSE-KMS` or `DSSE-KMS`.

`checksum_algorithm`

NoString

The algorithm that’s used to create the checksum for the object, one of
`CRC64NVME`, `CRC32`, `CRC32C`, `SHA1`,
or `SHA256`. If no checksum is present, this value is null. For more
information, see [Using supported checksum algorithms](checking-object-integrity-upload.md#using-additional-checksums).

`object_tags`

NoMap <String, String>

The object tags that are associated with the object. Object tags are stored as a map of
key-value pairs. If an object has no object tags, an empty map ( `{}`) is stored. For
more information, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

###### Note

If the `record_type` value is `DELETE`, the
`object_tags` column contains a null value. If the
`record_type` value is `CREATE` or
`UPDATE_METADATA`, rows that represent object versions that no longer
existed at the time that a delete or overwrite event was processed will contain a
null value in the `object_tags` column.

`user_metadata`

NoMap <String, String>

The user metadata that's associated with the object. User metadata is stored as a
map of key-value pairs. If an object has no user metadata, an empty map
( `{}`) is stored. For more information, see [User-defined object metadata](usingmetadata.md#UserMetadata).

###### Note

If the `record_type` value is `DELETE`, the
`user_metadata` column contains a null value. If the
`record_type` value is `CREATE` or
`UPDATE_METADATA`, rows that represent object versions that no longer
existed at the time that a delete or overwrite event was processed will contain a
null value in the `user_metadata` column.

`requester`

NoString

The AWS account ID of the requester or the AWS service principal that made the request. For example,
if the requester is S3 Lifecycle, this value is `s3.amazonaws.com`.

`source_ip_address`

NoString

The source IP address of the request. For records that are generated by a user request, this
column contains the source IP address of the request. For actions taken by Amazon S3 or
another AWS service on behalf of the user, this column contains a null value.

`request_id`

NoString

The request ID that's associated with the request.
