# Delete an object through an access point for a general purpose bucket

This section explains how to delete an object through an access point for a general purpose bucket using the AWS Management Console,
AWS Command Line Interface, or REST API.

###### To delete an object or objects through an access point in your AWS account

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the
    currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region that you want to
    list access points for.

3. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose
    **Access Points**.

4. (Optional) Search for access points by name. Only access points in your selected AWS Region will appear here.

5. Choose the name of the access point you want to manage or use.

6. Under the **Objects** tab, select the name of
    the object or objects you wish to delete.

7. Review the objects listed for deletion, and type _delete_ in the confirmation box.

8. Choose **Delete objects**.

The following `delete-object` example command shows how you can
use the AWS CLI to delete an object through an access point.

The following command deletes the existing object `puppy.jpg` using access point
`my-access-point`.

```nohighlight

aws s3api delete-object --bucket arn:aws:s3:AWS Region:111122223333:accesspoint/my-access-point --key puppy.jpg
```

###### Note

S3 automatically generate access point aliases for all access points and access point aliases can be used
anywhere a bucket name is used to perform object-level operations. For more
information, see [Access point aliases](access-points-naming.md#access-points-alias).

For more information and examples, see [delete-object](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/delete-object.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

You can use the REST API to delete an object through an access point. For more information, see [DeleteObject](../api/api-deleteobject.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.
