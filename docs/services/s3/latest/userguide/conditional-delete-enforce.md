# Enforce conditional deletes on Amazon S3 buckets

By using Amazon S3 bucket policies, you can enforce `If-Match` header
with conditional deletes for objects in general purpose buckets.
If the `If-Match` header doesn’t exist,
the request will be denied with an `403 Access Denied`.
A bucket policy is a resource-based policy that you can use to grant access permissions
to your bucket and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner can associate a policy with a bucket.
For more information about bucket policies, see [Bucket policies for Amazon S3](bucket-policies.md).

The following examples show how to use conditions in a bucket policy to force clients
to use the `If-Match` HTTP header.

## Example 1: Only allow conditional deletes using the `If-Match` header with the `ETag` value

You can use this bucket policy to only allow conditional deletes using
`DeleteObject` and `DeleteObjects` requests that include
the `If-Match` header with the `ETag` value. All
non-conditional deletes would be denied and conditional deletes would pass.
