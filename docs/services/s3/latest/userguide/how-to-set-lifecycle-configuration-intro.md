# Setting an S3 Lifecycle configuration on a bucket

You can set an Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration on a bucket by using the Amazon S3 console,
the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS SDKs, or the Amazon S3 REST API. For information about
S3 Lifecycle configuration, see [Managing the lifecycle of objects](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md).

###### Note

To view or edit the lifecycle configuration for a directory bucket, use the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or the Amazon S3 REST API. For more information, see [Working with S3 Lifecycle for directory buckets](directory-buckets-objects-lifecycle.md).

In your S3 Lifecycle configuration, you use _lifecycle_
_rules_ to define actions that you want Amazon S3 to take during an object's
lifetime. For example, you can define rules to transition objects to another storage class,
archive objects, or expire (delete) objects after a specified period of time.

## S3 Lifecycle considerations

Before you set a lifecycle configuration, note the following:

###### Lifecycle configuration propagation delay

When you add an S3 Lifecycle configuration to a bucket, there is usually some
lag before a new or updated Lifecycle configuration is fully propagated to all the
Amazon S3 systems. Expect a delay of a few minutes before the configuration fully takes
effect. This delay can also occur when you delete an S3 Lifecycle
configuration.

###### Transition or expiration delay

There's a delay between when a lifecycle rule is satisfied and when the action for the
rule is completed. For example, suppose that a set of objects is expired by a lifecycle
rule on January 1. Even though the expiration rule has been satisfied on January 1, Amazon S3
might not actually delete these objects until days or even weeks later. This delay
occurs because S3 Lifecycle queues objects for transitions or expirations asynchronously.
When you add or modify a Lifecycle rule, S3 Lifecycle may begin processing eligible objects immediately or with some delay. When S3 Lifecycle creates a delete marker or transitions an object, the timestamp is set to midnight UTC on the day the action occurred, regardless of the actual time the action was taken.
However, changes in billing are usually applied when the lifecycle rule is satisfied,
even if the action isn't complete. For more information, see [Changes in billing](#lifecycle-billing). To monitor the effect of
updates made by active lifecycle rules, see [How do I monitor the actions taken by my lifecycle rules?](troubleshoot-lifecycle.md#troubleshoot-lifecycle-2)

###### Note

When a lifecycle rule is created or modified, objects that already meet the eligibility criteria may be processed immediately.

###### Updating, disabling, or deleting lifecycle rules

When you disable or delete lifecycle rules, Amazon S3 stops scheduling new objects
for deletion or transition after a small delay. Any objects that were already scheduled
are unscheduled and are not deleted or transitioned.

###### Note

Before updating, disabling, or deleting lifecycle rules, use the `LIST` API
operations (such as [ListObjectsV2](../api/api-listobjectsv2.md), [ListObjectVersions](../api/api-listobjectversions.md), and [ListMultipartUploads](../api/api-listmultipartuploads.md)) or [Cataloging and analyzing your data with S3 Inventory](storage-inventory.md) to verify that Amazon S3
has transitioned and expired eligible objects based on your use cases. If you're
experiencing any issues with updating, disabling, or deleting lifecycle rules, see [Troubleshooting Amazon S3 Lifecycle issues](troubleshoot-lifecycle.md).

###### Existing and new objects

When you add a Lifecycle configuration to a bucket, the configuration rules apply to
both existing objects and objects that you add later. For example, if you add a
Lifecycle configuration rule today with an expiration action that causes objects with a
specific prefix to expire 30 days after creation, Amazon S3 will queue for removal any
existing objects that are more than 30 days old and that have the specified
prefix.

###### Monitoring the effect of lifecycle rules

To monitor the effect of updates made by active lifecycle rules, see [How do I monitor the actions taken by my lifecycle rules?](troubleshoot-lifecycle.md#troubleshoot-lifecycle-2)

###### Changes in billing

There might be a lag between when the Lifecycle configuration rules are satisfied
and when the action triggered by satisfying the rule is taken. However, changes in
billing happen as soon as the Lifecycle configuration rule is satisfied, even if the
action isn't yet taken.

For example, after the object expiration time, you aren't charged for storage, even if the
object isn't deleted immediately. Likewise, as soon as the object transition time elapses,
you're charged S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage rates, even if the object isn't
immediately transitioned to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class.

However, lifecycle transitions to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class are the
exception. Changes in billing don't happen until after the object has transitioned into the
S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

###### Multiple or conflicting rules

When you have multiple rules in an S3 Lifecycle configuration, an object can become
eligible for multiple S3 Lifecycle actions on the same day. In such cases, Amazon S3 follows
these general rules:

- Permanent deletion takes precedence over transition.

- Transition takes precedence over creation of [delete\
markers](deletemarker.md).

- When an object is eligible for both an S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and an
S3 Standard-IA (or an S3 One Zone-IA) transition, Amazon S3 chooses the
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval transition.

For examples, see [Examples of overlapping filters and conflicting lifecycle actions](lifecycle-conflicts.md#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex5).

## How to set an S3 Lifecycle configuration

You can set an Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration on a general purpose bucket by using the Amazon S3 console,
the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS SDKs, or the Amazon S3 REST API.

For information about AWS CloudFormation templates and examples, see [Working with AWS CloudFormation templates](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/template-guide.md) and [AWS::S3::Bucket](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-resource-s3-bucket.md#aws-resource-s3-bucket--examples) in the _CloudFormation User_
_Guide_.

You can define lifecycle rules for all objects or a subset of objects in a bucket by using a
shared prefix (objects names that begin with a common string) or a tag. In your lifecycle rule,
you can define actions specific to current and noncurrent object versions. For more information,
see the following:

- [Managing the lifecycle of objects](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)

- [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md)

###### To create a lifecycle rule

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

03. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to
     create a lifecycle rule for.

04. Choose the **Management** tab, and choose **Create lifecycle**
    **rule**.

05. In **Lifecycle rule name**, enter a name for your rule.

    The name must be unique within the bucket.

06. Choose the scope of the lifecycle rule:

- To apply this lifecycle rule to _all objects with a specific prefix or_
_tag_, choose **Limit the scope to specific prefixes or**
**tags**.

- To limit the scope by prefix, in **Prefix**, enter the prefix.

- To limit the scope by tag, choose **Add tag**, and enter the
tag key and value.

For more information about object name prefixes, see [Naming Amazon S3 objects](object-keys.md). For more information about object tags, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

- To apply this lifecycle rule to _all objects in the bucket_,
choose **This rule applies to _all_ objects in the**
**bucket**, and then choose **I acknowledge that this rule applies to**
**all objects in the bucket**.

07. To filter a rule by object size, you can select **Specify minimum object**
    **size**, **Specify maximum object size**, or both options.

- When you're specifying a value for **Minimum object size** or
**Maximum object size**, the value must be larger than 0 bytes and up
to 50 TB. You can specify this value in bytes, KB, MB, or GB.

- When you're specifying both values, the maximum object size must be larger than the
minimum object size.

###### Note

The **Minimum object size** and **Maximum object**
**size** filters exclude the specified values. For example, if you set a
filter to expire objects that have a **Minimum object size** of 128
KB, objects that are exactly 128 KB don't expire. Instead, the rule applies only to
objects that are greater than 128 KB in size.

08. Under **Lifecycle rule actions**, choose the actions that you want your
     lifecycle rule to perform:

- Transition _current_ versions of objects between
storage classes

- Transition _previous_ versions of objects between
storage classes

- Expire _current_ versions of objects

###### Note

For buckets that don't have [S3 Versioning](versioning.md)
enabled, expiring current versions causes Amazon S3 to permanently delete the objects. For
more information, see [Lifecycle actions and bucket versioning state](intro-lifecycle-rules.md#lifecycle-actions-bucket-versioning-state).

- Permanently delete _previous_ versions of
objects

- Delete expired delete markers or incomplete multipart uploads

Depending on the actions that you choose, different options appear.

09. To transition _current_ versions of objects between
     storage classes, under **Transition current versions of objects between storage**
    **classes**, do the following:

    1. In **Storage class transitions**, choose the storage class to
        transition to. For a list of possible transitions, see [Supported lifecycle transitions](lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md#supported-lifecycle-transitions). You can choose from the following storage
        classes:

- S3 Standard-IA

- S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- S3 One Zone-IA

- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive

    2. In **Days after object creation**, enter the number of days after
        creation to transition the object.

For more information about storage classes, see [Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes](storage-class-intro.md). You can define transitions for current or previous
object versions or for both current and previous versions. Versioning enables you to keep
multiple versions of an object in one bucket. For more information about versioning, see
[Using the S3 console](manage-versioning-examples.md#enable-versioning).

###### Important

When you choose the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or
Glacier Deep Archive storage class, your objects remain in Amazon S3. You cannot access them
directly through the separate Amazon Glacier service. For more information, see [Transitioning objects using Amazon S3 Lifecycle](lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md).

10. To transition _noncurrent_ versions of objects between
     storage classes, under **Transition noncurrent versions of objects between storage**
    **classes**, do the following:
    1. In **Storage class transitions**, choose the storage class to
        transition to. For a list of possible transitions, see [Supported lifecycle transitions](lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md#supported-lifecycle-transitions). You can choose from the following storage
        classes:

- S3 Standard-IA

- S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- S3 One Zone-IA

- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive

    2. In **Days after object becomes noncurrent**, enter the number of
        days after creation to transition the object.
11. To expire _current_ versions of objects, under
     **Expire current versions of objects**, in **Number of days after**
    **object creation**, enter the number of days.

    ###### Important

    In a nonversioned bucket, the expiration action results in Amazon S3 permanently removing
    the object. For more information about lifecycle actions, see [Elements to describe lifecycle actions](intro-lifecycle-rules.md#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions).

12. To permanently delete previous versions of objects, under **Permanently delete**
    **noncurrent versions of objects**, in **Days after objects become**
    **noncurrent**, enter the number of days. You can optionally specify the number of
     newer versions to retain by entering a value under **Number of newer versions to**
    **retain**.

13. Under **Delete expired delete markers or incomplete multipart**
    **uploads**, choose **Delete expired object delete markers** and
     **Delete incomplete multipart uploads**. Then, enter the number of days
     after the multipart upload initiation that you want to end and clean up incomplete multipart
     uploads.

    For more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md).

14. Choose **Create rule**.

    If the rule does not contain any errors, Amazon S3 enables it, and you can see it on the
     **Management** tab under **Lifecycle rules**.

You can use the following AWS CLI commands to manage S3 Lifecycle configurations:

- `put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration`

- `get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration`

- `delete-bucket-lifecycle`

For instructions on setting up the AWS CLI, see [Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI](../api/setup-aws-cli.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

The Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration is an XML file. But when you're using the AWS CLI, you
cannot specify the XML format. You must specify the JSON format instead. The
following are example XML lifecycle configurations and the equivalent JSON
configurations that you can specify in an AWS CLIcommand.

Consider the following example S3 Lifecycle configuration.

###### Example 1

                        },
                        {
                            "Value": "mytagvalue2",
                            "Key": "mytagkey2"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "Status": "Enabled",

                "Days": 1
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can test the `put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration` as follows.

###### To test the configuration

1. Save the JSON Lifecycle configuration in a file (for example,
    `lifecycle.json`).

2. Run the following AWS CLI command to set the Lifecycle configuration on your
    bucket. Replace the `user input
                               placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

$ aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration  \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket  \
   --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
```

3. To verify, retrieve the S3 Lifecycle configuration by using the
    `get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration` AWS CLI command as
    follows:

```nohighlight

$ aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration  \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket
```

4. To delete the S3 Lifecycle configuration, use the
    `delete-bucket-lifecycle` AWS CLI command as follows:

```nohighlight

aws s3api delete-bucket-lifecycle \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket
```

Java

You can use the AWS SDK for Java to manage the S3 Lifecycle configuration of a bucket. For more information about managing S3 Lifecycle configuration, see [Managing the lifecycle of objects](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md).

###### Note

When you add an S3 Lifecycle configuration to a bucket, Amazon S3 replaces the bucket's current Lifecycle configuration, if there is one. To update a configuration, you retrieve it, make the desired changes, and then add the revised configuration to the bucket.

To manage lifecycle configuration using the AWS SDK for Java, you can:

- Add a Lifecycle configuration to a bucket.

- Retrieve the Lifecycle configuration and update it by adding another rule.

- Add the modified Lifecycle configuration to the bucket. Amazon S3 replaces the existing configuration.

- Retrieve the configuration again and verify that it has the right number of rules by printing the number of rules.

- Delete the Lifecycle configuration and verify that it has been deleted by attempting to retrieve it again.

For examples of how to set lifecycle configuration on a bucket with the AWS SDK for Java, see [Set lifecycle configuration on a bucket](../api/s3-example-s3-putbucketlifecycleconfiguration-section.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

.NET

You can use the AWS SDK for .NET to manage the S3 Lifecycle configuration on a bucket. For
more information about managing Lifecycle configuration, see [Managing the lifecycle of objects](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md).

###### Note

When you add a Lifecycle configuration, Amazon S3 replaces the existing configuration
on the specified bucket. To update a configuration, you must first retrieve the
Lifecycle configuration, make the changes, and then add the revised Lifecycle
configuration to the bucket.

The following example shows how to use the AWS SDK for .NET to add, update, and
delete a bucket's Lifecycle configuration. The code example does the
following:

- Adds a Lifecycle configuration to a bucket.

- Retrieves the Lifecycle configuration and updates it by adding another
rule.

- Adds the modified Lifecycle configuration to the bucket. Amazon S3 replaces the
existing Lifecycle configuration.

- Retrieves the configuration again and verifies it by printing the number
of rules in the configuration.

- Deletes the Lifecycle configuration and verifies the
deletion.

For information about setting up and running the code examples, see [Getting\
Started with the AWS SDK for .NET](../../../../reference/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config.md) in the _AWS SDK for .NET_
_Developer Guide_.

Ruby

You can use the AWS SDK for Ruby to manage an S3 Lifecycle configuration
on a bucket by using the class [AWS::S3::BucketLifecycleConfiguration](../../../../reference/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/aws/s3/bucketlifecycle.md).
For more information about managing S3 Lifecycle configuration, see
[Managing the lifecycle of objects](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md).

The following topics in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_ describe the REST
API operations related to S3 Lifecycle configuration:

- [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](../api/api-putbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md)

- [GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration](../api/api-getbucketlifecycleconfiguration.md)

- [DeleteBucketLifecycle](../api/api-deletebucketlifecycle.md)

## Troubleshooting S3 Lifecycle

For common issues that might occur when working with S3 Lifecycle, see [Troubleshooting Amazon S3 Lifecycle issues](troubleshoot-lifecycle.md).
