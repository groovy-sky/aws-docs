# Enabling CloudTrail event logging for S3 buckets and objects

You can use CloudTrail data events to get information about bucket and object-level
requests in Amazon S3. To enable CloudTrail data events for all of your buckets or for a list
of specific buckets, you must [create a trail manually in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time.html).

###### Note

- The default setting for CloudTrail is to find only management events. Check
to ensure that you have the data events enabled for your account.

- With an S3 bucket that is generating a high workload, you could
quickly generate thousands of logs in a short amount of time. Be mindful
of how long you choose to enable CloudTrail data events for a busy bucket.

CloudTrail stores Amazon S3 data event logs in an S3 bucket of your choosing. Consider using
a bucket in a separate AWS account to better organize events from multiple buckets
that you might own into a central place for easier querying and analysis. AWS Organizations
helps you create an AWS account that is linked to the account that owns the bucket
that you're monitoring. For more information, see [What is AWS Organizations?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) in the
_AWS Organizations User Guide_.

When you log data events for a trail in CloudTrail, you can choose to use advanced event
selectors or basic event selectors to log data events for objects stored in general
purpose buckets. To log data events for objects stored in directory buckets, you
must use advanced event selectors. For more information, see [Logging with AWS CloudTrail for S3 Express One Zone](s3-express-one-zone-logging.md).

When you create a trail in the CloudTrail console using advanced event selectors, in the
data events section, you can choose **Log all events** for the
**Log selector template** to log all object-level events. When
you create a trail in the CloudTrail console using basic event selectors, in the
data events section, you can select the **Select all S3 buckets in your**
**account** check box to log all object-level events.

###### Note

- It's a best practice to create a lifecycle configuration for your
AWS CloudTrail data event bucket. Configure the lifecycle configuration to
periodically remove log files after the period of time you believe you
need to audit them. Doing so reduces the amount of data that Athena
analyzes for each query. For more information, see [Setting an S3 Lifecycle configuration on a bucket](how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.md).

- For examples of how to query CloudTrail logs, see the _AWS Big Data Blog_ post [Analyze Security, Compliance, and Operational Activity Using\
AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/aws-cloudtrail-and-amazon-athena-dive-deep-to-analyze-security-compliance-and-operational-activity).

## Enable logging for objects in a bucket using the console

You can use the AWS CloudTrail console to configure a CloudTrail trail to log data events for objects in
an S3 bucket. CloudTrail supports logging Amazon S3 object-level API operations such as
`GetObject`, `DeleteObject`, and `PutObject`. These events
are called _data events_.

By default, CloudTrail trails don't log data events, but you can configure trails to log data
events for S3 buckets that you specify, or to log data events for all the Amazon S3 buckets in your
AWS account. For more information, see [Logging Amazon S3 API calls using AWS CloudTrail](cloudtrail-logging.md).

CloudTrail does not populate data events in the CloudTrail event history. Additionally, not all
bucket-level actions are populated in the CloudTrail event history. For more information about the
Amazon S3 bucket–level API actions tracked by CloudTrail logging, see [Amazon S3 bucket-level actions that are tracked by CloudTrail logging](cloudtrail-logging-s3-info.md#cloudtrail-bucket-level-tracking).
For more information about how to query CloudTrail logs, see the AWS Knowledge Center article about
[using\
Amazon CloudWatch Logs filter patterns and Amazon Athena to query CloudTrail logs](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/find-cloudtrail-object-level-events).

###### Note

If you are logging data activity with AWS CloudTrail, the event record for an Amazon S3
`DeleteObjects` data event includes both the `DeleteObjects` event and
a `DeleteObject` event for each object deleted as part of that operation. You can
exclude the additional visibility about deleted objects from the event record. For more
information, see [AWS CLI examples for filtering data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/filtering-data-events.html#filtering-data-events-deleteobjects) in the _AWS CloudTrail_
_User Guide_.

To enable CloudTrail data events logging for objects in an S3 general purpose bucket or an S3
directory bucket see [Creating a trail with the CloudTrail console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-a-trail-using-the-console-first-time) in the
_AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

For more information about logging objects in an S3 directory bucket, see [Logging with AWS CloudTrail for directory buckets](s3-express-one-zone-logging.md).

For information about using the CloudTrail console to configure a trail to log S3 data events, see
[Logging data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

To disable CloudTrail data events logging for objects in an S3 bucket, see [Deleting a trail with the CloudTrail console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-delete-trails-console.html) in the
_AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

Additional charges apply for data events. For more information, see [AWS CloudTrail pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).
