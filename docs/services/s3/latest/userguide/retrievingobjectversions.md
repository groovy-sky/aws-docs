# Retrieving object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket

Versioning in Amazon S3 is a way of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same
bucket. A simple `GET` request retrieves the current version of an object.
The following figure shows how `GET` returns the current version of the
object, `photo.gif`.

To retrieve a specific version, you have to specify its version ID. The following
figure shows that a `GET versionId` request retrieves the specified version
of the object (not necessarily the current one).

You can retrieve object versions in Amazon S3 using the console, AWS SDKs, or REST
API.

###### Note

To access object versions older than 300 versions, you must use the AWS CLI or the
object's URL.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the **Buckets** list, choose the name of the bucket that
    contains the object.

3. In the **Objects** list, choose the name of the object.

4. Choose **Versions**.

Amazon S3 shows all the versions for the object.

5. Select the check box next to the **Version ID** for the versions
    that you want to retrieve.

6. Choose **Actions**, choose **Download**, and
    save the object.

You also can view, download, and delete object versions in the object overview panel. For
more information, see [Viewing object properties in the Amazon S3 console](view-object-properties.md).

###### Important

You can undelete an object only if it was deleted as the latest (current) version. You
can't undelete a previous version of an object that was deleted. For more information,
see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md).

The examples for uploading objects in nonversioned and versioning-enabled
buckets are the same. However, for versioning-enabled buckets, Amazon S3 assigns a
version number. Otherwise, the version number is null.

For examples of downloading objects using AWS SDKs for Java, .NET, and PHP,
see [Downloading\
objects](download-objects.md).

For examples of listing the version of objects using AWS SDKs for .NET and Rust,
see
[List the version of objects in an Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/s3_example_s3_ListObjectVersions_section.html).

###### To retrieve a specific object version

1. Set `versionId` to the ID of the version of the object that
    you want to retrieve.

2. Send a `GET Object versionId` request.

###### Example— Retrieving a versioned object

The following request retrieves version
`L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmpUMLUo` of `my-image.jpg`.

```

GET /my-image.jpg?versionId=L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmpUMLUo HTTP/1.1
Host: bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2009 22:32:00 GMT
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:0RQf4/cRonhpaBX5sCYVf1bNRuU=
```

You can retrieve just the metadata of an object (not the content). For information,
see [Retrieving the metadata of an object version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RetMetaOfObjVersion.html).

For information about restoring a previous object version, see [Restoring previous versions](restoringpreviousversions.md).
