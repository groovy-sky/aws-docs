# S3 Tables maintenance job status

S3 Tables maintenance jobs run periodically for your S3 tables or table buckets.
You can query the status of these jobs with the
`GetTableMaintenanceJobStatus` API.

**To get the status of your maintenance jobs by using the AWS CLI**

The following example will get the statuses of maintenance jobs using the
`GetTableMaintenanceJobStatus` API.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables get-table-maintenance-job-status \
   --table-bucket-arn="arn:aws:s3tables:arn:aws::111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket1" \
   --namespace="mynamespace" \
   --name="testtable"
```

For more information, see [get-table-maintenance-job-status](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3tables/get-table-maintenance-job-status.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

S3 Tables maintenance jobs can transition between four possible statuses:

- `Successful`

- `Failed`

- `Disabled`

- `Not_Yet_Run`

Jobs with a failed status will include a failure message. The following list describes
possible failure messages.

- Encountered Iceberg validation exception when trying to read table. Ensure
that your table is readable, adheres to the Iceberg specification, and contains
only S3 paths that begin with your S3 Table alias.

- Iceberg Snapshot management does not currently support user defined tags or
references.

- Iceberg table maintenance configuration is incompatible with
'history.expire.max-snapshot-age-ms' and 'history.expire.min-snapshots-to-keep'
table properties.

- Iceberg snapshot management and unreferenced file removal is not supported
when the 'gc.enabled' table property is false. Ensure that this property is
unset or explicitly set to true.

- Failed to commit because of out of date metadata. Maintenance will be retried
at the next available opportunity.

- Insufficient access to perform table maintenance. Ensure that the key used to
encrypt the table is active, exists, and has a resource policy granting access
to the S3 service principal
`maintenance.s3tables.amazonaws.com`.
