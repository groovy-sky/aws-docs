# Metrics and dimensions

The storage metrics and dimensions that Amazon S3 sends to Amazon CloudWatch are listed in
the following tables.

###### Best-effort CloudWatch metrics delivery

CloudWatch metrics are delivered on a best-effort basis. Most requests for an Amazon S3
object that have request metrics result in a data point being sent to CloudWatch.

The completeness and timeliness of metrics are not guaranteed. The data point for
a particular request might be returned with a timestamp that is later than when the
request was actually processed. The data point for a minute might be delayed before
being available through CloudWatch, or it might not be delivered at all. CloudWatch request
metrics give you an idea of the nature of traffic against your bucket in near-real
time. It is not meant to be a complete accounting of all requests.

It follows from the best-effort nature of this feature that the reports available
at the [Billing & Cost\
Management Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?) might include one or more access requests that do
not appear in the bucket metrics.

## Amazon S3 daily storage metrics for buckets in CloudWatch

The `AWS/S3` namespace includes the following daily storage metrics for
buckets.

MetricDescription`BucketSizeBytes`

The amount of data in bytes that is stored in a bucket in the
following storage classes:

- Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)
( `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`)

- S3 Express One Zone ( `EXPRESS_ONEZONE`)

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive ( `DEEP_ARCHIVE`)

- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
( `GLACIER`)

- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval ( `GLACIER_IR`)

- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
( `INTELLIGENT_TIERING`)

- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
( `ONEZONE_IA`)

- S3 Standard ( `STANDARD`)

- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
( `STANDARD_IA`)

This value is calculated by summing the size of all objects
and metadata (such as bucket names) in the bucket (both current and noncurrent
objects), including the size of all parts for all incomplete
multipart uploads to the bucket.

###### Note

The S3 Express One Zone storage class is available only for
directory buckets.

Valid storage-type filters (see the `StorageType`
dimension):

- Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS):
`ReducedRedundancyStorage`

- S3 Express One Zone: `ExpressOneZoneStorage`

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
`DeepArchiveObjectOverhead`,
`DeepArchiveS3ObjectOverhead`,
`DeepArchiveStagingStorage`,
`DeepArchiveStorage`

- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: `GlacierObjectOverhead`,
`GlacierS3ObjectOverhead`,
`GlacierStagingStorage`,
`GlacierStorage`

- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: `GlacierInstantRetrievalStorage`, `GlacierIRSizeOverhead`

- S3 Intelligent-Tiering:
`IntelligentTieringAAStorage`,
`IntelligentTieringAIAStorage`,
`IntelligentTieringDAAStorage`,
`IntelligentTieringFAStorage`,
`IntelligentTieringIAStorage`

- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access:
`OneZoneIASizeOverhead`,
`OneZoneIAStorage`

- S3 Standard:
`StandardStorage`

- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access:
`StandardIAObjectOverhead`,
`StandardIASizeOverhead`,

Units: Bytes

Valid statistics: Average

For more information about the `StorageType`
dimensions, see [Amazon S3 dimensions in CloudWatch](#s3-cloudwatch-dimensions).

`NumberOfObjects`

The total number of objects stored in a general purpose bucket for all
storage classes. This value is calculated by counting all objects in the bucket, which
includes current and noncurrent objects, delete markers, and the total number of parts for
all incomplete multipart uploads to the bucket. For directory buckets with objects in the
S3 Express One Zone storage class, this value is calculated by counting all objects in the bucket, but it
doesn't include incomplete multipart uploads to the bucket.

This dimension filters the data that you request for the
identified bucket only.

`StorageType`

This dimension filters the data that you have stored in a
bucket by the following types of storage:

- `DeepArchiveObjectOverhead` – For

`FilterId`

This dimension filters metrics configurations that you
specify for the request metrics on a bucket. When you create a
metrics configuration, you specify a filter ID (for example, a
prefix, a tag, or an access point). For more information, see [Creating a metrics configuration](metrics-configurations.md).

## S3 Replication dimensions in CloudWatch

The following dimensions are used to filter S3 Replication metrics.

Dimension

Description

`SourceBucket`

The name of the bucket objects are replicated from.

`DestinationBucket`

The name of the bucket objects are replicated to.

`RuleId`

A unique identifier for the rule that triggered this replication metric to update.

## S3 Storage Lens dimensions in CloudWatch

For a list of dimensions that are used to filter S3 Storage Lens metrics in CloudWatch, see
[Dimensions](storage-lens-cloudwatch-metrics-dimensions.md#storage-lens-cloudwatch-dimensions).

## S3 Object Lambda request dimensions in CloudWatch

The following dimensions are used to filter data from an Object Lambda Access Point.

DimensionDescription`AccessPointName`

The name of the access point of which requests are being made.

`DataSourceARN`

The source the Object Lambda Access Point is retrieving the data from. If the
request invokes a Lambda function this refers to the Lambda Amazon
Resource Name (ARN). Otherwise this refers to the access point
ARN.

## Amazon S3 usage metrics

You can use CloudWatch usage metrics to provide visibility into your account's usage of resources. Use these metrics to visualize your
current service usage on CloudWatch graphs and dashboards.

Amazon S3 usage metrics correspond to AWS service quotas. You can configure alarms that
alert you when your usage approaches a service quota. For more information about CloudWatch
integration with service quotas, see [AWS usage metrics](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-service-quota-integration.md)
in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

Amazon S3 publishes the following metrics in the `AWS/Usage` namespace.

MetricDescription

`ResourceCount`

The number of the specified resources running in your account. The resources are defined by the dimensions
associated with the metric.

The following dimensions are used to refine the usage metrics that are published by Amazon S3.

DimensionDescription`Service`

The name of the AWS service containing the resource. For
Amazon S3 usage metrics, the value for this dimension is
`S3`.

`Type`

The type of entity that is being reported. Currently, the only
valid value for Amazon S3 usage metrics is
`Resource`.

`Resource`

The type of resource that is running. Currently, the only
valid value for Amazon S3 usage metrics is
`GeneralPurposeBuckets`, which returns the number
of general purpose buckets in an AWS account. General purpose buckets allow
objects that are stored across all storage classes, except
S3 Express One Zone.
