## I ran a list operation on my bucket and saw objects that I thought were expired or transitioned by a lifecycle rule.

S3 Lifecycle [object transitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html) and [object\
expirations](lifecycle-expire-general-considerations.md) are asynchronous operations. Therefore, there might be a delay
between the time that the objects are eligible for expiration or transition and the time
that they are actually transitioned or expired. Changes in billing are applied as soon
as the lifecycle rule is satisfied, even if the action isn't complete. The exception to
this behavior is if you have a lifecycle rule set to transition to the
S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. In that case, billing changes don't occur until the
object has transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering. For more information about changes in
billing, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html).

###### Note

Amazon S3 doesn’t transition objects that are smaller than 128 KB from the S3 Standard
or S3 Standard-IA storage class to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, or
S3 One Zone-IA storage class.

## How do I monitor the actions taken by my lifecycle rules?

To monitor actions taken by lifecycle rules, you can use the following features:

- **S3 Event Notifications** – You can set
up [S3\
Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configure-notification.html) so that you're notified of any S3 Lifecycle
expiration or transition events.

- **S3 server access logs** – You can enable
server access logs for your S3 buckets to capture S3 Lifecycle actions, such as
object transitions to another storage class or object expirations. For more
information, see [Lifecycle and logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config.html#lifecycle-general-considerations-logging).

To view the changes in your storage caused by lifecycle actions on a daily basis, we
recommend using [S3 Storage Lens dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens_basics_metrics_recommendations.html#storage_lens_basics_dashboards) instead of using Amazon CloudWatch metrics. In your Storage Lens
dashboard, you can view the following metrics, which monitor the object count or
size:

- **Current version bytes**

- **Current version object count**

- **Noncurrent version bytes**

- **Noncurrent version object count**

- **Delete marker object count**

- **Delete marker storage bytes**

- **Incomplete multipart upload bytes**

- **Incomplete multipart upload object count**

## My S3 object count still increases, even after setting up lifecycle rules on a versioning-enabled bucket.

In a [versioning-enabled\
bucket](versioning.md#versioning-states), when an object is expired, the object isn't completely deleted from
the bucket. Instead, a [delete marker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DeleteMarker.html) is created
as the newest version of the object. Delete markers are still counted as objects.
Therefore, if a lifecycle rule is created to expire only the current versions, then the
object count in the S3 bucket actually increases instead of going down.

For example, let's say an S3 bucket is versioning-enabled with 100 objects, and a
lifecycle rule is set to expire current versions of the object after 7 days. After the
seventh day, the object count increases to 200 because 100 delete markers are created in
addition to the 100 original objects, which are now the noncurrent versions. For more
information about S3 Lifecycle configuration rule actions for versioning-enabled buckets,
see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html).

To permanently remove objects, add an additional lifecycle configuration to delete the
previous versions of the objects, expired delete markers, and incomplete multipart
uploads. For instructions on how to create new lifecycle rules, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html).

###### Note

- Amazon S3 rounds the transition or expiration date of an object to midnight UTC
the next day.

When evaluating objects for lifecycle actions, Amazon S3 uses the object
creation time in UTC. For example, consider a nonversioned bucket with a
lifecycle rule that's configured to expire objects after one day. Suppose
that an object was created on January 1 at 17:05 Pacific Daylight Time
(PDT), which corresponds to January 2 at 00:05 UTC. The object becomes one
day old at 00:05 UTC on January 3, which makes it eligible for expiration
when S3 Lifecycle evaluates objects at 00:00 UTC on January 4.

Because Amazon S3 lifecycle actions occur asynchronously, there might be
some delay between the date specified in the lifecycle rule and the actual
physical transition of the object. For more information, see [Transition or expiration\
delay](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html#lifecycle-action-delay).

For more information, see [Lifecycle rules: Based on an object's age](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-number-of-days).

- For S3 objects that are protected by Object Lock, current versions are
not permanently deleted. Instead, a delete marker is added to the objects,
making them noncurrent. Noncurrent versions are then preserved and are not
permanently expired.

## How do I empty my S3 bucket by using lifecycle rules?

S3 Lifecycle rules are an effective tool to [empty an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/empty-bucket.html) with
millions of objects. To delete a large number of objects from your S3 bucket, make sure
to use these two pairs of lifecycle rules:

- **Expire current versions of objects** and
**Permanently delete previous versions of objects**

- **Delete expired delete markers** and **Delete**
**incomplete multipart uploads**

For steps on how to create a lifecycle configuration rule, see [Setting lifecycle configuration on a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html).

###### Note

For S3 objects that are protected by Object Lock, current versions are not
permanently deleted. Instead, a delete marker is added to the objects, making them
noncurrent. Noncurrent versions are then preserved and are not permanently
expired.

## My Amazon S3 bill increased after transitioning objects to a lower-cost storage class.

There are several reasons that your bill might increase after transitioning objects to
a lower-cost storage class:

- S3 Glacier overhead charges for small objects

For each object that is transitioned to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive, a total overhead of 40 KB is associated with this storage
update. As part of the 40 KB overhead, 8 KB is used to store metadata and the
name of the object. This 8 KB is charged according to S3 Standard rates. The
remaining 32 KB is used for indexing and related metadata. This 32 KB is charged
according to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive pricing.

Therefore, if you're storing many smaller sized objects, we don't recommend
using lifecycle transitions. Instead, to reduce any overhead charges, consider
aggregating many smaller objects into a smaller number of large objects before
storing them in Amazon S3. For more information about cost considerations, see [Transitioning to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage\
classes (object archival)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html#before-deciding-to-archive-objects).

- Minimum storage charges

Some S3 storage classes have minimum storage-duration requirements. Objects
that are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned from those classes before the
minimum duration is satisfied are charged a prorated early transition or
deletion fee. These minimum storage-duration requirements are as follows:

- S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA – 30 days

- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval –
90 days

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive – 180 days

For more information about these requirements, see the
_Constraints_ section of [Transitioning objects using S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html). For general S3 pricing
information, see [Amazon S3\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing) and the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/).

- Lifecycle transition costs

Each time an object is transitioned to a different storage class by a
lifecycle rule, Amazon S3 counts that transition as one transition request. The costs
for these transition requests are in addition to the costs of these storage
classes. If you plan to transition a large number of objects, consider the
request costs when transitioning to a lower tier. For more information, see
[Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

## I’ve updated my bucket policy, but my S3 objects are still being deleted by expired lifecycle rules.

`Deny` statements in a bucket policy don't prevent the expiration of the
objects defined in a lifecycle rule. Lifecycle actions (such as transitions or
expirations) don't use the S3 `DeleteObject` operation. Instead, S3 Lifecycle
actions are performed by using internal S3 endpoints. (For more information, see [Lifecycle and logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config.html#lifecycle-general-considerations-logging).)

To prevent your lifecycle rule from taking any action, you must edit, delete, or
[disable the rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lifecycle-config-conceptual-ex2).

## Can I recover S3 objects that are expired by S3 Lifecycle rules?

The only way to recover objects that are expired by S3 Lifecycle is through versioning,
which must be in place before the objects become eligible for expiration. You cannot
undo the expiration operations that are performed by lifecycle rules. If objects are
permanently deleted by the S3 Lifecycle rules that are in place, you cannot recover these
objects. To enable versioning on a bucket, see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md).

If you have applied versioning to the bucket and the noncurrent versions of the
objects are still intact, you can [restore previous\
versions of the expired objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RestoringPreviousVersions.html). For more information about the behavior of
S3 Lifecycle rule actions and versioning states, see the _Lifecycle actions and_
_bucket versioning state_ table in [Elements to describe lifecycle actions](intro-lifecycle-rules.md#non-current-days-calculations).

###### Note

If the S3 bucket is protected by [AWS Backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/s3-backups.html) or [S3 Replication](replication.md), you might also be able to use these features to
recover your expired objects.

## Why are my expiration and transition lifecycle actions not occurring?

For a versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended bucket, the following considerations guide how Amazon S3
handles the Expiration action:

- Object expiration applies only to an object's current version (it has no impact on noncurrent
object versions).

- Amazon S3 doesn't take any action if there are one or more object versions and the delete marker is
the current version.

- Amazon S3 doesn't take any action on noncurrent versions of objects that have S3 Object Lock
applied.

- For objects with a `PENDING` replication status, Amazon S3 doesn't take any action current
or noncurrent versions of objects.

Lifecycle storage class transitions have the following constraints:

- By default, objects smaller than 128 KB won't transition to any storage class.

- Objects must be stored for at least 30 days before transitioning to S3 Standard-IA or
S3 One Zone-IA.

- For versioning enabled or versioning suspended buckets, objects with a `PENDING`
replication status can't be transitioned.

## How can I exclude a prefix from my lifecycle rule?

S3 Lifecycle doesn't support excluding prefixes in your rules. Instead, use tags to tag
all of the objects that you want to include in the rule. For more information about
using tags in your lifecycle rules, see [Archiving all objects within one day after creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lifecycle-config-ex1).

## How can I include multiple prefixes in my lifecycle rule?

S3 Lifecycle doesn't support including multiple prefixes in your rules. Instead, use
tags to tag all of the objects that you want to include in the rule. For more
information about using tags in your lifecycle rules, see [Archiving all objects within one day after creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lifecycle-config-ex1).

However, if you have one or more prefixes that start with the same characters, you can
include all of those prefixes in your rule by specifying a partial prefix with no
trailing slash ( `/`) in the filter. For example, suppose that you have these
prefixes:

```

sales1999/
sales2000/
sales2001/
```

To include all three prefixes in your rule, specify
`<Prefix>sales</Prefix>` in your lifecycle rule.
