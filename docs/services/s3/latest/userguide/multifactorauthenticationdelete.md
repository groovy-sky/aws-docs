# Configuring MFA delete

When working with S3 Versioning in Amazon S3 buckets, you can optionally add another layer of
security by configuring a bucket to enable _MFA (multi-factor_
_authentication) delete_. When you do this, the bucket owner must include two
forms of authentication in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state of
the bucket.

MFA delete requires additional authentication for either of the following
operations:

- Changing the versioning state of your bucket

- Permanently deleting an object version

MFA delete requires two forms of authentication together:

- Your security credentials

- The concatenation of a valid serial number, a space, and the six-digit code
displayed on an approved authentication device

MFA delete thus provides added security if, for example, your security credentials are
compromised. MFA delete can help prevent accidental bucket deletions by requiring the user
who initiates the delete action to prove physical possession of an MFA device with an MFA
code and adding an extra layer of friction and security to the delete action.

To identify buckets that have MFA delete enabled, you can use Amazon S3 Storage Lens metrics.
S3 Storage Lens is a cloud-storage analytics feature that you can use to gain organization-wide
visibility into object-storage usage and activity. For more information, see [Assessing your storage activity and usage with S3 Storage Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens?icmpid=docs_s3_user_guide_MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete.html). For a complete list of metrics, see [S3 Storage Lens metrics glossary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens_metrics_glossary.html?icmpid=docs_s3_user_guide_MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete.html).

The bucket owner, the AWS account that created the bucket (root account), and all
authorized users can enable versioning. However, only the bucket owner (root account)
can enable MFA delete. For more information, see [Securing Access\
\
to AWS Using MFA](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-access-to-aws-using-mfa-part-3) on the AWS Security Blog.

###### Note

To use MFA delete with versioning, you enable `MFA Delete`. However, you cannot
enable `MFA Delete` using the AWS Management Console. You must use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
or the API.

For examples of using MFA delete with versioning, see the examples section in the topic
[Enabling versioning on buckets](manage-versioning-examples.md).

You cannot use MFA delete with lifecycle configurations. For more information about lifecycle
configurations and how they interact with other configurations, see
[How S3 Lifecycle interacts with other bucket configurations](lifecycle-and-other-bucket-config.md).

To enable or disable MFA delete, you use the same API that you use to configure versioning
on a bucket. Amazon S3 stores the MFA delete configuration in the same
_versioning_ subresource that stores the bucket's versioning
status.

```nohighlight

<VersioningConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Status>VersioningState</Status>
  <MfaDelete>MfaDeleteState</MfaDelete>
</VersioningConfiguration>
```

To use MFA delete, you can use either a hardware or virtual MFA device to generate an
authentication code. The following example shows a generated authentication code displayed
on a hardware device.

MFA delete and MFA-protected API access are features intended to provide protection for
different scenarios. You configure MFA delete on a bucket to help ensure that the data in
your bucket cannot be accidentally deleted. MFA-protected API access is used to enforce
another authentication factor (MFA code) when accessing sensitive Amazon S3 resources. You can
require any operations against these Amazon S3 resources to be done with temporary credentials
created using MFA. For an example, see [Requiring MFA](example-bucket-policies.md#example-bucket-policies-MFA).

For more information about how to purchase and activate an authentication device, see
[Multi-factor\
authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa).

## To enable S3 Versioning and configure MFA delete

The serial number is the number that uniquely identifies the MFA device. For physical MFA devices, this is the unique serial number that's provided with the device. For virtual MFA devices, the serial number is the device ARN. To use the following commands, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

The following example enables S3 Versioning and multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete on a bucket for a physical MFA device. For physical MFA devices, in the `--mfa` parameter, pass a concatenation of the MFA device serial number, a space character, and the value that is displayed on your authentication device.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "SerialNumber 123456"
```

The following example enables S3 Versioning and multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete on a bucket for a virtual MFA device. For virtual MFA devices, in the `--mfa` parameter, pass a concatenation of the MFA device ARN, a space character, and the value that is displayed on your authentication device.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::account-id:mfa/root-account-mfa-device 123789"
```
