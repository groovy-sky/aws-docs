# Networking for directory buckets

To access directory buckets and objects inside, you use Regional and Zonal
API endpoints that are different from the standard Amazon S3 endpoints. Depending on the S3 API
operation that you use, either a Zonal or Regional endpoint is required. For a complete list
of API operations by endpoint type, see [Differences for directory buckets](s3-express-differences.md).

You can access both Zonal and Regional API operations through gateway virtual private
cloud (VPC) endpoints.

The following topics describe the networking requirements for accessing S3 Express One Zone by
using a gateway VPC endpoint.

## Endpoints

You can access directory buckets and objects inside from your VPC by
using gateway VPC endpoints. Directory buckets use Regional and Zonal API endpoints.
Depending on the Amazon S3 API operation that you use, either a Regional or Zonal endpoint is
required. There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.

Bucket-level (or control plane) API operations are available through Regional
endpoints and are referred to as Regional endpoint API operations. Examples of Regional
endpoint API operations are `CreateBucket` and `DeleteBucket`.
When you create a directory bucket, you choose a single Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone) where your
directory bucket will be created. After you create a directory bucket, you can use Zonal
endpoint API operations to upload and manage the objects in your directory
bucket.

Object-level (or data plane) API operations are available through Zonal endpoints and
are referred to as Zonal endpoint API operations. Examples of Zonal endpoint API
operations are `CreateSession` and `PutObject`.

For more information about the endpoints and the locations that support directory buckets in Availability Zones, see [Endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones](directory-bucket-az-networking.md#s3-express-endpoints-az).

For more information about the endpoints and the locations that support directory buckets in Local Zones, see [Enable accounts for Local Zones](opt-in-directory-bucket-lz.md).

## Configuring VPC gateway endpoints

To configure gateway VPC endpoints for access directory buckets in Availability Zones, see [Configuring VPC gateway endpoints](directory-bucket-az-networking.md#s3-express-networking-vpc-gateway).

To configure gateway VPC endpoints for access directory buckets in Local Zones, see [Private connectivity from your VPC](connectivity-lz-directory-buckets.md).
