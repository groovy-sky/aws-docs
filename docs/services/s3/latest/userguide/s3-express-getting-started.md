# Tutorial: Getting started with S3 Express One Zone

Amazon S3 Express One Zone is the first S3 storage class where you can select a single Availability
Zone with the option to co-locate your object storage with your compute resources which
provides the highest possible access speed. Data in S3 Express One Zone is stored in directory
buckets located in Availability Zones. For more information on directory buckets, see
[Directory\
buckets](directory-buckets-overview.md).

S3 Express One Zone is ideal for any application where it's critical to minimize request latency.
Such applications can be human-interactive workflows, like video editing, where creative
professionals need responsive access to content from their user interfaces. S3 Express One Zone also
benefits analytics and machine learning workloads that have similar responsiveness
requirements from their data, especially workloads with a lot of smaller accesses or a large
numbers of random accesses. S3 Express One Zone can be used with other AWS services such as Amazon
EMR, Amazon Athena, AWS Glue Data Catalog and Amazon SageMaker Model Training to support
analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) workloads,. You can work
with the S3 Express One Zone storage class and directory buckets by using the Amazon S3
console, AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and Amazon S3 REST API. For
more information, see [What is S3 Express One\
Zone?](s3-express-one-zone.md) and [How is S3 Express One Zone\
different?](s3-express-differences.md).

###### Objective

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a gateway endpoint, create and attach
an IAM policy, create a directory bucket and then use the Import action to populate your
directory bucket with objects currently stored in your general purpose bucket.
Alternatively, you can manually upload objects to your directory bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, you must have an AWS account
that you can sign in to as an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user with correct
permissions.

###### Substeps

- [Create an AWS account](#s3-express-create-account)

- [Create an IAM user in your AWS account (console)](#s3-express-tutorial-user)

- [Create an IAM policy and attach it to an IAM user or role (console)](#s3-express-tutorial-polict)

### Create an AWS account

To complete this tutorial, you need an AWS account. When you sign up for AWS,
your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including
Amazon S3. You are charged only for the services that you use. For more information about
pricing, see [S3\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

### Create an IAM user in your AWS account (console)

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an AWS service that helps administrators securely control
access to AWS resources. IAM administrators control who can be authenticated
(signed in) and authorized (have permissions) to access objects and use directory
buckets in S3 Express One Zone. You can use IAM for no additional charge.

By default, users don't have permissions to access directory buckets and perform
S3 Express One Zone operations. To grant access permissions for directory buckets and
S3 Express One Zone operations, you can use IAM to create users or roles and attach
permissions to those identities. For more information about how to create an
IAM user, see [Creating\
IAM users (console)](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-users-create.md#id_users_create_console) in the _IAM User Guide_. For more information about how to create an IAM
role, see [Creating a role to\
delegate permissions to an IAM user](../../../iam/latest/userguide/id-roles-create-for-user.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

For simplicity, this tutorial creates and uses an IAM user. After completing
this tutorial, remember to [Delete the IAM user](tutorial-s3-object-lambda-uppercase.md#ol-upper-step8-delete-user). For production use, we recommend
that you follow the [Security best practices in\
IAM](../../../iam/latest/userguide/best-practices.md) in the _IAM User Guide_. A best
practice requires human users to use federation with an identity provider to access
AWS with temporary credentials. Another best practice is to require workloads to
use temporary credentials with IAM roles to access AWS. To learn more about
using AWS IAM Identity Center to create users with temporary credentials, see [Getting started](../../../singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.md) in the _AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide_.

###### Warning

IAM users have long-term credentials, which presents a security risk. To help mitigate this risk, we recommend that you provide these users with only the permissions they require to perform the task and that you remove these users when they are no longer needed.

### Create an IAM policy and attach it to an IAM user or role (console)

By default, users don't have permissions for directory buckets and S3 Express One
Zone operations. To grant access permissions for directory buckets, you can use IAM
to create users, groups, or roles and attach permissions to those identities.
Directory buckets are the only resource that you can include in bucket policies or
IAM identity policies for S3 Express One Zone access.

To use Regional endpoint API operations (bucket-level or control plane operations) with
S3 Express One Zone, you use the IAM authorization model, which doesn't involve session
management. Permissions are granted for actions individually. To use Zonal endpoint
API operations (object-level or data plane operations), you use [`CreateSession`](../api/api-createsession.md) to create and manage sessions that are
optimized for low-latency authorization of data requests. To retrieve and use a
session token, you must allow the `s3express:CreateSession` action for
your directory bucket in an identity-based policy or a bucket policy. If you're
accessing S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 console, through the AWS Command
Line Interface (AWS CLI), or by using the AWS SDKs, S3 Express One Zone creates
a session on your behalf. For more information, see [`CreateSession` authorization](s3-express-create-session.md) and [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone](s3-express-security-iam.md).

###### To create an IAM policy and attach the policy to an IAM user (or role)

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM Management Console.

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Policies**.

03. Choose **Create Policy**.

04. Select **JSON**.

05. Copy the policy below into the **Policy editor** window. Before you can
     create directory buckets or use S3 Express One Zone, you must grant the necessary permissions
     to your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role or users. This example policy allows access
     to the `CreateSession` API operation (for use with other Zonal or
     object-level API operations) and all of the Regional endpoint (bucket-level)
     API operations. This policy allows the `CreateSession` API
     operation for use with all directory buckets, but the Regional endpoint API
     operations are allowed only for use with the specified directory bucket. To
     use this example policy, replace the `user input
                                    placeholders` with your own information.
    JSON

07. Name the policy.

    ###### Note

    Bucket tags are not supported for S3 Express One Zone.

08. Select **Create policy**.

09. Now that you've created an IAM policy, you can attach it to an IAM user. In the navigation
     pane, choose **Policies**.

10. In the **search bar**, enter the name of your policy.

11. From the **Actions** menu, select **Attach**.

12. Under **Filter by Entity Type**, select **IAM users** or **Roles**.

13. In the **search field**, type the name of the user or role you wish to use.

14. Choose **Attach Policy**.
