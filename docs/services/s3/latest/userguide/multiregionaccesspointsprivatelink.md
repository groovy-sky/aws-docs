# Configuring a Multi-Region Access Point for use with AWS PrivateLink

AWS PrivateLink provides you with private connectivity to Amazon S3 using private IP addresses
in your virtual private cloud (VPC). You can provision one or more interface endpoints
inside your VPC to connect to Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points.

You can create **com.amazonaws.s3-global.accesspoint** endpoints for Multi-Region Access Points through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS
SDKs. To learn more about how to configure an interface endpoint for Multi-Region Access Point, see [Interface VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.html) in the
_VPC User Guide_.

To make requests to a Multi-Region Access Point via interface endpoints, follow these steps to configure the
VPC and the Multi-Region Access Point.

###### To configure a Multi-Region Access Point to use with AWS PrivateLink

1. Create or have an appropriate VPC endpoint that can connect to Multi-Region Access Points. For
    more information about creating VPC endpoints, see [Interface VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.html) in the
    _VPC User Guide_.

###### Important

Make sure to create a **com.amazonaws.s3-global.accesspoint** endpoint. Other endpoint types
cannot access Multi-Region Access Points.

After this VPC endpoint is created, all Multi-Region Access Point requests in the VPC route
    through this endpoint if you have private DNS enabled for the endpoint. This is
    enabled by default.

2. If the Multi-Region Access Point policy does not support connections from VPC endpoints, you will need to
    update it.

3. Verify that the individual bucket policies will allow access to the users of the Multi-Region Access Point.

Remember that Multi-Region Access Points work by routing requests to buckets, not by fulfilling requests
themselves. This is important to remember because the originator of the request must have
permissions to the Multi-Region Access Point and be allowed to access the individual buckets in the Multi-Region Access Point.
Otherwise, the request might be routed to a bucket where the originator doesn't have
permissions to fulfill the request. A Multi-Region Access Point and the buckets associated can be owned by the
same or another AWS account. However, VPCs from different accounts can use a Multi-Region Access Point if the
permissions are configured correctly.

Because of this, the VPC endpoint policy must allow access both to the Multi-Region Access Point and to
each underlying bucket that you want to be able to fulfill requests. For example, suppose
that you have a Multi-Region Access Point with the alias `mfzwi23gnjvgw.mrap`. It is backed by
buckets `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` and
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket2`, all owned by AWS account
`123456789012`. In this case, the following VPC endpoint policy would
allow `GetObject` requests from the VPC made to `mfzwi23gnjvgw.mrap`
to be fulfilled by either backing bucket.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Sid": "Read-buckets-and-MRAP-VPCE-policy",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*",
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/*",
            "arn:aws:s3::111122223333:accesspoint/mfzwi23gnjvgw.mrap/object/*"
        ]
    }]
}

```

As mentioned previously, you also must make sure that the Multi-Region Access Point policy is configured to
support access through a VPC endpoint. You don't need to specify the VPC endpoint that
is requesting access. The following sample policy would grant access to any requester trying
to use the Multi-Region Access Point for the `GetObject` requests.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
        "Sid": "Open-read-MRAP-policy",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject"
          ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3::111122223333:accesspoint/mfzwi23gnjvgw.mrap/object/*"
    }]
}

```

And of course, the individual buckets would each need a policy to support access from
requests submitted through VPC endpoint. The following example policy grants read access
to any anonymous users, which would include requests made through the VPC endpoint.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
       "Sid": "Public-read",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": "*",
       "Action": "s3:GetObject",
       "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1",
           "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/*"]
    }]
}

```
