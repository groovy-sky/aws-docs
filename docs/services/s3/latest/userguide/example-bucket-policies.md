# Examples of Amazon S3 bucket policies

With Amazon S3 bucket policies, you can secure access to objects in your buckets, so that only
users with the appropriate permissions can access them. You can even prevent authenticated users
without the appropriate permissions from accessing your Amazon S3 resources.

This section presents examples of typical use cases for bucket policies. These sample
policies use `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` as the resource value. To test these policies,
replace the `user input placeholders` with your own
information (such as your bucket name).

To grant or deny permissions to a set of objects, you can use wildcard characters
( `*`) in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and other values. For example, you can
control access to groups of objects that begin with a common [prefix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#keyprefix) or end with a specific
extension, such as `.html`.

For more information about AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language, see [Policies and permissions in Amazon S3](access-policy-language-overview.md).

For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](using-with-s3-policy-actions.md).

###### Note

When testing permissions by using the Amazon S3 console, you must grant additional permissions
that the console requires— `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`,
`s3:GetBucketLocation`, and `s3:ListBucket`. For an example
walkthrough that grants permissions to users and tests those permissions by using the console,
see [Controlling access to a bucket with user policies](walkthrough1.md).

## Granting read-only permission to a public anonymous user

You can use your policy settings to grant access to public anonymous users, which is
useful if you're configuring your bucket as a static website. Granting access to public
anonymous users requires you to disable the Block Public Access settings for your bucket. For
more information about how to do this, and the policy required, see [Setting permissions for website access](websiteaccesspermissionsreqd.md). To
learn how to set up more restrictive policies for the same purpose, see [How can I grant\
public read access to some objects in my Amazon S3 bucket?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/read-access-objects-s3-bucket) in the AWS Knowledge
Center.

By default, Amazon S3 blocks public access to your account and buckets. If you want to use a bucket to host a static website, you can use these steps to edit your block public access settings.

###### Warning

Before you complete these steps, review [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](access-control-block-public-access.md) to ensure that you understand and accept the risks involved with allowing public access. When you turn off block public access settings to make your bucket public, anyone on the internet can access your bucket. We recommend that you block all public access to your buckets.

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. Choose the name of the bucket that you have configured as a static website.

3. Choose **Permissions**.

4. Under **Block public access (bucket settings)**, choose **Edit**.

5. Clear **Block _all_ public**
**access**, and choose **Save changes**.

![The Amazon S3 console, showing the block public access bucket settings.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/edit-public-access-clear.png)

Amazon S3 turns off the Block Public Access settings for your bucket. To create a public static website, you might also have to [edit the Block Public Access settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/block-public-access-account.html) for your account
    before adding a bucket policy. If the Block Public Access settings for your account are currently turned on, you see a note under **Block public access (bucket settings)**.

## Requiring encryption

You can require server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), as shown in
the following examples.

### Require SSE-KMS for all objects written to a bucket

The following example policy requires every object that is written to the bucket to be
encrypted with server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). If the object
isn't encrypted with SSE-KMS, the request is denied.

JSON

```json

{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
"Id": "PutObjPolicy",
"Statement": [{
  "Sid": "DenyObjectsThatAreNotSSEKMS",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
  "Condition": {
    "Null": {
      "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id": "true"
    }
  }
}]
}

```

### Require SSE-KMS with a specific AWS KMS key for all objects written to a bucket

The following example policy denies any objects from being written to the bucket if they
aren’t encrypted with SSE-KMS by using a specific KMS key ID. Even if the objects are
encrypted with SSE-KMS by using a per-request header or bucket default encryption, the
objects can't be written to the bucket if they haven't been encrypted with the specified
KMS key. Make sure to replace the KMS key ARN that's used in this example with your own
KMS key ARN.

JSON

```json

{
"Version":"2012-10-17",
"Id": "PutObjPolicy",
"Statement": [{
  "Sid": "DenyObjectsThatAreNotSSEKMSWithSpecificKey",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
  "Condition": {
    "ArnNotEqualsIfExists": {
      "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
    }
  }
}]
}

```

## Managing buckets using canned ACLs

### Granting permissions to multiple accounts to upload objects or set object ACLs for public access

The following example policy grants the `s3:PutObject` and
`s3:PutObjectAcl` permissions to multiple AWS accounts. Also, the example
policy requires that any requests for these operations must include the
`public-read` [canned access control list (ACL)](acl-overview.md#canned-acl). For more information,
see [Policy actions for Amazon S3](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions) and [Policy condition keys for Amazon S3](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-conditionkeys).

###### Warning

The `public-read` canned ACL allows anyone in the world to view the objects
in your bucket. Use caution when granting anonymous access to your Amazon S3 bucket or
disabling block public access settings. When you grant anonymous access, anyone in the
world can access your bucket. We recommend that you never grant anonymous access to your
Amazon S3 bucket unless you specifically need to, such as with [static website hosting](websitehosting.md). If you want to enable block public access settings for
static website hosting, see [Tutorial: Configuring a\
static website on Amazon S3](hostingwebsiteons3setup.md).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddPublicReadCannedAcl",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root",
                    "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:root"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": [
                        "public-read"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

### Grant cross-account permissions to upload objects while ensuring that the bucket owner has full control

The following example shows how to allow another AWS account to upload objects to your
bucket while ensuring that you have full control of the uploaded objects. This policy grants
a specific AWS account ( `111122223333`)
the ability to upload objects only if that account includes the
`bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL on upload. The `StringEquals`
condition in the policy specifies the `s3:x-amz-acl` condition key to express the
canned ACL requirement. For more information, see [Policy condition keys for Amazon S3](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-conditionkeys).

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
     {
       "Sid":"PolicyForAllowUploadWithACL",
       "Effect":"Allow",
       "Principal":{"AWS":"111122223333"},
       "Action":"s3:PutObject",
       "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
       "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {"s3:x-amz-acl":"bucket-owner-full-control"}
       }
     }
   ]
}

```

## Managing object access with object tagging

### Allow a user to read only objects that have a specific tag key and value

The following permissions policy limits a user to only reading objects that have the
`environment: production` tag key and value. This policy uses the
`s3:ExistingObjectTag` condition key to specify the tag key and value.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Principal":{
            "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/JohnDoe"
         },
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:GetObjectVersion"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
         "Condition":{
            "StringEquals":{
               "s3:ExistingObjectTag/environment":"production"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}

```

### Restrict which object tag keys that users can add

The following example policy grants a user permission to perform the
`s3:PutObjectTagging` action, which allows a user to add tags to an existing
object. The condition uses the `s3:RequestObjectTagKeys` condition key to specify
the allowed tag keys, such as `Owner` or `CreationDate`. For more
information, see [Creating a\
condition that tests multiple key values](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_multi-value-conditions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

The policy ensures that every tag key specified in the request is an authorized tag key.
The `ForAnyValue` qualifier in the condition ensures that at least one of the
specified keys must be present in the request.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {"Principal":{"AWS":[
            "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/JohnDoe"
         ]
       },
 "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObjectTagging"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {"ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {"s3:RequestObjectTagKeys": [
            "Owner",
            "CreationDate"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### Require a specific tag key and value when allowing users to add object tags

The following example policy grants a user permission to perform the
`s3:PutObjectTagging` action, which allows a user to add tags to an existing
object. The condition requires the user to include a specific tag key (such as
`Project`) with the value set to
`X`.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {"Principal":{"AWS":[
       "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/JohnDoe"
         ]
       },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObjectTagging"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"s3:RequestObjectTag/Project": "X"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### Allow a user to only add objects with a specific object tag key and value

The following example policy grants a user permission to perform the
`s3:PutObject` action so that they can add objects to a bucket. However, the
`Condition` statement restricts the tag keys and values that are allowed on the
uploaded objects. In this example, the user can only add objects that have the specific tag
key ( `Department`) with the value set to
`Finance` to the bucket.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Principal":{
            "AWS":[
                 "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/JohnDoe"
         ]
        },
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:PutObject"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
        ],
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
                "s3:RequestObjectTag/Department": "Finance"
            }
        }
    }]
}

```

## Managing object access by using global condition keys

[Global condition\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) are condition context keys with an `aws` prefix. AWS services can
support global condition keys or service-specific keys that include the service prefix. You
can use the `Condition` element of a JSON policy to compare the keys in a request
with the key values that you specify in your policy.

### Restrict access to only Amazon S3 server access log deliveries

In the following example bucket policy, the [aws:SourceArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn) global condition key is used to compare the [Amazon Resource\
Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns) of the resource, making a service-to-service request with the ARN that
is specified in the policy. The `aws:SourceArn` global condition key is used to
prevent the Amazon S3 service from being used as a [confused deputy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html) during
transactions between services. Only the Amazon S3 service is allowed to add objects to the Amazon S3
bucket.

This example bucket policy grants `s3:PutObject` permissions to only the
logging service principal ( `logging.s3.amazonaws.com`).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPutObjectS3ServerAccessLogsPolicy",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "logging.s3.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket-logs/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                "aws:SourceAccount": "111122223333"
                },
                "ArnLike": {
                "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket1"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "RestrictToS3ServerAccessLogs",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket-logs/*",
            "Condition": {
                "ForAllValues:StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:PrincipalServiceNamesList": "logging.s3.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

### Allow access to only your organization

If you want to require all [IAM\
principals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) accessing a resource to be from an AWS account in your organization
(including the AWS Organizations management account), you can use the `aws:PrincipalOrgID`
global condition key.

To grant or restrict this type of access, define the `aws:PrincipalOrgID`
condition and set the value to your [organization ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_details.html)
in the bucket policy. The organization ID is used to control access to the bucket. When you
use the `aws:PrincipalOrgID` condition, the permissions from the bucket policy
are also applied to all new accounts that are added to the organization.

Here’s an example of a resource-based bucket policy that you can use to grant specific
IAM principals in your organization direct access to your bucket. By adding the
`aws:PrincipalOrgID` global condition key to your bucket policy, the principal
account is now required to be in your organization to obtain access to the resource. Even if
you accidentally specify an incorrect account when granting access, the [aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-principalorgid) acts as an additional
safeguard. When this global key is used in a policy, it prevents all principals from outside
of the specified organization from accessing the S3 bucket. Only principals from accounts in
the listed organization are able to obtain access to the resource.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "AllowGetObject",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
        },
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
                "aws:PrincipalOrgID": ["o-aa111bb222"]
            }
        }
    }]
}

```

## Managing access based on HTTP or HTTPS requests

### Restrict access to only HTTPS requests

If you want to prevent potential attackers from manipulating network traffic, you can
use HTTPS (TLS) to only allow encrypted connections while restricting HTTP requests from
accessing your bucket. To determine whether the request is HTTP or HTTPS, use the [aws:SecureTransport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-securetransport) global condition key in your S3 bucket
policy. The `aws:SecureTransport` condition key checks whether a request was sent
by using HTTP.

If a request returns `true`, then the request was sent through HTTPS. If the
request returns `false`, then the request was sent through HTTP. You can then
allow or deny access to your bucket based on the desired request scheme.

In the following example, the bucket policy explicitly denies HTTP requests.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "RestrictToTLSRequestsOnly",
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
        ],
        "Condition": {
            "Bool": {
                "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
            }
        },
        "Principal": "*"
    }]
}

```

### Restrict access to a specific HTTP referer

Suppose that you have a website with the domain name
`www.example.com` or
`example.com` with links to photos and videos
stored in your bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`. By default, all Amazon S3 resources
are private, so only the AWS account that created the resources can access them.

To allow read access to these objects from your website, you can add a bucket policy
that allows the `s3:GetObject` permission with a condition that the
`GET` request must originate from specific webpages. The following policy
restricts requests by using the `StringLike` condition with the
`aws:Referer` condition key.

Make sure that the browsers that you use include the HTTP `referer` header in
the request.

###### Warning

We recommend that you use caution when using the `aws:Referer` condition
key. It is dangerous to include a publicly known HTTP referer header value. Unauthorized
parties can use modified or custom browsers to provide any `aws:Referer` value
that they choose. Therefore, do not use `aws:Referer` to prevent unauthorized
parties from making direct AWS requests.

The `aws:Referer` condition key is offered only to allow customers to
protect their digital content, such as content stored in Amazon S3, from being referenced on
unauthorized third-party sites. For more information, see [aws:Referer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-referer) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Managing user access to specific folders

### Grant users access to specific folders

Suppose that you're trying to grant users access to a specific folder. If the IAM user
and the S3 bucket belong to the same AWS account, then you can use an IAM policy to
grant the user access to a specific bucket folder. With this approach, you don't need to
update your bucket policy to grant access. You can add the IAM policy to an IAM role
that multiple users can switch to.

If the IAM identity and the S3 bucket belong to different AWS accounts, then you
must grant cross-account access in both the IAM policy and the bucket policy. For more
information about granting cross-account access, see [Bucket\
owner granting cross-account bucket permissions](example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example2.md).

The following example bucket policy grants
`JohnDoe` full console access to only his folder
( `home/JohnDoe/`). By creating a `home`
folder and granting the appropriate permissions to your users, you can have multiple users
share a single bucket. This policy consists of three `Allow` statements:

- `AllowRootAndHomeListingOfCompanyBucket`:
Allows the user ( `JohnDoe`) to list objects at the
root level of the `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` bucket and
in the `home` folder. This statement also allows the user to search on the
prefix `home/` by using the console.

- `AllowListingOfUserFolder`: Allows the user
( `JohnDoe`) to list all objects in the
`home/JohnDoe/` folder and any
subfolders.

- `AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder`: Allows the
user to perform all Amazon S3 actions by granting `Read`, `Write`, and
`Delete` permissions. Permissions are limited to the bucket owner's home
folder.

## Managing access for access logs

### Grant access to Application Load Balancer for enabling access logs

When you enable access logs for Application Load Balancer, you must specify the name of the S3 bucket where
the load balancer will [store the logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/enable-access-logging.html#access-log-create-bucket). The bucket must have an [attached policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/enable-access-logging.html#attach-bucket-policy) that grants Elastic Load Balancing permission to write to the bucket.

In the following example, the bucket policy grants Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) permission to write the
access logs to the bucket:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
            },
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/111122223333/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Note

Make sure to replace `elb-account-id` with the
AWS account ID for Elastic Load Balancing for your AWS Region. For the list of Elastic Load Balancing Regions, see
[Attach a policy to your Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-access-logs.html#attach-bucket-policy) in the _Elastic Load Balancing User_
_Guide_.

If your AWS Region does not appear in the supported Elastic Load Balancing Regions list, use the
following policy, which grants permissions to the specified log delivery service.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
       "Principal": {
         "Service": "logdelivery.elasticloadbalancing.amazonaws.com"
          },
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/111122223333/*"
    }
  ]
}

```

Then, make sure to configure your [Elastic Load Balancing access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/enable-access-logging.html#enable-access-logs) by enabling them. You can [verify your bucket permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/enable-access-logging.html#verify-bucket-permissions) by creating a test file.

## Managing access to an Amazon CloudFront OAI

### Grant permission to an Amazon CloudFront OAI

The following example bucket policy grants a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI)
permission to get (read) all objects in your S3 bucket. You can use a CloudFront OAI to allow
users to access objects in your bucket through CloudFront but not directly through Amazon S3. For more
information, see [Restricting access to Amazon S3 content by using an Origin Access\
Identity](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.

The following policy uses the OAI's ID as the policy's `Principal`. For more
information about using S3 bucket policies to grant access to a CloudFront OAI, see [Migrating from origin access identity (OAI) to origin access control (OAC)](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.md#migrate-from-oai-to-oac) in the
_Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.

To use this example:

- Replace `EH1HDMB1FH2TC` with the OAI's ID. To
find the OAI's ID, see the [Origin Access Identity page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=us-east-1) on the
CloudFront console, or use [ListCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_ListCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentities.html) in the CloudFront API.

- Replace `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the name of your bucket.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity EH1HDMB1FH2TC"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Managing access for Amazon S3 Storage Lens

### Grant permissions for Amazon S3 Storage Lens

S3 Storage Lens aggregates your metrics and displays the information in the **Account snapshot** section on the
Amazon S3 console **Buckets** page. S3 Storage Lens also provides an interactive dashboard that you can use to visualize insights and
trends, flag outliers, and receive recommendations for optimizing storage costs and applying data protection best practices. Your dashboard has
drill-down options to generate and visualize insights at the organization, account, AWS Region, storage class, bucket, prefix, or
Storage Lens group level. You can also send a daily metrics report in CSV or Parquet format to a general purpose S3 bucket or export
the metrics directly to an AWS-managed S3 table bucket.

S3 Storage Lens can export your aggregated storage usage metrics to an Amazon S3 bucket for further
analysis. The bucket where S3 Storage Lens places its metrics exports is known as the
_destination bucket_. When setting up your S3 Storage Lens metrics export, you
must have a bucket policy for the destination bucket. For more information, see [Monitoring your storage activity and usage with Amazon S3 Storage Lens](storage-lens.md).

The following example bucket policy grants Amazon S3 permission to write objects
( `PUT` requests) to a destination bucket. You use a bucket policy like this on
the destination bucket when setting up an S3 Storage Lens metrics export.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "S3StorageLensExamplePolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "storage-lens.s3.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/destination-prefix/StorageLens/111122223333/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "111122223333",
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:region-code:111122223333:storage-lens/storage-lens-dashboard-configuration-id"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

When you're setting up an S3 Storage Lens organization-level metrics export, use the following
modification to the previous bucket policy's `Resource` statement.

```json

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/destination-prefix/StorageLens/your-organization-id/*",

```

## Managing permissions for S3 Inventory, S3 analytics, and S3 Inventory reports

### Grant permissions for S3 Inventory and S3 analytics

S3 Inventory creates lists of the objects in a bucket, and S3 analytics Storage Class
Analysis export creates output files of the data used in the analysis. The bucket that the
inventory lists the objects for is called the _source bucket_. The bucket
where the inventory file or the analytics export file is written to is called a
_destination bucket_. When setting up an inventory or an analytics
export, you must create a bucket policy for the destination bucket. For more information,
see [Cataloging and analyzing your data with S3 Inventory](storage-inventory.md) and [Amazon S3 analytics – Storage Class Analysis](analytics-storage-class.md).

The following example bucket policy grants Amazon S3 permission to write objects
( `PUT` requests) from the account for the source bucket to the destination
bucket. You use a bucket policy like this on the destination bucket when setting up S3
Inventory and S3 analytics export.

JSON

```json

{
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "InventoryAndAnalyticsExamplePolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "111122223333",
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

### Control S3 Inventory report configuration creation

[Cataloging and analyzing your data with S3 Inventory](storage-inventory.md) creates lists of
the objects in an S3 bucket and the metadata for each object. The
`s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` permission allows a user to create an inventory
configuration that includes all object metadata fields that are available by default and to
specify the destination bucket to store the inventory. A user with read access to objects in
the destination bucket can access all object metadata fields that are available in the
inventory report. For more information about the metadata fields that are available in S3
Inventory, see [Amazon S3 Inventory list](storage-inventory.md#storage-inventory-contents).

To restrict a user from configuring an S3 Inventory report, remove the
`s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` permission from the user.

Some object metadata fields in S3 Inventory report configurations are optional, meaning
that they're available by default but they can be restricted when you grant a user the
`s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` permission. You can control whether users can
include these optional metadata fields in their reports by using the
`s3:InventoryAccessibleOptionalFields` condition key. For a list of the
optional metadata fields available in S3 Inventory, see [OptionalFields](../api/api-putbucketinventoryconfiguration.md#API_PutBucketInventoryConfiguration_RequestBody) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

To grant a user permission to create an inventory configuration with specific optional
metadata fields, use the `s3:InventoryAccessibleOptionalFields` condition key to
refine the conditions in your bucket policy.

The following example policy grants a user ( `Ana`)
permission to create an inventory configuration conditionally. The
`ForAllValues:StringEquals` condition in the policy uses the
`s3:InventoryAccessibleOptionalFields` condition key to specify the two allowed
optional metadata fields, namely `Size` and `StorageClass`. So, when
`Ana` is creating an inventory configuration, the
only optional metadata fields that she can include are `Size` and
`StorageClass`.

JSON

```json

{
	"Id": "InventoryConfigPolicy",
	"Version":"2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [{
			"Sid": "AllowInventoryCreationConditionally",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Ana"
			},
			"Action":
				"s3:PutInventoryConfiguration",
			"Resource":
				"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-SOURCE-BUCKET",
			"Condition": {
				"ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
					"s3:InventoryAccessibleOptionalFields": [
					   "Size",
					   "StorageClass"
					   ]
				  }
				}
			}
	]
}

```

To restrict a user from configuring an S3 Inventory report that includes specific
optional metadata fields, add an explicit `Deny` statement to the bucket policy
for the source bucket. The following example bucket policy denies the user
`Ana` from creating an inventory configuration in
the source bucket `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` that
includes the optional `ObjectAccessControlList` or `ObjectOwner`
metadata fields. The user `Ana` can still create an
inventory configuration with other optional metadata fields.

```json

{
	"Id": "InventoryConfigSomeFields",
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [{
			"Sid": "AllowInventoryCreation",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Ana"
			},
			"Action": "s3:PutInventoryConfiguration",
			"Resource":
				"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket",

		},
		{
			"Sid": "DenyCertainInventoryFieldCreation",
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/Ana"
			},
			"Action": "s3:PutInventoryConfiguration",
			"Resource":
			  "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket",
			"Condition": {
				"ForAnyValue:StringEquals": {
					"s3:InventoryAccessibleOptionalFields": [
					   "ObjectOwner",
					   "ObjectAccessControlList"
					   ]
				  }
				}
			}
	]
}
```

###### Note

The use of the `s3:InventoryAccessibleOptionalFields` condition key in
bucket policies doesn't affect the delivery of inventory reports based on the existing
inventory configurations.

###### Important

We recommend that you use `ForAllValues` with an `Allow` effect
or `ForAnyValue` with a `Deny` effect, as shown in the prior
examples.

Don't use `ForAllValues` with a `Deny` effect nor
`ForAnyValue` with an `Allow` effect, because these combinations
can be overly restrictive and block inventory configuration deletion.

To learn more about the `ForAllValues` and `ForAnyValue`
condition set operators, see [Multivalued context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-single-vs-multi-valued-context-keys.html#reference_policies_condition-multi-valued-context-keys) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Requiring MFA

Amazon S3 supports MFA-protected API access, a feature that can enforce multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for access to your Amazon S3 resources. Multi-factor authentication provides
an extra level of security that you can apply to your AWS environment. MFA is a security
feature that requires users to prove physical possession of an MFA device by providing a valid
MFA code. For more information, see [AWS Multi-Factor\
Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/mfa). You can require MFA for any requests to access your Amazon S3 resources.

To enforce the MFA requirement, use the `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` condition key
in a bucket policy. IAM users can access Amazon S3 resources by using temporary credentials
issued by the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS). You provide the MFA code at the time of the AWS STS
request.

When Amazon S3 receives a request with multi-factor authentication, the
`aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` condition key provides a numeric value that indicates
how long ago (in seconds) the temporary credential was created. If the temporary credential
provided in the request was not created by using an MFA device, this key value is null
(absent). In a bucket policy, you can add a condition to check this value, as shown in the
following example.

This example policy denies any Amazon S3 operation on the
`/taxdocuments` folder in the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket` bucket if the request is not authenticated by using MFA. To
learn more about MFA, see [Using\
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "123",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/taxdocuments/*",
        "Condition": { "Null": { "aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": true }}
      }
    ]
 }

```

The `Null` condition in the `Condition` block evaluates to
`true` if the `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` condition key value is null,
indicating that the temporary security credentials in the request were created without an MFA
device.

The following bucket policy is an extension of the preceding bucket policy. The following
policy includes two policy statements. One statement allows the `s3:GetObject`
permission on a bucket ( `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`) to everyone. Another statement
further restricts access to the
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket/taxdocuments` folder in the
bucket by requiring MFA.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "123",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "DenyInsecureConnections",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
        },
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/taxdocuments/*",
        "Condition": { "Null": { "aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": true } }
      },
      {
        "Sid": "AllowGetObject",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
        },
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
      }
    ]
 }

```

You can optionally use a numeric condition to limit the duration for which the
`aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` key is valid. The duration that you specify with the
`aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` key is independent of the lifetime of the temporary
security credential that's used in authenticating the request.

For example, the following bucket policy, in addition to requiring MFA authentication,
also checks how long ago the temporary session was created. The policy denies any operation if
the `aws:MultiFactorAuthAge` key value indicates that the temporary session was
created more than an hour ago (3,600 seconds).

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "123",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/taxdocuments/*",
        "Condition": {"Null": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": true }}
      },
      {
        "Sid": "",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "s3:*",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/taxdocuments/*",
        "Condition": {"NumericGreaterThan": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthAge": 3600 }}
       },
       {
         "Sid": "",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
       }
    ]
 }

```

## Preventing users from deleting objects

By default, users have no permissions. But as you create policies, you might grant users
permissions that you didn't intend to grant. To avoid such permission loopholes, you can write
a stricter access policy by adding an explicit deny.

To explicitly block users or accounts from deleting objects, you must add the following
actions to a bucket policy: `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`,
and `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` permissions. All three actions are required
because you can delete objects either by explicitly calling the `DELETE Object` API
operations or by configuring their lifecycle (see [Managing the lifecycle of objects](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md)) so that Amazon S3 can remove the objects when their
lifetime expires.

In the following policy example, you explicitly deny `DELETE Object`
permissions to the user `MaryMajor`. An explicit
`Deny` statement always supersedes any other permission granted.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "statement1",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MaryMajor"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObjectVersion",
        "s3:GetBucketAcl"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1",
	 	"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "statement2",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MaryMajor"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:DeleteObjectVersion",
        "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1",
	    "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
