# Deregistering a delegated administrator for S3 Storage Lens

After enabling trusted access, you can also deregister delegate administrator access to
accounts in your organization. Delegated administrator accounts allow other accounts besides
your [management account](../../../managedservices/latest/userguide/management-account.md) to create organization-level dashboards. Only the management
account of an organization can deregister accounts as delegated administrators for the
organization.

You can deregister a delegated administrator by using the AWS Organizations AWS Management Console, REST API,
AWS CLI, or AWS SDKS from the management account. For more information, see [DeregisterDelegatedAdministrator](../../../../reference/organizations/latest/apireference/api-deregisterdelegatedadministrator.md) in the _AWS Organizations API_
_Reference_.

When an account is deregistered as a delegated administrator, the account loses access to
the following:

- All read-only AWS Organizations API operations that provide visibility to the members and
structures of your organization.

- All organization-level dashboards created by the delegated administrator. Deregistering
a delegated administrator also automatically stops all organization-level dashboards created
by that delegated administrator from aggregating new storage metrics.

###### Note

The deregistered delegated administrator will still be able to see the historic data
for the disabled dashboards that they created if data is still available for
querying.

###### To deregister delegated administrators for S3 Storage Lens

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. On the left navigation pane, navigate to **Storage Lens**.

3. Choose **AWS Organizations settings**.

4. Under **Delegated administrators**, choose the account that you
    wish to deregister.

5. Choose **De-register account**. The deregistered account is no
    longer a delegated administrator and is now unable to create organization-level
    dashboards for all accounts and storage in your organization.

6. Choose **Register account**.
