# Using S3 Storage Lens to protect your data

You can use Amazon S3 Storage Lens data-protection metrics to identify buckets where data-protection
best practices haven't been applied. You can use these metrics to take action and apply
standard settings that align with best practices for protecting your data across the buckets
in your account or organization. For example, you can use data-protection metrics to
identify buckets that don't use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) for default encryption or
requests that use AWS Signature Version 2 (SigV2).

The following use cases provide strategies for using your S3 Storage Lens dashboard to identify
outliers and apply data-protection best practices across your S3 buckets.

## Identify buckets that don't use server-side encryption with AWS KMS for default encryption (SSE-KMS)

With Amazon S3 default encryption, you can set the default encryption behavior for an S3
bucket. For more information, see [Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets](bucket-encryption.md).

You can use the **SSE-KMS enabled bucket count** and **% SSE-KMS enabled buckets** metrics to identify buckets that
use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for default encryption. S3 Storage Lens
also provides metrics for unencrypted bytes, unencrypted objects, encrypted bytes, and
encrypted objects. For a complete list of metrics, see [Amazon S3 Storage Lens metrics glossary](storage-lens-metrics-glossary.md).

You can analyze SSE-KMS encryption metrics in the context of general encryption
metrics to identify buckets that don't use SSE-KMS. If you want to use SSE-KMS for all
the buckets in your account or organization, you can then update the default encryption
settings for these buckets to use SSE-KMS. In addition to SSE-KMS, you can use
server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or customer-provided keys
(SSE-C). For more information, see [Protecting data with encryption](usingencryption.md).

### Step 1: Identify which buckets are using SSE-KMS for default encryption

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
    **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name of the
    dashboard that you want to view.

4. In the **Trends and distributions** section, choose
    **% SSE-KMS enabled bucket count** for the primary
    metric and **% encrypted bytes** for the secondary
    metric.

The **Trend for _date_**
    chart updates to display trends for SSE-KMS and encrypted bytes.

5. To view more granular, bucket-level insights for SSE-KMS:
1. Choose a point on the chart. A box will appear with choices for
       more granular insights.

2. Choose the **Buckets** dimension. Then choose
       **Apply**.
6. In the **Distribution by buckets for _date_** chart, choose the **SSE-KMS**
**enabled bucket count** metric.

7. You can now see which buckets have SSE-KMS enabled and which do
    not.

### Step 2: Update bucket default encryption settings

Now that you've determined which buckets use SSE-KMS in the context of your
**% encrypted bytes**, you can identify buckets that don't use
SSE-KMS. You can then optionally navigate to these buckets within the S3 console and
update their default encryption settings to use SSE-KMS or SSE-S3. For more
information, see [Configuring default encryption](default-bucket-encryption.md).

## Identify buckets that have S3 Versioning enabled

When enabled, the S3 Versioning feature retains multiple versions of the same
object that can be used to quickly recover data if an object is accidentally deleted or
overwritten. You can use the **Versioning-enabled bucket count** metric
to see which buckets use S3 Versioning. Then, you can take action in the S3 console to
enable S3 Versioning for other buckets.

### Step 1: Identify buckets that have S3 Versioning enabled

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Storage**
**Lens**, **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name
    of the dashboard that you want to view.

4. In the **Trends and distributions** section, choose
    **Versioning-enabled bucket count** for the primary
    metric and **Buckets** for the secondary metric.

The **Trend for _date_**
    chart updates to display trends for S3 Versioning enabled buckets. Right
    below the trends line, you can see the **Storage class**
**distribution** and **Region distribution**
    subsections.

5. To view more granular insights for any of the buckets that you see in the
    **Trend for _date_**
    chart so that you can perform a deeper analysis, do the following:
1. Choose a point on the chart. A box will appear with choices for
       more granular insights.

2. Choose a dimension to apply to your data for deeper analysis:
       **Account**, **AWS Region**,
       **Storage class**, or
       **Bucket**. Then choose
       **Apply**.
6. In the **Bubble analysis by buckets for _date_** section, choose the
    **Versioning-enabled bucket count**,
    **Buckets**, and **Active buckets**
    metrics.

The **Bubble analysis by buckets for _date_** section updates to display data for the
    metrics that you selected. You can use this data to see which buckets have
    S3 Versioning enabled in the context of your total bucket count. In the
    **Bubble analysis by buckets for _date_** section, you can plot your buckets on
    multiple dimensions by using any three metrics to represent the
    **X-axis**, **Y-axis**, and
    **Size** of the bubble.

### Step 2: Enable S3 Versioning

After you've identified buckets that have S3 Versioning enabled, you can identify
buckets that have never had S3 Versioning enabled or are versioning suspended. Then,
you can optionally enable versioning for these buckets in the S3 console. For more
information, see [Enabling versioning on buckets](manage-versioning-examples.md).

## Identify requests that use AWS Signature Version 2 (SigV2)

You can use the **All unsupported signature requests**
metric to identify requests that use AWS Signature Version 2 (SigV2). This data can
help you identify specific applications that are using SigV2. You can then migrate these
applications to AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4).

SigV4 is the recommended signing method for all new S3 applications. SigV4 provides
improved security and is supported in all AWS Regions. For more information, see
[Amazon S3 update -\
SigV2 deprecation period extended & modified](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-sigv2-deprecation-period-extended-modified).

###### Prerequisite

To see **All unsupported signature requests** in your S3 Storage Lens
dashboard, you must enable S3 Storage Lens **Advanced metrics and**
**recommendations** and then select **Advanced data protection**
**metrics**. For more information, see [Using the S3 console](storage-lens-editing.md#storage_lens_console_editing).

### Step 1: Examine SigV2 signing trends by AWS account, Region, and bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
    **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name of the
    dashboard that you want to view.

4. To identify specific buckets, accounts, and Regions with requests that use
    SigV2:
1. Under **Top N overview for _date_**, in **Top N**,
       enter the number of buckets that you would like to see data for.

2. For **Metric**, choose **All unsupported**
      **signature requests** from the **Data**
      **protection** category.

      The **Top N overview for _date_** updates to display data for
       SigV2 requests by account, AWS Region, and bucket. The
       **Top N overview for _date_** section also shows the
       percentage change from the prior day or week and a spark-line to
       visualize the trend. This trend is a 14-day trend for free metrics
       and a 30-day trend for advanced metrics and recommendations.

      ###### Note

      With S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics and recommendations, metrics
      are available for queries for 15 months. For more information,
      see [Metrics selection](storage-lens-basics-metrics-recommendations.md#storage_lens_basics_metrics_selection).

### Step 2: Identify buckets that are accessed by applications through SigV2 requests

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
    **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name of the
    dashboard that you want to view.

4. In your Storage Lens dashboard, choose the **Bucket**
    tab.

5. Scroll down to the **Buckets** section. Under **Metrics categories**, choose **Data**
**protection**. Then clear **Summary**.

The **Buckets** list updates to display all the available
    **Data protection** metrics for the buckets shown.

6. To filter the **Buckets** list to display only specific
    data-protection metrics, choose the preferences icon (![A screenshot that shows the preferences icon in the S3 Storage Lens dashboard.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/preferences.png)).

7. Clear the toggles for all data-protection metrics until only the following
    metrics remain selected:

- **All unsupported signature requests**

- **% all unsupported signature requests**

8. (Optional) Under **Page size**, choose the number of
    buckets to display in the list.

9. Choose **Confirm**.

The **Buckets** list updates to display bucket-level
    metrics for SigV2 requests. You can use this data to identify specific
    buckets that have SigV2 requests. Then, you can use this information to
    migrate your applications to SigV4. For more information, see [Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)](../api/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.md) in the
    _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Count the total number of replication rules for each bucket

S3 Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3
buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same
AWS account or by different accounts. For more information, see [Replicating objects within and across Regions](replication.md).

You can use S3 Storage Lens replication rule count metrics to get detailed per-bucket
information about your buckets that are configured for replication. This information
includes replication rules within and across buckets and Regions.

###### Prerequisite

To see replication rule count metrics in your S3 Storage Lens dashboard, you must enable
S3 Storage Lens **Advanced metrics and recommendations** and then select
**Advanced data protection metrics**. For more information, see
[Using the S3 console](storage-lens-editing.md#storage_lens_console_editing).

### Step 1: Count the total number of replication rules for each bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
    **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name of the
    dashboard that you want to view.

4. In your Storage Lens dashboard, choose the **Bucket**
    tab.

5. Scroll down to the **Buckets** section. Under **Metrics categories**, choose **Data**
**protection**. Then clear **Summary**.

6. To filter the **Buckets** list to display only
    replication rule count metrics, choose the preferences icon (![A screenshot that shows the preferences icon in the S3 Storage Lens dashboard.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/preferences.png)).

7. Clear the toggles for all data-protection metrics until only the
    replication rule count metrics remain selected:

- **Same-Region Replication rule count**

- **Cross-Region Replication rule count**

- **Same-account replication rule count**

- **Cross-account replication rule count**

- **Total replication rule count**

8. (Optional) Under **Page size**, choose the number of
    buckets to display in the list.

9. Choose **Confirm**.

### Step 2: Add replication rules

After you have a per-bucket replication rule count, you can optionally create
additional replication rules. For more information, see [Examples for configuring live replication](replication-example-walkthroughs.md).

## Identify percentage of Object Lock bytes

With S3 Object Lock, you can store objects by using a _write-once-read-many (WORM)_ model. You can use Object Lock to help
prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or
indefinitely. You can enable Object Lock only when you create a bucket and also enable
S3 Versioning. However, you can edit the retention period for individual object versions
or apply legal holds for buckets that have Object Lock enabled. For more information,
see [Locking objects with Object Lock](object-lock.md).

You can use Object Lock metrics in S3 Storage Lens to see the **%**
**Object Lock bytes** metric for your account or organization. You can use
this information to identify buckets in your account or organization that aren't
following your data-protection best practices.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
    **Dashboards**.

3. In the **Dashboards** list, choose the name of
    the dashboard that you want to view.

4. In the **Snapshot** section, under **Metrics categories**, choose **Data**
**protection**.

The **Snapshot** section updates to display data-protection
    metrics, including the **% Object Lock bytes** metric. You can
    see the overall percentage of Object Lock bytes for your account or
    organization.

5. To see the **% Object Lock bytes** per bucket, scroll down
    to the **Top N overview** section.

To get object-level data for Object Lock, you can also use the **Object Lock object count** and **%**
**Object Lock objects** metrics.

6. For **Metric**, choose **% Object Lock**
**bytes** from the **Data protection**
    category.

By default, the **Top N overview for _date_** section displays metrics for the top 3
    buckets. In the **Top N** field, you can increase the number of
    buckets. The **Top N overview for _date_** section also shows the percentage change
    from the prior day or week and a spark-line to visualize the trend. This trend
    is a 14-day trend for free metrics and a 30-day trend for advanced metrics and
    recommendations.

###### Note

With S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics and recommendations, metrics are available
for queries for 15 months. For more information, see [Metrics selection](storage-lens-basics-metrics-recommendations.md#storage_lens_basics_metrics_selection).

7. Review the following data for **% Object Lock**
