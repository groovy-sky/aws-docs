# Copying an object using multipart upload

Multipart upload allows you to copy objects as a set of parts. The examples in this
section show you how to copy objects greater than 5 GB using the multipart upload API. For
information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md).

You can copy objects less than 5 GB in a single operation without using the multipart
upload API. You can copy objects less than 5 GB using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, REST API, or
AWS SDKs. For more information, see [Copying, moving, and renaming objects](copy-object.md).

For an end-to-end procedure on uploading an object with multipart upload with an additional checksum, see
[Tutorial: Upload an object through multipart upload and verify its data integrity](tutorial-s3-mpu-additional-checksums.md).

The following section show how to copy an object with multipart upload with the REST API or AWS SDKs.

The following sections in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_ describe the
REST API for multipart upload. For copying an existing object, use the Upload Part
(Copy) API and specify the source object by adding the
`x-amz-copy-source` request header in your request.

- [Initiate Multipart\
Upload](../api/mpuploadinitiate.md)

- [Upload\
Part](../api/mpuploaduploadpart.md)

- [Upload Part\
(Copy)](../api/mpuploaduploadpartcopy.md)

- [Complete Multipart\
Upload](../api/mpuploadcomplete.md)

- [Abort Multipart\
Upload](../api/mpuploadabort.md)

- [List Parts](../api/mpuploadlistparts.md)

- [List Multipart\
Uploads](../api/mpuploadlistmpupload.md)

You can use these APIs to make your own REST requests, or you can use one of the
SDKs we provide. For more information about using Multipart Upload with the AWS CLI,
see [Using the AWS CLI](mpu-upload-object.md#UsingCLImpUpload). For more
information about the SDKs, see [AWS SDK support for multipart upload](mpuoverview.md#sdksupportformpu).

To copy an object using the low-level API, do the following:

- Initiate a multipart upload by calling the
`AmazonS3Client.initiateMultipartUpload()` method.

- Save the upload ID from the response object that the
`AmazonS3Client.initiateMultipartUpload()` method returns.
You provide this upload ID for each part-upload operation.

- Copy all of the parts. For each part that you need to copy, create a new
instance of the `CopyPartRequest` class. Provide the part
information, including the source and destination bucket names, source and
destination object keys, upload ID, locations of the first and last bytes of
the part, and part number.

- Save the responses of the `AmazonS3Client.copyPart()` method
calls. Each response includes the `ETag` value and part number
for the uploaded part. You need this information to complete the multipart
upload.

- Call the `AmazonS3Client.completeMultipartUpload()` method to
complete the copy operation.

Java

For examples of how to copy objects using multipart upload with the AWS SDK for Java, see [Copy part of an object from another object](../api/s3-example-s3-uploadpartcopy-section.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

.NET

The following C# example shows how to use the SDK for .NET to copy an Amazon S3
object that is larger than 5 GB from one source location to another,
such as from one bucket to another. To copy objects that are smaller
than 5 GB, use the single-operation copy procedure described in [Using the AWS SDKs](copy-object.md#CopyingObjectsUsingSDKs). For more information
about Amazon S3 multipart uploads, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md).

This example shows how to copy an Amazon S3 object that is larger than 5 GB
from one S3 bucket to another using the SDK for .NET multipart upload
API.
