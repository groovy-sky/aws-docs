# Differences for directory buckets

When using Amazon S3, you can choose the bucket type that best fits your application and
performance requirements. A directory bucket is a type of bucket that is best used for
low latency or data residency use cases. To
learn more about directory buckets, see [Working with directory buckets](directory-buckets-overview.md).

For more information about how directory buckets are different, see
the following topics.

## Differences for directory buckets

- **Directory bucket names**

- A directory bucket name consists of a base name that you
provide and a suffix that contains the ID of the AWS Zone
(an Availability Zone or Local Zone) that your bucket is located in, followed by `--x-s`. For a list of rules and examples of
directory bucket names, see [Directory bucket naming rules](directory-bucket-naming-rules.md).

- **`ListObjectsV2` behavior**

- For directory buckets, `ListObjectsV2` does not
return objects in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.
Additionally, prefixes must end in a delimiter and only "/" can
be specified as the delimiter.

- For directory buckets, `ListObjectsV2` response
includes the prefixes that are related only to in-progress
multipart uploads.

- **Deletion behavior** – When you
delete an object in a directory bucket, Amazon S3 recursively deletes any
empty directories in the object path. For example, if you delete the
object key `dir1/dir2/file1.txt`, Amazon S3 deletes
`file1.txt`. If the ` dir1/`
and `dir2/` directories are empty and contain no
other objects, Amazon S3 also deletes those directories.

- **ETags and checksums** – Entity tags
(ETags) for directory buckets are random alphanumeric strings unique to the object and not MD5 checksums.
For more information about using additional checksums with directory buckets, see
[S3 additional checksum best practices](s3-express-optimizing-performance.md#s3-express-optimizing-performance-checksums).

- **Object keys in `DeleteObjects`**
**requests**

- Object keys in `DeleteObjects` requests must
contain at least one non-white space character. Strings of all
white space characters aren't supported in
`DeleteObjects` requests.

- Object keys in `DeleteObjects` requests cannot
contain Unicode control characters, except for the newline
( `\n`), tab ( `\t`), and carriage
return ( `\r`) characters.

- **Regional and Zonal endpoints** –
Bucket-management API operations for directory buckets are available
through a Regional endpoint and are referred to as Regional endpoint API
operations. Examples of Regional endpoint API operations are
CreateBucket and DeleteBucket. After you create a directory bucket, you
can use Zonal endpoint API operations to upload and manage the objects
in your directory bucket. Zonal endpoint API operations are available
through a Zonal endpoint. Examples of Zonal endpoint API operations are
`PutObject` and `CopyObject`. When using
directory buckets, you must specify the Region in all requests. For
Regional endpoints, you specify the Region, for example,
`s3express-control.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`. For Zonal
endpoints, you specify both the Region and the Availability Zone, for
example, `s3express-usw2-az1.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`. For
more information, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets](s3-express-regions-and-zones.md).

- **Multipart uploads** – You can
upload and copy large objects that are stored in directory buckets by
using the multipart upload process. However, the following are some
differences when using the multipart upload process with objects stored
in directory buckets. For more information, see [Using multipart uploads with directory buckets](s3-express-using-multipart-upload.md).

- The object creation date is the completion date of the
multipart upload.

- Multipart part numbers must use consecutive part numbers. If
you try to complete a multipart upload request with
nonconsecutive part numbers, Amazon S3 generates an HTTP `400
                                          (Bad Request)` error.

- The initiator of a multipart upload can abort the multipart
upload request only if they have been granted explicit allow
access to `AbortMultipartUpload` through the
`s3express:CreateSession` permission. For more
information, see [Authorizing Regional endpoint API operations with IAM](s3-express-security-iam.md).

- **Emptying a directory bucket** –
The `s3 rm` command through the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), the
`delete` operation through Mountpoint, and the
**Empty** bucket option button through the
AWS Management Console are unable to delete in-progress multipart uploads in a
directory bucket. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads, use
the `ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the in-progress
multipart uploads in the bucket and use the
`AbortMultipartUpload` operation to abort all the
in-progress multipart uploads.

- **AWS Local Zones** – Local Zones are only supported for directory buckets not general purpose buckets.

- Appending data to existing objects isn’t supported for
directory buckets that reside in Local Zones. You can only append data to
existing objects in directory buckets that reside in Availability
Zones.

## API operations supported for directory buckets

The directory buckets support both Regional (bucket level, or control plane) and
Zonal (object level, or data plane) endpoint API operations. For more information, see
[Networking for directory buckets](s3-express-networking.md) and
[Endpoints and gateway VPC endpoints](directory-bucket-high-performance.md#s3-express-overview-endpoints). For a list of supported API operations see [Directory bucket API operations](s3-express-apis.md).
