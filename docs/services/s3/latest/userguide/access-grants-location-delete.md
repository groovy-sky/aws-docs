# Delete a registered location

You can delete a location registration from an Amazon S3 Access Grants instance. Deleting the
location deregisters it from the S3 Access Grants instance.

Before you can remove a location registration from an S3 Access Grants instance, you must delete all
of the grants that are associated with this location. For information about how to delete
grants, see [Delete a grant](access-grants-grant-delete.md).

You can delete a location in your S3 Access Grants instance by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI), the Amazon S3 REST API, and the AWS SDKs.

###### To delete a location registration from your S3 Access Grants instance

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Access Grants**.

3. On the **S3 Access Grants** page, choose the Region that contains
    the S3 Access Grants instance that you want to work with.

4. Choose **View details** for the instance.

5. On the details page for the instance, choose the
    **Locations** tab.

6. Find the location that you want to update. To filter the list of
    locations, use the search box.

7. Choose the option button next to the registered location that you want to
    delete.

8. Choose **Deregister**.

9. A dialog box appears that warns you that this action can't be undone. To
    delete the location, choose **Deregister**.

To install the AWS CLI, see [Installing the\
AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.
