# How Amazon S3 authorizes a request

When Amazon S3 receives a request—for example, a bucket or an object operation—it first verifies
that the requester has the necessary permissions. Amazon S3 evaluates all the relevant access
policies, user policies, and resource-based policies (bucket policy, bucket access control
list (ACL), and object ACL) in deciding whether to authorize the request.

###### Note

If the Amazon S3 permission check fails to find valid permissions, an Access Denied (403
Forbidden)permission denied error is returned. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Access Denied (403 Forbidden) errors in Amazon S3](troubleshoot-403-errors.md).

To determine whether the requester has permission to perform the specific operation, Amazon S3
does the following, in order, when it receives a request:

1. Converts all the relevant access policies (user policy, bucket policy, and ACLs) at run
    time into a set of policies for evaluation.

2. Evaluates the resulting set of policies in the following steps. In each step, Amazon S3
    evaluates a subset of policies in a specific context, based on the context
    authority.

1. User context – In the user context, the parent
    account to which the user belongs is the context authority.

Amazon S3 evaluates a subset of policies owned by the parent account. This subset includes
    the user policy that the parent attaches to the user. If the parent also
    owns the resource in the request (bucket or object), Amazon S3 also evaluates the
    corresponding resource policies (bucket policy, bucket ACL, and object ACL)
    at the same time.

A user must have permission from the parent account to perform the
    operation.

This step applies only if the request is made by a user in an AWS account. If the
    request is made by using the root user credentials of an AWS account, Amazon S3
    skips this step.

2. Bucket context – In the bucket context, Amazon S3
    evaluates policies owned by the AWS account that owns the bucket.

If the request is for a bucket operation, the requester must have permission from the
    bucket owner. If the request is for an object, Amazon S3 evaluates all the
    policies owned by the bucket owner to check if the bucket owner has not
    explicitly denied access to the object. If there is an explicit deny set,
    Amazon S3 does not authorize the request.

3. Object context – If the request is for an object,
    Amazon S3 evaluates the subset of policies owned by the object owner.

Following are some example scenarios that illustrate how Amazon S3 authorizes a request.

###### Example– Requester is an IAM principal

If the requester is an IAM principal, Amazon S3 must determine if the parent AWS account to
which the principal belongs has granted the principal necessary permission to perform
the operation. In addition, if the request is for a bucket operation, such as a request
to list the bucket content, Amazon S3 must verify that the bucket owner has granted
permission for the requester to perform the operation. To perform a specific operation
on a resource, an IAM principal needs permission from both the parent AWS account to
which it belongs and the AWS account that owns the resource.

###### Example– Requester is an IAM principal – If the request is for an operation on an object that the bucket owner doesn't own

If the request is for an operation on an object that the bucket owner doesn't own, in
addition to making sure the requester has permissions from the object owner, Amazon S3 must
also check the bucket policy to ensure the bucket owner has not set explicit deny on the
object. A bucket owner (who pays the bill) can explicitly deny access to objects in the
bucket regardless of who owns it. The bucket owner can also delete any object in the
bucket.

By default, when another AWS account uploads an object to your S3 general purpose bucket, that account (the object
writer) owns the object, has access to it, and can grant other users access to it through access control lists
(ACLs). You can use Object Ownership to change this default behavior so that ACLs are
disabled and you, as the bucket owner, automatically own every object in your general purpose bucket. As a
result, access control for your data is based on policies, such as IAM user policies, S3 bucket
policies, virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint policies, and AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs).
