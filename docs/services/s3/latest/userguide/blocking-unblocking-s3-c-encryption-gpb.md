# Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket

Most modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer use server-side encryption with customer-provided
keys (SSE-C) because it lacks the flexibility of server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
keys (SSE-S3) or server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). SSE-C's requirement to
provide the encryption key each time you interact with your SSE-C encrypted data makes it
impractical to share your SSE-C key with other users, roles, or AWS services who read data from
your S3 buckets in order to operate on your data.

To limit the server-side encryption types you can use in your general purpose buckets, you can choose to block SSE-C write requests by updating your default encryption configuration for your buckets. This bucket-level configuration blocks requests to upload objects that specify SSE-C. When SSE-C is blocked for a bucket, any `PutObject`, `CopyObject`, `PostObject`, or Multipart Upload or replication requests that specify SSE-C encryption will be rejected with an HTTP 403 `AccessDenied` error.

This setting is a parameter on the `PutBucketEncryption` API and can also be updated using the S3 Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs, if you have the `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration` permission.

Valid values are `SSE-C`, which blocks SSE-C encryption for the general purpose bucket, and `NONE`, which allows the use SSE-C for writes to the bucket.

###### Important

As [announced on November 19, 2025](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/advanced-notice-amazon-s3-to-disable-the-use-of-sse-c-encryption-by-default-for-all-new-buckets-and-select-existing-buckets-in-april-2026), Amazon Simple Storage Service is deploying a new default bucket security setting that automatically disables server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) for all new general purpose buckets. For existing buckets in AWS accounts with no SSE-C encrypted objects, Amazon S3 will also disable SSE-C for all new write requests. For AWS accounts with SSE-C usage, Amazon S3 will not change the bucket encryption configuration on any of the existing buckets in those accounts. This deployment started on April 6, 2026, and will complete over the next few weeks in 37 AWS Regions, including the AWS China and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

With these changes, applications that need SSE-C encryption must deliberately enable SSE-C by using the [PutBucketEncryption](../api/api-putbucketencryption.md) API operation after creating a new bucket. For more information about this change, see [Default SSE-C setting for new buckets FAQ](default-s3-c-encryption-setting-faq.md).

## Permissions

Use the `PutBucketEncryption` API or the S3 Console, AWS SDKs, or AWS CLI to block or unblock encryption types for a general purpose bucket. You must have the following permission:

- `s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration`

Use the `GetBucketEncryption` API or the S3 Console, AWS SDKs, or AWS CLI to view blocked encryption types for a general purpose bucket. You must have the following permission:

- `s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration`

## Considerations before blocking SSE-C encryption

After you block SSE-C for any bucket, the following encryption behavior applies:

- There is no
change to the encryption of the objects that existed in the bucket before you blocked SSE-C
encryption.

- After you block SSE-C encryption, you can continue to make GetObject and HeadObject
requests on pre-existing objects encrypted with SSE-C as long as you provide the required SSE-C
headers on the requests.

- When SSE-C is blocked for a bucket, any `PutObject`,
`CopyObject`, `PostObject`, or Multipart Upload requests that
specify SSE-C encryption will be rejected with an HTTP 403 `AccessDenied` error.

- If a destination bucket for replication has SSE-C blocked and the source objects being
replicated are encrypted with SSE-C, the replication will fail with an HTTP 403
`AccessDenied` error.

If you want to review if you're using SSE-C encryption in
any of your buckets before blocking this encryption type, you can use tools such as [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail) to monitor access to your data. This [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/auditing-amazon-s3-server-side-encryption-methods-for-object-uploads) shows you how to audit
encryption methods for object uploads in real time. You can also reference this [re:Post article](https://repost.aws/articles/ARhGC12rOiTBCKHcAe9GZXCA/how-to-detect-existing-use-of-sse-c-in-your-amazon-s3-buckets) to guide you through the querying S3 Inventory reports to see if you have any SSE-C
encrypted objects.

### Steps

You can block or unblock server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) for a general purpose bucket by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the Amazon S3 REST API, and AWS SDKs.

To block or unblock SSE-C encryption for a bucket using the Amazon S3 console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **general purpose**
**buckets**.

3. Select the bucket that you would like to block SSE-C encryption for.

4. Select the **Properties** tab for the bucket.

5. Navigate to the **Default Encryption** properties panel for the
    bucket and select **Edit**.

6. In the **Blocked encryption types** section, check the box next
    to **Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)** to block SSE-C encryption or uncheck this box to allow SSE-C.

7. Select **Save Changes**.

To install the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

The following CLI example shows you how to block or unblock SSE-C encryption for a general purpose bucket by using the AWS CLI. To use the command replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

**Request to block SSE-C encryption for a general purpose bucket:**

```

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
  --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
  --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
    "Rules": [{
      "BlockEncryptionTypes": {
        "EncryptionType": "SSE-C"
      }
    }]
  }'
```

**Request to enable the use of SSE-C encryption on a general purpose bucket:**

```

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
  --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket \
  --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
    "Rules": [{
      "BlockEncryptionTypes": {
        "EncryptionType": "NONE"
      }
    }]
  }'
```

SDK for Java 2.x

The following examples show you how to block or unblock SSE-C encryption writes to your general purpose buckets by using the AWS SDKs
