Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might
encounter when working with Amazon S3 and IAM.

## I received an access denied error

Verify that there is not an explicit `Deny`
statement against the requester you are trying to grant permissions to in
either the bucket policy or the identity-based policy.

For detailed information about troubleshooting access denied errors, see [Troubleshoot access denied (403 Forbidden) errors in Amazon S3](troubleshoot-403-errors.md).

## I am not authorized to perform an action in Amazon S3

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your
policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user
tries to use the console to view details about a fictional
`my-example-widget` resource but doesn't
have the fictional `s3:GetWidget` permissions.

```replaceable
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: s3:GetWidget on resource: my-example-widget
```

In this case, the policy for the `mateojackson` user must be updated to allow access to the
`my-example-widget` resource by using the
`s3:GetWidget` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to Amazon S3.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do
this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in
Amazon S3. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the
role to the service.

```nohighlight

User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.

## I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon S3 resources

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who
is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant
people access to your resources.
