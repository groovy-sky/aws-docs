In this example scenario, you own a bucket and you have enabled other AWS accounts to
upload objects. If you have applied the bucket owner enforced setting for
S3 Object Ownership for the bucket, you will own all objects in the bucket, including
objects written by another AWS account. This approach resolves the issue that objects are
not owned by you, the bucket owner. Then, you can delegate permission to users in your own
account or to other AWS accounts. Suppose the bucket owner enforced setting for
S3 Object Ownership is not enabled. That is, your bucket can have objects that other
AWS accounts own.

Now, suppose as a bucket owner, you need to grant cross-account permission on objects,
regardless of who the owner is, to a user in another account. For example, that user could
be a billing application that needs to access object metadata. There are two core
issues:

- The bucket owner has no permissions on those objects created by other AWS accounts. For
the bucket owner to grant permissions on objects it doesn't own, the object owner
must first grant permission to the bucket owner. The object owner is the
AWS account that created the objects. The bucket owner can then delegate those
permissions.

- The bucket owner account can delegate permissions to users in its own account (see [Example 3: Bucket owner granting permissions to objects it does not own](example-walkthroughs-managing-access-example3.md)). However, the
bucket owner account can't delegate permissions to other AWS accounts because
cross-account delegation isn't supported.

In this scenario, the bucket owner can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission to
access objects Then, the bucket owner can grant another AWS account permission to assume
the role, temporarily enabling it to access objects in the bucket.

###### Note

S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to both control ownership of the objects that are
uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs. By default, Object Ownership is set to the Bucket owner enforced setting,
and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to them
exclusively by using access-management policies.

A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs. We recommend that you keep ACLs disabled, except
in circumstances where you need to control access for each object individually. With ACLs disabled, you can use policies
to control access to all objects in your bucket, regardless of who uploaded the objects to your bucket.
For more information, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](about-object-ownership.md).

## Understanding cross-account permissions and using IAM roles

IAM roles enable several scenarios to delegate access to your resources, and
cross-account access is one of the key scenarios. In this example, the bucket owner,
Account A, uses an IAM role to temporarily delegate object access cross-account to
users in another AWS account, Account C. Each IAM role that you create has the
following two policies attached to it:

- A trust policy identifying another AWS account that can assume the
role.

- An access policy defining what permissions—for example,
`s3:GetObject`—are allowed when someone assumes the role.
For a list of permissions you can specify in a policy, see [Policy actions for Amazon S3](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions).

The AWS account identified in the trust policy then grants its user permission to
assume the role. The user can then do the following to access objects:

- Assume the role and, in response, get temporary security credentials.

- Using the temporary security credentials, access the objects in the
bucket.

For more information about IAM roles, see [IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

The following is a summary of the walkthrough
steps:

![Cross-account permissions using IAM roles.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/access-policy-ex4.png)

1. Account A administrator user attaches a bucket policy granting Account B
    conditional permission to upload objects.

2. Account A administrator creates an IAM role, establishing trust with Account
    C, so users in that account can access Account A. The access policy attached to
    the role limits what user in Account C can do when the user accesses Account
    A.

3. Account B administrator uploads an object to the bucket owned by Account A,
    granting full-control permission to the bucket owner.

4. Account C administrator creates a user and attaches a user policy that allows
    the user to assume the role.

5. User in Account C first assumes the role, which returns the user temporary
    security credentials. Using those temporary credentials, the user then accesses
    objects in the bucket.

For this example, you need three accounts. The following table shows how we refer to
these accounts and the administrator users in these accounts. In accordance with the
IAM guidelines (see [About using an administrator user to create resources and grant permissions](example-walkthroughs-managing-access.md#about-using-root-credentials)), we don't use the AWS account root user
credentials in this walkthrough. Instead, you create an administrator user in each
account and use those credentials when creating resources and granting them
permissions.

## Step 0: Preparing for the walkthrough

###### Note

You might want to open a text editor, and write down some of the information as you go
through the steps. In particular, you will need account IDs, canonical user IDs,
IAM user Sign-in URLs for each account to connect to the console, and Amazon
Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM users, and roles.

1. Make sure that you have three AWS accounts and each account has one administrator user
    as shown in the table in the preceding section.
1. Sign up for AWS accounts, as needed. We refer to these accounts as
       Account A, Account B, and Account C.

2. Using Account A credentials, sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) and
       do the following to create an administrator user:

- Create user `AccountAadmin` and note its security credentials.
For more information about adding users, see [Creating an\
IAM user in your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- Grant administrator privileges to **AccountAadmin** by attaching a
user policy giving full access. For instructions, see [Managing\
IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- In the IAM Console **Dashboard**, note the **IAM User**
**Sign-In URL**. Users in this account must use this
URL when signing in to the AWS Management Console. For more information, see
[Sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_how-users-sign-in.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

3. Repeat the preceding step to create administrator users in Account B
       and Account C.
2. For Account C, note the canonical user ID.

When you create an IAM role in Account A, the trust policy grants Account C
    permission to assume the role by specifying the account ID. You can find account
    information as follows:
1. Use your AWS account ID or account alias, your IAM user name, and your password to
       sign in to the [Amazon S3\
       console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. Choose the name of an Amazon S3 bucket to view the details about that
       bucket.

3. Choose the **Permissions** tab and then choose
       **Access Control List**.

4. In the **Access for your AWS account** section, in
       the **Account** column is a long identifier, such as
       `c1daexampleaaf850ea79cf0430f33d72579fd1611c97f7ded193374c0b163b6`.
       This is your canonical user ID.
3. When creating a bucket policy, you will need the following information. Note these
    values:

- **Canonical user ID of Account A**
– When the Account A administrator grants conditional upload
object permission to the Account B administrator, the condition
specifies the canonical user ID of the Account A user that must get
full-control of the objects.

###### Note

The canonical user ID is the Amazon S3–only concept. It is a
64-character obfuscated version of the account ID.

- **User ARN for Account B administrator**
– You can find the user ARN in the
[IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).You
must select the user and find the user's ARN in the
**Summary** tab.

In the bucket policy, you grant `AccountBadmin` permission to upload objects
and you specify the user using the ARN. Here's an example ARN
value:

```nohighlight

arn:aws:iam::AccountB-ID:user/AccountBadmin
```

4. Set up either the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. Make sure that you save administrator
    user credentials as follows:

- If using the AWS CLI, create profiles, `AccountAadmin` and
`AccountBadmin`, in the config file.

- If using the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, make sure that you store credentials for the session as
`AccountAadmin` and `AccountBadmin`.

For instructions, see [Setting up the tools for the walkthroughs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/policy-eval-walkthrough-download-awscli.html).

## Step 1: Do the account A tasks

In this example, Account A is the bucket owner. So user AccountAadmin in Account A
will do the following:

- Create a bucket.

- Attach a bucket policy that grants the Account B administrator permission to
upload objects.

- Create an IAM role that grants Account C permission to assume the role so it
can access objects in the bucket.

### Step 1.1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console

Using the IAM user Sign-in URL for Account A, first sign in to the AWS Management Console as
`AccountAadmin` user. This user will create a bucket and
attach a policy to it.

### Step 1.2: Create a bucket and attach a bucket policy

In the Amazon S3 console, do the following:

1. Create a bucket. This exercise assumes the bucket name is
    `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.

For instructions, see [Creating a general purpose bucket](create-bucket-overview.md).

2. Attach the following bucket policy. The policy grants conditional
    permission to the Account B administrator permission to upload
    objects.

Update the policy by providing your own values for
    `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`,
    `AccountB-ID`, and the
    `CanonicalUserId-of-AWSaccountA-BucketOwner`.
JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "111",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/AccountBadmin"
               },
               "Action": "s3:PutObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*"
           },
           {
               "Sid": "112",
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/AccountBadmin"
               },
               "Action": "s3:PutObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*",
               "Condition": {
                   "StringNotEquals": {
                       "s3:x-amz-grant-full-control": "id=CanonicalUserId-of-AWSaccountA-BucketOwner"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
}

```

### Step 1.3: Create an IAM role to allow Account C cross-account access in Account A

In the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), create an IAM role
( `examplerole`) that grants Account C permission to assume
the role. Make sure that you are still signed in as the Account A administrator
because the role must be created in Account A.

01. Before creating the role, prepare the managed policy that defines the
     permissions that the role requires. You attach this policy to the role in a
     later step.
    1. In the navigation pane on the left, choose
        **Policies** and then choose **Create**
       **Policy**.

    2. Next to **Create Your Own Policy**, choose
        **Select**.

    3. Enter `access-accountA-bucket` in the
        **Policy Name** field.

    4. Copy the following access policy and paste it into the
        **Policy Document** field. The access policy
        grants the role `s3:GetObject` permission so, when the
        Account C user assumes the role, it can only perform the
        `s3:GetObject` operation.
       JSON

       ```json

       {
         "Version":"2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": "s3:GetObject",
             "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/*"
           }
         ]
       }

       ```

    5. Choose **Create Policy**.

       The new policy appears in the list of managed policies.
02. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Roles** and
     then choose **Create New Role**.

03. Under **Select Role Type**, select **Role for**
    **Cross-Account Access**, and then choose the
     **Select** button next to **Provide access**
    **between AWS accounts you own**.

04. Enter the Account C account ID.

    For this walkthrough, you don't need to require users to have multi-factor
     authentication (MFA) to assume the role, so leave that option
     unselected.

05. Choose **Next Step** to set the permissions that will be
     associated with the role.

06. Select the checkbox next to the
     **access-accountA-bucket** policy that you created, and
     then choose **Next Step**.

    The Review page appears so you can confirm the settings for the role
     before it's created. One very important item to note on this page is the
     link that you can send to your users who need to use this role. Users who
     use the link go straight to the **Switch Role** page with
     the Account ID and Role Name fields already filled in. You can also see this
     link later on the **Role Summary** page for any
     cross-account role.

07. Enter `examplerole` for the role name, and then choose
     **Next**
    **Step**.

08. After reviewing the role, choose **Create Role**.

    The `examplerole` role is displayed in the list of
     roles.

09. Choose the role name `examplerole`.

10. Select the **Trust Relationships** tab.

11. Choose **Show policy document** and verify the trust
     policy shown matches the following policy.

    The following trust policy establishes trust with Account C, by allowing
     it the `sts:AssumeRole` action. For more information, see [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html)
     in the _AWS Security Token Service API Reference_.
    JSON

    ```json

    {
        "Version":"2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
            }
        ]
    }

    ```

12. Note the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the `examplerole` role
     that you created.

    Later in the following steps, you attach a user policy to allow an
     IAM user to assume this role, and you identify the role by the ARN value.

## Step 2: Do the Account B tasks

The example bucket owned by Account A needs objects owned by other accounts. In this step, the
Account B administrator uploads an object using the command line tools.

- Using the `put-object` AWS CLI command, upload an object to
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key HappyFace.jpg --body HappyFace.jpg --grant-full-control id="canonicalUserId-ofTheBucketOwner" --profile AccountBadmin
```

Note the following:

- The `--Profile` parameter specifies the `AccountBadmin` profile,
so the object is owned by Account B.

- The parameter `grant-full-control`
grants the bucket owner full-control permission on the object as
required by the bucket policy.

- The `--body` parameter identifies the source file to upload. For example, if
the file is on the C: drive of a Windows computer, you
specify `c:\HappyFace.jpg`.

## Step 3: Do the Account C tasks

In the preceding steps, Account A has already created a role, `examplerole`,
establishing trust with Account C. This role allows users in Account C to access Account
A. In this step, the Account C administrator creates a user (Dave) and delegates him the
`sts:AssumeRole` permission it received from Account A. This approach
allows Dave to assume the `examplerole` and temporarily gain access to
Account A. The access policy that Account A attached to the role limits what Dave can do
when he accesses Account A—specifically, get objects in
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.

### Step 3.1: Create a user in Account C and delegate permission to assume examplerole

1. Using the IAM user sign-in URL for Account C, first sign in to the AWS Management Console as
    `AccountCadmin` user.

2. In the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), create a user, Dave.

For step-by-step instructions, see
    [Creating IAM users (AWS Management Console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console) in the _IAM User Guide_.

3. Note the Dave credentials. Dave will need these credentials to assume the
    `examplerole` role.

4. Create an inline policy for the Dave IAM user to delegate the
    `sts:AssumeRole` permission to Dave on the
    `examplerole` role in Account A.
1. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Users**.

2. Choose the user name **Dave**.

3. On the user details page, select the **Permissions** tab and then expand the
       **Inline Policies** section.

4. Choose **click here** (or **Create User Policy**).

5. Choose **Custom Policy**, and then choose **Select**.

6. Enter a name for the policy in the **Policy Name** field.

7. Copy the following policy into the **Policy Document** field.

      You must update the policy by providing the
       `AccountA-ID`.
      JSON

      ```json

      {
          "Version":"2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "sts:AssumeRole"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/examplerole"
              }
          ]
      }

      ```

8. Choose **Apply Policy**.
5. Save Dave's credentials to the config file of the AWS CLI by adding another profile,
    `AccountCDave`.

```nohighlight

[profile AccountCDave]
aws_access_key_id = UserDaveAccessKeyID
aws_secret_access_key = UserDaveSecretAccessKey
region = us-west-2
```

### Step 3.2: Assume role (examplerole) and access objects

Now Dave can access objects in the bucket owned by Account A as follows:

- Dave first assumes the `examplerole` using his own credentials. This
will return temporary credentials.

- Using the temporary credentials, Dave will then access objects in Account A's
bucket.

1. At the command prompt, run the following AWS CLI `assume-role` command using the
    `AccountCDave` profile.

You must update the ARN value in the command by providing the
    `AccountA-ID` where
    `examplerole` is defined.

```nohighlight

aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::AccountA-ID:role/examplerole --profile AccountCDave --role-session-name test
```

In response, AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) returns temporary security credentials (access key ID,
    secret access key, and a session token).

2. Save the temporary security credentials in the AWS CLI config file under the
    `TempCred` profile.

```nohighlight

[profile TempCred]
aws_access_key_id = temp-access-key-ID
aws_secret_access_key = temp-secret-access-key
aws_session_token = session-token
region = us-west-2
```

3. At the command prompt, run the following AWS CLI command to access objects using the
    temporary credentials. For example, the command specifies the head-object
    API to retrieve object metadata for the `HappyFace.jpg`
    object.

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key HappyFace.jpg SaveFileAs.jpg --profile TempCred
```

Because the access policy attached to `examplerole` allows the actions, Amazon S3
    processes the request. You can try any other action on any other object in
    the bucket.

If you try any other action—for example, `get-object-acl`—you will
    get permission denied because the role isn't allowed that action.

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-object-acl --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key HappyFace.jpg --profile TempCred
```

We used user Dave to assume the role and access the object using temporary credentials.
    It could also be an application in Account C that accesses objects in
    `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. The application can obtain temporary
    security credentials, and Account C can delegate the application permission
    to assume `examplerole`.

## Step 4: Clean up

1. After you're done testing, you can do the following to clean up:
1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) using Account A
       credentials, and do the following:

- In the Amazon S3 console, remove the bucket policy attached to
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. In the bucket
**Properties**, delete the policy in the
**Permissions** section.

- If the bucket is created for this exercise, in the Amazon S3
console, delete the objects and then delete the bucket.

- In the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), remove the `examplerole` you created in Account
A. For step-by-step instructions, see [Deleting an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_manage.html#id_users_deleting) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

- In the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), remove the **AccountAadmin** user.
2. Sign in to the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) by using Account B credentials. Delete the user
    **AccountBadmin**.

3. Sign in to the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) by using Account C credentials. Delete
    **AccountCadmin** and the user Dave.
