# S3 Object Lambda tutorials

###### Note

As of November 7th, 2025, S3 Object Lambda is available only to existing customers that are currently using the service as well as to select AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. For capabilities similar to S3 Object Lambda, learn more here - [Amazon S3 Object Lambda availability change](amazons3-ol-change.md).

The following tutorials present complete end-to-end procedures for some S3 Object Lambda tasks.

With S3 Object Lambda, you can add your own code to process data retrieved from S3 before returning it
to an application. Each of the following tutorials will modify data as it is retrieved from
Amazon S3, without changing the existing object or maintaining multiple copies of the data. The
first tutorial will walk through how to add an AWS Lambda function to a S3 GET request
to modify an object retrieved from S3. The second tutorial demonstrates how to use a prebuilt
Lambda function powered by Amazon Comprehend to protect personally identifiable information (PII) retrieved from S3 before
returning it to an application. The third tutorial uses S3 Object Lambda to add a watermark to an image as it is retrieved from Amazon S3.
