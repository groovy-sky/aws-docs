# Enabling CloudWatch publishing for S3 Storage Lens

You can publish S3 Storage Lens metrics to Amazon CloudWatch to create a unified view of your
operational health in [CloudWatch\
dashboards](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-dashboards.md). You can also use CloudWatch features, such as alarms and triggered
actions, metric math, and anomaly detection, to monitor and take action on S3 Storage Lens
metrics. In addition, CloudWatch API operations enable applications, including third-party
providers, to access your S3 Storage Lens metrics. For more information about CloudWatch features,
see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch-concepts.md).

S3 Storage Lens metrics are published to CloudWatch in the account that owns the S3 Storage Lens configuration.
After you enable the CloudWatch publishing option within advanced metrics, you can access account-level and
bucket-level metrics by configuration ID, account, bucket (for bucket-level metrics only), Region, and
storage class in CloudWatch. Prefix-level metrics are not available in CloudWatch.

You can enable CloudWatch support for new or existing dashboard configurations by using the
S3 console, Amazon S3 REST APIs, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs. The CloudWatch publishing option is
available for dashboards that are upgraded to S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics and
recommendations. For S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics and recommendations pricing, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing). No additional CloudWatch metrics
publishing charges apply; however, other CloudWatch charges, such as dashboards, alarms, and
API calls, do apply.

To enable the CloudWatch publishing option for S3 Storage Lens metrics, see the following
topics.

###### Note

S3 Storage Lens metrics are daily metrics and are published to CloudWatch once per day.
When you query S3 Storage Lens metrics in CloudWatch, the period for the query must be 1 day (86400 seconds). After your daily S3 Storage Lens metrics appear in your S3 Storage Lens dashboard in the
Amazon S3 console, it can take a few hours for these same metrics to appear in CloudWatch. When you enable
the CloudWatch publishing option for S3 Storage Lens metrics for the first time, it can take up to 24
hours for your metrics to publish to CloudWatch.

Currently, S3 Storage Lens metrics cannot be consumed through CloudWatch streams.

When you update an S3 Storage Lens dashboard, you can't change the dashboard name or
home Region. You also can't change the scope of the default dashboard, which is
scoped to your entire account's storage.

###### To update an S3 Storage Lens dashboard to enable CloudWatch publishing

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console
    at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **S3 Storage**
**Lens**, **Dashboards**.

3. Choose the dashboard that you want to edit, and then choose **Edit.**

4. Under **Metrics selection**, choose
    **Advanced metrics and**
**recommendations**.

Advanced metrics and recommendations are available for an additional
    charge. Advanced metrics and recommendations include a 15-month period
    for data queries, usage metrics aggregated at the prefix level, activity
    metrics aggregated by bucket, the CloudWatch publishing option, and contextual
    recommendations that help you optimize storage costs and apply
    data-protection best practices. For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

5. Under **Select Advanced metrics and recommendations**
**features**, select **CloudWatch**
**publishing**.

###### Important

If your configuration enables prefix aggregation for usage metrics,
prefix-level metrics will not be published to CloudWatch. Only bucket,
account, and organization-level S3 Storage Lens metrics are published to
CloudWatch.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

###### To create a new S3 Storage Lens dashboard that enables CloudWatch support

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **Storage Lens**,
     **Dashboards**.

03. Choose **Create dashboard**.

04. Under **General**, define the following configuration
     options:
    1. For **Dashboard name**, enter your dashboard
        name.

       Dashboard names must be fewer than 65 characters and must not
        contain
        special
        characters or spaces. You can't change the
        dashboard name after you create your dashboard.

    2. Choose the **Home Region** for your dashboard.

       Metrics for all Regions included in this dashboard scope are stored centrally in
        the designated home Region. In CloudWatch, S3 Storage Lens metrics are also
        available in the home Region. You can't change the home Region
        after you create your dashboard.
05. (Optional) To add tags, choose **Add tag** and enter
     the tag **Key** and **Value**.

    ###### Note

    You can add up to 50 tags to your dashboard configuration.

06. Define the scope for your configuration:
    1. If you're creating an organization-level configuration, choose the
        accounts to include in the configuration: **Include all**
       **accounts in your configuration** or **Limit**
       **the scope to your signed-in account**.

       ###### Note

       When you create an organization-level configuration that includes
       all accounts, you can include or exclude only Regions, not
       buckets.

    2. Choose the Regions and buckets that you want S3 Storage Lens to include in
        the dashboard configuration by doing the following:

- To include all Regions, choose **Include Regions and buckets**.

- To include specific Regions, clear **Include all Regions**. Under
**Choose Regions to include**, choose the Regions that you want S3 Storage Lens to include in the
dashboard.

- To include specific buckets, clear **Include all buckets**. Under
**Choose buckets to include**, choose the buckets that you want S3 Storage Lens to include in the
dashboard.

###### Note

You can choose up to 50 buckets.
07. For **Metrics selection**, choose **Advanced**
    **metrics and recommendations**.

    For more information about advanced metrics and recommendations pricing, see
     [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

08. Under **Advanced metrics and recommendations features**,
     select the options that you want to enable:

- **Advanced metrics**

- **CloudWatch publishing**

###### Important

If you enable prefix aggregation for your S3 Storage Lens configuration,
prefix-level metrics will not be published to CloudWatch. Only
bucket, account, and organization-level S3 Storage Lens metrics are
published to CloudWatch.

- **Prefix aggregation**

###### Note

For more information about advanced metrics and recommendations features, see [Metrics selection](storage-lens-basics-metrics-recommendations.md#storage_lens_basics_metrics_selection).

09. If you enabled **Advanced metrics**, select the
     **Advanced metrics categories** that you want to
     display in your S3 Storage Lens dashboard:

- **Activity metrics**

- **Detailed status code metrics**

- **Advanced cost optimization metrics**

- **Advanced data protection metrics**

For more information about metrics categories, see [Metrics categories](storage-lens-basics-metrics-recommendations.md#storage_lens_basics_metrics_types). For a complete
list of metrics, see [Amazon S3 Storage Lens metrics glossary](storage-lens-metrics-glossary.md).

10. (Optional) Configure your metrics export.

    For more information about how to configure a metrics export, see step [Using the S3 console](storage-lens-creating-dashboard.md#storage_lens_console_creating).

11. Choose **Create dashboard**.

The following AWS CLI example enables the CloudWatch publishing option by using a
S3 Storage Lens organization-level advanced metrics and recommendations configuration.
To use this example, replace the `user input
                            placeholders` with your own information.

To enable the CloudWatch publishing option by using the Amazon S3 REST API, you can use
[PutStorageLensConfiguration](../api/api-control-putstoragelensconfiguration.md).

###### Next steps

After you enable the CloudWatch publishing option, you can access your S3 Storage Lens metrics in CloudWatch. You also can leverage CloudWatch features to monitor and analyze your S3 Storage Lens data in CloudWatch. For more information, see the following topics:
