# Using multipart uploads with directory buckets

You can use the multipart upload process to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each
part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts
independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that
part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3
assembles these parts and creates the object. In general, when your object size reaches 100
MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single
operation.

Using multipart upload provides the following advantages:

- **Improved throughput** – You can upload parts
in parallel to improve throughput.

- **Quick recovery from any network issues** –
Smaller part sizes minimize the impact of restarting a failed upload because of a
network error.

- **Pause and resume object uploads** – You can
upload object parts over time. After you initiate a multipart upload, there is no
expiration date. You must explicitly complete or abort the multipart upload.

- **Begin an upload before you know the final object**
**size** – You can upload an object as you are creating it.

We recommend that you use multipart uploads in the following ways:

- If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use
multipart uploads to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading
object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance.

- If you're uploading over a spotty network, use multipart uploads to increase
resiliency to network errors by avoiding upload restarts. When using multipart
uploads, you need to retry uploading only the parts that are interrupted during the
upload. You don't need to restart uploading your object from the beginning.

When you're using multipart uploads to upload objects to the Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class in
directory buckets, the multipart upload process is similar to the process of using multipart
upload to upload objects to general purpose buckets. However, there are some notable
differences.

For more information about using multipart uploads to upload objects to S3 Express One Zone, see
the following topics.

## The multipart upload process

A multipart upload is a three-step process:

- You initiate the upload.

- You upload the object parts.

- After you have uploaded all of the parts, you complete the multipart
upload.

Upon receiving the complete multipart upload request, Amazon S3 constructs the object from
the uploaded parts, and you can then access the object as you would any other object in
your bucket.

###### Multipart upload initiation

When you send a request to initiate a multipart upload, Amazon S3 returns a response
with an upload ID, which is a unique identifier for your multipart upload. You must
include this upload ID whenever you upload parts, list the parts, complete an
upload, or abort an upload.

###### Parts upload

When uploading a part, in addition to the upload ID, you must specify a part
number. When you're using a multipart upload with S3 Express One Zone, the multipart part
numbers must be consecutive part numbers. If you try to complete a multipart upload
request with nonconsecutive part numbers, an `HTTP 400 Bad Request`
(Invalid Part Order) error is generated.

A part number uniquely identifies a part and its position in the object that you are
uploading. If you upload a new part by using the same part number as a previously
uploaded part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten.

Whenever you upload a part, Amazon S3 returns an entity tag (ETag) header in its response.
For each part upload, you must record the part number and the ETag value. The ETag
values for all object part uploads will remain the same, but each part will be assigned
a different part number. You must include these values in the subsequent request to
complete the multipart upload.

Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When
doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request,
the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption
configuration of the destination bucket. The default encryption configuration of an Amazon S3
bucket is always enabled and is at a minimum set to server-side encryption with Amazon S3
managed keys (SSE-S3). For directory buckets, SSE-S3 and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys
(SSE-KMS) are supported. For more
information, see [Data protection and encryption](s3-express-data-protection.md).

###### Multipart upload completion

When you complete a multipart upload, Amazon S3 creates the object by concatenating the
parts in ascending order based on the part number. After a successful
_complete_ request, the parts no longer exist.

Your _complete multipart upload_ request must include the upload ID
and a list of both part numbers and their corresponding ETag values. The Amazon S3 response
includes an ETag that uniquely identifies the combined object data. This ETag is not an
MD5 hash of the object data.

###### Multipart upload listings

You can list the parts of a specific multipart upload or all in-progress multipart
uploads. The list parts operation returns the parts information that you have
uploaded for a specific multipart upload. For each list parts request, Amazon S3 returns
the parts information for the specified multipart upload, up to a maximum of 1,000
parts. If there are more than 1,000 parts in the multipart upload, you must use
pagination to retrieve all the parts.

The returned list of parts doesn't include parts that haven't finished uploading.
Using the _list multipart uploads_ operation, you can obtain a list
of multipart uploads that are in progress.

An in-progress multipart upload is an upload that you have initiated, but have not yet
completed or aborted. Each request returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads. If there are
more than 1,000 multipart uploads in progress, you must send additional requests to
retrieve the remaining multipart uploads. Use the returned listing only for
verification. Do not use the result of this listing when sending a _complete_
_multipart upload_ request. Instead, maintain your own list of the part
numbers that you specified when uploading parts and the corresponding ETag values that
Amazon S3 returns.

For more information about multipart upload listings, see [ListParts](../api/api-listparts.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Checksums with multipart upload operations

When you upload an object to, you can specify a checksum algorithm to check object
integrity. MD5 is not supported for directory buckets. You can specify one of the
following Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) or Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) data-integrity
check algorithms:

- CRC32

- CRC32C

- SHA-1

- SHA-256

You can use the Amazon S3 REST API or the AWS SDKs to retrieve the checksum value for
individual parts by using `GetObject` or `HeadObject`. If you want
to retrieve the checksum values for individual parts of multipart uploads still in
process, you can use `ListParts`.

###### Important

When using the preceding checksum algorithms, the multipart part numbers must use
consecutive part numbers. If you try to complete a multipart upload request with
nonconsecutive part numbers, Amazon S3 generates an `HTTP 400 Bad Request`
(Invalid Part Order) error.

For more information about how checksums work with multipart upload objects, see [Checking object integrity in Amazon S3](checking-object-integrity.md).

## Concurrent multipart upload operations

In a distributed development environment, your application can initiate several
updates on the same object at the same time. For example, your application might
initiate several multipart uploads by using the same object key. For each of these
uploads, your application can then upload parts and send a complete upload request to
Amazon S3 to create the object. For S3 Express One Zone, the object creation time is the completion
date of the multipart upload.

###### Important

Versioning isn’t supported for objects that are stored in
directory buckets.

## Multipart uploads and pricing

After you initiate a multipart upload, Amazon S3 retains all the parts until you either
complete or abort the upload. Throughout its lifetime, you are billed for all storage,
bandwidth, and requests for this multipart upload and its associated parts. If you abort
the multipart upload, Amazon S3 deletes the upload artifacts and any parts that you have
uploaded, and you are no longer billed for them. There are no early delete charges for
deleting incomplete multipart uploads, regardless of the storage class specified. For
more information about pricing, see [Amazon S3\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

###### Important

If the complete multipart upload request isn't sent successfully, the object parts
aren't assembled and an object isn't created. You are billed for all storage associated
with uploaded parts. It's important that you either complete the multipart upload to
have the object created or abort the multipart upload to remove any uploaded parts.

Before you can delete a directory bucket, you must complete or abort all
in-progress multipart uploads. Directory buckets don't support S3 Lifecycle
configurations. If needed, you can list your active multipart uploads, then abort
the uploads, and then delete your bucket.

## Multipart upload API operations and permissions

To allow access to object management API operations on a directory bucket, you grant
the `s3express:CreateSession` permission in a bucket policy or an AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) identity-based policy.

You must have the necessary permissions to use the multipart upload operations. You
can use bucket policies or IAM identity-based policies to grant IAM principals
permissions to perform these operations. The following table lists the required
permissions for various multipart upload operations.

You can identify the initiator of a multipart upload through the
`Initiator` element. If the initiator is an AWS account, this element
provides the same information as the `Owner` element. If the initiator is an
IAM user, this element provides the user ARN
and
display name.

ActionRequired permissions

For the initiator to upload a part for an object, the owner of the
bucket must allow the initiator to perform the
`s3express:CreateSession` action on the
object.

Complete a multipart upload

To complete a multipart upload, you must be allowed to perform the
`s3express:CreateSession` action on the directory
bucket.

For the initiator to complete a multipart upload, the bucket owner
must allow the initiator to perform the

### Creating a multipart upload

###### Note

For directory buckets, when you perform a `CreateMultipartUpload` operation and an `UploadPartCopy` operation,
the bucket's default encryption must use the desired encryption configuration, and
the request headers you provide in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request must match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.

The following examples show how to create a multipart upload.

SDK for Java 2.x

###### Example

```JavaV2

/**
 * This method creates a multipart upload request that generates a unique upload ID that is used to track
 * all the upload parts
 *
 * @param s3
 * @param bucketName - for example, 'doc-example-bucket--use1-az4--x-s3'
 * @param key
 * @return
 */
 private static String createMultipartUpload(S3Client s3, String bucketName, String key) {

     CreateMultipartUploadRequest createMultipartUploadRequest = CreateMultipartUploadRequest.builder()
             .bucket(bucketName)
             .key(key)
             .build();

     String uploadId = null;

     try {
         CreateMultipartUploadResponse response = s3.createMultipartUpload(createMultipartUploadRequest);
         uploadId = response.uploadId();
     }
     catch (S3Exception e) {
         System.err.println(e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage());
         System.exit(1);
     }
     return uploadId;
```

SDK for Python

###### Example

```Python

def create_multipart_upload(s3_client, bucket_name, key_name):
    '''
   Create a multipart upload to a directory bucket

   :param s3_client: boto3 S3 client
   :param bucket_name: The destination bucket for the multipart upload
   :param key_name: The key name for the object to be uploaded
   :return: The UploadId for the multipart upload if created successfully, else None
   '''

   try:
        mpu = s3_client.create_multipart_upload(Bucket = bucket_name, Key = key_name)
        return mpu['UploadId']
    except ClientError as e:
        logging.error(e)
        return None
```

### Creating a multipart upload copy operation

###### Note

- To encrypt new object part copies in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)).
The [AWS managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk) ( `aws/s3`) isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 [customer managed key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.
You can't specify server-side encryption settings for new object part copies with SSE-KMS in the [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md) request headers.
Also, the request headers you provide in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request must match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.

- S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md). In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.

The following examples show how to copy objects from one bucket to another using a multipart upload.

The following examples show how to list the parts of a multipart upload to a directory bucket by using the AWS CLI. To use the command replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api list-parts --bucket bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3 --key KEY_NAME --upload-id "AS_mgt9RaQE9GEaifATue15dAAAAAAAAAAEMAAAAAAAAADQwNzI4MDU0MjUyMBYAAAAAAAAAAA0AAAAAAAAAAAH2AfYAAAAAAAAEBSD0WBKMAQAAAABneY9yBVsK89iFkvWdQhRCcXohE8RbYtc9QvBOG8tNpA"
```
