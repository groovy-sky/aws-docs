# S3 Metadata live inventory tables schema

The live inventory table provides a simple, queryable inventory of all the objects and their versions
in your bucket so that you can determine the latest state of your data. Updates to your objects are
typically reflected in the inventory table within one hour.

You can use this table to simplify and speed up business workflows and big data jobs by identifying
objects that you want to process for various workloads. For example, you can query the inventory table to
do the following:

- Find all objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class.

- Create a distribution of object tags or find objects without tags.

- Find all objects that aren't encrypted by using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys
(SSE-KMS).

When you enable the inventory table for your metadata table configuration, the table goes through a
process known as _backfilling_, during which Amazon S3 scans your general
purpose bucket to retrieve the initial metadata for all objects in the bucket. Depending on the number of
objects in your bucket, this process can take minutes (minimum 15 minutes) to hours. When the backfilling process is finished,
the status of your inventory table changes from **Backfilling** to
**Active**. After backfilling is completed, updates to your objects are typically
reflected in the inventory table within one hour.

###### Note

You're charged for backfilling your inventory table. If your general purpose bucket has more than
one billion objects, you're also charged a monthly fee for your inventory table. For more information,
see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

Amazon S3 Metadata inventory tables contain rows and columns. Each row represents the current state of an
object in your general purpose bucket. The inventory table provides a simple, queryable inventory of all
objects in your bucket so that you can determine the current state of your data.

The following is an example of an inventory table for a general purpose bucket named
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket:`

Inventory tables have the following schema:

Column nameRequired?Data type

`bucket`

YesStringThe general purpose bucket name. For more information, see [General purpose bucket naming rules](bucketnamingrules.md).

`key`

YesStringThe object key name (or key) that uniquely identifies the object in the bucket. For more
information, see [Naming Amazon S3 objects](object-keys.md).

`sequence_number`

YesString

The sequence number, which is an ordinal that's included in the records for a given object.
To order records of the same bucket and key, you can sort on `sequence_number`. For a
given bucket and key, a lexicographically larger `sequence_number` value implies that
the record was introduced to the bucket more recently.

`version_id`

NoString

The object's version ID. When you enable versioning on a bucket, Amazon S3 assigns a version
number to objects that are added to the bucket. For more information, see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md).

Objects that are stored in your bucket before you set the versioning state have a version ID
of null.

`is_delete_marker`

NoBoolean

The object's delete marker status. If the object is a delete marker, this value is
`True`. Otherwise, it's `False`. For more information, see [Working with delete markers](deletemarker.md).

###### Note

Rows that are added for delete markers have a `record_type` value of
`DELETE`, not `UPDATE_METADATA`. If the delete marker is created as
the result of an S3 Lifecycle expiration, the `requester` value is
`s3.amazonaws.com`.

`size`

NoLong

The object size in bytes, not including the size of incomplete multipart uploads or object
metadata. If `is_delete_marker` is `True`, the size is `0`. For
more information, see [System-defined object metadata](usingmetadata.md#SysMetadata).

`last_modified_date`

NoTimestamp NTZ (no time zone)

The object creation date or the last modified date, whichever is the latest. For multipart
uploads, the object creation date is the date when the multipart upload is initiated. For more
information, see [System-defined object metadata](usingmetadata.md#SysMetadata).

`e_tag`

NoString

The entity tag (ETag), which is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the
contents of an object, not to its metadata. The ETag can be an MD5 digest of the object data.
Whether the ETag is an MD5 digest depends on how the object was created and how it's encrypted.
For more information, see [Object](../api/api-object.md) in the _Amazon S3 API_
_Reference_.

`storage_class`

NoString

The storage class that’s used for storing the object. One of `STANDARD`,
`REDUCED_REDUNDANCY`, `STANDARD_IA`, `ONEZONE_IA`,
`INTELLIGENT_TIERING`, `GLACIER`, `DEEP_ARCHIVE`, or
`GLACIER_IR`. For more information, see [Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes](storage-class-intro.md).

`is_multipart`

NoBoolean

The object's upload type. If the object was uploaded as a multipart upload, this value is
`True`. Otherwise, it's `False`. For more information, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md).

`encryption_status`

NoString

The object's server-side encryption status, depending on what kind of encryption key is
used: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys
(DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C). If the object is
unencrypted, this value is null. Possible values are `SSE-S3`, `SSE-KMS`,
`DSSE-KMS`, `SSE-C`, or null. For more information, see [Protecting data with encryption](usingencryption.md).

`is_bucket_key_enabled`

NoBoolean

The object's S3 Bucket Key enablement status. If the object uses an S3 Bucket Key for
SSE-KMS, this value is `True`. Otherwise, it's `False`. For more
information, see [Configuring an S3 Bucket Key at the object level](configuring-bucket-key-object.md).

`kms_key_arn`

NoString

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key with which the object is encrypted, for rows
where `encryption_status` is `SSE-KMS` or `DSSE-KMS`. If the
object isn't encrypted with SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS, the value is null. For more information, see
[Using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)](usingkmsencryption.md) and [Using dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS)](usingdssencryption.md).

###### Note

If a row represents an object version that no longer existed at the time that a delete or
overwrite event was processed, `kms_key_arn` contains a null value, even if the
`encryption_status` column value is `SSE-KMS` or
`DSSE-KMS`.

`checksum_algorithm`

NoString

The algorithm that’s used to create the checksum for the object, one of
`CRC64-NVME`, `CRC32`, `CRC32C`, `SHA1`, or
`SHA256`. If no checksum is present, this value is null. For more information, see
[Using supported checksum algorithms](checking-object-integrity-upload.md#using-additional-checksums).

`object_tags`

NoMap <String, String>

The object tags that are associated with the object. Object tags are stored as a map of
key-value pairs. If an object has no object tags, an empty map ( `{}`) is stored. For
more information, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

###### Note

If the `record_type` value is `DELETE`, the `object_tags`
column contains a null value. If the `record_type` value is `CREATE` or
`UPDATE_METADATA`, rows that represent object versions that no longer existed at
the time that a delete or overwrite event was processed will contain a null value in the
`object_tags` column.

`user_metadata`

NoMap <String, String>

The user metadata that's associated with the object. User metadata is stored as a map of
key-value pairs. If an object has no user metadata, an empty map ( `{}`) is stored.
For more information, see [User-defined object metadata](usingmetadata.md#UserMetadata).

###### Note

If the `record_type` value is `DELETE`, the
`user_metadata` column contains a null value. If the `record_type`
value is `CREATE` or `UPDATE_METADATA`, rows that represent object
versions that no longer existed at the time that a delete or overwrite event was processed
will contain a null value in the `user_metadata` column.
