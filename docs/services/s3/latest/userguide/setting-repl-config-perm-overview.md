# Setting up permissions for live replication

When setting up live replication in Amazon S3, you must acquire the necessary permissions as
follows:

- You must grant the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) principal (user or role) who will be creating replication
rules a certain set of permissions.

- Amazon S3 needs permissions to replicate objects on your behalf. You grant these permissions by
creating an IAM role and then specifying that role in your replication configuration.

- When the source and destination buckets aren't owned by the same accounts, the owner
of the destination bucket must also grant the source bucket owner permissions to store the
replicas.

###### Note

If you're using S3 Batch Operations to replicate objects on demand instead of setting up live
replication, a different IAM role and policies are required for S3 Batch Replication. For a
Batch Replication IAM role and policy examples, see [Configuring an IAM role for S3 Batch Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-batch-replication-policies.html).

- [(Optional) Step 4: Granting permissions to change replica ownership](#change-replica-ownership)

## Step 1: Granting permissions to the IAM principal who's creating replication rules

The IAM user or role that you will use to create replication rules needs permissions to create replication rules for one- or two-way replications. If the user or role doesn't have these permissions, you won't be able to create replication rules. For more information, see [IAM Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

The user or role needs the following actions:

- `iam:AttachRolePolicy`

- `iam:CreatePolicy`

- `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`

- `iam:PassRole`

- `iam:PutRolePolicy`

- `s3:GetBucketVersioning`

- `s3:GetObjectVersionAcl`

- `s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication`

- `s3:GetReplicationConfiguration`

- `s3:PutReplicationConfiguration`

Following is a sample IAM policy that includes these actions.

            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/service-role/s3*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:List*"
            ],

            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

## Step 2: Creating an IAM role for Amazon S3 to assume

By default, all Amazon S3 resources—buckets, objects, and related
subresources—are private, and only the resource owner can access the resource. Amazon S3
needs permissions to read and replicate objects from the source bucket. You grant these
permissions by creating an IAM role and specifying that role in your replication
configuration.

This section explains the trust policy and the minimum required permissions policy that
are attached to this IAM role. The example walkthroughs provide step-by-step instructions
to create an IAM role. For more information, see [Examples for configuring live replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-example-walkthroughs.html).

###### Note

If you're using the console to create your replication configuration, we recommend that you skip
this section and instead have the console create this IAM role and the necessary trust and
permission policies for you.

The _trust policy_ identifies which principal
identities can assume the IAM role. The _permissions_
_policy_ specifies which actions the IAM role can perform, on which resources,
and under what conditions.

- The following example shows a _trust policy_ where
you identify Amazon S3 as the AWS service principal that can assume the role:
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement":[
        {
           "Effect":"Allow",
           "Principal":{
              "Service":"s3.amazonaws.com"
           },
           "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
        }
     ]
}

```

- The following example shows a _trust policy_ where
you identify Amazon S3 and S3 Batch Operations as service principals that can assume the role. Use
this approach if you're creating a Batch Replication job. For more information, see
[Create a Batch Replication job for new replication rules or destinations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-batch-replication-new-config.html).
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement":[
        {
           "Effect":"Allow",
           "Principal":{
              "Service": [
                "s3.amazonaws.com",
                "batchoperations.s3.amazonaws.com"
             ]
           },
           "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
        }
     ]
}

```

For more information about IAM roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

- The following example shows the _permissions_
_policy_, where you grant the IAM role permissions to perform replication
tasks on your behalf. When Amazon S3 assumes the role, it has the permissions that you
specify in this policy. In this policy, `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` is the
source bucket, and `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` is the destination
bucket.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
        {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
              "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration",
              "s3:ListBucket"
           ],
           "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket"
           ]
        },
        {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
              "s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
              "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
              "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging"
           ],
           "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/*"
           ]
        },
        {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
              "s3:ReplicateObject",
              "s3:ReplicateDelete",
              "s3:ReplicateTags"
           ],
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
        }
     ]
}

```

The permissions policy grants permissions for the following actions:

- `s3:GetReplicationConfiguration` and `s3:ListBucket` –
Permissions for these actions on the `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` bucket
allow Amazon S3 to retrieve the replication configuration and list the bucket content.
(The current permissions model requires the `s3:ListBucket` permission
for accessing delete markers.)

- `s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication` and
`s3:GetObjectVersionAcl` – Permissions for these actions are
granted on all objects to allow Amazon S3 to get a specific object version and access
control list (ACL) associated with the objects.

- `s3:ReplicateObject` and `s3:ReplicateDelete` –
Permissions for these actions on all objects in the
`amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` bucket allow Amazon S3 to replicate
objects or delete markers to the destination bucket. For information about delete
markers, see [How delete operations affect replication](replication-what-is-isnot-replicated.md#replication-delete-op).

###### Note

Permissions for the `s3:ReplicateObject` action on the
`amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` bucket also allow replication of
metadata such as object tags and ACLs. Therefore, you don't need to explicitly
grant permission for the `s3:ReplicateTags` action.

- `s3:GetObjectVersionTagging` – Permissions for this action on
objects in the `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` bucket allow Amazon S3 to read
object tags for replication. For more information about object tags, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md). If Amazon S3 doesn't have
the `s3:GetObjectVersionTagging` permission, it replicates the objects,
but not the object tags.

For a list of Amazon S3 actions, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html#list_amazons3-actions-as-permissions) in the _Service Authorization Reference_.

For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](using-with-s3-policy-actions.md).

###### Important

The AWS account that owns the IAM role must have permissions for the actions
that it grants to the IAM role.

For example, suppose that the source bucket contains objects owned by another
AWS account. The owner of the objects must explicitly grant the AWS account that
owns the IAM role the required permissions through the objects' access control lists
(ACLs). Otherwise, Amazon S3 can't access the objects, and replication of the objects
fails. For information about ACL permissions, see [Access control list (ACL) overview](acl-overview.md).

The permissions described here are related to the minimum replication
configuration. If you choose to add optional replication configurations, you must
grant additional permissions to Amazon S3:

- To replicate encrypted objects, you also need to grant the necessary AWS Key Management Service
(AWS KMS) key permissions. For more information, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html).

- To use Object Lock with replication, you must grant two additional
permissions on the source S3 bucket in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you use to
set up replication. The two additional permissions are
`s3:GetObjectRetention` and `s3:GetObjectLegalHold`. If
the role has an `s3:Get*` permission statement, that statement
satisfies the requirement. For more information, see [Using Object Lock with S3 Replication](object-lock-managing.md#object-lock-managing-replication).

## (Optional) Step 3: Granting permissions when the source and destination buckets are owned by different AWS accounts

When the source and destination buckets aren't owned by the same accounts, the owner of
the destination bucket must also add a bucket policy to grant the owner of the source bucket
permissions to perform replication actions, as shown in the following example. In this
example policy, `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` is the destination
bucket.

You can also use the Amazon S3 console to automatically generate this bucket policy for you.
For more information, see [Enable receiving replicated objects from a\
source bucket](#receiving-replicated-objects).

###### Note

The ARN format of the role might appear different. If the role was created by using
the console, the ARN format is
`arn:aws:iam::account-ID:role/service-role/role-name`.
If the role was created by using the AWS CLI, the ARN format is
`arn:aws:iam::account-ID:role/role-name`.
For more information, see [IAM\
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PolicyForDestinationBucket",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Permissions on objects",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/service-role/source-account-IAM-role"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ReplicateDelete",
                "s3:ReplicateObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Permissions on bucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/service-role/source-account-IAM-role"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:List*",
                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
                "s3:PutBucketVersioning"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket"
        }
    ]
}

```

For an example, see [Configuring replication for buckets in different accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-walkthrough-2.html).

If objects in the source bucket are tagged, note the following:

- If the source bucket owner grants Amazon S3 permission for the
`s3:GetObjectVersionTagging` and `s3:ReplicateTags` actions to
replicate object tags (through the IAM role), Amazon S3 replicates the tags along with the
objects. For information about the IAM role, see [Step 2: Creating an IAM role for Amazon S3 to assume](#setting-repl-config-same-acctowner).

- If the owner of the destination bucket doesn't want to replicate the tags, they can
add the following statement to the destination bucket policy to explicitly deny
permission for the `s3:ReplicateTags` action. In this policy,
`amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` is the destination bucket.

```nohighlight

...
     "Statement":[
        {
           "Effect":"Deny",
           "Principal":{
              "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::source-bucket-account-id:role/service-role/source-account-IAM-role"
           },
           "Action":"s3:ReplicateTags",
           "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
        }
     ]
...
```

###### Note

- If you want to replicate encrypted objects, you also must grant the necessary
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key permissions. For more information, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html).

- To use Object Lock with replication, you must grant two additional permissions on
the source S3 bucket in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you use to set up replication.
The two additional permissions are `s3:GetObjectRetention` and
`s3:GetObjectLegalHold`. If the role has an `s3:Get*`
permission statement, that statement satisfies the requirement. For more information,
see [Using Object Lock with S3 Replication](object-lock-managing.md#object-lock-managing-replication).

###### Enable receiving replicated objects from a source bucket

Instead of manually adding the preceding policy to your destination bucket, you can
quickly generate the policies needed to enable receiving replicated objects from a source
bucket through the Amazon S3 console.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

3. In the **Buckets** list, choose the bucket that you want to use as
    a destination bucket.

4. Choose the **Management** tab, and scroll down to
    **Replication rules**.

5. For **Actions**, choose **Receive replicated**
**objects**.

Follow the prompts and enter the AWS account ID of the source bucket account, and
    then choose **Generate policies**. The console generates an Amazon S3 bucket
    policy and a KMS key policy.

6. To add this policy to your existing bucket policy, either choose **Apply**
**settings** or choose **Copy** to manually copy the changes.

7. (Optional) Copy the AWS KMS policy to your desired KMS key policy in the AWS Key Management Service
    console.

## (Optional) Step 4: Granting permissions to change replica ownership

When different AWS accounts own the source and destination buckets, you can tell Amazon S3 to change
the ownership of the replica to the AWS account that owns the destination bucket. To override the
ownership of replicas, you must either grant some additional permissions or adjust the
S3 Object Ownership settings for the destination bucket. For more information about owner override,
see [Changing the replica owner](replication-change-owner.md).
