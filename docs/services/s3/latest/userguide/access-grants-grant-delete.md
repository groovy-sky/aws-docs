# Delete a grant

You can delete access grants from your Amazon S3 Access Grants instance. You can't undo an access grant
deletion. After you delete an access grant, the grantee will no longer have access to your
Amazon S3 data.

You can delete an access grant by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the Amazon S3
REST API, and the AWS SDKs.

###### To delete an access grant

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Access**
**Grants**.

3. On the **S3 Access Grants** page, choose the Region that contains
    the S3 Access Grants instance that you want to work with.

4. Choose **View details** for the instance.

5. On the details page, choose the **Grants** tab.

6. Search for the grant that you want to delete. When you locate the grant,
    choose the radio button next to it.

7. Choose **Delete**. A dialog box appears with a warning
    that your action can't be undone. Choose **Delete** again
    to delete the grant.

To install the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

To use the following example command, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.
