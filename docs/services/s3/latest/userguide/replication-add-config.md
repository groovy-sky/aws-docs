# Replication configuration file elements

Amazon S3 stores a replication configuration as XML. If you're configuring replication
programmatically through the Amazon S3 REST API, you specify the various elements of your
replication configuration in this XML file. If you're configuring replication through the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you specify your replication configuration using JSON format. For JSON
examples, see the walkthroughs in [Examples for configuring live replication](replication-example-walkthroughs.md).

###### Note

The latest version of the replication configuration XML format is V2. XML V2 replication
configurations are those that contain the `<Filter>` element for rules, and
rules that specify S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

To see your replication configuration version, you can use the
`GetBucketReplication` API operation. For more information, see [GetBucketReplication](../api/api-getbucketreplication.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the XML V1 replication
configuration format. If you've used the XML V1 replication configuration format, see [Backward compatibility considerations](#replication-backward-compat-considerations) for backward compatibility
considerations.

In the replication configuration XML file, you must specify an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and
one or more rules, as shown in the following example:

```nohighlight

<ReplicationConfiguration>
    <Role>IAM-role-ARN</Role>
    <Rule>
        ...
    </Rule>
    <Rule>
         ...
    </Rule>
     ...
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

Amazon S3 can't replicate objects without your permission. You grant permissions to Amazon S3 with
the IAM role that you specify in the replication configuration. Amazon S3 assumes this IAM role
to replicate objects on your behalf. You must grant the required permissions to the IAM role
first. For more information about managing permissions, see [Setting up permissions for live replication](setting-repl-config-perm-overview.md).

You add only one rule in a replication configuration in the following scenarios:

- You want to replicate all objects.

- You want to replicate only one subset of objects. You identify the object subset by
adding a filter in the rule. In the filter, you specify an object key prefix, tags, or a
combination of both to identify the subset of objects that the rule applies to. The
filters target objects that match the exact values that you specify.

If you want to replicate different subsets of objects, you add multiple rules in a
replication configuration. In each rule, you specify a filter that selects a different subset.
For example, you might choose to replicate objects that have either `tax/` or
`document/` key prefixes. To do this, you add two rules, one that specifies the
`tax/` key prefix filter and another that specifies the `document/`
key prefix. For more information about object key prefixes, see [Organizing objects using prefixes](using-prefixes.md).

The following sections provide additional information.

- [Additional destination configurations](#replication-config-optional-dest-config)

- [Example replication configurations](#replication-config-example-configs)

- [Backward compatibility considerations](#replication-backward-compat-considerations)

## Basic rule configuration

Each rule must include the rule's status and priority. The rule must also indicate
whether to replicate delete markers.

- The `<Status>` element indicates whether the rule is enabled or
disabled by using the values `Enabled` or `Disabled`. If a rule
is disabled, Amazon S3 doesn't perform the actions specified in the rule.

- The `<Priority>` element indicates which rule has precedence
whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 attempts to replicate objects
according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the
same destination bucket, then objects are replicated according to the rule with the
highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

- The `<DeleteMarkerReplication>` element indicates whether to
replicate delete markers by using the values `Enabled` or
`Disabled`.

In the `<Destination>` element configuration, you must provide the name
of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects.

The following example shows the minimum requirements for a V2 rule. For backward
compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the XML V1 format. For more information, see [Backward compatibility considerations](#replication-backward-compat-considerations).

```nohighlight

...
    <Rule>
        <ID>Rule-1</ID>
        <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
        <Filter>
            <Prefix></Prefix>
        </Filter>
        <Priority>integer</Priority>
        <DeleteMarkerReplication>
           <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
        </DeleteMarkerReplication>
        <Destination>
           <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
        </Destination>
    </Rule>
    <Rule>
         ...
    </Rule>
     ...
...
```

You can also specify other configuration options. For example, you might choose to use a
storage class for object replicas that differs from the class for the source object.

## Optional: Specifying a filter

To choose a subset of objects that the rule applies to, add an optional filter. You can
filter by object key prefix, object tags, or a combination of both. If you filter on both a
key prefix and object tags, Amazon S3 combines the filters by using a logical `AND`
operator. In other words, the rule applies to a subset of objects with both a specific key
prefix and specific tags.

###### Filter based on object key prefix

To specify a rule with a filter based on an object key prefix, use the following XML.
You can specify only one prefix per rule.

```nohighlight

<Rule>
    ...
    <Filter>
        <Prefix>key-prefix</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    ...
</Rule>
...
```

###### Filter based on object tags

To specify a rule with a filter based on object tags, use the following XML. You can
specify one or more object tags.

```nohighlight

<Rule>
    ...
    <Filter>
        <And>
            <Tag>
                <Key>key1</Key>
                <Value>value1</Value>
            </Tag>
            <Tag>
                <Key>key2</Key>
                <Value>value2</Value>
            </Tag>
             ...
        </And>
    </Filter>
    ...
</Rule>
...
```

###### Filter with a key prefix and object tags

To specify a rule filter with a combination of a key prefix and object tags, use the
following XML. You wrap these filters in an `<And>` parent element. Amazon S3
performs a logical `AND` operation to combine these filters. In other words,
the rule applies to a subset of objects with both a specific key prefix and specific tags.

```nohighlight

<Rule>
    ...
    <Filter>
        <And>
            <Prefix>key-prefix</Prefix>
            <Tag>
                <Key>key1</Key>
                <Value>value1</Value>
            </Tag>
            <Tag>
                <Key>key2</Key>
                <Value>value2</Value>
            </Tag>
             ...
    </Filter>
    ...
</Rule>
...
```

###### Note

- If you specify a rule with an empty `<Filter>` element, your rule applies to all objects in
your bucket.

- When you're using tag-based replication rules with live replication, new objects
must be tagged with the matching replication rule tag in the `PutObject`
operation. Otherwise, the objects won't be replicated. If objects are tagged after the
`PutObject` operation, those objects also won't be replicated.

To replicate objects that have been tagged after the `PutObject`
operation, you must use S3 Batch Replication. For more information about Batch
Replication, see [Replicating existing\
objects](s3-batch-replication-batch.md).

## Additional destination configurations

In the destination configuration, you specify the bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3
to replicate objects. You can set configurations to replicate objects from one source bucket
to one or more destination buckets.

```nohighlight

...
<Destination>
    <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
</Destination>
...
```

You can add the following options in the `<Destination>` element.

###### Topics

- [Specify storage class](#storage-class-configuration)

- [Add multiple destination buckets](#multiple-destination-buckets-configuration)

- [Specify different parameters for each replication rule with multiple destination buckets](#replication-rule-configuration)

- [Change replica ownership](#replica-ownership-configuration)

- [Enable S3 Replication Time Control](#rtc-configuration)

- [Replicate objects created with server-side encryption by using AWS KMS](#sse-kms-configuration)

### Specify storage class

You can specify the storage class for the object replicas. By default, Amazon S3 uses the
storage class of the source object to create object replicas, as in the following
example.

```nohighlight

...
<Destination>
       <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
       <StorageClass>storage-class</StorageClass>
</Destination>
...
```

### Add multiple destination buckets

You can add multiple destination buckets in a single replication configuration, as
follows.

```nohighlight

...
<Rule>
    <ID>Rule-1</ID>
    <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
    <Priority>integer</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
    <Destination>
       <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket1</Bucket>
    </Destination>
</Rule>
<Rule>
    <ID>Rule-2</ID>
    <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
    <Priority>integer</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
    <Destination>
       <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket2</Bucket>
    </Destination>
</Rule>
...
```

### Specify different parameters for each replication rule with multiple destination buckets

When adding multiple destination buckets in a single replication configuration, you
can specify different parameters for each replication rule, as follows.

```nohighlight

...
<Rule>
    <ID>Rule-1</ID>
    <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
    <Priority>integer</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>Disabled</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
      <Metrics>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <EventThreshold>
      <Minutes>15</Minutes>
    </EventThreshold>
  </Metrics>
    <Destination>
       <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket1</Bucket>
    </Destination>
</Rule>
<Rule>
    <ID>Rule-2</ID>
    <Status>Enabled-or-Disabled</Status>
    <Priority>integer</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>Enabled</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
      <Metrics>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <EventThreshold>
      <Minutes>15</Minutes>
    </EventThreshold>
  </Metrics>
  <ReplicationTime>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Time>
      <Minutes>15</Minutes>
    </Time>
  </ReplicationTime>
    <Destination>
       <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket2</Bucket>
    </Destination>
</Rule>
...
```

### Change replica ownership

When the source and destination buckets aren't owned by the same accounts, you can
change the ownership of the replica to the AWS account that owns the destination bucket.
To do so, add the `<AccessControlTranslation>` element. This element takes
the value `Destination`.

```nohighlight

...
<Destination>
   <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
   <Account>destination-bucket-owner-account-id</Account>
   <AccessControlTranslation>
       <Owner>Destination</Owner>
   </AccessControlTranslation>
</Destination>
...
```

If you don't add the `<AccessControlTranslation>` element to the
replication configuration, the replicas are owned by the same AWS account that owns the
source object. For more information, see [Changing the replica owner](replication-change-owner.md).

### Enable S3 Replication Time Control

You can enable S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) in your replication configuration. S3 RTC replicates
most objects in seconds and 99.99 percent of objects within 15 minutes (backed by a
service-level agreement).

###### Note

Only a value of `<Minutes>15</Minutes>` is accepted for the
`<EventThreshold>` and `<Time>` elements.

```nohighlight

...
<Destination>
  <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
  <Metrics>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <EventThreshold>
      <Minutes>15</Minutes>
    </EventThreshold>
  </Metrics>
  <ReplicationTime>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Time>
      <Minutes>15</Minutes>
    </Time>
  </ReplicationTime>
</Destination>
...
```

For more information, see [Meeting compliance requirements with S3 Replication Time Control](replication-time-control.md). For API examples, see [PutBucketReplication](../api/api-putbucketreplication.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

### Replicate objects created with server-side encryption by using AWS KMS

Your source bucket might contain objects that were created with server-side encryption
by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate these
objects. You can optionally direct Amazon S3 to replicate these objects. To do so, first
explicitly opt into this feature by adding the `<SourceSelectionCriteria>`
element. Then provide the AWS KMS key (for the AWS Region of the destination bucket)
to use for encrypting object replicas. The following example shows how to specify these
elements.

```nohighlight

...
<SourceSelectionCriteria>
  <SseKmsEncryptedObjects>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
  </SseKmsEncryptedObjects>
</SourceSelectionCriteria>
<Destination>
  <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
  <EncryptionConfiguration>
    <ReplicaKmsKeyID>AWS KMS key ID to use for encrypting object replicas</ReplicaKmsKeyID>
  </EncryptionConfiguration>
</Destination>
...
```

For more information, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md).

## Example replication configurations

To get started, you can add the following example replication configurations to your
bucket, as appropriate.

###### Important

To add a replication configuration to a bucket, you must have the
`iam:PassRole` permission. This permission allows you to pass the IAM role
that grants Amazon S3 replication permissions. You specify the IAM role by providing the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is used in the `<Role>` element in the
replication configuration XML. For more information, see [Granting a User Permissions to Pass a\
Role to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

###### Example 1: Replication configuration with one rule

The following basic replication configuration specifies one rule. The rule specifies
an IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume and a single destination bucket for object replicas.
The `<Status>` element value of `Enabled` indicates that the rule
is in effect.

```nohighlight

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ReplicationConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>
  <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>

    <Destination>
      <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
    </Destination>
  </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

To choose a subset of objects to replicate, you can add a filter. In the following
configuration, the filter specifies an object key prefix. This rule applies to objects
that have the prefix `Tax/` in their key names.

```nohighlight

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ReplicationConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>
  <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Priority>1</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>string</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>

    <Filter>
       <Prefix>Tax/</Prefix>
    </Filter>

    <Destination>
       <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
    </Destination>

  </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

If you specify the `<Filter>` element, you must also include the
`<Priority>` and `<DeleteMarkerReplication>` elements. In
this example, the value that you set for the `<Priority>` element is
irrelevant because there is only one rule.

In the following configuration, the filter specifies one prefix and two tags. The rule
applies to the subset of objects that have the specified key prefix and tags.
Specifically, it applies to objects that have the
`Tax/` prefix in their key names and the two
specified object tags. In this example, the value that you set for the
`<Priority>` element is irrelevant because there is only one rule.

```nohighlight

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ReplicationConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>
  <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Priority>1</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>string</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>

    <Filter>
        <And>
          <Prefix>Tax/</Prefix>
          <Tag>
             <Tag>
                <Key>tagA</Key>
                <Value>valueA</Value>
             </Tag>
          </Tag>
          <Tag>
             <Tag>
                <Key>tagB</Key>
                <Value>valueB</Value>
             </Tag>
          </Tag>
       </And>

    </Filter>

    <Destination>
        <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
    </Destination>

  </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

You can specify a storage class for the object replicas as follows:

```nohighlight

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<ReplicationConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>
  <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Destination>
       <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
       <StorageClass>storage-class</StorageClass>
    </Destination>
  </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

You can specify any storage class that Amazon S3 supports.

###### Example 2: Replication configuration with two rules

###### Example

In the following replication configuration, the rules specify the following:

- Each rule filters on a different key prefix so that each rule applies to a
distinct subset of objects. In this example, Amazon S3 replicates objects with the key
names `Tax/doc1.pdf` and
`Project/project1.txt`, but it doesn't
replicate objects with the key name
`PersonalDoc/documentA`.

- Although both rules specify a value for the `<Priority>`
element, the rule priority is irrelevant because the rules apply to two distinct
sets of objects. The next example shows what happens when rule priority is applied.

- The second rule specifies the S3 Standard-IA storage class for object replicas.
Amazon S3 uses the specified storage class for those object replicas.

```nohighlight

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<ReplicationConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>
  <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Priority>1</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>string</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
    <Filter>
        <Prefix>Tax</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Destination>
      <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
    </Destination>
     ...
  </Rule>
 <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Priority>2</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>string</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
    <Filter>
        <Prefix>Project</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Destination>
      <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
     <StorageClass>STANDARD_IA</StorageClass>
    </Destination>
     ...
  </Rule>

</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

###### Example 3: Replication configuration with two rules with overlapping prefixes

In this configuration, the two rules specify filters with overlapping key prefixes,
`star` and
`starship`. Both rules apply to objects with the
key name `starship-x`. In this case, Amazon S3 uses the
rule priority to determine which rule to apply. The higher the number, the higher the
priority.

```nohighlight

<ReplicationConfiguration>

  <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>

  <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Priority>1</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>string</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
    <Filter>
        <Prefix>star</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Destination>
      <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
    </Destination>
  </Rule>
  <Rule>
    <Status>Enabled</Status>
    <Priority>2</Priority>
    <DeleteMarkerReplication>
       <Status>string</Status>
    </DeleteMarkerReplication>
    <Filter>
        <Prefix>starship</Prefix>
    </Filter>
    <Destination>
      <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
    </Destination>
  </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

###### Example 4: Example walkthroughs

For example walkthroughs, see [Examples for configuring live replication](replication-example-walkthroughs.md).

For more information about the XML structure of replication configuration, see [PutBucketReplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTreplication.html) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Backward compatibility considerations

The latest version of the replication configuration XML format is V2. XML V2 replication
configurations are those that contain the `<Filter>` element for rules, and
rules that specify S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).

To see your replication configuration version, you can use the
`GetBucketReplication` API operation. For more information, see [GetBucketReplication](../api/api-getbucketreplication.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the XML V1 replication
configuration format. If you've used the XML V1 replication configuration format, consider
the following issues that affect backward compatibility:

- The replication configuration XML V2 format includes the `<Filter>`
element for rules. With the `<Filter>` element, you can specify object
filters based on the object key prefix, tags, or both to scope the objects that the rule
applies to. The replication configuration XML V1 format supports filtering based only on
the key prefix. In that case, you add the `<Prefix>` element directly as a
child element of the `<Rule>` element, as in the following example:

```nohighlight

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ReplicationConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <Role>arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name</Role>
    <Rule>
      <Status>Enabled</Status>
      <Prefix>key-prefix</Prefix>
      <Destination>
         <Bucket>arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket</Bucket>
      </Destination>

    </Rule>
</ReplicationConfiguration>
```

- When you delete an object from your source bucket without specifying an object
version ID, Amazon S3 adds a delete marker. If you use the replication configuration XML V1
format, Amazon S3 replicates only delete markers that result from user actions. In other
words, Amazon S3 replicates the delete marker only if a user deletes an object. If an expired
object is removed by Amazon S3 (as part of a lifecycle action), Amazon S3 doesn't replicate the
delete marker.

In the replication configuration XML V2 format, you can enable delete marker replication for
non-tag-based rules. For more information, see [Replicating delete markers between buckets](delete-marker-replication.md).
