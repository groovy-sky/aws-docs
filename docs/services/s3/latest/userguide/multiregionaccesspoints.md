# Managing multi-Region traffic with Multi-Region Access Points

Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points provides a global endpoint that applications can use to fulfill requests from
S3 buckets that are located in multiple AWS Regions. You can use Multi-Region Access Points to build
multi-Region applications with the same architecture that's used in a single Region, and
then run those applications anywhere in the world. Instead of sending requests over the
congested public internet, Multi-Region Access Points provides built-in network resilience with acceleration of
internet-based requests to Amazon S3. Application requests made to a Multi-Region Access Point global endpoint uses
[AWS Global Accelerator](../../../global-accelerator/latest/dg.md) to automatically route over the AWS global
network to the closest proximity S3 bucket with an active routing status.

If a Regional traffic disruption occurs, you can use Multi-Region Access Points failover controls to shift
the S3 data request traffic between AWS Regions and redirect S3 traffic away from the
disruptions within minutes. You can also test the application resiliency against a disruption to conduct application
failover and perform disaster recovery simulations. If you need to connect and accelerate requests to S3 from outside of a VPC, you can
simplify applications and network architecture with Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points. Your Multi-Region Access Points requests will
be routed over the AWS global network and then back to S3 within the AWS Region, without
having to traverse the public internet. As a result, you can build more highly available applications.

During your Multi-Region Access Points creation and setup, you'll specify a set of AWS Regions where you want to store data
to be served through that Multi-Region Access Point. You can use the provided Multi-Region Access Points endpoint name to connect your
clients. After you've established your client connections, you can select the existing or
new buckets that you'd like to route the Multi-Region Access Points requests between. Then, use [S3 Cross-Region Replication\
(CRR)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/replication) rules to synchronize data among buckets in those Regions.

After you've set up your Multi-Region Access Point. you can then request
or write data through the Multi-Region Access Points global endpoint. Amazon S3 automatically serves requests to the
replicated data set from the closest available Region. Within the AWS Management Console, you're also
able to view the underlying replication topology and replication metrics related to your
Multi-Region Access Points requests. This gives you an even easier way to build, manage, and monitor storage
for multi-Region applications. Alternatively, you
can use Amazon CloudFront to automate the creation and configuration of S3 Multi-Region Access Points.

The following image is a graphical representation of an Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Point in an active-active
configuration. The graphic shows how Amazon S3 requests are automatically routed to buckets in
the closest active AWS Region.

configuration. The graphic shows how you can control Amazon S3 data-access traffic to fail over
between active and passive AWS Regions.
