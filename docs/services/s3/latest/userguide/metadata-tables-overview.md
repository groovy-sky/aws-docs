# Discovering your data with S3 Metadata tables

Amazon S3 Metadata accelerates data discovery by automatically capturing metadata for objects in your
general purpose buckets and storing it in read-only, fully managed Apache Iceberg tables
that you can query. These read-only tables are called _metadata tables_.
As objects are added to, updated, or removed from your general purpose buckets, S3 Metadata automatically
refreshes the corresponding metadata tables to reflect the latest changes.

By default, S3 Metadata provides three types of metadata:

- [System-defined metadata](usingmetadata.md#SysMetadata), such as an object's creation
time and storage class

- Custom metadata, such as tags and [user-defined\
metadata](usingmetadata.md#UserMetadata) that was included during object upload

- Event metadata, such as when an object is updated or deleted, and the AWS account that
made the request

With S3 Metadata, you can easily find, store, and query metadata for your S3 objects, so that you can
quickly prepare data for use in business analytics, content retrieval, artificial intelligence and machine
learning (AI/ML) model training, and more.

For each general purpose bucket, you can create a metadata table configuration that contains two
complementary metadata tables:

- **Journal table** – By default, your metadata table
configuration contains a _journal table_, which captures events that
occur for the objects in your bucket. The journal table records changes made to your data in near real
time, helping you to identify new data uploaded to your bucket, track recently deleted objects,
monitor lifecycle transitions, and more. The journal table records new objects and updates to your
objects and their metadata (those updates that require either a `PUT` or a
`DELETE` operation).

The journal table captures metadata only for change events (such as uploads, updates, and deletes)
that happen after you create your metadata table configuration. Because this table is queryable, you
can audit the changes to your bucket through simple SQL queries.

The journal table is required for each metadata table configuration. (In the initial release of S3
Metadata, the journal table was referred to as "the metadata table.")

For more information about what data is stored in journal tables, see [S3 Metadata journal tables schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metadata-tables-schema.html).

To help minimize your storage costs, you can choose to enable journal table record expiration. For
more information, see [Expiring journal table records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metadata-tables-expire-journal-table-records.html).

- **Live inventory table** – Optionally, you can add a _live inventory table_ to your metadata table configuration. The live
inventory table provides a simple, queryable inventory of all the objects and their versions in your
bucket so that you can determine the latest state of your data.

You can use the live inventory table to simplify and speed up business workflows and big data jobs
by identifying objects that you want to process for various workloads. For example, you can query the
live inventory table to find all objects stored in a particular storage class, all objects with
certain tags, all objects that aren't encrypted with server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
keys (SSE-KMS), and more.

When you enable the live inventory table for your metadata table configuration, the table goes
through a process known as _backfilling_, during which Amazon S3 scans
your general purpose bucket to retrieve the initial metadata for all objects that exist in the bucket.
Depending on the number of objects in your bucket, this process can take minutes (minimum 15 minutes) to hours. When the
backfilling process is finished, the status of your live inventory table changes from
**Backfilling** to **Active**. After backfilling is completed,
updates to your objects are typically reflected in the live inventory table within one hour.

You're charged for backfilling your inventory table. If your general purpose bucket has more than
one billion objects, you're also charged a monthly fee for your live inventory table. For more
information, see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

For more information about what data is stored in live inventory tables, see [S3 Metadata live inventory tables schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metadata-tables-inventory-schema.html).

Your metadata tables are stored in an AWS managed S3 table bucket, which provides storage that's
optimized for tabular data. To query your metadata, you can integrate your table bucket with Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse.
This integration, which uses the AWS Glue Data Catalog and AWS Lake Formation, allows AWS analytics services to
automatically discover and access your table data.

After your table bucket is integrated with the AWS Glue Data Catalog, you can directly query your metadata
tables with AWS analytics services such as Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift. You can also create
interactive dashboards with your query data by using Amazon Quick. For more information about integrating your
AWS managed S3 table bucket with Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse, see [Integrating Amazon S3 Tables with AWS analytics services](s3-tables-integrating-aws.md).

You can also query your metadata tables with Apache Spark, Apache Trino,
and any other application that supports the Apache Iceberg format by using the AWS Glue
Iceberg REST endpoint, the Amazon S3 Tables Iceberg REST endpoint, or the Amazon S3
Tables Catalog for Apache Iceberg client catalog. For more information about accessing your
metadata tables, see [Accessing table data](s3-tables-access.md).

For S3 Metadata pricing, see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

## How metadata tables work

Metadata tables are managed by Amazon S3, and can't be modified by any IAM principal outside of Amazon S3
itself. You can, however, delete your metadata tables. As a result, metadata tables are read-only, which
helps ensure that they correctly reflect the contents of your general purpose bucket.

To generate and store object metadata in AWS managed metadata tables, you create a metadata table
configuration for your general purpose bucket. Amazon S3 is designed to continuously update the metadata
tables to reflect the latest changes to your data as long as the configuration is active on the general
purpose bucket.

Before you create a metadata table configuration, make sure that you have the necessary AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) permissions to create and manage metadata tables. For more information, see [Setting up permissions for configuring metadata tables](metadata-tables-permissions.md).

###### Metadata table storage, organization, and encryption

When you create your metadata table configuration, your metadata tables are stored in an AWS
managed table bucket. All metadata table configurations in your account and in the same Region are
stored in a single AWS managed table bucket. These AWS managed table buckets are named
`aws-s3` and have the following Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format:

`arn:aws:s3tables:region:account_id:bucket/aws-s3`

For example, if your account ID is 123456789012 and your general purpose bucket is in
US East (N. Virginia) ( `us-east-1`), your AWS managed table bucket is also created
in US East (N. Virginia) ( `us-east-1`) and has the following ARN:

`arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:123456789012:bucket/aws-s3`

By default, AWS managed table buckets are encrypted with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed
keys (SSE-S3). After you create your first metadata configuration, you can set the default encryption
setting for the AWS managed table bucket to use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys
(SSE-KMS). For more information, see [Encryption for AWS managed table buckets](s3-tables-aws-managed-buckets.md#aws-managed-buckets-encryption) and [Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) in table buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-kms-specify.html).

Within your AWS managed table bucket, the metadata tables for your configuration are typically
stored in a namespace with the following naming format:

`b_general-purpose-bucket-name`

###### Note

- If your general purpose bucket name contains any periods, the periods are converted to underscores
( `_`) in the namespace name.

- If your general purpose bucket was created before March 1, 2018, its name might contain
uppercase letters and underscores, and it might also be up to 255 characters long. If your bucket
name has these characteristics, your metadata table namespace will have a different format. The
general purpose bucket name will be prefixed with `b_`, truncated to 63 characters,
converted to all lowercase, and suffixed with a hash.

Metadata tables have the following Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format, which includes the table ID of
the metadata table:

`arn:aws:s3tables:region-code:account-id:bucket/aws-s3/table/table-id`

For example, a metadata table in the US East (N. Virginia) Region would have an ARN like the
following:

`arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/aws-s3/table/a12bc345-67d8-912e-3456-7f89123g4h56`

Journal tables have the name `journal`, and live inventory tables have the name
`inventory`.

When you create your metadata table configuration, you can choose to encrypt your AWS managed
metadata tables with server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS). If you choose to use
SSE-KMS, you must provide a customer managed KMS key in the same Region as your general purpose
bucket. You can set the encryption type for your tables only during table creation. After an AWS
managed table is created, you can't change its encryption setting. To specify SSE-KMS for your metadata
tables, you must have certain permissions. For more information, see [Permissions for SSE-KMS](metadata-tables-permissions.md#metadata-kms-permissions).

The encryption setting for a metadata table takes precedence over the default bucket-level
encryption setting. If you don't specify encryption for a table, it will inherit the default encryption
setting from the bucket.

AWS managed table buckets don't count toward your S3 Tables quotas. For more information about
working with AWS managed table buckets and AWS managed tables, see [Working with AWS managed table\
buckets](s3-tables-aws-managed-buckets.md).

To monitor updates to your metadata table configuration, you can use AWS CloudTrail. For more information,
see [Amazon S3 bucket-level actions that are tracked by CloudTrail logging](cloudtrail-logging-s3-info.md#cloudtrail-bucket-level-tracking).

###### Metadata table maintenance and record expiration

To keep your metadata tables performing at their best, Amazon S3 performs periodic maintenance activities
on your tables, such as compaction and unreferenced file removal. These maintenance activities help to
both minimize the cost of storing your metadata tables and optimize query performance. This table
maintenance happens automatically, requiring no opt-in or ongoing management by you.

###### Note

- You can't control the expiration of journal table or inventory table snapshots. For each
table, Amazon S3 stores a minimum of 1 snapshot for a maximum of 24 hours.

- To help minimize your costs, you can configure journal table record expiration. By default,
journal table records don't expire, and journal table records must be retained for a minimum of 7
days. For more information, see [Expiring journal table records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metadata-tables-expire-journal-table-records.html).
