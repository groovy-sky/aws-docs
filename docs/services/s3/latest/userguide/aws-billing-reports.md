# AWS Billing reports for Amazon S3

Your monthly bill from AWS separates your usage information and cost by AWS service and
function. There are several AWS Billing reports available: the monthly report, the
cost allocation report, and detailed billing reports. For information about how to see
your billing reports, see [Viewing\
Your Bill](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/getting-viewing-bill.md) in the _AWS Billing User Guide_.

To track your AWS usage and provide estimated charges associated with your account, you
can set up AWS Cost and Usage Reports. For more information, see [What are AWSCost and Usage Reports?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html) in the _AWS Data_
_Exports Guide_.

You can also download a usage report that gives more detail about your Amazon S3 storage
usage than the billing reports. For more information, see [AWS usage reports for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/aws-usage-report.html).

The following table lists the charges associated with Amazon S3 usage.

ChargeComments

Storage

You pay for storing objects in your S3 buckets. The rate you're charged depends on your
objects' size, how long you stored the objects during the month, and
the storage class. Amazon S3 offers the following storage classes:
S3 Standard, S3 Express One Zone, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA (IA
for infrequent access), S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval,
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, S3 Glacier Deep Archive, or
Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS). For more information about storage
classes, see [Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes](storage-class-intro.md).

Be aware that if you have S3 Versioning enabled, you're charged for each version of an
object that is retained. For more information about versioning, see
[How S3 Versioning works](versioning-workflows.md).

General purpose buckets You're not billed for the first 2000 general purpose buckets that you
create in your account. However, there is a per-bucket rate for each
bucket that you create beyond the first 2000. This rate is billed per
bucket/month. For information about general purpose bucket pricing, see
[Amazon S3\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).Monitoring and automationYou pay a monthly monitoring and automation fee per object stored in
the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to monitor access patterns and
move objects between access tiers in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

Requests

You pay for requests, for example, `GET` requests, made against your S3
buckets and objects. This includes lifecycle requests. The rates for
requests depend on what kind of request you're making. For
information about request pricing, see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

Retrievals

You pay for retrieving objects that are stored in S3 Standard-IA,
S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and
S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage.

Early deletes

If you delete an object stored in S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA,
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage before the minimum storage
commitment has passed, you pay an early deletion fee for that
object.

Storage management

You pay for the storage management features (Amazon S3 Inventory, analytics, and object
tagging) that are enabled on your account's buckets.

Bandwidth

You pay for all bandwidth into and out of Amazon S3, except for the
following:

- Data transferred in from the internet

- Data transferred out to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance,
when the instance is in the same AWS Region as the S3
bucket

- Data transferred out to Amazon CloudFront (CloudFront)

You also pay a fee for any data transferred by using Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration.
