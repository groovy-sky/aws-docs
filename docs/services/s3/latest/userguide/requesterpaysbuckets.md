# Using Requester Pays general purpose buckets for storage transfers and usage

In general, bucket owners pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs that are
associated with their bucket. However, you can configure a general purpose bucket to be a _Requester Pays_ bucket. With Requester Pays buckets, the
requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data download
from the bucket. The bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.

Typically, you configure buckets to be Requester Pays buckets when you want to share data
but not incur charges associated with others accessing the data. For example, you might use
Requester Pays buckets when making available large datasets, such as zip code directories,
reference data, geospatial information, or web crawling data.

###### Important

If you enable Requester Pays on a general purpose bucket, anonymous access to that bucket is not
allowed.

You must authenticate all requests involving Requester Pays buckets. The request
authentication enables Amazon S3 to identify and charge the requester for their use of the
Requester Pays bucket.

When the requester assumes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role before making their request, the
account to which the role belongs is charged for the request. For more information about
IAM roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

After you configure a bucket to be a Requester Pays bucket, requesters must show they understand that they will be charged for the request and for the data download. To show they accept the charges, requesters must either include `x-amz-request-payer` as a header in their API request for DELETE, GET, HEAD, POST, and PUT requests, or add the `RequestPayer` parameter in their REST request. For CLI requests, requesters can use the `--request-payer` parameter.

###### Example– Using Requester Pays when deleting an object

To use the following [DeleteObjectVersion](../api/api-deleteobject.md) API example, replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

DELETE /Key+?versionId=VersionId HTTP/1.1
Host: Bucket.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-mfa: MFA
x-amz-request-payer: RequestPayer
x-amz-bypass-governance-retention: BypassGovernanceRetention
x-amz-expected-bucket-owner: ExpectedBucketOwner

```

If the requester restores objects by using the [RestoreObject](../api/api-restoreobject.md) API, Requester Pays is supported as long as the `x-amz-request-payer` header or the `RequestPayer` parameter are in the request; however, the requester only pays for the cost of the request. The bucket owner pays the retrieval charges.

Requester Pays buckets do not support the following:

- Anonymous requests

- SOAP requests

- Using a Requester Pays bucket as the target bucket for end-user logging, or vice
versa. However, you can turn on end-user logging on a Requester Pays bucket where
the target bucket is not a Requester Pays bucket.

## How Requester Pays charges work

The charge for successful Requester Pays requests is straightforward: The requester
pays for the data transfer and the request, and the bucket owner pays for the data
storage. However, the bucket owner is charged for the request under the following
conditions:

- The request returns an `AccessDenied` (HTTP `403 Forbidden`) error and
the request is initiated inside the bucket owner's individual AWS account or AWS organization.

- The request is a SOAP request.
