# Security considerations and limitations for S3 Tables

The following list describes which security and access control features and functionality
are unsupported or limited for S3 Tables.

- Public access policies are not supported. Users can't modify bucket or table
policies to allow public access.

- Presigned URLs to access objects associated with a table are not supported.

- Requests made over HTTP are not supported. Amazon S3 automatically responds with an
HTTP redirect for any requests made via HTTP to upgrade the requests to
HTTPS.

- You must use AWS Signature Version 4 when making requests to an access point by
using the REST APIs.

- Requests made over the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) are supported only for
object-level actions over table storage endpoints, and not for the table- and
bucket-level actions.

- Table bucket and table access policies are limited to 20 KB in size.
