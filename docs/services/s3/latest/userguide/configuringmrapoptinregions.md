# Configuring Multi-Region Access Point opt-in Regions

An AWS opt-in Region is a Region that isn’t enabled by default in your AWS
account. In contrast, Regions that are enabled by default are known as AWS Regions or
commercial Regions.

To start using Multi-Region Access Points in AWS opt-in Regions, you must manually enable the opt-in Region
for your AWS account before creating your Multi-Region Access Point. After you enable the opt-in Region, you
can create Multi-Region Access Points with buckets in the selected opt-in Region. For instructions on how to
enable or disable an opt-in Region for your AWS account or AWS Organization, see [Enable or disable a Region for standalone accounts](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.md#manage-acct-regions-enable-standalone) or [Enable or disable a Region in your organization](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.md#manage-acct-regions-enable-organization).

###### Note

Multi-Region Access Point opt-in Regions are currently only supported through AWS SDKs and AWS CLI.

S3 Multi-Region Access Points supports the following AWS opt-in Regions:

- `Africa (Cape Town)`

- `Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)`

- `Asia Pacific (Jakarta)`

- `Asia Pacific (Melbourne)`

- `Asia Pacific (Hyderabad)`

- `Canada West (Calgary)`

- `Europe (Zurich)`

- `Europe (Milan)`

- `Europe (Spain)`

- `Israel (Tel Aviv)`

- `Middle East (Bahrain)`

- `Middle East (UAE)`

###### Note

There are no additional costs for enabling an opt-in Region. However, creating or
using a resource in a Multi-Region Access Point results in billing charges.

## Using a Multi-Region Access Point in an AWS opt-in Region

To perform a [data plane operation](mrapoperations.md) on
your Multi-Region Access Point, all associated AWS accounts must enable the opt-in Regions that are part
of the Multi-Region Access Point. This requirement applies to the requester account, the Multi-Region Access Point owner, S3
bucket owners, and the VPC endpoint owner. If any of these accounts don’t enable AWS
opt-in Regions, the Multi-Region Access Point requests fail. For more information about the
`InvalidToken` or `AllAccessDisabled` errors, see [List of error codes](../api/errorresponses.md#ErrorCodeList).

###### Note

[Control plane operations](mrapoperations.md) such as updating your Multi-Region Access Point policy or
updating your failover configuration aren’t impacted by the opt-in Region status of
any Region that is part of your Multi-Region Access Point. You also don’t need to disable any active
opt-in Regions before deleting a Multi-Region Access Point.

## Disabling an active AWS opt-in Region

If you disable opt-in Region that is part of your Multi-Region Access Point, requests routed to this
Region result in a `403 AllAccessDisabled` error. To safely disable an opt-in
Region, we recommend that you first identify an alternate Region in your Multi-Region Access Point
configuration to route the traffic to. You can then use Multi-Region Access Point failover controls to mark
the alternate Region as active, and mark the Region to be disabled as passive. After
changing the failover controls, you can disable the Region you want to opt out
of.

## Enabling a previously disabled AWS opt-in Region

To enable an opt-in AWS Region that was previously disabled for your Multi-Region Access Point, make
sure to update your AWS account settings. After you re-enable the opt-in Region, run
the [PutMultiRegionAccessPointPolicy](../api/api-control-putmultiregionaccesspointpolicy.md) API operation to apply
the Multi-Region Access Points policy to the opt-in Region.

If your Multi-Region Access Point is accessed through a VPC endpoint, we recommend that you update your
VPCE policy and use the [ModifyVpcEndpoint](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-modifyvpcendpoint.md) API operation to apply the updated VPC endpoint policy to
the re-enabled opt-in Region.

## Multi-Region Access Points policy and multiple AWS accounts

If your Multi-Region Access Points policy grants access to multiple AWS accounts, all requester
accounts must also enable the same opt-in Regions in their account settings. If the requester account submits a Multi-Region Access Point request without enabling the opt-in Regions that are
part of the Multi-Region Access Point, it’ll result in a `400 InvalidToken` error.

## AWS opt-in Region considerations

When you access a Multi-Region Access Point from an opt-in Region, be aware of the following:

- When you enable an opt-in Region, it allows you to create a Multi-Region Access Point using the
buckets from the opt-in Region. When you disable an opt-in Region, the Multi-Region Access Point is
no longer supported in the opt-in Region. If you no longer want an opt-in Region
enabled for your Multi-Region Access Point, make sure to [disable the Region for your account](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.md#manage-acct-regions-enable-standalone) first. Then, create a new
Multi-Region Access Point with your preferred list of opt-in Regions.

- If you attempt to create your Multi-Region Access Point with a disabled opt-in Region, you’ll
receive a `403 InvalidRegion` error. After you enable the opt-in
Region, try creating the Multi-Region Access Point again.

- The maximum number of supported Regions for a Multi-Region Access Point is 17 Regions. This
includes both opt-in Regions and commercial Regions. For more information, see
[Multi-Region Access Points restrictions and limitations](multiregionaccesspointrestrictions.md).

- Control plane requests for Multi-Region Access Points will work, even if you haven't opted in to
any Regions.

- When you're trying to create a Multi-Region Access Point for the first time,
you must opt into all Regions that are part of the Multi-Region Access Point.

- Any AWS accounts that are granted access to an S3 Multi-Region Access Point through the Multi-Region Access Point
policy must also enable the same opt-in Regions that are part of the
Multi-Region Access Point.
