# Adding objects to versioning-suspended buckets

You can add objects to versioning-suspended buckets in Amazon S3 to create the object with
a null version ID or overwrite any object version with a matching version ID.

After you suspend versioning on a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically adds a `null`
version ID to every subsequent object stored thereafter (using `PUT`,
`POST`, or `CopyObject`) in that bucket.

The following figure shows how Amazon S3 adds the version ID of `null` to an
object when it is added to a version-suspended bucket.

If a null version is already in the bucket and you add another object with the same
key, the added object overwrites the original null version.

If there are versioned objects in the bucket, the version you `PUT` becomes
the current version of the object. The following figure shows how adding an object to a
bucket that contains versioned objects does not overwrite the object already in the
bucket.

In this case, version 111111 was already in the bucket. Amazon S3 attaches a version ID of
null to the object being added and stores it in the bucket. Version 111111 is not
overwritten.

If a null version already exists in a bucket, the null version is overwritten, as
shown in the following figure.

Although the key and version ID ( `null`) of the null version are the same
before and after the `PUT`, the contents of the null version originally
stored in the bucket are replaced by the contents of the object `PUT` into
the bucket.
