# Emptying a directory bucket

You can empty an Amazon S3 directory bucket by using the Amazon S3 console. For more information
about directory buckets, see [Working with directory buckets](directory-buckets-overview.md).

Before you empty a directory bucket, note the following:

- When you empty a directory bucket, you delete all the objects, but you keep the
directory bucket.

- After you empty a directory bucket, the empty action can't be undone.

- Objects that are added to the directory bucket while the empty bucket action is
in progress might be deleted.

If you also want to delete the bucket, note the following:

- All objects in the directory bucket must be deleted before the bucket itself can
be deleted.

- In-progress multipart uploads in the directory bucket must be aborted before the
bucket itself can be deleted.

###### Note

The `s3 rm` command through the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), the `delete` operation
through Mountpoint, and the **Empty** bucket option button
through the AWS Management Console are unable to delete in-progress multipart uploads in a
directory bucket. To delete these in-progress multipart uploads, use the
`ListMultipartUploads` operation to list the in-progress
multipart uploads in the bucket and use the `AbortMultipartUpload`
operation to abort all the in-progress multipart uploads.

To delete a directory bucket, see [Deleting a directory bucket](directory-bucket-delete.md). To abort an in-progress multipart upload, see
[Aborting a multipart upload](abort-mpu.md).

To empty a general purpose bucket, see [Emptying a general purpose bucket](empty-bucket.md).

###### To empty a directory bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Directory buckets**.

3. Choose the option button next to the name of the bucket that you want to empty, and
    then choose **Empty**.

4. On the **Empty bucket** page, confirm that you want to empty the
    bucket by entering `permanently delete` in the text field, and then
    choose **Empty**.

5. Monitor the progress of the bucket emptying process on the **Empty bucket:**
**status** page.
