# Examples for configuring live replication

The following examples provide step-by-step walkthroughs that show how to configure live
replication for common use cases.

###### Note

Live replication refers to Same-Region Replication (SRR) and Cross-Region Replication
(CRR). Live replication doesn't replicate any objects that existed in the bucket before
you set up replication. To replicate objects that existed before you set up replication,
use on-demand replication. To sync buckets and replicate existing objects on demand, see
[Replicating existing\
objects](s3-batch-replication-batch.md).

These examples demonstrate how to create a replication configuration by using the Amazon S3
console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs (AWS SDK for Java and AWS SDK for .NET examples are shown).

For information about installing and configuring the AWS CLI, see the following topics in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_:

- [Get started with the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)

- [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) – You must set up at least one profile. If
you are exploring cross-account scenarios, set up two profiles.

For information about the AWS SDKs, see [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java) and [AWS SDK for .NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net).
