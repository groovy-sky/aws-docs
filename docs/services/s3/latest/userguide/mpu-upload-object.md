# Uploading an object using multipart upload

You can use the multipart upload to programmatically upload a single object to Amazon S3.
Each object is uploaded as a set of parts. Each part is a
contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and
in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without
affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles
these parts and creates the object. Anonymous users cannot initiate multipart uploads.

For an end-to-end procedure on uploading an object with multipart upload with an additional checksum, see
[Tutorial: Upload an object through multipart upload and verify its data integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/tutorial-s3-mpu-additional-checksums.html).

The following section show how to use multipart upload with the AWS Command Line Interface, and
AWS SDKs.

You can upload any file type—images, backups, data, movies, and so on—into an
S3 bucket. The maximum size of a file that you can upload by using the Amazon S3 console is 160 GB.
To upload a file larger than 160 GB, use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST
API.

For instructions on uploading an object via the AWS Management Console, see [Uploading objects](upload-objects.md).

The following describe the Amazon S3 operations for multipart upload using the AWS CLI.

The following sections in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_ describe the REST API for
multipart upload.

- [Initiate Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadInitiate.html)

- [Upload Part](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadUploadPart.html)

- [Stop Multipart Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadAbort.html)

- [List Parts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadListParts.html)

- [List Multipart Uploads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadListMPUpload.html)

Some AWS SDKs expose a high-level API that simplifies multipart upload by combining the different API operations required to complete a multipart upload into a single operation. For more information, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md).

If you need to pause and resume multipart uploads, vary part sizes during the
upload, or do not know the size of the data in advance, use the low-level API methods.
The low-level API methods for multipart uploads offer additional functionality, for more information, see [Using the AWS SDKs (low-level API)](#mpu-upload-low-level).

Java

For examples of how to perform a multipart upload with the AWS SDK for Java, see [Upload or download large files to and from Amazon S3 using an AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_Scenario_UsingLargeFiles_section.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

.NET

To upload a file to an S3 bucket, use the `TransferUtility`
class. When uploading data from a file, you must provide the object's
key name. If you don't, the API uses the file name for the key name.
When uploading data from a stream, you must provide the object's key
name.

To set advanced upload options—such as the part size, the
number of threads when uploading the parts concurrently, metadata, the
storage class, or ACL—use the
`TransferUtilityUploadRequest` class.

###### Note

When you're using a stream for the source of data, the `TransferUtility` class does not do concurrent uploads.

The following C# example uploads a file to an Amazon S3 bucket in multiple
parts. It shows how to use various `TransferUtility.Upload`
overloads to upload a file. Each successive call to upload replaces the
previous upload. For
information about setting up and running the code examples, see [Getting Started\
with the AWS SDK for .NET](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/net-dg-setup.html) in the _AWS SDK for .NET Developer_
_Guide_.

Go

For more information about the Go code example for multipart upload, see [Upload or download large files to and \
from Amazon S3 using an AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_Scenario_UsingLargeFiles_section.html).

###### Example

Upload a large object by using an upload manager to break
the data into parts and upload them concurrently.

```go

import (
	"bytes"
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/feature/s3/manager"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3/types"
	"github.com/aws/smithy-go"
)

// BucketBasics encapsulates the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) actions
// used in the examples.
// It contains S3Client, an Amazon S3 service client that is used to perform bucket
// and object actions.
type BucketBasics struct {
	S3Client *s3.Client
}

```

```go

// UploadLargeObject uses an upload manager to upload data to an object in a bucket.
// The upload manager breaks large data into parts and uploads the parts concurrently.
func (basics BucketBasics) UploadLargeObject(ctx context.Context, bucketName string, objectKey string, largeObject []byte) error {
	largeBuffer := bytes.NewReader(largeObject)
	var partMiBs int64 = 10
	uploader := manager.NewUploader(basics.S3Client, func(u *manager.Uploader) {
		u.PartSize = partMiBs * 1024 * 1024
	})
	_, err := uploader.Upload(ctx, &s3.PutObjectInput{
		Bucket: aws.String(bucketName),
		Key:    aws.String(objectKey),
		Body:   largeBuffer,
	})
	if err != nil {
		var apiErr smithy.APIError
		if errors.As(err, &apiErr) && apiErr.ErrorCode() == "EntityTooLarge" {
			log.Printf("Error while uploading object to %s. The object is too large.\n"+
				"The maximum size for a multipart upload is 5TB.", bucketName)
		} else {
			log.Printf("Couldn't upload large object to %v:%v. Here's why: %v\n",
				bucketName, objectKey, err)
		}
	} else {
		err = s3.NewObjectExistsWaiter(basics.S3Client).Wait(
			ctx, &s3.HeadObjectInput{Bucket: aws.String(bucketName), Key: aws.String(objectKey)}, time.Minute)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Failed attempt to wait for object %s to exist.\n", objectKey)
		}
	}

	return err
}

```

###### Example

Download a large object by using a download manager to get
the data in parts and download them concurrently.

```go

// DownloadLargeObject uses a download manager to download an object from a bucket.
// The download manager gets the data in parts and writes them to a buffer until all of
// the data has been downloaded.
func (basics BucketBasics) DownloadLargeObject(ctx context.Context, bucketName string, objectKey string) ([]byte, error) {
	var partMiBs int64 = 10
	downloader := manager.NewDownloader(basics.S3Client, func(d *manager.Downloader) {
		d.PartSize = partMiBs * 1024 * 1024
	})
	buffer := manager.NewWriteAtBuffer([]byte{})
	_, err := downloader.Download(ctx, buffer, &s3.GetObjectInput{
		Bucket: aws.String(bucketName),
		Key:    aws.String(objectKey),
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Couldn't download large object from %v:%v. Here's why: %v\n",
			bucketName, objectKey, err)
	}
	return buffer.Bytes(), err
}

PHP

This topic explains how to use the high-level
`Aws\S3\Model\MultipartUpload\UploadBuilder` class from
the AWS SDK for PHP for multipart file uploads. For more information about the AWS SDK for Ruby API, go to [AWS SDK for Ruby - Version\
2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/index.html).

The following PHP example uploads a file to an Amazon S3 bucket. The
example demonstrates how to set parameters for the
`MultipartUploader` object.

```PHP

 require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\Exception\MultipartUploadException;
use Aws\S3\MultipartUploader;
use Aws\S3\S3Client;

$bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';
$keyname = '*** Your Object Key ***';

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

// Prepare the upload parameters.
$uploader = new MultipartUploader($s3, '/path/to/large/file.zip', [
    'bucket' => $bucket,
    'key'    => $keyname
]);

// Perform the upload.
try {
    $result = $uploader->upload();
    echo "Upload complete: {$result['ObjectURL']}" . PHP_EOL;
} catch (MultipartUploadException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}

```

Python

The following example loads an object using the high-level multipart
upload Python API (the `TransferManager` class).

The AWS SDK exposes a low-level API that closely resembles the Amazon S3 REST API for
multipart uploads (see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md). Use the low-level API when you need to pause and resume multipart uploads, vary part
sizes during the upload, or do not know the size of the upload data in advance. When you
don't have these requirements, use the high-level API (see [Using the AWS SDKs (high-level API)](#multipart-upload-high-level)).

Java

The following
example shows how to use the low-level Java classes to upload a file. It performs the
following steps:

- Initiates a multipart upload using the `AmazonS3Client.initiateMultipartUpload()`
method, and passes in an `InitiateMultipartUploadRequest`
object.

- Saves the upload ID that the `AmazonS3Client.initiateMultipartUpload()` method
returns. You provide this upload ID for each subsequent multipart upload
operation.

- Uploads the parts of the object. For each part, you call the
`AmazonS3Client.uploadPart()` method. You provide part upload
information using an `UploadPartRequest` object.

- For each part, saves the ETag from the response of the
`AmazonS3Client.uploadPart()` method in a list. You use the ETag
values to complete the multipart upload.

- Calls the `AmazonS3Client.completeMultipartUpload()` method to complete the
multipart upload.

.NET

The following C# example shows how to use the low-level SDK for .NET multipart upload API to
upload a file to an S3 bucket. For information about Amazon S3 multipart uploads, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](mpuoverview.md).

###### Note

When you use the SDK for .NET API to upload large objects, a timeout might occur
while data is being written to the request stream. You can set an explicit
timeout using the `UploadPartRequest`.

The following C# example uploads a file to an S3 bucket using the low-level multipart
upload API. For
information about setting up and running the code examples, see [Getting Started\
with the AWS SDK for .NET](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/net-dg-setup.html) in the _AWS SDK for .NET Developer_
_Guide_.

PHP

This topic shows how to use the low-level `uploadPart` method from
version 3 of the AWS SDK for PHP to upload a file in multiple parts. For more information about the AWS SDK for Ruby API, go to [AWS SDK for Ruby - Version\
2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/index.html).

The following PHP example uploads a file to an Amazon S3 bucket using the low-level
PHP API multipart upload.

```PHP

 require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Aws\S3\Exception\S3Exception;
use Aws\S3\S3Client;

$bucket = '*** Your Bucket Name ***';
$keyname = '*** Your Object Key ***';
$filename = '*** Path to and Name of the File to Upload ***';

$s3 = new S3Client([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region'  => 'us-east-1'
]);

$result = $s3->createMultipartUpload([
    'Bucket'       => $bucket,
    'Key'          => $keyname,
    'StorageClass' => 'REDUCED_REDUNDANCY',
    'Metadata'     => [
        'param1' => 'value 1',
        'param2' => 'value 2',
        'param3' => 'value 3'
    ]
]);
$uploadId = $result['UploadId'];

// Upload the file in parts.
try {
    $file = fopen($filename, 'r');
    $partNumber = 1;
    while (!feof($file)) {
        $result = $s3->uploadPart([
            'Bucket'     => $bucket,
            'Key'        => $keyname,
            'UploadId'   => $uploadId,
            'PartNumber' => $partNumber,
            'Body'       => fread($file, 5 * 1024 * 1024),
        ]);
        $parts['Parts'][$partNumber] = [
            'PartNumber' => $partNumber,
            'ETag' => $result['ETag'],
        ];
        $partNumber++;

        echo "Uploading part $partNumber of $filename." . PHP_EOL;
    }
    fclose($file);
} catch (S3Exception $e) {
    $result = $s3->abortMultipartUpload([
        'Bucket'   => $bucket,
        'Key'      => $keyname,
        'UploadId' => $uploadId
    ]);

    echo "Upload of $filename failed." . PHP_EOL;
}

// Complete the multipart upload.
$result = $s3->completeMultipartUpload([
    'Bucket'   => $bucket,
    'Key'      => $keyname,
    'UploadId' => $uploadId,
    'MultipartUpload'    => $parts,
]);
$url = $result['Location'];

echo "Uploaded $filename to $url." . PHP_EOL;

```

The AWS SDK for Ruby version 3 supports Amazon S3 multipart uploads in two ways. For the first
option, you can use managed file uploads. For more information, see [Uploading Files to\
Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/uploading-files-to-amazon-s3) in the _AWS Developer Blog_. Managed file
uploads are the recommended method for uploading files to a bucket. They provide the
following benefits:

- Manage multipart uploads for objects larger than 15MB.

- Correctly open files in binary mode to avoid encoding issues.

- Use multiple threads for uploading parts of large objects in parallel.

Alternatively, you can use the following multipart upload client operations directly:

- [create\_multipart\_upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Client.html#create_multipart_upload-instance_method) – Initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID.

- [upload\_part](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Client.html#upload_part-instance_method) – Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

- [upload\_part\_copy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Client.html#upload_part_copy-instance_method) – Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source.

- [complete\_multipart\_upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Client.html#complete_multipart_upload-instance_method) – Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

- [abort\_multipart\_upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Client.html#abort_multipart_upload-instance_method) – Stops a multipart upload.
