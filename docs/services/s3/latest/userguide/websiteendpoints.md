# Website endpoints

When you configure your bucket as a static website, the website is available at the
AWS Region-specific website endpoint of the bucket. Website endpoints are different
from the endpoints where you send REST API requests. For more information about the
differences between the endpoints, see [Key differences between a website endpoint and a REST API endpoint](#WebsiteRestEndpointDiff).

Depending on your Region, your Amazon S3 website endpoint follows one of these two formats.

- **s3-website dash (-) Region** ‐ `http://bucket-name.s3-website-Region.amazonaws.com`

- **s3-website dot (.) Region** ‐ `http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com`

These URLs return the default index document that you configure for the website. For a complete list of Amazon S3 website endpoints, see [Amazon S3 Website\
Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints).

###### Note

To augment the security of your Amazon S3 static websites, the Amazon S3 website endpoint domains (for example, _s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com_ or _s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com_)
are registered in the [Public Suffix\
List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/). For further security, we recommend that you use cookies with
a `__Host-` prefix if you ever need to set sensitive cookies in the
domain name for your Amazon S3 static websites. This practice will help to
defend your domain against cross-site request forgery attempts (CSRF). For more
information see the [Set-Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) page in the Mozilla Developer Network.

If you want your website to be public, you must make all your content publicly
readable for your customers to be able to access it at the website endpoint. For more
information, see [Setting permissions for website access](websiteaccesspermissionsreqd.md).

###### Important

- Amazon S3 website endpoints do not support HTTPS or access points. If you want
to use HTTPS, you can do one of the following:

- (Recommended) Use [AWS Amplify\
Hosting](../../../amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.md) to host static website content stored on S3.
Amplify Hosting is a fully managed service that makes it easy to
deploy your websites on a globally available content delivery
network (CDN) powered by Amazon CloudFront, allowing secure static
website hosting.

With AWS Amplify Hosting, you can select the location of your
objects within your general purpose bucket, deploy your content to a
managed CDN, and generate a public HTTPS URL for your website to be
accessible anywhere. For more information about Amplify Hosting, see
[Deploying a static website to AWS Amplify Hosting from an S3\
general purpose bucket](website-hosting-amplify.md) and [Deploying a static website from S3 using the Amplify\
console](../../../amplify/latest/userguide/deploy-from-amplify-console.md) in the _AWS Amplify Console User_
_Guide_.

- Use Amazon CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3. For more
information, see [How do I use CloudFront to serve HTTPS requests for my Amazon S3\
bucket?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3) To use HTTPS with a custom domain, see [Configuring a static website using a custom domain registered\
with Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html).

- Requester Pays buckets do not allow access
through a website endpoint. Any request to such a bucket receives a
**`403 Access Denied`** response. For more information,
see [Using Requester Pays general purpose buckets for storage transfers and usage](requesterpaysbuckets.md).

## Website endpoint examples

The following examples show how you can access an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured
as a static website.

###### Example— Requesting an object at the root level

To request a specific object that is stored at the root level in the bucket,
use the following URL structure.

```nohighlight

http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com/object-name
```

For example, the following URL requests the `photo.jpg` object that
is stored at the root level in the bucket.

```

http://example-bucket.s3-website.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photo.jpg
```

###### Example— Requesting an object in a prefix

To request an object that is stored in a folder in your bucket, use this URL
structure.

```nohighlight

http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com/folder-name/object-name
```

The following URL requests the `docs/doc1.html` object in your
bucket.

```

http://example-bucket.s3-website.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs/doc1.html
```

## Adding a DNS CNAME

If you have a registered domain, you can add a DNS CNAME entry to point to the
Amazon S3 website endpoint. For example, if you registered the domain
`www.example-bucket.com`, you could create a bucket
`www.example-bucket.com`, and add a DNS CNAME record that points to
`www.example-bucket.com.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com`.
All requests to `http://www.example-bucket.com` are routed to
`www.example-bucket.com.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com`.

For more information, see [Customizing Amazon S3 URLs with CNAME records](virtualhosting.md#VirtualHostingCustomURLs).

## Using a custom domain with Route 53

Instead of accessing the website using an Amazon S3 website endpoint, you can use your
own domain registered with Amazon Route 53 to serve your content—for example,
`example.com`. You can use Amazon S3 with Route 53 to host a website at the
root domain. For example, if you have the root domain `example.com` and
you host your website on Amazon S3, your website visitors can access the site from their
browser by entering either `http://www.example.com` or
`http://example.com`.

For an example walkthrough, see [Tutorial: Configuring a static website using a custom domain registered with Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html).

## Key differences between a website endpoint and a REST API endpoint

An Amazon S3 website endpoint is optimized for access from a web browser. The following
table summarizes the key differences between a REST API endpoint and a website
endpoint.
