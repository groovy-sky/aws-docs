# Copy objects

You can use Amazon S3 Batch Operations to perform large-scale batch operations on Amazon S3 objects.
The Batch Operations **Copy** operation copies each object that is specified in the
manifest. You can copy objects to a bucket in the same AWS Region or to a bucket in a
different Region. S3 Batch Operations supports most options available through Amazon S3 for copying
objects. These options include setting object metadata, setting permissions, and changing an
object's storage class.

You can also use the **Copy** operation to copy existing unencrypted
objects and write them back to the same bucket as encrypted objects. For more information, see
[Encrypting objects\
with Amazon S3 Batch Operations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/encrypting-objects-with-amazon-s3-batch-operations).

When you copy objects, you can change the checksum algorithm used to calculate the checksum
of the object. If objects don't have an additional checksum calculated, you can also add one by
specifying the checksum algorithm for Amazon S3 to use. For more information, see
[Checking object integrity in Amazon S3](checking-object-integrity.md).

For more information about copying objects in Amazon S3 and the required and optional parameters,
see [Copying, moving, and renaming objects](copy-object.md) in this guide and [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Restrictions and limitations

When you're using the Batch Operations **Copy** operation, the following
restrictions and limitations apply:

- All source objects must be in one bucket.

- All destination objects must be in one bucket.

- You must have read permissions for the source bucket and write permissions for the
destination bucket.

- Objects to be copied can be up to 5 GB in size.

- If you try to copy objects from the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
classes to the S3 Standard storage class, you must first restore these objects. For more
information, see [Restoring an archived object](restoring-objects.md).

- You must create your Batch Operations **Copy** jobs in the destination
Region, which is the Region that you intend to copy the objects to.

- All `CopyObject` options are supported except for conditional checks on
entity tags (ETags) and server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C).

- If the destination bucket is unversioned, you will overwrite any objects that have the
same key names.

- Objects aren't necessarily copied in the same order as they appear in the manifest.
For versioned buckets, if preserving the current or noncurrent version order is important,
copy all noncurrent versions first. Then, after the first job is complete, copy the
current versions in a subsequent job.

- Copying objects to the Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) class isn't supported.

- A single Batch Operations Copy job can support a manifest with up to 20 billion objects.
