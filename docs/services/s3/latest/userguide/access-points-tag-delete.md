# Deleting a tag from an access point

You can remove tags from Amazon S3 Access Points. An AWS tag is a key-value pair that holds metadata about resources, in this case Access Points. For more information about tags, see [Using tags with S3 Access Points for general purpose buckets](access-points-tagging.md).

###### Note

If you delete a tag and later learn that it was being used to track costs or for access control, you can add the tag back to the access point.

## Permissions

To delete a tag from an access point, you must have the following permission:

- `s3:UntagResource`

## Troubleshooting errors

If you encounter an error when attempting to delete a tag from an access point, you can do the following:

- Verify that you have the required [Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-db-tag-delete.html#access-points-db-tag-delete-permissions) to delete a tag from an access point.

## Steps

You can delete tags from access points by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the Amazon S3 REST API, and AWS SDKs.

To delete tags from an access point using the Amazon S3 console:

1. Sign in to Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Access Points (General Purpose Buckets)**.

3. Choose the access point name.

4. Choose the **Properties** tab.

5. Scroll to the **Tags** section and select the checkbox next to the tag or tags that you would like to delete.

6. Choose **Delete**.

7. The **Delete user-defined tags** pop-up appears and asks you to confirm the deletion of the tag or tags you selected.

8. Choose **Delete** to confirm.

```nohighlight

UntagResourceRequest tagResourceRequest = UntagResourceRequest.builder()
                .resourceArn(arn:aws::s3:region:111122223333:accesspoint/my-access-point/*)
                .accountId(111122223333)
                .tagKeys(List.of("key1", "key2")).build();
awss3Control.untagResource(tagResourceRequest);
```
