## Verifying the signature of the Mountpoint for Amazon S3 package

1. Install GnuPG (the `gpg` command). It is required to
    verify the authenticity and integrity of a downloaded Mountpoint for Amazon S3 package.
    GnuPG is installed by default on Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
    After you installGnuPG, proceed to step 2.

2. Download the Mountpoint public key by running the following command:

```nohighlight

wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/mountpoint-s3-release/public_keys/KEYS
```

3. Import the Mountpoint public key into your keyring by running the following
    command:

```nohighlight

gpg --import KEYS
```

4. Verify the fingerprint of the Mountpoint public key by running the following
    command:

```nohighlight

gpg --fingerprint mountpoint-s3@amazon.com
```

Confirm that the displayed fingerprint string matches one of the following:

```nohighlight

8AEF E705 EBE3 29C0 948C  75A6 6F1C 3B3A EF4B 030B
673F E406 1506 BB46 9A0E  F857 BE39 7A52 B086 DA5A (older key)
```

If the fingerprint string doesn't match, do not finish installing
    Mountpoint, and contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport).

5. Download the package signature file. Replace
    `signature-link` with the appropriate
    signature link from the preceding sections.

```nohighlight

wget signature-link
```

6. Verify the signature of the downloaded package by running the following command.
    Replace `signature-filename` with the file name
    from the previous step.

```nohighlight

gpg --verify signature-filename
```

For example, on RPM-based distributions, including Amazon Linux, enter the following
    command:

```nohighlight

gpg --verify mount-s3.rpm.asc
```

7. The output should include the phrase `Good signature`. If the output
    includes the phrase `BAD signature`, redownload the Mountpoint
    package file and repeat these steps. If the issue persists, do not finish installing
    Mountpoint, and contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport).

The output may include a warning about a trusted signature. This does not indicate a
    problem. It only means that you have not independently verified the Mountpoint
    public key.
