# Using an AWS KMS key to encrypt your metrics exports

To grant Amazon S3 Storage Lens permission to encrypt your metrics exports by using a customer managed key,
you must use a key policy. To update your key policy so that you can use a KMS key to
encrypt your S3 Storage Lens metrics exports, follow these steps.

###### To grant S3 Storage Lens permissions to encrypt data by using your KMS key

1. Sign into the AWS Management Console by using the AWS account that owns the customer managed key.

2. Open the AWS KMS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kms).

3. To change the AWS Region, use the **Region selector** in the
    upper-right corner of the page.

4. In the left navigation pane, choose **Customer managed keys**.

5. Under **Customer managed keys**, choose the key that you want to use
    to encrypt the metrics exports. AWS KMS keys are Region-specific and must be in the
    same Region as the metrics export destination S3 bucket.

6. Under **Key policy**, choose **Switch to policy**
**view**.

7. To update the key policy, choose **Edit**.

8. Under **Edit key policy**, add the following key policy to the
    existing key policy. To use this policy, replace the `
             user input
                 placeholders
           ` with your information.

```json

{
       "Sid": "Allow Amazon S3 Storage Lens use of the KMS key",
        "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": {
           "Service": "storage-lens.s3.amazonaws.com"
       },
       "Action": [
           "kms:GenerateDataKey"
       ],
       "Resource": "*",
       "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
              "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:        source-account-id:storage-lens/your-dashboard-name",
              "aws:SourceAccount": "source-account-id"
           }
        }
}

```

9. Choose **Save changes**.

For more information about creating customer managed keys and using key policies, see the following
topics in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_:

- [Create a\
KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html)

- [Key\
policies in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html)

You can also use the AWS KMS `PUT` key policy API operation ( [PutKeyPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_PutKeyPolicy.html)) to copy the key policy to the customer managed keys that you want
to use to encrypt the metrics exports by using the REST API, AWS CLI, and SDKs.
