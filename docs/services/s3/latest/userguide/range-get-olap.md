# Working with Range and partNumber headers

###### Note

As of November 7th, 2025, S3 Object Lambda is available only to existing customers that are currently using the service as well as to select AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. For capabilities similar to S3 Object Lambda, learn more here - [Amazon S3 Object Lambda availability change](amazons3-ol-change.md).

When working with large objects in Amazon S3 Object Lambda, you can use the `Range` HTTP
header to download a specified byte range from an object. To fetch different byte ranges
from within the same object, you can use concurrent connections to Amazon S3. You can also
specify the `partNumber` parameter (an integer between 1 and 10,000), which
performs a ranged request for the specified part of the object.

Because there are multiple ways that you might want to handle a request that includes the
`Range` or `partNumber` parameters, S3 Object Lambda doesn't apply these
parameters to the transformed object. Instead, your AWS Lambda function must implement this
functionality as needed for your application.

To use the `Range` and `partNumber` parameters with S3 Object Lambda, you do the
following:

- Enable these parameters in your Object Lambda Access Point configuration.

- Write a Lambda function that can handle requests that include these
parameters.

The following steps describe how to accomplish this.

## Step 1: Configure your Object Lambda Access Point

By default, Object Lambda Access Points respond with an HTTP status code 501 (Not Implemented) error to
any `GetObject` or `HeadObject` request that contains a
`Range` or `partNumber` parameter, either in the headers or
query parameters.

To enable an Object Lambda Access Point to accept such requests, you must include `GetObject-Range`, `GetObject-PartNumber`, `HeadObject-Range`, or `HeadObject-PartNumber` in the `AllowedFeatures` section of your Object Lambda Access Point configuration. For more information about
updating your Object Lambda Access Point configuration, see [Creating Object Lambda Access Points](olap-create.md).

## Step 2: Implement `Range` or `partNumber` handling in your Lambda function

When your Object Lambda Access Point invokes your Lambda function with a ranged `GetObject` or
`HeadObject` request, the `Range` or `partNumber`
parameter is included in the event context. The location of the parameter in the event
context depends on which parameter was used and how it was included in the original
request to the Object Lambda Access Point, as explained in the following table.

ParameterEvent context location

`Range` (header)

`userRequest.headers.Range`

`Range` (query parameter)

`userRequest.url` (query parameter
`Range`)

`partNumber`

`userRequest.url` (query parameter
`partNumber`)

###### Important

The provided presigned URL for your Object Lambda Access Point doesn't contain the `Range` or
`partNumber` parameter from the original request. See the following options on how to handle these parameters in your AWS Lambda function.

After you extract the `Range` or `partNumber` value, you can take
one of the following approaches, based on your application's needs:

1. **Map the requested `Range` or**
**`partNumber` to the transformed object (recommended).**

The most reliable way to handle `Range` or `partNumber`
    requests is to do the following:

- Retrieve the full object from Amazon S3.

- Transform the object.

- Apply the requested `Range` or `partNumber`
parameters to the transformed object.

To do this, use the provided presigned URL to fetch the entire object from Amazon S3
and then process the object as needed. For an example Lambda function that processes
a `Range` parameter in this way, see [this sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-s3-object-lambda-default-configuration/blob/main/function/nodejs_20_x/src/response/range_mapper.ts) in the AWS Samples GitHub repository.

2. **Map the requested `Range` to the presigned URL.**

In some cases, your Lambda function can map the requested `Range` directly to the presigned URL to retrieve only part of
    the object from Amazon S3. This approach is appropriate only if your transformation meets
    both of the following criteria:

1. Your transformation function can be applied to partial object
    ranges.

2. Applying the `Range` parameter before or after the transformation function results in the same transformed
    object.

For example, a transformation function that converts all characters in an
ASCII-encoded object to uppercase meets both of the preceding criteria. The
transformation can be applied to part of an object, and applying the
`Range` parameter before the
transformation achieves the same result as applying it after the
transformation.

By contrast, a function that reverses the characters in an ASCII-encoded
object doesn't meet these criteria. Such a function meets criterion 1, because
it can be applied to partial object ranges. However, it doesn't meet criterion
2, because applying the `Range` parameter before the transformation
achieves different results than applying the parameter after the transformation.

Consider a request to apply the function to the first three
characters of an object with the contents `abcdefg`. Applying the
`Range` parameter before the transformation retrieves only
`abc` and then reverses the data, returning `cba`. But
if the parameter is applied after the transformation, the function retrieves the
entire object, reverses it, and then applies the `Range` parameter,
returning `gfe`. Because these results are different, this function
should not apply the `Range` parameter when retrieving the object
from Amazon S3. Instead, it should retrieve the entire object, perform the
transformation, and only then apply the `Range` parameter.

###### Warning

In many cases, applying the `Range` parameter to the presigned URL will result in unexpected behavior by the
Lambda function or the requesting client. Unless you are sure that your
application will work properly when retrieving only a partial object from
Amazon S3, we recommend that you retrieve and transform full objects as described
earlier in approach A.

If your application meets the criteria described earlier in approach B, you can
simplify your AWS Lambda function by fetching only
the requested object range and then running your transformation on that range.

The following Java code example demonstrates how to do the following:

- Retrieve the `Range` header from the `GetObject`
request.

- Add the `Range` header to the presigned URL that Lambda can use
to retrieve the requested range from Amazon S3.

```

private HttpRequest.Builder applyRangeHeader(ObjectLambdaEvent event, HttpRequest.Builder presignedRequest) {
    var header = event.getUserRequest().getHeaders().entrySet().stream()
            .filter(e -> e.getKey().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).equals("range"))
            .findFirst();

    // Add check in the query string itself.
    header.ifPresent(entry -> presignedRequest.header(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()));
    return presignedRequest;
}
```
