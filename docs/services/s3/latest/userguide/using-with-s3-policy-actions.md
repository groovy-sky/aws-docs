# Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations

###### Note

This page is about Amazon S3 policy actions for general purpose buckets. To learn more about Amazon S3 policy actions for directory buckets, see
[Actions for directory buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam.html#s3-express-security-iam-actions).

To perform an S3 API operation, you must have the right permissions. This page maps S3 API operations to the required permissions. To grant permissions to
perform an S3 API operation, you must compose a valid policy (such as an S3 bucket
policy or IAM identity-based policy), and specify corresponding actions in the
`Action` element of the policy. These actions are called policy actions.
Not every S3 API operation is represented by a single permission (a single policy action), and some permissions (some policy actions) are required for many different API operations.

When you compose policies, you must specify the `Resource` element based on the correct resource type required by the corresponding Amazon S3 policy actions. This page categorizes permissions to S3 API operations by the resource types.
For more information about the resource types, see
[Resource types defined by Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html#amazons3-resources-for-iam-policies) in the _Service Authorization_
_Reference_. For a full list of Amazon S3 policy actions, resources, and condition keys for use in policies, see [Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazons3.html) in the _Service Authorization_
_Reference_. For a complete list of Amazon S3 API operations, see [Amazon S3 API Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Operations.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

For more information on how to address the HTTP `403 Forbidden` errors in S3, see [Troubleshoot access denied (403 Forbidden) errors in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-403-errors.html). For
more information on the IAM features to use with S3, see [How Amazon S3 works with IAM](security-iam-service-with-iam.md). For more information on S3 security best practices,
see [Security best practices for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html).

## Bucket operations and permissions

Bucket operations are S3 API operations that operate on the bucket resource type. You must specify S3 policy actions for bucket operations
in bucket policies or IAM
identity-based policies.

In the policies, the `Resource` element must be the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information about the `Resource` element format and
example policies, see [Bucket operations](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-buckets).

###### Note

To grant permissions to bucket operations in access point policies, note the following:

- Permissions granted for bucket operations in an access point policy are effective only if the underlying bucket allows
the same permissions. When you use an access point, you must delegate access
control from the bucket to the access point or add the same permissions in the access point
policy to the underlying bucket's policy.

- In access point policies that grant permissions to bucket operations, the `Resource` element must be the `accesspoint` ARN. For more information about the `Resource` element format and
example policies, see [Bucket operations in policies for access points for general purpose buckets](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#bucket-operations-ap). For more information about access point policies, see [Configuring IAM policies for using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-policies.html).

- Not all bucket operations are supported by access points. For more information, see [Access points compatibility with S3 operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-service-api-support.html#access-points-operations-support).

## Object operations and permissions

Object operations are S3 API operations that operate on the object resource type. You must specify S3 policy actions for object operations in resource-based policies (such as bucket policies, access point policies, Multi-Region Access Point policies, VPC endpoint policies) or IAM
identity-based policies.

In the policies, the `Resource` element must be the object ARN. For more information about the `Resource` element format and
example policies, see [Object operations](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-objects).

###### Note

- AWS KMS policy actions ( `kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt`) are only applicable for the AWS KMS resource type and must be specified in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS resource-based policies (AWS KMS key policies).
You can't specify AWS KMS policy actions in S3 resource-based policies, such as S3 bucket policies.

- When you use access points to control access to object operations, you can use
access point policies. To grant permissions to object operations in access point policies, note the following:

- In access point policies that grant permissions to object operations, the `Resource` element must be the ARNs for objects accessed through an access point. For more information about the `Resource` element format and example
policies, see [Object operations in access point policies](security-iam-service-with-iam.md#object-operations-ap).

- Not all object operations are supported by access points. For more information, see [Access points compatibility with S3 operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-service-api-support.html#access-points-operations-support).

- Not all object operations are supported by Multi-Region Access Points. For more information, see [Multi-Region Access Point compatibility with S3 operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MrapOperations.html#mrap-operations-support).
