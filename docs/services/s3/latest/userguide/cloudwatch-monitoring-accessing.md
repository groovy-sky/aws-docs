# Accessing CloudWatch metrics

You can use the following procedures to view the storage metrics for
Amazon S3. To get the Amazon S3 metrics involved, you must set a start and end timestamp.
For metrics for any given 24-hour period, set the time period to 86400 seconds, the
number of seconds in a day. Also, remember to set the `BucketName` and
`StorageType` dimensions.

For example, if you want to use the AWS CLI to get the average of a specific
bucket's size in bytes, you could use the following command:

```nohighlight

aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --metric-name BucketSizeBytes --namespace AWS/S3 --start-time 2016-10-19T00:00:00Z --end-time 2016-10-20T00:00:00Z --statistics Average --unit Bytes --region us-west-2 --dimensions Name=BucketName,Value=amzn-s3-demo-bucket Name=StorageType,Value=StandardStorage --period 86400 --output json

```

This example produces the following output.

```

{
    "Datapoints": [
        {
            "Timestamp": "2016-10-19T00:00:00Z",
            "Average": 1025328.0,
            "Unit": "Bytes"
        }
    ],
    "Label": "BucketSizeBytes"
}
```

###### To view metrics by using the Amazon CloudWatch console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).
