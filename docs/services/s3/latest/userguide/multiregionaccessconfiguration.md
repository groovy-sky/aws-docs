# Configuring a Multi-Region Access Point for use with AWS PrivateLink

You can use Multi-Region Access Points to route Amazon S3 request traffic between AWS Regions. Each Multi-Region Access Point
global endpoint routes Amazon S3 data request traffic from multiple sources without your having
to build complex networking configurations with separate endpoints. These data-request
traffic sources include:

- Traffic originating in a virtual private cloud (VPC)

- Traffic from on-premises data centers traveling over AWS PrivateLink

- Traffic from the public internet

If you establish an AWS PrivateLink connection to an S3 Multi-Region Access Point, you can route S3 requests
into AWS, or across multiple AWS Regions, over a private connection by using a simple
network architecture and configuration. When you use AWS PrivateLink, you don't need to
configure a VPC peering connection.
