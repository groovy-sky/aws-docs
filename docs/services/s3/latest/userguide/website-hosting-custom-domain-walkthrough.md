# Tutorial: Configuring a static website using a custom domain registered with Route 53

Suppose that you want to host a static website on Amazon S3. You've registered a domain with
Amazon Route 53 (for example, `example.com`), and you want requests for
`http://www.example.com` and `http://example.com` to
be served from your Amazon S3 content. You can use this walkthrough to learn how to host a static
website and create redirects on Amazon S3 for a website with a custom domain name that is
registered with Route 53. You can work with an existing website that you want to host on Amazon S3,
or use this walkthrough to start from scratch.

After you complete this walkthrough, you can optionally use Amazon CloudFront to improve the
performance of your website. For more information, see [Speeding up your website with Amazon CloudFront](website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.md).

###### Note

Amazon S3 website endpoints do not support HTTPS or access points. If you want to use HTTPS, you can use Amazon CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3.

For a tutorial about how to host your content securely with CloudFront and Amazon S3, see [Tutorial: Hosting on-demand streaming video with Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53](tutorial-s3-cloudfront-route53-video-streaming.md). For more information, see [How do I use\
CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website) and [Requiring HTTPS for communication between viewers and CloudFront](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.md).

###### Automating static website setup with an CloudFormation template

You can use an CloudFormation template to automate your static website setup. The CloudFormation template sets
up the components that you need to host a secure static website so that you can focus
more on your website’s content and less on configuring components.

The CloudFormation template includes the following components:

- Amazon S3 – Creates an Amazon S3 bucket to host your static website.

- CloudFront – Creates a CloudFront distribution to speed up your static website.

- Lambda@Edge – Uses [Lambda@Edge](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/lambda-at-the-edge.md) to add security headers to every server response. Security
headers are a group of headers in the web server response that tell web browsers to
take extra security precautions. For more information, see the blog post [Adding HTTP security headers using Lambda@Edge and Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/adding-http-security-headers-using-lambdaedge-and-amazon-cloudfront).

This CloudFormation template is available for you to download and use. For information and
instructions, see [Getting started with a secure static website](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/getting-started-secure-static-website-cloudformation-template.md) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_.

## Before you begin

As you follow the steps in this example, you work with the following services:

Amazon Route 53 – You use Route 53 to register domains and to
define where you want to route internet traffic for your domain. The example shows how
to create Route 53 alias records that route traffic for your domain
( `example.com`) and subdomain ( `www.example.com`) to an Amazon S3
bucket that contains an HTML file.

Amazon S3 – You use Amazon S3 to create buckets, upload a sample
website page, configure permissions so that everyone can see the content, and then
configure the buckets for website hosting.

## Step 1: Register a custom domain with Route 53

If you don't already have a registered domain name, such as `example.com`,
register one with Route 53. For more information, see [Registering a new domain](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/domain-register.md) in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_. After you register your domain name, you can
create and configure your Amazon S3 buckets for website hosting.

## Step 2: Create two buckets

To support requests from both the root domain and subdomain, you create two buckets.

- **Domain bucket** – `example.com`

- **Subdomain bucket** – `www.example.com`

These bucket names must match your domain name exactly. In this example, the domain name is
`example.com`. You host your content out of the root domain bucket
( `example.com`). You create a redirect request for the subdomain bucket
( `www.example.com`). If someone enters `www.example.com` in
their browser, they are redirected to `example.com` and see the content that
is hosted in the Amazon S3 bucket with that name.

###### To create your buckets for website hosting

The following instructions provide an overview of how to create your buckets for website
hosting. For detailed, step-by-step instructions on creating a bucket, see [Creating a general purpose bucket](create-bucket-overview.md).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. Create your root domain bucket:
1. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region in which you want to create a bucket.

      ###### Note

      To minimize latency and costs and address regulatory requirements, choose a Region
      close to you. Objects stored in a Region never leave that Region unless you explicitly
      transfer them to another Region. For a list of Amazon S3 AWS Regions, see [AWS service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) in the
      _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

3. Choose **Create bucket**. The **Create bucket** page opens.

4. Enter the **Bucket name** (for example,
       `example.com`).

5. Choose the Region where you want to create the bucket.

      Choose a Region that is geographically close to you to minimize latency and costs, or to
       address regulatory requirements. The Region that you choose determines
       your Amazon S3 website endpoint. For more information, see [Website endpoints](websiteendpoints.md).

6. To accept the default settings and create the bucket, choose **Create**.
3. Create your subdomain bucket:
1. Choose **Create bucket**.

2. Enter the **Bucket name** (for example,
       `www.example.com`).

3. Choose the Region where you want to create the bucket.

      Choose a Region that is geographically close to you to minimize latency and costs, or
       to address regulatory requirements. The Region that you choose
       determines your Amazon S3 website endpoint. For more information, see [Website endpoints](websiteendpoints.md).

4. To accept the default settings and create the bucket, choose **Create**.

In the next step, you configure `example.com` for website hosting.

## Step 3: Configure your root domain bucket for website hosting

In this step, you configure your root domain bucket ( `example.com`) as a
website. This bucket will contain your website content. When you configure a bucket for
website hosting, you can access the website using the [Website endpoints](websiteendpoints.md).

###### To enable static website hosting

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

03. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to
     enable static website hosting for.

04. Choose **Properties**.

05. Under **Static website hosting**, choose **Edit**.

06. Choose **Use this bucket to host a website**.

07. Under **Static website hosting**, choose **Enable**.

08. In **Index document**, enter the file name of the index document,
     typically `index.html`.

    The index document name is case sensitive and must exactly match the file name of the HTML index document that you plan to upload to your S3 bucket. When you configure a bucket for website hosting, you must specify an index document.
     Amazon S3 returns this index document when requests are made to the root domain or any of the
     subfolders. For more information, see [Configuring an index document](indexdocumentsupport.md).

09. To provide your own custom error document for 4XX class
     errors, in **Error document**, enter the custom error document file name.

    The error document name is case sensitive and must exactly match the file name of the HTML error document that you plan to upload to your S3 bucket. If you don't specify a custom error document and an error occurs, Amazon S3 returns a
     default HTML error document. For more information, see [Configuring a custom error document](customerrordocsupport.md).

10. (Optional) If you want to specify advanced redirection rules, in **Redirection rules**, enter JSON to describe the rules.

    For example, you can conditionally route requests according to specific object key
     names or prefixes in the request. For more information, see [Configure redirection rules to use advanced conditional redirects](how-to-page-redirect.md#advanced-conditional-redirects).

11. Choose **Save changes**.

    Amazon S3 enables static website hosting for your bucket. At the bottom of the page, under **Static website hosting**, you see the website endpoint for your bucket.

12. Under **Static website hosting**, note the **Endpoint**.

    The **Endpoint** is the Amazon S3 website endpoint for your bucket.
     After you finish configuring your bucket as a static website, you can use this endpoint to test your
     website.

After you [edit block public access settings](website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.md#root-domain-walkthrough-configure-bucket-permissions) and [add a bucket policy](website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.md#add-bucket-policy-root-domain) that allows public read
access, you can use the website endpoint to
access your website.

In the next step, you configure your subdomain ( `www.example.com`) to redirect
requests to your domain ( `example.com`).

## Step 4: Configure your subdomain bucket for website redirect

After you configure your root domain bucket for website hosting, you can configure your
subdomain bucket to redirect all requests to the domain. In this example, all requests
for `www.example.com` are redirected to `example.com`.

###### To configure a redirect request

1. On the Amazon S3 console, in the **General purpose buckets** list, choose your subdomain
    bucket name ( `www.example.com` in this example).

2. Choose **Properties**.

3. Under **Static website hosting**, choose **Edit**.

4. Choose **Redirect requests for an object**.

5. In the **Target bucket** box, enter your root domain, for example,
    `example.com`.

6. For **Protocol**, choose **http**.

7. Choose **Save changes**.

## Step 5: Configure logging for website traffic

If you want to track the number of visitors accessing your website, you can optionally
enable logging for your root domain bucket. For more information, see [Logging requests with server access logging](serverlogs.md). If you plan to use Amazon CloudFront to speed up your website, you can also
use CloudFront logging.

###### To enable server access logging for your root domain bucket

01. Open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the same Region where you created the bucket that is configured as a static website, create a bucket for logging, for example `logs.example.com`.

03. Create a folder for the server access logging log files (for example, `logs`).

04. (Optional) If you want to use CloudFront to improve your website performance, create
     a folder for the CloudFront log files (for example, `cdn`).

    ###### Important

    When you create or update a distribution and enable CloudFront logging, CloudFront updates the bucket
    access control list (ACL) to give the `awslogsdelivery` account
    `FULL_CONTROL` permissions to write logs to your bucket. For
    more information, see [Permissions required to configure standard logging and to access your\
    log files](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/accesslogs.md#AccessLogsBucketAndFileOwnership) in the _Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide_. If the bucket that stores the logs uses the
    Bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership to disable ACLs,
    CloudFront cannot write logs to the bucket. For more information, see
    [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](about-object-ownership.md).

05. In the **Buckets** list, choose your root domain bucket.

06. Choose **Properties**.

07. Under **Server access logging**, choose **Edit**.

08. Choose **Enable**.

09. Under the **Target bucket**, choose the bucket and folder destination for the server access logs:

- Browse to the folder and bucket location:

1. Choose **Browse S3**.

2. Choose the bucket name, and then choose the logs folder.

3. Choose **Choose path**.

- Enter the S3 bucket path, for example, `s3://logs.example.com/logs/`.

10. Choose **Save changes**.

    In your log bucket, you can now access your logs. Amazon S3 writes website access logs to your log bucket every 2 hours.

## Step 6: Upload index and website content

In this step, you upload your index document and optional website content to your root
domain bucket.

When you enable static website hosting for your bucket, you enter the name of the index document (for example, `index.html`). After you enable static website hosting for the bucket, you upload an HTML file with this index document name to your bucket.

###### To configure the index document

1. Create an `index.html` file.

If you don't have an `index.html` file, you can use the following
    HTML to create one:

```

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" >
<head>
       <title>My Website Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>
     <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
     <p>Now hosted on Amazon S3!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Save the index file locally.

The index document file name must exactly match the index document name that you enter in the **Static website hosting** dialog box. The index document name is case sensitive. For example, if you enter `index.html` for the **Index document** name in the **Static website hosting** dialog box, your index document file name must also be `index.html` and not `Index.html`.

3. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

4. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

5. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to use to host a static website.

6. Enable static website hosting for your bucket, and enter the exact name of your index document
    (for example, `index.html`). For more
    information, see [Enabling website hosting](enablewebsitehosting.md).

After enabling static website hosting, proceed to step 6.

7. To upload the index document to your bucket, do one of the following:

- Drag and drop the index file into the console bucket listing.

- Choose **Upload**, and follow the prompts to choose and upload the index file.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Uploading objects](upload-objects.md).

8. (Optional) Upload other website content to your bucket.

## Step 7: Upload an error document

When you enable static website hosting for your bucket, you enter the name of the error document (for example, `404.html`). After you enable static website hosting for the bucket, you upload an HTML file with this error document name to your bucket.

###### To configure an error document

1. Create an error document, for example `404.html`.

2. Save the error document file locally.

The error document name is case sensitive and must exactly match the name that
    you enter when you enable static website hosting. For example, if you enter
    `404.html` for the **Error document**
    name in the **Static website hosting** dialog box, your error
    document file name must also be `404.html`.

3. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

4. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

5. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to use to host a static website.

6. Enable static website hosting for your bucket, and enter the exact name of
    your error document (for example, `404.html`). For more
    information, see [Enabling website hosting](enablewebsitehosting.md) and [Configuring a custom error document](customerrordocsupport.md).

After enabling static website hosting, proceed to step 6.

7. To upload the error document to your bucket, do one of the following:

- Drag and drop the error document file into the console bucket listing.

- Choose **Upload**, and follow the prompts to choose and upload the index file.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Uploading objects](upload-objects.md).

## Step 8: Edit S3 Block Public Access settings

In this example, you edit block public access settings for the domain bucket
( `example.com`) to allow public access.

By default, Amazon S3 blocks public access to your account and buckets. If you want to use a bucket to host a static website, you can use these steps to edit your block public access settings.

###### Warning

Before you complete these steps, review [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](access-control-block-public-access.md) to ensure that you understand and accept the risks involved with allowing public access. When you turn off block public access settings to make your bucket public, anyone on the internet can access your bucket. We recommend that you block all public access to your buckets.

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. Choose the name of the bucket that you have configured as a static website.

3. Choose **Permissions**.

4. Under **Block public access (bucket settings)**, choose **Edit**.

5. Clear **Block _all_ public**
**access**, and choose **Save changes**.

![The Amazon S3 console, showing the block public access bucket settings.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/edit-public-access-clear.png)

Amazon S3 turns off the Block Public Access settings for your bucket. To create a public static website, you might also have to [edit the Block Public Access settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/block-public-access-account.html) for your account
    before adding a bucket policy. If the Block Public Access settings for your account are currently turned on, you see a note under **Block public access (bucket settings)**.

## Step 9: Attach a bucket policy

In this example, you attach a bucket policy to the domain bucket ( `example.com`)
to allow public read access. You replace the `Bucket-Name` in
the example bucket policy with the name of your domain bucket, for example
`example.com`.

After you edit S3 Block Public Access settings, you can add a bucket policy to grant public read access to your bucket. When you grant public read access, anyone on the internet can access your bucket.

###### Important

The following policy is an example only and allows full access to the contents of your bucket. Before you proceed with this step, review [How can I secure the files in my Amazon S3 bucket?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/secure-s3-resources) to ensure that you understand the best practices for securing the files in your S3 bucket and risks involved in granting public access.

1. Under **Buckets**, choose the name of your bucket.

2. Choose **Permissions**.

3. Under **Bucket Policy**, choose **Edit**.

4. To grant public read access for your website, copy the following bucket policy, and paste it in the **Bucket policy editor**.

```nohighlight

{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
}
```

5. Update the `Resource` to your bucket name.

In the preceding example bucket policy, `Bucket-Name` is a placeholder for the bucket name. To use this bucket policy with your own bucket, you must update this name to
    match your bucket name.

6. Choose **Save changes**.

A message appears indicating that the bucket policy has been successfully added.

If you see an error that says `Policy has invalid resource`, confirm that the bucket
    name in the bucket policy matches your bucket name. For information about adding a bucket
    policy, see [How do I add an S3 bucket policy?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html)

If you get an error message and cannot save the bucket policy, check your account and bucket Block Public Access settings to confirm that you allow public access to the bucket.

In the next step, you can figure out your website endpoints and test your domain
endpoint.

## Step 10: Test your domain endpoint

After you configure your domain bucket to host a public website, you can test your
endpoint. For more information, see [Website endpoints](websiteendpoints.md). You can only test the endpoint for your domain
bucket because your subdomain bucket is set up for website redirect and not static
website hosting.

###### Note

Amazon S3 does not support HTTPS access to the website. If you want to use HTTPS, you can use Amazon CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3.

For more information, see [How do I use CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website) and [Requiring HTTPS for communication between viewers and CloudFront](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.md).

1. Under **Buckets**, choose the name of your bucket.

2. Choose **Properties**.

3. At the bottom of the page, under **Static website hosting**, choose your **Bucket website endpoint**.

Your index document opens in a separate browser window.

In the next step, you use Amazon Route 53 to enable customers to use both of your custom URLs to
navigate to your site.

## Step 11: Add alias records for your domain and subdomain

In this step, you create the alias records that you add to the hosted zone for your domain
maps `example.com` and
`www.example.com`. Instead of using IP
addresses, the alias records use the Amazon S3 website endpoints. Amazon Route 53 maintains a
mapping between the alias records and the IP addresses where the Amazon S3 buckets reside.
You create two alias records, one for your root domain and one for your
subdomain.

###### To add an alias record for your root domain ( `example.com`)

01. Open the Route 53 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

    ###### Note

    If you don't already use Route 53, see [Step 1: Register a domain](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/getting-started.md#getting-started-find-domain-name) in the
    _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_. After completing your
    setup, you can resume the instructions.

02. Choose **Hosted zones**.

03. In the list of hosted zones, choose the name of the hosted zone that matches your domain name.

04. Choose **Create record**.

05. Choose **Switch to wizard**.

    ###### Note

    If you want to use quick create to create your alias records, see [Configuring Route 53 to route traffic to an S3\
    Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/RoutingToS3Bucket.html#routing-to-s3-bucket-configuring).

06. Choose **Simple routing**, and choose **Next**.

07. Choose **Define simple record**.

08. In **Record name**, accept the default value, which is the name of your
     hosted zone and your domain.

09. In **Value/Route traffic to**, choose **Alias to S3 website endpoint**.

10. Choose the Region.

11. Choose the S3 bucket.

    The bucket name should match the name that appears in the **Name** box.
     In the **Choose S3 bucket** list, the bucket name appears with the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the Region
     where the bucket was created, for example, `s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com (example.com)`.

    **Choose S3 bucket** lists a bucket if:

- You configured the bucket as a static website.

- The bucket name is the same as the name of the record that you're creating.

- The current AWS account created the bucket.

If your bucket does not appear in the **Choose S3 bucket** list, enter
the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the Region where the bucket was created,
for example, `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`.
For a complete list of Amazon S3 website endpoints, see [Amazon S3\
Website endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints). For more information about the alias
target, see [Value/route traffic to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-alias.html#rrsets-values-alias-alias-target) in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

12. In **Record type**, choose **A ‐ Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources**.

13. For **Evaluate target health**, choose **No**.

14. Choose **Define simple record**.

###### To add an alias record for your subdomain ( `www.example.com`)

1. Under **Configure records**, choose **Define simple record**.

2. In **Record name** for your subdomain, type `www`.

3. In **Value/Route traffic to**, choose **Alias to S3 website endpoint**.

4. Choose the Region.

5. Choose the S3 bucket, for example, `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
   								(www.example.com)`.

If your bucket does not appear in the **Choose S3 bucket** list, enter
    the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the Region where the bucket was created,
    for example, `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`.
    For a complete list of Amazon S3 website endpoints, see [Amazon S3\
    Website endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints). For more information about the alias
    target, see [Value/route traffic to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-alias.html#rrsets-values-alias-alias-target) in the
    _Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

6. In **Record type**, choose **A ‐ Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources**.

7. For **Evaluate target health**, choose **No**.

8. Choose **Define simple record**.

9. On the **Configure records** page, choose **Create records**.

###### Note

Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 servers within 60 seconds. When propagation is
done, you can route traffic to your Amazon S3 bucket by using the names of the alias
records that you created in this procedure.

###### To add an alias record for your root domain ( `example.com`)

The Route 53 console has been redesigned. In the Route 53 console you can temporarily use the old console. If you choose to work with the old Route 53 console, use the procedure below.

1. Open the Route 53 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53).

###### Note

If you don't already use Route 53, see [Step 1: Register a domain](../../../route53/latest/developerguide/getting-started.md#getting-started-find-domain-name) in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_. After completing your
setup, you can resume the instructions.

2. Choose **Hosted Zones**.

3. In the list of hosted zones, choose the name of the hosted zone that matches your domain name.

4. Choose **Create Record Set**.

5. Specify the following values:

**Name**

Accept the default value, which is the name of your hosted zone and your domain.

For the root domain, you don't need to enter any additional information in the
**Name** field.

**Type**

Choose **A – IPv4 address**.

**Alias**

Choose **Yes**.

**Alias Target**

In the **S3 website endpoints** section of the list, choose your bucket
name.

The bucket name should match the name that appears in the **Name**
box. In the **Alias Target** listing, the
bucket name is followed by the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the
Region where the bucket was created, for example
`example.com
   											(s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com)`.
**Alias Target** lists a bucket
if:

- You configured the bucket as a static website.

- The bucket name is the same as the name of the record that you're creating.

- The current AWS account created the bucket.

If your bucket does not appear in the **Alias Target** listing, enter
the Amazon S3 website endpoint for the Region where the bucket
was created, for example, `s3-website-us-west-2`.
For a complete list of Amazon S3 website endpoints, see [Amazon S3 Website endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints). For more information
about the alias target, see [Value/route traffic to](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-alias.html#rrsets-values-alias-alias-target) in the
_Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide_.

**Routing Policy**

Accept the default value of **Simple**.

**Evaluate Target Health**

###### To add an alias record for your subdomain ( `www.example.com`)

1. In the hosted zone for your root domain ( `example.com`), choose
    **Create Record Set**.

2. Specify the following values:

**Name**

For the subdomain, enter `www` in the box.

**Type**

Choose **A – IPv4 address**.

**Alias**

Choose **Yes**.

**Alias Target**

In the **S3 website endpoints** section of the list, choose the same
bucket name that appears in the **Name**
field—for example, `www.example.com
   											(s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com)`.

**Routing Policy**

Accept the default value of **Simple**.

**Evaluate Target Health**

3. Choose **Create**.

###### Note

Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 servers within 60 seconds. When propagation is
done, you can route traffic to your Amazon S3 bucket by using the names of the alias
records that you created in this procedure.

## Step 12: Test the website

Verify that the website and the redirect work correctly. In your browser, enter your URLs.
In this example, you can try the following URLs:

- **Domain** ( `http://example.com`) – Displays
the index document in the `example.com` bucket.

- **Subdomain** ( `http://www.example.com`) –
Redirects your request to `http://example.com`. You see the index
document in the `example.com` bucket.

If your website or redirect links don't work, you can try the following:

- **Clear cache** – Clear the cache of your web
browser.

- **Check name servers** – If your web page and redirect
links don't work after you've cleared your cache, you can compare the name
servers for your domain and the name servers for your hosted zone. If the name
servers don't match, you might need to update your domain name servers to match
those listed under your hosted zone. For more information, see [Adding or changing name servers and glue records for a\
domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-name-servers-glue-records.html).

After you've successfully tested your root domain and subdomain, you can set up an [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) distribution to improve the
performance of your website and provide logs that you can use to review website traffic.
For more information, see [Speeding up your website with Amazon CloudFront](website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.md).
