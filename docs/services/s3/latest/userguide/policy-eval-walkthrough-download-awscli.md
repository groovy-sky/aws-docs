# Setting up the tools for the walkthroughs

The introductory examples (see [Walkthroughs that use policies to manage access to your Amazon S3 resources](example-walkthroughs-managing-access.md)) use the AWS Management Console to create
resources and grant permissions. To test permissions, the examples use the command line
tools, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, so you don't need to write any code. To test
permissions, you must set up one of these tools.

###### To set up the AWS CLI

1. Download and configure the AWS CLI. For instructions, see the following topics
    in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_:

[Install or update to the\
    latest version of the AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.md)

[Get started with the\
    AWS Command Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/installing.md)

2. Set the default profile.

You store user credentials in the AWS CLI config file. Create a default profile in the
    config file using your AWS account credentials. For instructions on finding
    and editing your AWS CLI config file, see [Configuration and credential file\
    settings](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.md).

```nohighlight

[default]
aws_access_key_id = access key ID
aws_secret_access_key = secret access key
region = us-west-2
```

3. Verify the setup by entering the following command at the command prompt. Both these
    commands don't provide credentials explicitly, so the credentials of the default
    profile are used.

- Try the `help` command.

```

aws help
```

- To get a list of buckets on the configured account, use the `aws s3 ls`
command.

```

aws s3 ls
```

As you go through the walkthroughs, you will create users, and you will save user
credentials in the config files by creating profiles, as the following example shows.
These profiles have the names of `AccountAadmin` and
`AccountBadmin`.

```nohighlight

[profile AccountAadmin]
aws_access_key_id = User AccountAadmin access key ID
aws_secret_access_key = User AccountAadmin secret access key
region = us-west-2

[profile AccountBadmin]
aws_access_key_id = Account B access key ID
aws_secret_access_key = Account B secret access key
region = us-east-1
```

To run a command using these user credentials, you add the `--profile` parameter
specifying the profile name. The following AWS CLI command retrieves a listing of objects
in `examplebucket` and specifies the
`AccountBadmin` profile.

```nohighlight

aws s3 ls s3://examplebucket --profile AccountBadmin
```

Alternatively, you can configure one set of user credentials as the default profile by
changing the `AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE` environment variable from the command
prompt. After you've done this, whenever you perform AWS CLI commands without the
`--profile` parameter, the AWS CLI uses the profile you set in the
environment variable as the default profile.

```nohighlight

$ export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=AccountAadmin
```

###### To set up AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell

1. Download and configure the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. For instructions, go to [Installing the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](../../../powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-set-up.md#pstools-installing-download) in the
    _AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide_.

###### Note

To load the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell module, you must enable PowerShell
script execution. For more information, see [Enable Script Execution](../../../powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-set-up.md#enable-script-execution) in the
_AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide_.

2. For these walkthroughs, you specify AWS credentials per session using the
    `Set-AWSCredentials` command. The command saves the credentials
    to a persistent store ( `-StoreAs ` parameter).

```nohighlight

Set-AWSCredentials -AccessKey AccessKeyID -SecretKey SecretAccessKey -storeas string
```

3. Verify the setup.

- To retrieve a list of available commands that you can use for Amazon S3 operations, run the
`Get-Command` command.

```nohighlight

Get-Command -module awspowershell -noun s3* -StoredCredentials string
```

- To retrieve a list of objects in a bucket, run the `Get-S3Object`
command.

```nohighlight

Get-S3Object -BucketName bucketname -StoredCredentials string
```

For a list of commands, see [AWS Tools for PowerShell\
Cmdlet\
Reference](../../../powershell/latest/reference/index.md).
