# Verifying bucket ownership with bucket owner condition

Amazon S3 bucket owner condition ensures that the buckets you use in your S3 operations belong
to the AWS accounts that you expect.

Most S3 operations read from or write to specific S3 buckets. These operations include
uploading, copying, and downloading objects, retrieving or modifying bucket configurations,
and retrieving or modifying object configurations. When you perform these operations, you
specify the bucket that you want to use by including its name with the request. For example,
to retrieve an object from S3, you make a request that specifies the name of a bucket and
the object key to retrieve from that bucket.

Because Amazon S3 identifies buckets based on their names, an application that uses an
incorrect bucket name in a request could inadvertently perform operations against a
different bucket than expected. To help avoid unintentional bucket interactions in
situations like this, you can use _bucket owner condition_.
Bucket owner condition enables you to verify that the target bucket is owned by the expected
AWS account, providing an additional layer of assurance that your S3 operations are having
the effects you intend.

## When to use bucket owner condition

We recommend using bucket owner condition whenever you perform a supported S3
operation and know the account ID of the expected bucket owner. Bucket owner condition
is available for all S3 object operations and most S3 bucket operations. For a list of
S3 operations that don't support bucket owner condition, see [Restrictions and limitations](#bucket-owner-condition-restrictions-limitations).

To see the benefit of using bucket owner condition, consider the following scenario
involving AWS customer Bea:

1. Bea develops an application that uses Amazon S3. During development, Bea uses her
    testing-only AWS account to create a bucket named `bea-data-test`,
    and configures her application to make requests to
    `bea-data-test`.

2. Bea deploys her application, but forgets to reconfigure the application to use
    a bucket in her production AWS account.

3. In production, Bea's application makes requests to `bea-data-test`,
    which succeed. This results in production data being written to the bucket in
    Bea's test account.

Bea can help protect against situations like this by using bucket owner condition.
With bucket owner condition, Bea can include the AWS account ID of the expected bucket
owner in her requests. Amazon S3 then checks the account ID of the bucket owner before
processing each request. If the actual bucket owner doesn't match the expected bucket
owner, the request fails.

If Bea uses bucket owner condition, the scenario described earlier won't result in
Bea's application inadvertently writing to a test bucket. Instead, the requests that her
application makes at step 3 will fail with an `Access Denied` error message. By using bucket
owner condition, Bea helps eliminate the risk of accidentally interacting with buckets
in the wrong AWS account.

## Verifying a bucket owner

To use bucket owner condition, you include a parameter with your request that
specifies the expected bucket owner. Most S3 operations involve only a single bucket,
and require only this single parameter to use bucket owner condition. For
`CopyObject` operations, this first parameter specifies the expected
owner of the destination bucket, and you include a second parameter to specify the
expected owner of the source bucket.

When you make a request that includes a bucket owner condition parameter, S3 checks
the account ID of the bucket owner against the specified parameter before processing the
request. If the parameter matches the bucket owner's account ID, S3 processes the
request. If the parameter doesn't match the bucket owner's account ID, the request fails
with an `Access Denied` error message.

You can use bucket owner condition with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, and Amazon S3
REST APIs. When using bucket owner condition with the AWS CLI and Amazon S3 REST APIs, use the
following parameter names.

Access methodParameter for non-copy operationsCopy operation source parameterCopy operation destination parameterAWS CLI`--expected-bucket-owner``--expected-source-bucket-owner``--expected-bucket-owner`Amazon S3 REST APIs`x-amz-expected-bucket-owner` header`x-amz-source-expected-bucket-owner` header`x-amz-expected-bucket-owner` header

The parameter names that are required to use bucket owner condition with the AWS
SDKs vary depending on the language. To determine the required parameters, see the SDK
documentation for your desired language. You can find the SDK documentation at [Tools to Build on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/tools).

## Examples

The following examples show how you can implement bucket owner condition in Amazon S3 using
the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK for Java 2.x.

###### Example

**_Example: Upload an_**
**_object_**

The following example uploads an object to S3 bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`, using bucket owner condition to ensure that
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` is owned by AWS account
`111122223333`.

AWS CLI

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object \
                 --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key exampleobject --body example_file.txt \
                 --expected-bucket-owner 111122223333
```

AWS SDK for Java 2.x

```java

public void putObjectExample() {
    S3Client s3Client = S3Client.create();;
    PutObjectRequest request = PutObjectRequest.builder()
            .bucket("amzn-s3-demo-bucket1")
            .key("exampleobject")
            .expectedBucketOwner("111122223333")
            .build();
    Path path = Paths.get("example_file.txt");
    s3Client.putObject(request, path);
}
```

###### Example

**_Example: Copy an_**
**_object_**

The following example copies the object `object1` from S3 bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` to S3 bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket2`. It uses bucket owner condition to ensure
that the buckets are owned by the expected accounts according to the following
table.

BucketExpected owner`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1``111122223333``amzn-s3-demo-bucket2``444455556666`

AWS CLI

```nohighlight

aws s3api copy-object --copy-source amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/object1 \
                            --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket2 --key object1copy \
                            --expected-source-bucket-owner 111122223333 --expected-bucket-owner 444455556666
```

AWS SDK for Java 2.x

```java

public void copyObjectExample() {
        S3Client s3Client = S3Client.create();
        CopyObjectRequest request = CopyObjectRequest.builder()
                .copySource("amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/object1")
                .destinationBucket("amzn-s3-demo-bucket2")
                .destinationKey("object1copy")
                .expectedSourceBucketOwner("111122223333")
                .expectedBucketOwner("444455556666")
                .build();
        s3Client.copyObject(request);
    }
```

###### Example

**_Example: Retrieve a bucket_**
**_policy_**

The following example retrieves the access policy for S3 bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`, using bucket owner condition to ensure that
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` is owned by AWS account
`111122223333`.

AWS CLI

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --expected-bucket-owner 111122223333
```

AWS SDK for Java 2.x

```java

public void getBucketPolicyExample() {
    S3Client s3Client = S3Client.create();
    GetBucketPolicyRequest request = GetBucketPolicyRequest.builder()
            .bucket("amzn-s3-demo-bucket1")
            .expectedBucketOwner("111122223333")
            .build();
    try {
        GetBucketPolicyResponse response = s3Client.getBucketPolicy(request);
    }
    catch (S3Exception e) {
        // The call was transmitted successfully, but Amazon S3 couldn't process
        // it, so it returned an error response.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

## Restrictions and limitations

Amazon S3 bucket owner condition has the following restrictions and limitations:

- The value of the bucket owner condition parameter must be an AWS account ID
(12-digit numeric value). Service principals aren't supported.

- Bucket owner condition isn't available for [CreateBucket](../api/api-createbucket.md), [ListBuckets](../api/api-listbuckets.md), or any of the operations included in [AWS S3\
Control](../api/api-operations-aws-s3-control.md). Amazon S3 ignores any bucket owner condition parameters included
with requests to these operations.

- Bucket owner condition only verifies that the account specified in the
verification parameter owns the bucket. Bucket owner condition doesn't check the
configuration of the bucket. It also doesn't guarantee that the bucket's
configuration meets any specific conditions or matches any past state.
