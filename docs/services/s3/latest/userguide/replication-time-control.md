# Meeting compliance requirements with S3 Replication Time Control

S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) helps you meet compliance or business requirements for data replication and
provides visibility into Amazon S3 replication times. S3 RTC replicates most objects that you
upload to Amazon S3 in seconds, and 99.9 percent of those objects within 15 minutes.

By default, S3 RTC includes two ways to track the progress of replication:

- **S3 Replication metrics** – You can use
S3 Replication metrics to monitor the total number of S3 API operations that are pending
replication, the total size of objects pending replication, the maximum replication
time to the destination Region, and the total number of operations that failed
replication. You can then monitor each dataset that you replicate separately. You
can also enable S3 Replication metrics independently of S3 RTC. For more information,
see [Using S3 Replication metrics](repl-metrics.md).

Replication rules with S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) enabled publish S3 Replication metrics. Replication
metrics are available within 15 minutes of enabling S3 RTC. Replication metrics
are available through the Amazon S3 console, the Amazon S3 API, the AWS SDKs, the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and Amazon CloudWatch. For more information about CloudWatch metrics, see [Monitoring metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](cloudwatch-monitoring.md). For
more information about viewing replication metrics through the Amazon S3 console, see
[Viewing replication metrics](repl-metrics.md#viewing-replication-metrics).

S3 Replication metrics are billed at the same rate as Amazon CloudWatch custom metrics. For
information, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

- **Amazon S3 Event Notifications** – S3 RTC
provides `OperationMissedThreshold` and
`OperationReplicatedAfterThreshold` events that notify the bucket
owner if object replication exceeds or occurs after the 15-minute threshold. With
S3 RTC, Amazon S3 Event Notifications can notify you in the rare instance when objects
don't replicate within 15 minutes and when those objects replicate after the
15-minute threshold.

Replication events are available within 15 minutes of enabling S3 RTC. Amazon S3 Event
Notifications are available through Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, or AWS Lambda. For more
information, see [Receiving replication failure events with Amazon S3 Event Notifications](replication-metrics-events.md).

## Best practices and guidelines for S3 RTC

When replicating data in Amazon S3 with S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) enabled, follow these best practice
guidelines to optimize replication performance for your workloads.

###### Topics

- [Amazon S3 Replication and request rate performance guidelines](#rtc-request-rate-performance)

- [Estimating your replication request rates](#estimating-replication-request-rates)

- [Exceeding S3 RTC data transfer rate quotas](#exceed-rtc-data-transfer-limits)

- [AWS KMS encrypted object replication request rates](#kms-object-replication-request-rates)

### Amazon S3 Replication and request rate performance guidelines

When uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3, your applications can achieve
thousands of transactions per second in request performance. For example, an
application can achieve at least 3,500
`PUT`/ `COPY`/ `POST`/ `DELETE` or
5,500 `GET`/ `HEAD` requests per second per prefix in an S3
bucket, including the requests that S3 Replication makes on your behalf. There are
no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write
performance by parallelizing reads. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an S3
bucket to parallelize reads, you can scale your read performance to 55,000 read
requests per second.

Amazon S3 automatically scales in response to sustained request rates above these
guidelines, or sustained request rates concurrent with `LIST` requests.
While Amazon S3 is internally optimizing for the new request rate, you might receive HTTP
503 request responses temporarily until the optimization is complete. This behavior
might occur with increases in request per second rates, or when you first enable
S3 RTC. During these periods, your replication latency might increase. The
S3 RTC service level agreement (SLA) doesn’t apply to time periods when Amazon S3
performance guidelines on requests per second are exceeded.

The S3 RTC SLA also doesn't apply during time periods where your replication
data transfer rate exceeds the default 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) quota. If you
expect your replication transfer rate to exceed 1 Gbps, you can contact
[AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) or use [Service\
Quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md) to request an increase in your replication transfer rate quota.

### Estimating your replication request rates

Your total request rate including the requests that Amazon S3 replication makes on your
behalf must be within the Amazon S3 request rate guidelines for both the replication
source and destination buckets. For each object replicated, Amazon S3 replication makes
up to five `GET`/ `HEAD` requests and one `PUT`
request to the source bucket, and one `PUT` request to each destination
bucket.

For example, if you expect to replicate 100 objects per second, Amazon S3 replication
might perform an additional 100 `PUT` requests on your behalf for a total
of 200 `PUT` requests per second to the source S3 bucket. Amazon S3
replication also might perform up to 500 `GET`/ `HEAD` requests
(5 `GET`/ `HEAD` requests for each object that's replicated.)

###### Note

You incur costs for only one `PUT` request per object replicated.
For more information, see the pricing information in the [Amazon S3 FAQs about\
replication](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs).

### Exceeding S3 RTC data transfer rate quotas

If you expect your S3 RTC data transfer rate to exceed the default 1 Gbps quota,
contact [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) or use [Service\
Quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md) to request an increase in your replication transfer rate quota.

### AWS KMS encrypted object replication request rates

When you replicate objects that are encrypted with server-side encryption with
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), AWS KMS requests per second quotas apply. AWS KMS
might reject an otherwise valid request because your request rate exceeds the quota
for the number of requests per second. When a request is throttled, AWS KMS returns a
`ThrottlingException` error. The AWS KMS request rate quota applies to
requests that you make directly and to requests made by Amazon S3 replication on your
behalf.

For example, if you expect to replicate 1,000 objects per second, you can subtract
2,000 requests from your AWS KMS request rate quota. The resulting request rate per
second is available for your AWS KMS workloads excluding replication. You can use
[AWS KMS request metrics in\
Amazon CloudWatch](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.md) to monitor the total AWS KMS request rate on your
AWS account.

To request an increase to your AWS KMS requests per second quota, contact
[AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home) or use [Service\
Quotas](../../../../general/latest/gr/aws-service-limits.md).

## Enabling S3 Replication Time Control

You can start using S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) with a new or existing replication rule. You can choose
to apply your replication rule to an entire bucket, or to objects with a specific prefix or
tag. When you enable S3 RTC, S3 Replication metrics are also enabled on your replication rule.

You can configure S3 RTC by using the Amazon S3 console, the Amazon S3 API, the AWS SDKs,
and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

###### Topics

For step-by-step instructions, see [Configuring replication for buckets in the same account](replication-walkthrough1.md). This topic provides instructions for
enabling S3 RTC in your replication configuration when the source and destination
buckets are owned by the same and different AWS accounts.

To use the AWS CLI to replicate objects with S3 RTC enabled, you create buckets,
enable versioning on the buckets, create an IAM role that gives Amazon S3 permission to
replicate objects, and add the replication configuration to the source bucket. The
replication configuration must have S3 RTC enabled, as shown in the following
example.

For step-by-step instructions for setting up your replication configuration by
using the AWS CLI, see [Configuring replication for buckets in the same account](replication-walkthrough1.md).

The following example replication configuration enables and sets the
`ReplicationTime` and `EventThreshold` values for a
replication rule. Enabling and setting these values enables S3 RTC on the
rule.

```json

{
    "Rules": [
        {
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Filter": {
                "Prefix": "Tax"
            },
            "DeleteMarkerReplication": {
                "Status": "Disabled"
            },
            "Destination": {
                "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket",
                "Metrics": {
                    "Status": "Enabled",
                    "EventThreshold": {
                        "Minutes": 15
                    }
                },
                "ReplicationTime": {
                    "Status": "Enabled",
                    "Time": {
                        "Minutes": 15
                    }
                }
            },
            "Priority": 1
        }
    ],
    "Role": "IAM-Role-ARN"
}
```

###### Important

`Metrics:EventThreshold:Minutes` and
`ReplicationTime:Time:Minutes` can only have
`15` as a valid value.
