# Deleting Amazon S3 log files

An Amazon S3 bucket with server access logging enabled can accumulate many server log objects
over time. Your application might need these access logs for a specific period after they are
created, and after that, you might want to delete them. You can use Amazon S3 Lifecycle
configuration to set rules so that Amazon S3 automatically queues these objects for deletion at the
end of their life.

You can define a lifecycle configuration for a subset of objects in your S3 bucket by
using a shared prefix. If you specified a prefix in your server access logging configuration,
you can set a lifecycle configuration rule to delete log objects that have that prefix.

For example, suppose that your log objects have the prefix `logs/`. You can set
a lifecycle configuration rule to delete all objects in the bucket that have the prefix
`logs/` after a specified period of time.

For more information about lifecycle configuration, see [Managing the lifecycle of objects](object-lifecycle-mgmt.md).

For general information about server access logging, see [Logging requests with server access logging](serverlogs.md).
