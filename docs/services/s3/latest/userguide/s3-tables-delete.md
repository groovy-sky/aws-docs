# Deleting an Amazon S3 table

You can delete a table by using the Amazon S3 REST API, AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or by using
integrated query engines.

###### Note

S3 Tables doesn't support the `DROP TABLE` operation with `purge=false`. Some
versions of Apache Spark always set this flag to `false` even when running
`DROP TABLE PURGE` commands. To delete a table, you can retry `DROP TABLE` with
`purge=true`, or use the S3 Tables [DeleteTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_s3TableBuckets_DeleteTable.html) REST
API operation.

###### Important

When you delete a table, you need to know the following:

- Deleting a table is permanent and cannot be undone. Before deleting a table, make sure that you have
backed up or replicated any important data.

- All data and configurations associated with the table are permanently removed.

This example shows how to delete a table by using the AWS CLI. To use this command, replace
the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables delete-table \
    --table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket \
    --namespace example_namespace --name example_table
```

You can delete a table in an Apache Spark session connected to your
Amazon S3 table buckets.

This example shows how to delete a table by using the `DROP TABLE PURGE` command.
To use the command, replace the `user input placeholders` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

spark.sql(
" DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] s3tablesbucket.example_namespace.example_table PURGE")
```
