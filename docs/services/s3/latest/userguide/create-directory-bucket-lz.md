# Creating a directory bucket in a Local Zone

In Dedicated Local Zones, you can create directory buckets to store and retrieve objects in a specific
data perimeter to help meet your data residency and data isolation use cases. S3
directory buckets are the only supported bucket type in Local Zones, and contain a bucket
location type called `LocalZone`. A directory bucket name consists of a base
name that you provide and a suffix that contains the Zone ID of your bucket location and
`--x-s3`. You can obtain a list of Local Zone IDs by using the [DescribeAvailabilityZones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.html) API operation.
For more information, see [Directory bucket naming rules](directory-bucket-naming-rules.md).

###### Note

- For all the services in AWS Dedicated Local Zones (Dedicated Local Zones), including S3, your administrator
must enable your AWS account before you can create or access any resource in
the Dedicated Local Zone. For more information, see [Enable accounts for Local Zones](opt-in-directory-bucket-lz.md).

- For the data residency requirements, we recommend enabling access to your
buckets only from gateway VPC endpoints. For more information, see [Private connectivity from your VPC](connectivity-lz-directory-buckets.md).

- To restrict access to only within the Local Zone network border groups, you can use
the condition key `s3express:AllAccessRestrictedToLocalZoneGroup` in
your IAM policies. For more information, see [Authenticating and authorizing for directory buckets in Local Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/iam-directory-bucket-LZ.html).

The following describes ways to create a directory bucket in a single Local Zone with the
AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the
     currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the parent Region of a Local Zone
     in which you want to create a directory bucket.

    ###### Note

    For more information about the parent Regions, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md).

03. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.

04. Choose **Create bucket**.

    The **Create bucket** page opens.

05. Under **General configuration**, view the AWS Region
     where your bucket will be created.

06. Under **Bucket type**, choose
     **Directory**.

    ###### Note

- If you've chosen a Region that doesn't support directory
buckets, the bucket type defaults to a general purpose bucket. To
create a directory bucket, you must choose a supported Region.
For a list of Regions that support directory buckets, see [Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-Regions-and-Zones.html).

- After you create the bucket, you can't change the bucket
type.

07. Under **Bucket location**, choose a Local Zone that you want to
     use.

    ###### Note

    The Local Zone can't be changed after the bucket is created.

08. Under **Bucket location**, select the checkbox to
     acknowledge that in the event of a Local Zone outage, your data might be
     unavailable or lost.

    ###### Important

    Although directory buckets are stored across multiple devices within
    a single Local Zone, directory buckets don't store data redundantly across
    Local Zones.

09. For **Bucket name**, enter a name for your
     directory bucket.

    For more information about the naming rules for directory buckets, see
     [General purpose bucket naming rules](bucketnamingrules.md). A
     suffix is automatically added to the base name that you provide when you
     create a directory bucket using the console. This suffix includes the Zone
     ID of the Local Zone that you chose.

    After you create the bucket, you can't change its name.

    ###### Important

    Don't include sensitive information, such as account numbers, in the
    bucket name. The bucket name is visible in the URLs that point to the
    objects in the bucket.

10. Under **Object Ownership**, the **Bucket owner**
    **enforced** setting is automatically enabled, and all access
     control lists (ACLs) are disabled. For directory buckets, ACLs are disabled
     and can't be enabled.

    With the **Bucket owner enforced** setting enabled, the
     bucket owner automatically owns and has full control over every object in
     the bucket. ACLs no longer affect access permissions to data in the S3
     bucket. The bucket uses policies exclusively to define access control. A
     majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs. For
     more information, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](about-object-ownership.md).

11. Under **Block Public Access settings for this bucket**,
     all Block Public Access settings for your directory bucket are automatically
     enabled. These settings can't be modified for directory buckets. For more
     information about blocking public access, see [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](access-control-block-public-access.md).

12. Under **Default encryption**, directory buckets use
     **Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys**
    **(SSE-S3)** to encrypt data by default. You also have the option
     to encrypt data in directory buckets with **Server-side encryption**
    **with AWS Key Management Service keys (SSE-KMS)**.

13. Choose **Create bucket**.

    After creating the bucket, you can add files and folders to the bucket.
     For more information, see [Working with objects in a directory bucket](directory-buckets-objects.md).

This example shows how to create a directory bucket in a Local Zone by using the
AWS CLI. To use the command, replace the `user input
                    placeholders` with your own information.

When you create a directory bucket, you must provide configuration details and
use the following naming convention: `bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3`.

```nohighlight

aws s3api create-bucket
--bucket bucket-base-name--zone-id--x-s3
--create-bucket-configuration 'Location={Type=LocalZone,Name=local-zone-id},Bucket={DataRedundancy=SingleLocalZone,Type=Directory}'
--region parent-region-code
```

For more information about Local Zone ID and Parent Region Code, see [Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones](s3-lzs-for-directory-buckets.md). For more information about the
AWS CLI command, see [create-bucket](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.
