# Deleting a general purpose bucket

You can delete an empty Amazon S3 general purpose bucket. For information about emptying a general purpose bucket, see [Emptying a general purpose bucket](empty-bucket.md).

You can delete a bucket by using the Amazon S3 console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS SDKs,
or the Amazon S3 REST API.

###### Important

Before deleting a general purpose bucket, consider the following:

- **If a bucket is deleted, it can't be restored by AWS.** Before
deleting a bucket, make sure that you have backed up or replicated your data.

- General purpose buckets names are unique within a global namespace. **If you delete a bucket in the shared global namespace, be aware that another AWS account can use the same general purpose bucket**
**name for a new bucket and can therefore potentially receive requests intended for the deleted**
**bucket.** If you want to prevent this, or if you want to continue to use the same bucket
name, don't delete the bucket. We recommend that you empty the bucket and keep it, and instead,
block any bucket requests as needed. For buckets no longer in active use, we recommend emptying the
bucket of all objects to minimize costs while retaining the bucket itself.

- We recommend creating buckets in your account regional namespace for assurance that only your account can ever own these bucket names. For more information, see [Namespaces for general purpose buckets](gpbucketnamespaces.md).

- When you delete a general purpose bucket, the bucket might not be instantly removed. Instead, Amazon S3 queues the
bucket for deletion. Because Amazon S3 is distributed across AWS Regions, the deletion process takes
time to fully propagate and achieve consistency throughout the system.

- If the bucket hosts a static website, and you created and configured an Amazon Route 53 hosted
zone as described in [Tutorial: Configuring a static website using a custom domain registered with Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html), you must clean up the Route 53
hosted zone settings that are related to the bucket. For more information, see [Step 2: Delete the Route 53 hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/getting-started-cleanup.html#getting-started-cleanup-route53).

- If the bucket receives log data from Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), we recommend that you
stop the delivery of ELB logs to the bucket before deleting it. After you delete
the bucket, if another user creates a bucket using the same name, your log data
could potentially be delivered to that bucket. For information about ELB access
logs, see [Access logs for\
your Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/access-log-collection.html) in the _User Guide for Classic Load Balancers_ and [Access logs for your\
Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html) in the _User Guide for Application Load Balancers_.

###### Troubleshooting

If you are unable to delete an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket, consider the following:

- **Make sure that the bucket is empty** – You
can delete buckets only if they don't have any objects in them. Make sure that the
bucket is empty. For information about emptying a bucket, see [Emptying a general purpose bucket](empty-bucket.md).

- **Make sure that there aren't any access points**
**attached** – You can delete buckets only if they don't have any
S3 Access Points or Multi-Region Access Points attached within the same account. Before deleting the
bucket, delete any same-account access points that are attached to the
bucket.

- **Make sure that you have the `s3:DeleteBucket`**
**permission** – If you can't delete a bucket, work with your IAM administrator to
confirm that you have the `s3:DeleteBucket` permission. For information about how to view
or update IAM permissions, see [Changing permissions for an\
IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. For troubleshooting information,
see [Troubleshoot access denied (403 Forbidden) errors in Amazon S3](troubleshoot-403-errors.md).

- **Check for `s3:DeleteBucket Deny` statements in AWS Organizations**
**service control policies (SCPs) and resource control policies (RCPs)** – SCPs and
RCPs can deny the delete permission on a bucket. For more information, see [service control\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) and [resource control\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html) in the _AWS Organizations User Guide_.

- **Check for `s3:DeleteBucket Deny` statements in your bucket**
**policy** – If you have `s3:DeleteBucket` permissions in your IAM user
or role policy and you can't delete a bucket, the bucket policy might include a `Deny`
statement for `s3:DeleteBucket`. Buckets created by AWS Elastic Beanstalk have a policy containing this
statement by default. Before you can delete the bucket, you must delete this statement or the bucket
policy.

###### Prerequisites

Before you can delete a general purpose bucket, you must empty it. For information about emptying a
bucket, see [Emptying a general purpose bucket](empty-bucket.md).

###### To delete an S3 bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

3. In the buckets list, select the option button next
    to the name of the bucket that you want to delete, and then choose
    **Delete** at the top of the page.

4. On the **Delete bucket** page, confirm that you want to delete the
    bucket by entering the bucket name in the text field, and then choose **Delete**
**bucket**.

###### Note

If the bucket contains any objects, empty the bucket before deleting it by choosing
the **Empty bucket** button in the **This bucket is not**
**empty** error alert and following the instructions on the **Empty**
**bucket** page. Then return to the **Delete bucket** page and
delete the bucket.

5. To verify that you've deleted the bucket, open the **General purpose**
**buckets** list and enter the name of the bucket that you deleted. If the bucket
    can't be found, your deletion was successful.

To empty and delete a general purpose bucket using the AWS SDK for Java, you must first delete all objects in the general purpose bucket, and then delete the bucket.

For examples in other languages, see [Use DeleteBucket with\
an AWS SDK or CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_DeleteBucket_section.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_. For information
about using other AWS SDKs, see [Tools for Amazon Web\
Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools).

Java

To delete a bucket that contains objects using the AWS SDK for Java, you must delete all objects first, and then delete the bucket. This approach works for buckets with or without versioning enabled.

###### Note

For buckets without versioning enabled, you can delete all objects
directly and then delete the bucket. For buckets with versioning enabled,
you must delete all object versions before deleting the bucket.

For examples of how to delete a bucket with the AWS SDK for Java, see [Delete a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_DeleteBucket_section.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

You can delete a general purpose bucket that contains objects with the AWS CLI if the bucket doesn't
have versioning enabled. When you delete a bucket that contains objects, all the
objects in the bucket are permanently deleted, including objects that have been
transitioned to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class.

If your bucket doesn't have versioning enabled, you can use the `rb` (remove
bucket) AWS CLI command with the `--force` parameter to delete the bucket and all the objects
in it. This command deletes all the objects first and then deletes the bucket.

If versioning is enabled, using the `rb` command with the
`--force` parameter doesn't delete versioned objects, so the bucket
deletion fails because the bucket isn't empty. For more information about deleting
versioned objects, see [Deleting object\
versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DeletingObjectVersions.html).

To use the following command, replace `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the name of the
bucket that you want to delete:

```nohighlight

$ aws s3 rb s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket --force
```

For more information, see [Using\
High-Level S3 Commands with the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/using-s3-commands.html) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.
