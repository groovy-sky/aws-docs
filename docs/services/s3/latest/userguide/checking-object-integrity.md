# Checking object integrity in Amazon S3

Amazon S3 provides a range of data protection capabilities throughout an object's storage
lifecycle. With Amazon S3, you can use checksum values to verify the integrity of the data that
you upload or download. In addition, you can request that another checksum value be
calculated for any object that you store in S3.

When uploading, copying, or managing your data, you can choose from several supported
checksum algorithms:

- CRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`)

###### Note

The `CRC64NVME` checksum algorithm is the default checksum
algorithm used for checksum calculations.

- CRC-32 ( `CRC32`)

- CRC-32C ( `CRC32C`)

- SHA-1 ( `SHA1`)

- SHA-256 ( `SHA256`)

- MD5 ( `MD5`)

###### Note

For multipart uploads, the Compute checksum operation provides full object
checksum values using `MD5`, which isn’t possible during uploads. For single part
uploads, the `content-MD5 header` is only available using the S3 ETag for objects
and must use SSE-S3 encryption.

When you upload an object to S3, you can specify the usage of any of these checksum
algorithms. For uploads, all AWS-owned clients calculate a checksum of the object and send
it with the upload request. S3 then independently calculates a checksum value of the object
on the server-side, and validates it with the provided value before storing the object and
checksum value. You can also provide precalculated
values for these checksum algorithms when you a perform a single part upload or multipart upload (using the full
object checksum type for multipart uploads). To use precalculated values with multiple objects, use the AWS CLI or
AWS SDKs.

Alternatively, if you want to verify datasets in S3 without the need to restore or
download data, you can use the **Compute checksum** operation with
S3 Batch Operations. The **Compute checksum** operation allows you to
efficiently verify billions of objects in one job request. When the
**Compute checksum** operation is performed, S3 calculates the
checksum values for a list of objects, at rest. At the end of the job request, you’ll
receive an automatically generated integrity report (also known as a completion report) that
you can use to confirm that your data set remains intact.
