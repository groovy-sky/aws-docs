# Viewing the properties for an S3 general purpose bucket

You can view properties for any Amazon S3 bucket you own. These settings include the following:

- **Bucket Versioning** – Keep multiple versions of an object
in one general purpose bucket by using versioning. By default, versioning is disabled for a new bucket.
For information about enabling versioning, see [Enabling versioning on buckets](manage-versioning-examples.md).

- **Tags** – An AWS tag is a key-value pair that holds metadata. You attach the tags to your Amazon S3 resources, such as buckets. You can tag resources when you create them or manage tags on existing resources. You can use tags for cost allocation to track storage costs by bucket tag in AWS Billing and Cost Management. You can also use tags for attribute-based access control (ABAC), to scale access permissions and grant access to S3 resources based on their tags. For more information, see [Using tags with S3 general purpose buckets](buckets-tagging.md).

- **Default encryption** – Enabling default encryption provides
you with automatic server-side encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts an object before saving it to a
disk and decrypts the object when you download it. For more information, see [Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets](bucket-encryption.md).

- **Server access logging** – Get detailed records for the
requests that are made to your general purpose bucket with server access logging. By default, Amazon S3
doesn't collect server access logs. For information about enabling server access
logging, see [Enabling Amazon S3 server access logging](enable-server-access-logging.md).

- **AWS CloudTrail data events** – Use CloudTrail to log data events. By
default, trails don't log data events. Additional charges apply for data events. For
more information, see [Logging\
Data Events for Trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) in the _AWS CloudTrail User Guide_.

- **Event notifications** – Enable certain Amazon S3 general purpose bucket events to
send notification messages to a destination whenever the events occur. For more information,
see [Enabling and configuring event notifications using the Amazon S3 console](enable-event-notifications.md).

- **Transfer acceleration** – Enable fast, easy, and secure
transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. For
information about enabling transfer acceleration, see [Enabling and using S3 Transfer Acceleration](transfer-acceleration-examples.md).

- **Object Lock** – Use S3 Object Lock to prevent an object
from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. For more
information, see [Locking objects with Object Lock](object-lock.md).

- **Requester Pays** – Enable Requester Pays if you want the
requester (instead of the general purpose bucket owner) to pay for requests and data transfers. For more
information, see [Using Requester Pays general purpose buckets for storage transfers and usage](requesterpaysbuckets.md).

- **Static website hosting** – You can host a static website on
Amazon S3. For more information, see [Hosting a static website using Amazon S3](websitehosting.md).

You can view bucket properties using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

3. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to
    view the properties for.

4. Choose the **Properties** tab.

5. On the **Properties** page, you can configure the above properties
    for the bucket.

###### View bucket properties with the AWS CLI

The following commands show how you can use the AWS CLI to list different general purpose bucket
properties.

The following returns the tag set associated with the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. For more
information about bucket tags see, [Using cost allocation S3 bucket tags](costalloctagging.md).

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-tagging --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1
```

For more information and examples, see [get-bucket-tagging](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-tagging.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

The following returns the versioning state of the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. For
information about the bucket versioning, see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md).

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1
```

For more information and examples, see [get-bucket-versioning](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-versioning.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

The following returns the default encryption configuration for the bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that
uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). For information about the
bucket default encryption, see [Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets](bucket-encryption.md).

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1
```

For more information and examples, see [get-bucket-encryption](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-encryption.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

The following returns the notification configuration of the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.
For information about the bucket event notifications, see [Amazon S3 Event Notifications](eventnotifications.md).

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-notification-configuration --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1
```

For more information and examples, see [get-bucket-notification-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-notification-configuration.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

The following returns the logging status for the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. For
information about the bucket logging, see [Logging requests with server access logging](serverlogs.md).

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-logging --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1
```

For more information and examples, see [get-bucket-logging](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-logging.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

For examples of how to return general purpose bucket properties with the AWS SDKs, such as versioning,
tags, and more, see [Code examples](../api/s3-example-s3-listbuckets-section.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

For general information about using different AWS SDKs, see [Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDKs](../../../../reference/amazons3/latest/api/sdk-general-information-section.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.
