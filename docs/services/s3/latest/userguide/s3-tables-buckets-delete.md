# Deleting a table bucket

You can use the Amazon S3 APIs, AWS Command Line Interface, or AWS SDKs to delete a table bucket. Before you
delete a table bucket, you must first delete all namespaces and tables within the bucket.

###### Important

When you delete a table bucket, you need to know the following:

- Bucket deletion is permanent and can't be undone.

- All data and configurations associated with the bucket are permanently lost.

This example shows how to delete a table bucket by using the AWS CLI. To use this
example, replace the `user input placeholders` with your
own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables delete-table-bucket \
    --region us-east-2 \
    --table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket1
```
