# Access management for S3 Tables

In S3 Tables resources include table buckets and the tables that they contain. The root
user of the AWS account that created the resource (the resource owner) and AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) users within that account that have the necessary permissions can access a resource
that they created. The resource owner specifies who else can access the resource and the
actions that they are allowed to perform on the resource. Amazon S3 has various access management
tools that you can use to grant others access to your S3 resources. If you've integrated your tables with AWS Lake Formation, then you can also manage fine-grained access to your tables and namespaces.
The following topics
provide you with an overview of resources, IAM actions, and condition keys for S3 Tables.
They also provide examples for both resource-based and identity-based policies for
S3 Tables.

## Resources

S3 Tables resources include table buckets and the tables that they contain.

- Table buckets – Table buckets are specifically designed for tables and provider higher
transactions per seconds (TPS) and better query throughput compared to
self-managed tables in general purpose S3 buckets. Table buckets deliver the
same durability, availability, scalability, and performance characteristics as
Amazon S3 general purpose buckets.

- Tables – Tables in your table buckets are stored in Apache Iceberg format. You can
query these tables using standard SQL in query engines that support
Iceberg.

Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for tables and table buckets contain the
`s3tables` namespace, the AWS Region, the AWS account ID, and the
bucket name. To access and perform actions on your tables and table buckets, you must
use the following ARN formats:

- Table ARN format:

`arn:aws:s3tables:us-west-2:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket/table/demo-tableID`

## Actions for S3 Tables

In an identity-based policy or resource-based policy, you define which S3 Tables
actions are allowed or denied for specific IAM principals. Tables actions correspond
to bucket and table-level API operations. All actions are
part of a unique IAM namespace: `s3tables`.

When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API
operation with the same name. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to
more than one API operation. For example, the `s3tables:GetTableData` actions includes permissions for
the `GetObject`, `ListParts`, and `ListMultiparts` API
operations.

The following are supported actions for table buckets. You can specify the following
actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy or resource policy.

ActionDescriptionAccess levelCross-account access`s3tables:CreateTableBucket`Grants permissions to create a table bucket`Write`No`s3tables:GetTableBucket`Grants permission to retrieve a table bucket ARN, table bucket name,

The following actions are supported for tables:

To perform table-level read and write actions, S3 Tables supports Amazon S3 API
operations such as `GetObject` and `PutObject`. The following
table provides a list of object-level actions. When
granting read and write permissions to your tables, you use the following actions.

ActionS3 object APIs`s3tables:GetTableData``GetObject` `, ListParts`,
`HeadObject``s3tables:PutTableData``PutObject`, `CreateMultipartUpload`,
`CompleteMultipartUpload`, ` UploadPart`,
`AbortMultipartUpload`

For example, if a user has `GetTableData` permissions, then they can read
all the files associated with the table, such as its metadata file, manifest, manifest
list files, and parquet data files.

## Condition keys for S3 Tables

S3 Tables supports [AWS global\
condition context keys](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-condition-keys.md).

Additionally, S3 Tables defines the following condition keys that you can use in an
access policy.

Condition keyDescriptionType`
                            s3tables:tableName` Filters access by the name of the tables in the table bucket.

You can use the `s3tables:tableName` condition key
to write IAM, or table bucket policies that restrict user or
application access to only the tables that meet this name condition.

It's important to note that if you use the
`s3tables:tableName` condition key to control access
then changes in tables’ name could impact these policies.

**Example value:** `"s3tables:tableName":"department*"``String``
                            s3tables:namespace`

Filters access by the namespaces created in the table bucket.

You can use the `s3tables:namespace` condition key to write IAM,
table, or table bucket policies that restrict user or application access to tables that are part of a specific namespace. _Example value:_ `"s3tables:namespace":"hr" `

It's important to note that if you use the `s3tables:namespace`
condition key to control access, then changes in namespaces could impact these policies.

`String``
                            s3tables:SSEAlgorithm`

Filters access by the server-side encryption algorithm used to encrypt a table.

You can use the `s3tables:SSEAlgorithm` condition key to write IAM,
table, or table bucket policies that restrict user or application access to tables that are encrypted with a certain encryption type. _Example value:_ `"s3tables:SSEAlgorithm":"aws:kms" `

It's important to note that if you use the `s3tables:SSEAlgorithm`
condition key to control access, then changes in encryption could impact these policies.

`String``
                            s3tables:KMSKeyArn`

Filters access by the AWS KMS key ARN for the key used to encrypt a table

You can use the `s3tables:KMSKeyArn` condition key to write IAM,
table, or table bucket policies that restrict user or application access to tables that are encrypted with a specific KMS key.

It's important to note that if you use the `s3tables:KMSKeyArn`
condition key to control access, then changing your KMS key could impact these policies.
