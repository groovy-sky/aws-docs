# Amazon S3 Object Lambda availability change

After careful consideration, S3 Object Lambda as of November 7th, 2025 is available only to existing
customers that are currently using the service as well as to select AWS Partner Network
(APN) partners. Existing customers of S3 Object Lambda, as
well as customers using or deploying APN partner solutions, can continue to use the service
as usual. AWS will prioritize security and availability improvements for S3 Object Lambda,
but we do not plan to introduce new capabilities

There are several alternative services and designs that allow you to modify and process
data accessed from S3 to meet the needs of various client applications or users who are
accessing the data. Those alternatives include the AWS Solution Dynamic Image Transformation
for Amazon CloudFront, invoking AWS Lambda by other means (via CloudFront, API Gateway, or
function URLs), or processing data in the client application. All of these alternatives
continue to use Amazon S3 for the underlying storage, so no data migration is
necessary.

In this post, we discuss how to choose the best option for your use case.

**Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront**

This AWS solution enables real-time image processing through the global content delivery
network (CDN) of Amazon CloudFront using API Gateway and Lambda. It supports a variety of
transformations such as format changes, dimensions, fit methods, rotations, and filters. If
you are using S3 Object Lambda today for image transformation, this can be a good alternative. The
[solution overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront/solution-overview.html) has more details on capabilities and how to get started using
it. Be sure to modify the Enable S3 Object Lambda template parameter to "No" when deploying the solution
to your account.

For more information, see [Dynamic Image Transformation for Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/dynamic-image-transformation-for-amazon-cloudfront).

**Data processing in AWS Lambda**

You can continue to use AWS Lambda for your data processing, but invoke it directly or
through other AWS services. Your data processing logic can remain the same, but your Lambda
function will need to be updated based on how you choose to invoke it. This option is best
for use cases such as sensitive data redaction, format changes, or situations where the
application that invokes S3 Object Lambda relies on receiving processed data. This option also
minimizes the changes required if you choose to migrate off S3 Object Lambda.

If you are using an S3 Object Lambda access point as the origin of a CloudFront
distribution, you can create a new origin using either Lambda Function URLs or API Gateway.
[This blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-amazon-cloudfront-with-aws-lambda-as-origin-to-accelerate-your-web-applications) details how you can setup a Lambda Function URL to act as an origin for your
CloudFront distribution.

If you directly invoke S3 Object Lambda from your client code today, you can use Lambda
Function URLs to directly invoke your Lambda function or you can use API Gateway. If you're
not sure which is the best method for your use case, see [Select a method to invoke your\
Lambda function using an HTTP request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/apig-http-invoke-decision.html) in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_. After you have decided which method for invoking
Lambda is best for your use case and have setup your Lambda function accordingly, you will
also need to update your calling application to invoke your Lambda function rather than
calling S3 Object Lambda.

**Data processing in the client application**

You also have the option of moving your data processing logic from S3 Object Lambda into
your client application. This works best if you are using S3 Object Lambda as part of an
application that already performs further processing or analysis of the data returned by S3 Object Lambda. For example, if your S3 Object Lambda access point was responsible for
redirecting to particular objects or object versions, that redirect logic can be moved into
the calling application which would then directly access data in the S3 bucket.
