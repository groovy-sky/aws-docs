# Configuring a custom error document

After you configure your bucket as a static website, when an error occurs, Amazon S3
returns an HTML error document. You can optionally configure your bucket with a custom
error document so that Amazon S3 returns that document when an error occurs.

###### Note

Some browsers display their own error message when an error occurs, ignoring the
error document that Amazon S3 returns. For example, when an **`HTTP 404 Not**
**Found`** error occurs, Google Chrome might ignore the error document
that Amazon S3 returns and display its own error.

## Amazon S3 HTTP response codes

The following table lists the subset of HTTP response codes that Amazon S3 returns when
an error occurs.

HTTP error codeDescription**301 Moved Permanently**When a user sends a request directly to the Amazon S3 website endpoint
( `http://s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com/`),
Amazon S3 returns a **301 Moved Permanently** response
and redirects those requests to
`https://aws.amazon.com/s3/`.**302 Found**

When Amazon S3 receives a request for a key `x`,
`http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com/x`,
without a trailing slash, it first looks for the object with the
key name `x`. If the object is not found, Amazon S3
determines that the request is for subfolder `x` and
redirects the request by adding a slash at the end, and returns
**302 Found**.

**304 Not Modified**

Amazon S3 uses request headers `If-Modified-Since`,
`If-Unmodified-Since`, `If-Match`
and/or `If-None-Match` to determine whether the
requested object is same as the cached copy held by the client.
If the object is the same, the website endpoint returns a
**304 Not Modified** response.

**400 Malformed Request**

The website endpoint responds with a **400 Malformed**
**Request** when a user attempts to access a bucket
through the incorrect regional endpoint.

**403 Forbidden**

The website endpoint responds with a **403**
**Forbidden** when a user request translates to an
object that is not publicly readable. The object owner must make
the object publicly readable using a bucket policy or an ACL.

**404 Not Found**

The website endpoint responds with **404 Not**
**Found** for the following reasons:

- Amazon S3 determines that the URL of the website refers to
an object key that does not exist.

- Amazon S3 infers that the request is for an index document
that does not exist.

- A bucket specified in the URL does not exist.

- A bucket specified in the URL exists, but isn't
configured as a website.

You can create a custom document that is returned for
**404 Not Found**. Make sure that the
document is uploaded to the bucket configured as a website, and
that the website hosting configuration is set to use the
document.

For information on how Amazon S3 interprets the URL as a request
for an object or an index document, see [Configuring an index document](indexdocumentsupport.md).

**500 Service Error**

The website endpoint responds with a **500 Service**
**Error** when an internal server error
occurs.

**503 Service Unavailable**

The website endpoint responds with a **503 Service**
**Unavailable** when Amazon S3 determines that you need to
reduce your request rate.

For each of these errors, Amazon S3 returns a predefined HTML message. The following
is an example HTML message that is returned for a **403 Forbidden**
response.

## Configuring a custom error document

When you configure your bucket as a static website, you can provide a custom error
document that contains a user-friendly error message and additional help. Amazon S3
returns your custom error document for only the HTTP 4XX class of error codes.

To configure a custom error document using the S3 console, follow the steps below.
You can also configure an error document using the REST API, the AWS SDKs, the
AWS CLI, or CloudFormation. For more information, see the following:

- [PutBucketWebsite](../api/api-putbucketwebsite.md) in the
_Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_

- [AWS::S3::Bucket WebsiteConfiguration](../../../cloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-websiteconfiguration.md) in the _CloudFormation User Guide_

- [put-bucket-website](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/put-bucket-website.html) in the _AWS CLI Command_
_Reference_

When you enable static website hosting for your bucket, you enter the name of the error document (for example, `404.html`). After you enable static website hosting for the bucket, you upload an HTML file with this error document name to your bucket.

###### To configure an error document

1. Create an error document, for example `404.html`.

2. Save the error document file locally.

The error document name is case sensitive and must exactly match the name that
    you enter when you enable static website hosting. For example, if you enter
    `404.html` for the **Error document**
    name in the **Static website hosting** dialog box, your error
    document file name must also be `404.html`.

3. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

4. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

5. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to use to host a static website.

6. Enable static website hosting for your bucket, and enter the exact name of
    your error document (for example, `404.html`). For more
    information, see [Enabling website hosting](enablewebsitehosting.md) and [Configuring a custom error document](customerrordocsupport.md).

After enabling static website hosting, proceed to step 6.

7. To upload the error document to your bucket, do one of the following:

- Drag and drop the error document file into the console bucket listing.

- Choose **Upload**, and follow the prompts to choose and upload the index file.

For step-by-step instructions, see [Uploading objects](upload-objects.md).
