# Locating your inventory list

When an inventory list is published, the manifest files are published to the following
location in the destination bucket.

```nohighlight

destination-prefix/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/config-ID/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MMZ/manifest.json
 destination-prefix/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/config-ID/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MMZ/manifest.checksum
 destination-prefix/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/config-ID/hive/dt=YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM/symlink.txt
```

- `destination-prefix` is the object key name
prefix that is optionally specified in the inventory configuration. You can use this
prefix to group all the inventory list files in a common location within the destination
bucket.

- `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` is the source bucket that the
inventory list is for. The source bucket name is added to prevent collisions when multiple
inventory reports from different source buckets are sent to the same destination
bucket.

- `config-ID` is added to prevent collisions with
multiple inventory reports from the same source bucket that are sent to the same
destination bucket. The `config-ID` comes from the
inventory report configuration, and is the name for the report that is defined during
setup.

- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MMZ` is the timestamp that
consists of the start time and the date when the inventory report generation process
begins scanning the bucket; for example, `2016-11-06T21-32Z`.

- `manifest.json` is the manifest file.

- `manifest.checksum` is the MD5 hash of the content of the
`manifest.json` file.

- `symlink.txt` is the Apache Hive-compatible manifest
file.

The inventory lists are published daily or weekly to the following location in the
destination bucket.

```nohighlight

destination-prefix/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/config-ID/data/example-file-name.csv.gz
...
destination-prefix/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/config-ID/data/example-file-name-1.csv.gz
```

- `destination-prefix` is the object key name
prefix that is optionally specified in the inventory configuration. You can use this
prefix to group all the inventory list files in a common location in the destination
bucket.

- `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` is the source bucket that the
inventory list is for. The source bucket name is added to prevent collisions when multiple
inventory reports from different source buckets are sent to the same destination
bucket.

- `example-file-name` `.csv.gz`
is one of the CSV inventory files. ORC inventory names end with the file name extension
`.orc`, and Parquet inventory names end with the file
name extension `.parquet`.

## Inventory manifest

The manifest files `manifest.json` and
`symlink.txt` describe where the inventory files are located. Whenever
a new inventory list is delivered, it is accompanied by a new set of manifest files. These
files might overwrite each other. In versioning-enabled buckets, Amazon S3 creates new versions
of the manifest files.

Each manifest contained in the `manifest.json` file provides metadata
and other basic information about an inventory. This information includes the
following:

- The source bucket name

- The destination bucket name

- The version of the inventory

- The creation timestamp in the epoch date format that consists of the start time and
the date when the inventory report generation process begins scanning the bucket

- The format and schema of the inventory files

- A list of the inventory files that are in the destination bucket

Whenever a `manifest.json` file is written, it is accompanied by a
`manifest.checksum` file that is the MD5 hash of the content of the
`manifest.json` file.

The following examples show an inventory manifest in a
`manifest.json` file for CSV, ORC, and
Parquet-formatted inventories.

`manifest.json` file for a CSV-formatted inventory.

```json

{

    "destinationBucket": "arn:aws:s3:::example-inventory-destination-bucket",
    "version": "2016-11-30",
    "creationTimestamp" : "1514944800000",

    "files": [
        {
            "key": "Inventory/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/2016-11-06T21-32Z/files/939c6d46-85a9-4ba8-87bd-9db705a579ce.csv.gz",

        }
    ]
}
```

ORC

The following is an example of a manifest in a
`manifest.json` file for an ORC-formatted inventory.

```json

{
    "sourceBucket": "amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket",
    "destinationBucket": "arn:aws:s3:::example-destination-bucket",
    "version": "2016-11-30",

```json

{
    "sourceBucket": "amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket",
    "destinationBucket": "arn:aws:s3:::example-destination-bucket",
    "version": "2016-11-30",

    "files": [
        {
           "key": "inventory/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/data/d754c470-85bb-4255-9218-47023c8b4910.parquet",

        }
    ]
}
```

The `symlink.txt` file is an Apache Hive-compatible
manifest file that allows Hive to automatically discover inventory files
and their associated data files. The Hive-compatible manifest works with
the Hive-compatible services Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum. It also works with
Hive-compatible applications, including [Presto](https://prestodb.io/), [Apache\
Hive](https://hive.apache.org/), [Apache\
Spark](https://databricks.com/spark/about), and many others.

###### Important

The `symlink.txt`
Apache Hive-compatible manifest file does not currently work with
AWS Glue.

Reading the `symlink.txt` file with [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) and [Apache Spark](https://databricks.com/spark/about) is not
supported for ORC and Parquet-formatted inventory files.
