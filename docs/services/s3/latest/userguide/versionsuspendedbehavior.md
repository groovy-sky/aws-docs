# Working with objects in a versioning-suspended bucket

In Amazon S3, you can suspend versioning to stop accruing new versions of the same object in a
bucket. You might do this because you only want a single version of an object in a bucket.
Or, you might not want to accrue charges for multiple versions.

When you suspend versioning, existing objects in your bucket do not change. What changes is
how Amazon S3 handles objects in future requests. The topics in this section explain various
object operations in a versioning-suspended bucket, including adding, retrieving, and
deleting objects.

For more information about S3 Versioning, see [Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning](versioning.md). For more information about retrieving object
versions, see [Retrieving object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RetrievingObjectVersions.html).
