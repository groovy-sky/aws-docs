# Checking object integrity for data uploads in Amazon S3

Amazon S3 uses checksum values to verify data integrity during upload and download
operations. When you upload data, AWS SDK and the AWS Management Console use your chosen
checksum algorithm to compute a checksum value before data transmission. S3 then
independently calculates a checksum of your data and validates it against the provided
checksum value. Objects are accepted only after confirming data integrity was maintained
during transit. S3 stores both the checksum value as object metadata and the object
itself.

To verify object integrity, you can request the checksum value during downloads. This
validation works consistently across encryption modes, object sizes, storage classes, and
both single part and multipart uploads. To change the checksum algorithm for an upload, you
can copy an individual object or use batch copy for multiple objects.

For single part uploads, you can provide checksum values as headers. You can either
provide a pre-calculated value or let the AWS SDK calculate one during upload. If the checksum
value calculated by S3 matches your provided value, the request is accepted. If the
values don't match, the request is rejected.

For multipart uploads, AWS SDKs can automatically create trailing checksums for chunked
uploads. When you use a trailing checksum, Amazon S3 generates checksum values for every
part using your specified algorithm and appends the checksum value to the end of the chunked
upload request. S3 performs the verification and upload in a single pass, improving
efficiency. For more information, see see [Using trailing checksums](#trailing-checksums).

## Using supported checksum algorithms

With Amazon S3, you can choose a checksum algorithm to calculate the checksum values during
uploads. The specified checksum algorithm is then stored with your object and can be
used to validate data integrity during downloads. You can choose one of the following
Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA) or Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) checksum algorithms to
calculate the checksum value:

- CRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`)

- CRC-32 ( `CRC32`)

- CRC-32C ( `CRC32C`)

- SHA-1 ( `SHA1`)

- SHA-256 ( `SHA256`)

- MD5 ( `MD5`)

###### Note

The `content-MD5` header is only available using the S3 ETag
for objects uploaded in a single part upload ( `PUT` operation)
that uses the SSE-S3 encryption.

Additionally, you can provide a checksum with each request using the Content-MD5
header.

When you [upload an object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html), you
specify the algorithm that you want to use:

- **When you use the AWS Management Console**, choose the
checksum algorithm that you want to use. You can optionally specify the checksum
value of the object. When Amazon S3 receives the object, it calculates the checksum
by using the algorithm that you specified. If the two checksum values don't
match, Amazon S3 generates an error.

- **When you use an SDK**, be aware of the
following:

- Set the `ChecksumAlgorithm` parameter to the algorithm that
you want Amazon S3 to use. If you already have a precalculated checksum, you
pass the checksum value to the AWS SDK, and the SDK includes the value in
the request. If you don’t pass a checksum value or don’t specify a
checksum algorithm, the SDK automatically calculates a checksum value
for you and includes it with the request to provide integrity
protections. If the individual checksum value doesn't match the set
value of the checksum algorithm, Amazon S3 fails the request with a
`BadDigest` error.

- If you’re using an upgraded AWS SDK, the SDK chooses a checksum
algorithm for you. However, you can override this checksum
algorithm.

- If you don’t specify a checksum algorithm and the SDK also doesn’t
calculate a checksum for you, then S3 automatically chooses the
CRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`) checksum algorithm.

- **When you use the REST API**, don't use the
`x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm` parameter. Instead, use one of the
algorithm-specific headers (for example,
`x-amz-checksum-crc32`).

To apply any of these checksum values to objects that are already uploaded to Amazon S3,
you can copy the object and specify whether you want to use the existing checksum
algorithm or a new one. If you don’t specify an algorithm, S3 uses the existing
algorithm. If the source object doesn’t have a specified checksum algorithm or checksum
value, Amazon S3 uses the CRC-64/NVME algorithm to calculate the checksum value for the
destination object. You can also specify a checksum algorithm when copying objects using
[S3 Batch Operations](batch-ops.md).

###### Important

If you use a multipart upload with **Checksums** for composite (or
part-level) checksums, the multipart upload part numbers must be consecutive and begin with 1.
If you try to complete a multipart upload request with nonconsecutive part numbers, Amazon S3
generates an `HTTP 500 Internal Server` error.

## Full object and composite checksum types

In Amazon S3, there are two types of supported checksums:

- **Full object checksums:** A full object checksum
is calculated based on all of the content of a multipart upload, covering all data from the
first byte of the first part to the last byte of the last part. Be aware that if
you're using the AWS Management Console to upload objects that are smaller than 16 MB, only
the full object checksum type is supported.

###### Note

All PUT requests require a full object checksum type. You must specify a
full object checksum type if you're uploading your object via PUT
request.

- **Composite checksums:** A composite checksum is
calculated based on the individual checksums of each part in a multipart upload. Instead of
computing a checksum based on all of the data content, this approach aggregates
the part-level checksums (from the first part to the last) to produce a single,
combined checksum for the complete object. If you're using a multipart upload to upload
your object, then you must specify the composite checksum type.

###### Note

When an object is uploaded as a multipart upload, the entity tag (ETag) for the
object is not an MD5 digest of the entire object. Instead, Amazon S3 calculates
the MD5 digest of each individual part as it is uploaded. The MD5 digests
are used to determine the ETag for the final object. Amazon S3 concatenates the
bytes for the MD5 digests together and then calculates the MD5 digest of
these concatenated values. During the final ETag creation step,
Amazon S3 adds a dash with the total number of parts to the
end.

Amazon S3 supports the following full object and composite checksum algorithm types:

- CRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`): Supports the full object checksum type
only.

- CRC-32 ( `CRC32`): Supports both full object and composite checksum
types.

- CRC-32C ( `CRC32C`): Supports both full object and composite
checksum types.

- SHA-1 ( `SHA1`): Supports both full object and composite checksum
types.

- SHA-256 ( `SHA256`): Supports both full object and composite
checksum types.

- MD5 ( `MD5`): Supports both full object and composite checksum
types.

### Single part uploads

Checksums of objects that are uploaded in a single part (using [`PutObject`](../api/api-putobject.md#API_PutObject)) are treated as full object checksums. When
you upload an object in the Amazon S3 console, you can choose the checksum algorithm that
you want S3 to use and also (optionally) provide a precomputed value. Amazon S3 then
validates the precomputed checksum value before storing the object and its checksum
value. You can verify an object's data integrity when you request the checksum value
during object downloads.

### Multipart uploads

When you upload the object in multiple parts using the [`MultipartUpload`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_MultipartUpload.html) API, you can specify the checksum
algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use and the checksum type (full object or
composite).

The following table indicates which checksum algorithm type is supported for each
checksum algorithm in a multipart upload:

Checksum algorithmFull objectCompositeCRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`)YesNoCRC-32 ( `CRC32`)YesYesCRC-32C ( `CRC32C`)YesYesSHA-1 ( `SHA1`)NoYesSHA-256 ( `SHA256`)NoYes

## Using full object checksums for multipart upload

When creating or performing a multipart upload, you can use full object checksums for validation
on upload. This means that you can provide the checksum algorithm for the [`MultipartUpload`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_MultipartUpload.html) API, simplifying your integrity validation
tooling because you no longer need to track part boundaries for uploaded objects. You
can provide the checksum of the whole object in the [`CompleteMultipartUpload`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html) request, along with the object
size.

When you provide a full object checksum during a multipart upload, the AWS SDK passes the checksum
to Amazon S3, and S3 validates the object integrity server-side, comparing it to the received
value. Then, Amazon S3 stores the object if the values match. If the two values don’t match,
S3 fails the request with a `BadDigest` error. The checksum of your object is
also stored in object metadata that you use later to validate an object's data
integrity.

For full object checksums, you can use CRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`), CRC-32
( `CRC32`), or CRC-32C ( `CRC32C`) checksum algorithms in S3.
Full object checksums in multipart uploads are only available for CRC-based checksums
because they can linearize into a full object checksum. This linearization allows Amazon S3
to parallelize your requests for improved performance. In particular, S3 can compute the
checksum of the whole object from the part-level checksums. This type of validation
isn’t available for other algorithms, such as SHA and MD5. Because S3 has default
integrity protections, if objects are uploaded without a checksum, S3 automatically
attaches the recommended full object CRC-64/NVME ( `CRC64NVME`) checksum
algorithm to the object.

###### Note

To initiate the multipart upload, you can specify the checksum algorithm and the
full object checksum type. After you specify the checksum algorithm and the full
object checksum type, you can provide the full object checksum value for the
multipart upload.

## Using part-level checksums for multipart upload

When objects are uploaded to Amazon S3, they can be uploaded as a single object or uploaded
in parts with the multipart upload process. You can choose a **Checksum** type for
your multipart upload. For multipart upload part-level checksums (or composite checksums), Amazon S3 calculates the
checksum for each individual part by using the specified checksum algorithm. You can use
[`UploadPart`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) to provide the checksum values for each part.
If the object that you try to upload in the Amazon S3 console is set to use the CRC-64/NVME
( `CRC64NVME`) checksum algorithm and exceeds 16 MB, it is automatically
designated as a full object checksum.

Amazon S3 then uses the stored part-level checksum values to confirm that each part is
uploaded correctly. When each part’s checksum (for the whole object) is provided, S3
uses the stored checksum values of each part to calculate the full object checksum
internally, comparing it with the provided checksum value. This minimizes compute costs
since S3 can compute a checksum of the whole object using the checksum of the parts. For
more information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html) and [Using full object checksums for multipart upload](#Full-object-checksums).

When the object is completely uploaded, you can use the final calculated checksum to
verify the data integrity of the object.

When uploading a part of the multipart upload, be aware of the following:

- To retrieve information about the object, including how many parts make up the
entire object, you can use the [`GetObjectAttributes`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAttributes.html) operation. With additional
checksums, you can also recover information for each individual part that
includes the part's checksum value.

- For completed uploads, you can get an individual part's checksum by using the
[`GetObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html) or [`HeadObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadObject.html) operations and specifying a part number or
byte range that aligns with a single part. If you want to retrieve the checksum
values for individual parts of multipart uploads that are still in progress, you
can use [`ListParts`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html).

- Because of how Amazon S3 calculates the checksum for multipart objects, the
checksum value for the object might change if you copy it. If you're using an
SDK or the REST API and you call [`CopyObject`](../api/api-copyobject.md), Amazon S3 copies any object up to the size
limitations of the `CopyObject` API operation. Amazon S3 does this copy as
a single action, regardless of whether the object was uploaded in a single
request or as part of a multipart upload. With a copy command, the checksum of the object
is a direct checksum of the full object. If the object was originally uploaded
using a multipart upload, the checksum value changes even though the data doesn't.

- Objects that are larger than the size limitations of the
`CopyObject` API operation must use [multipart upload copy\
commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CopyingObjectsMPUapi.html).

- When you perform some operations using the AWS Management Console, Amazon S3 uses a multipart upload if the
object is greater than 16 MB in size.

## Checksum methods

After uploading objects, you can get the checksum value and compare it to a
precomputed or previously stored checksum value of the same checksum algorithm type. The
following examples show you which checksum calculation methods you can use to verify
data integrity.

To learn more about using the console and specifying checksum algorithms to
use when uploading objects, see [Uploading objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html) and [Tutorial: Checking the integrity of data in Amazon S3 with additional\
checksums](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/amazon-s3-with-additional-checksums?ref=docs_gateway%2Famazons3%2Fchecking-object-integrity.html).

The following example shows how you can use the AWS SDKs to upload a large
file with multipart upload, download a large file, and validate a multipart upload file, all by using
SHA-256 for file validation.

You can send REST requests to upload an object with a checksum value to verify
the integrity of the data with [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md). You can also retrieve the checksum value for objects
using [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html) or [HeadObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadObject.html).

You can send a `PUT` request to upload an object of up to 5 GB in a
single operation. For more information, see the [`PutObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html#examples) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_. You can also use [`get-object`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/get-object.html) and
[`head-object`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/head-object.html) to retrieve the checksum of an
already-uploaded object to verify the integrity of the data.

For information, see [Amazon S3 CLI FAQ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/s3-faq.html) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

## Using Content-MD5 when uploading objects

Another way to verify the integrity of your object after uploading is to provide an
MD5 digest of the object when you upload it. If you calculate the MD5 digest for your
object, you can provide the digest with the `PUT` command by using the
`Content-MD5` header.

After uploading the object, Amazon S3 calculates the MD5 digest of the object and compares
it to the value that you provided. The request succeeds only if the two digests match.

Supplying an MD5 digest isn't required, but you can use it to verify the integrity of
the object as part of the upload process.

## Using Content-MD5 and the ETag to verify uploaded objects

The entity tag (ETag) for an object represents a specific version of that object. Keep
in mind that the ETag only reflects changes to the content of an object, not changes to
its metadata. If only the metadata of an object changes, the ETag remains the same.

Depending on the object, the ETag of the object might be an MD5 digest of the object
data:

- If an object is created by the `PutObject`,
`PostObject`, or `CopyObject` operation, or through the
AWS Management Console, and that object is also plaintext or encrypted by server-side
encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), that object has an ETag that is an
MD5 digest of its object data.

- If an object is created by the `PutObject`,
`PostObject`, or `CopyObject` operation, or through the
AWS Management Console, and that object is encrypted by server-side encryption with
customer-provided keys (SSE-C) or server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
keys (SSE-KMS), that object has an ETag that is not an MD5 digest of its object
data.

- If an object is created by either the multipart upload process or the
`UploadPartCopy` operation, the object's ETag is not an MD5
digest, regardless of the method of encryption. If an object is larger than 16
MB, the AWS Management Console uploads or copies that object as a multipart upload, and therefore the
ETag isn't an MD5 digest.

For objects where the ETag is the `Content-MD5` digest of the object, you
can compare the ETag value of the object with a calculated or previously stored
`Content-MD5` digest.

## Using trailing checksums

When uploading large objects to Amazon S3, you can either provide a precalculated checksum
for the object or use an AWS SDK to automatically create trailing checksums for
chunked uploads, on your behalf. If you use a trailing checksum, Amazon S3 automatically
generates the checksum value by using your specified algorithm to validate the integrity
of the object in chunked uploads, when you upload an object.

To create a trailing checksum when using an AWS SDK, populate the
`ChecksumAlgorithm` parameter with your preferred algorithm. The SDK uses
that algorithm to calculate the checksum value for your object (or object parts) and
automatically appends it to the end of your chunked upload request. This behavior saves
you time because Amazon S3 performs both the verification and upload of your data in a single
pass.

###### Important

If you're using S3 Object Lambda, all requests to S3 Object Lambda are signed using
`s3-object-lambda` instead of `s3`. This behavior affects
the signature of trailing checksum values. For more information about S3 Object Lambda, see
[Transforming objects with S3 Object Lambda](transforming-objects.md).

### Trailing checksum headers

To make a chunked content encoding request, Amazon S3 requires client servers to
include several headers to correctly parse the request. Client servers must include
the following headers:

- **`x-amz-decoded-content-length`:** This header
indicates the plaintext size of the actual data that is being uploaded to
Amazon S3 with the request.

- **`x-amz-content-sha256`:** This
header indicates the type of chunked upload that is included in the request.
For chunked uploads with trailing checksums, the header value is
`STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER` for requests that don’t
use payload signing and
`STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER` for requests
that use SigV4 payload signing. (For more information about implementing
signed payloads, see [Signature calculations\
for the authorization header: Transferring a payload in multiple\
chunks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-streaming.html).)

- **`x-amz-trailer`:** This header
indicates the name of the trailing header in the request. If trailing
checksums exist (where AWS SDKs append checksums to the encoded request
bodies), the `x-amz-trailer` header value includes the
`x-amz-checksum-` prefix and ends with the algorithm name.
The following `x-amz-trailer` values are currently
supported:

- `x-amz-checksum-crc32`

- `x-amz-checksum-crc32c`

- `x-amz-checksum-crc64nvme`

- `x-amz-checksum-sha1`

- `x-amz-checksum-sha256`

###### Note

You can also include the `Content-Encoding` header, with the
chunked value, in your request. While this header isn’t required, including this
header can minimize HTTP proxy issues when transmitting encoded data. If another
`Content-Encoding` header (such as gzip) exists in the request,
the `Content-Encoding` header includes the chunked value in a
comma-separated list of encodings. For example, `Content-Encoding:
                        aws-chunked, gzip`.

### Chunked parts

When you upload an object to Amazon S3 using chunked encoding, the upload request
includes the following types of chunks (formatted in the listed order):

- **Object body chunks:** There can be one,
multiple, or zero body chunks associated with a chunked upload request.

- **Completion chunks:** There can be one,
multiple, or zero body chunks associated with a chunked upload request.

- **Trailing chunks:** The trailing checksum is
listed after the completion chunk. Only one trailing chunk is
allowed.

###### Note

Every chunked upload must end with a final CRLF (such as `\r\n`)
to indicate the end of the request.

For examples of chunked formatting, see [Examples: Chunked uploads with trailing checksums](#example-chunked-uploads-trailing).

#### Object body chunks

Object body chunks are the chunks that contain the actual object data that is
being uploaded to S3. These chunks have consistent size and format
constraints.

##### Object body chunk size

These chunks must contain at least 8,192 bytes (or 8 KiB) of object data,
except for the final body chunk, which can be smaller. There is no explicit
maximum chunk size but you can expect all chunks to be smaller than the 5 GB
maximum upload size. Chunk sizes can vary from one chunk to the next based
on your client server implementation.

##### Object body chunk format

Object body chunks begin with the hexadecimal encoding of the number of
bytes in the object body chunk, followed by a CRLF (Carriage Return Line
Feed), the object bytes for that chunk, and another CRLF.

For example:

```nohighlight

hex-encoding-of-object-bytes-in-chunk\r\n
chunk-object-bytes\r\n
```

However, when the chunk is signed, the object body chunk follows a
different format, where the signature is appended to the chunk size with a
semicolon delimiter. For example:

```nohighlight

hex-encoding-of-object-bytes-in-chunk;chunk-signature\r\n
 chunk-object-bytes\r\n
```

For more information about chunk signing, see [Signature calculations\
for the Authorization Header: Transferring a payload in\
multiple chunks (AWS Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-streaming.html). For more
information about chunk formatting, see [Chunked transfer encoding](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112) on the _RFC_
_Editor_ website.

#### Completion chunks

Completion chunks are required to be the final object body chunk of every
chunked upload. A completion chunk's format is similar to a body chunk, but
always contains zero bytes of object data. (The zero bytes of object data
indicate that all of the data has been uploaded.) Chunked uploads must include a
completion chunk as its final object body chunk, following a format like
this:

```

0\r\n
```

However, if the content encoding request uses payload signing, it follows this
format instead:

```nohighlight

0;chunk-signature\r\n
```

#### Trailer chunks

Trailer chunks hold the calculated checksum for all S3 upload requests.
Trailer chunks include two fields: one header name field and one header value
field. The header name field for an upload request must match the value passed
into the `x-amz-trailer` request header. For example, if a request
contains `x-amz-trailer: x-amz-checksum-crc32` and the trailer chunk
has the header name `x-amz-checksum-sha1`, the request fails. The
value field in the trailer chunk includes a base64 encoding of the big-endian
checksum value for that object. (The big-endian ordering stores the most
significant byte of data at the lowest memory address, and the least significant
byte at the largest memory address). The algorithm used to calculate this
checksum is the same as the suffix for the header name (for example,
`crc32`).

##### Trailer chunk format

Trailer chunks use the following format for unsigned payload
requests:

```nohighlight

x-amz-checksum-lowercase-checksum-algorithm-name:base64-checksum-value\n\r\n\r\n
```

For requests with [SigV4 signed\
payloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-streaming-trailers.html), the trailer chunk includes a trailer signature after
the trailer chunk.

```nohighlight

trailer-checksum\n\r\n
trailer-signature\r\n
```

You can also add the CRLF directly to the end of the base64 checksum
value. For example:

```nohighlight

x-amz-checksum-lowercase-checksum-algorithm-name:base64-checksum-value\r\n\r\n
```

#### Examples: Chunked uploads with trailing checksums

Amazon S3 supports chunked uploads that use `aws-chunked` content
encoding for `PutObject` and `UploadPart` requests with
trailing checksums.

###### Example 1 – Unsigned chunked `PutObject` request with a trailing CRC-32 checksum

The following is an example of a chunked `PutObject` request with
a trailing CRC-32 checksum. In this example, the client uploads a 17 KB object
in three unsigned chunks and appends a trailing CRC-32 checksum chunk by using
the `x-amz-checksum-crc32` header.

```nohighlight

\r\n                                         // CRLF
```

Here's an example response:

```

HTTP/1.1 200
ETag: ETag
x-amz-checksum-crc32: YABb/g==
```

###### Note

The usage of the linefeed `\n` at the end of the checksum
value might vary across clients.

###### Example 2 – SigV4-signed chunked `PutObject` request with a trailing CRC-32 ( `CRC32`) checksum

The following is an example of a chunked `PutObject` request with a
trailing CRC-32 checksum. This request uses SigV4 payload signing. In this
example, the client uploads a 17 KB object in three signed chunks. In addition
to the `object body` chunks, the `completion chunk` and
`trailer chunk` are also signed.

```nohighlight
