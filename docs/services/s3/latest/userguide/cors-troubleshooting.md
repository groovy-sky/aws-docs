## 403 Forbidden error: CORS is not enabled for this bucket

The following `403 Forbidden` error occurs when a cross-origin request
is sent to Amazon S3 but CORS is not configured on your S3 bucket.

Error: **`HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden CORS Response: CORS is not enabled for this**
**bucket. `**

The CORS configuration is a document or policy with rules that identify the
origins that you will allow to access your bucket, the operations (HTTP methods) that
you will support for each origin, and other operation-specific information. See how to
[configure CORS](enabling-cors-examples.md)
on S3 by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS SDKs, and REST API. For more information on
CORS and examples of a CORS configuration, see [Elements of\
CORS](managecorsusing.md#cors-example-1).

## 403 Forbidden error: This CORS request is not allowed

The following `403 Forbidden` error is received when a CORS rule in your
CORS configuration doesn't match the data in your request.

Error: **` HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden**
**CORS Response: This CORS request is not allowed.`**

As a result, this `403 Forbidden` error can occur for multiple
reasons:

- Origin is not allowed.

- Methods are not allowed.

- Requested headers are not allowed.

For each request that Amazon S3 receives, you must have a CORS rule in your CORS configuration that matches the data in your request.

### Origin is not allowed

The `Origin` header in a CORS request to your bucket must match the origins in the
`AllowedOrigins` element in your CORS configuration. A wildcard
character ( `"*"`) in the `AllowedOrigins` element would match
all HTTP methods. For more information on how to update the
`AllowedOrigins` element, see [Configuring\
cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](enabling-cors-examples.md).

For example, if only the `http://www.example1.com` domain is included
in the `AllowedOrigins` element, then a CORS request sent from the
`http://www.example2.com` domain would receive the `403
                    Forbidden` error.

The following example shows part of a CORS configuration that includes
the `http://www.example1.com` domain in the `AllowedOrigins`
element.

```

"AllowedOrigins":[
   "http://www.example1.com"
]
```

For a CORS request sent from the `http://www.example2.com`
domain to be successful, the `http://www.example2.com` domain should be
included in the `AllowedOrigins` element of CORS configuration.

```

"AllowedOrigins":[
   "http://www.example1.com"
   "http://www.example2.com"
]
```

### Methods are not allowed

The HTTP methods that are specified in the
`Access-Control-Request-Method` in a CORS request to your bucket must
match the method or methods listed in the `AllowedMethods` element in
your CORS configuration. A wildcard character ( `"*"`) in
`AllowedMethods` would match all HTTP methods. For more information
on how to update the `AllowedOrigins` element, see [Configuring\
cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](enabling-cors-examples.md).

In a CORS configuration, you can specify the following methods in
the `AllowedMethods` element:

- `GET`

- `PUT`

- `POST`

- `DELETE`

- `HEAD`

The following example shows part of a CORS configuration that includes the
`GET` method in the `AllowedMethods` element. Only
requests including the `GET` method would succeed.

```

"AllowedMethods":[
   "GET"
]
```

If an HTTP method (for example, `PUT`) was used in a CORS request or
included in a pre-flight CORS request to your bucket but the method isn't present in
your CORS configuration, the request would result in a `403 Forbidden`
error. To allow this CORS request or CORS pre-flight request, the `PUT`
method must be added to your CORS configuration.

```

"AllowedMethods":[
   "GET"
   "PUT"
]
```

### Requested headers are not allowed

The headers listed in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header in a
pre-flight request must match the headers in the `AllowedHeaders` element
in your CORS configuration. For a list of common headers that can be used in
requests to Amazon S3, see [Common Request\
Headers](../api/restcommonrequestheaders.md). For more information on how to update the
`AllowedHeaders` element, see [Configuring\
cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](enabling-cors-examples.md).

The following example shows part of a CORS configuration that includes the
`Authorization` header in the `AllowedHeaders` element.
Only requests for the `Authorization` header would succeed.

```

"AllowedHeaders":  [
    "Authorization"
]
```

If a header (for example `Content-MD5` was included in a CORS request
but the header isn't present in your CORS configuration, the request would result in
a `403 Forbidden` error. To allow this CORS request , the
`Content-MD5` header must be added to your CORS configuration. If you
want to pass both `Authorization` and `Content-MD5` headers in
a CORS request to your bucket, confirm that both headers are included in the
`AllowedHeaders` element in your CORS configuration.

```

"AllowedHeaders":  [
    "Authorization"
    "Content-MD5"
]
```

## Headers not found in CORS response

The `ExposeHeaders` element in your CORS configuration identifies which
response headers that you would like to make accessible to scripts and applications
running in browsers, in response to a CORS request.

If your objects stored in your S3 bucket have user-defined metadata (for example,
`x-amz-meta-custom-header`) along with the response data, this custom
header could contain additional metadata or information that you want to access from
your client-side JavaScript code. However, by default, browsers block access to custom
headers for security reasons. To allow your client-side JavaScript to access custom
headers, you need to include the header in your CORS configuration.

In the example below, the `x-amz-meta-custom-header1` header is included
in the `ExposeHeaders` element. The `x-amz-meta-custom-header2`
isn't included in the `ExposeHeaders` element and is missing from the CORS
configuration. In the response, only the values included in the
`ExposeHeaders` element would be returned. If the request included the
`x-amz-meta-custom-header2` header in the
`Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header, the response would still return a
`200 OK`. However, only the permitted header, For example
`x-amz-meta-custom-header` would be returned and show in the response.

```

"ExposeHeaders":  [
    "x-amz-meta-custom-header1"
]
```

To ensure all headers appear in the response, add all permitted headers to the `ExposeHeaders` element in your CORS configuration as shown below.

```

"ExposeHeaders":  [
    "x-amz-meta-custom-header1",
    "x-amz-meta-custom-header2"
]
```

## Considerations of CORS on S3 proxy integrations

If you are experiencing errors and have already checked the CORS configuration on your
S3 bucket, and the cross-origin request is sent to proxies such as AWS CloudFront, try
the following:

- Configure the settings to allow the `OPTIONS` method for HTTP requests.

- Configure the proxy to forward the following headers: `Origin`,
`Access-Control-Request-Headers`, and
`Access-Control-Request-Method`.

- Configure the proxy settings to include the origin header in its cache key. This is important because caching proxies that don't include the origin header in their cache key may serve cached responses that don't include the appropriate CORS headers for different origins.

Some proxies provide pre-defined features for CORS requests. For example, in
CloudFront, you can configure a policy that includes the headers

that enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) requests when the origin is an
Amazon S3 bucket.

This policy has the following settings:

- Headers included in origin requests:

`Origin`

`Access-Control-Request-Headers`

`Access-Control-Request-Method`

- Cookies included in origin requests: None

- Query strings included in origin requests: None

For more information, see [Control\
origin requests with a policy](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/controlling-origin-requests.md) and [Use managed origin request policies](../../../amazoncloudfront/latest/developerguide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.md#managed-origin-request-policy-cors-s3) in the _CloudFront Developer_
_Guide_.
