# AWS managed policies for Amazon S3

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed
to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because
they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining
[customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS
managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is
most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for
existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonS3FullAccess

You can attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy to your IAM identities.
This policy grants permissions that allow full access to Amazon S3.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonS3FullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) in the AWS Management Console.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

You can attach the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy to your IAM
identities. This policy grants permissions that allow read-only access to Amazon S3.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) in the AWS Management Console.

## AWS managed policy: AmazonS3ObjectLambdaExecutionRolePolicy

Provides AWS Lambda functions the required permissions to send data to S3 Object Lambda when
requests are made to an S3 Object Lambda access point. Also grants Lambda permissions to write to
Amazon CloudWatch logs.

To view the permissions for this policy, see [AmazonS3ObjectLambdaExecutionRolePolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) in the
AWS Management Console.

## AWS managed policy: S3UnlockBucketPolicy

If you incorrectly configured your bucket policy for a member account to deny all users access to your S3 bucket, you can use this AWS managed policy ( `S3UnlockBucketPolicy`) to unlock the bucket. For more information on how to remove a misconfigured bucket policy that denies all principals from accessing an Amazon S3 bucket, see [Perform a privileged task on an AWS Organizations member account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user-privileged-task.html) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.
