# Configuring replication for buckets in the same account

Live replication is the automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across general purpose buckets in the
same or different AWS Regions. Live replication copies newly created objects and object
updates from a source bucket to a destination bucket or buckets. For more information, see
[Replicating objects within and across Regions](replication.md).

When you configure replication, you add replication rules to the source bucket. Replication rules
define which source bucket objects to replicate and the destination bucket or buckets where the
replicated objects are stored. You can create a rule to replicate all the objects in a bucket or
a subset of objects with a specific key name prefix, one or more object tags, or both. A
destination bucket can be in the same AWS account as the source bucket, or it can be in a
different account.

If you specify an object version ID to delete, Amazon S3 deletes that object version in the
source bucket. But it doesn't replicate the deletion in the destination bucket. In other words,
it doesn't delete the same object version from the destination bucket. This protects data from
malicious deletions.

When you add a replication rule to a bucket, the rule is enabled by default, so it starts
working as soon as you save it.

In this example, you set up live replication for source and destination buckets that are
owned by the same AWS account. Examples are provided for using the Amazon S3 console, the
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and the AWS SDK for Java and AWS SDK for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you use the following procedures, make sure that you've set up the necessary
permissions for replication, depending on whether the source and destination buckets are
owned by the same or different accounts. For more information, see [Setting up permissions for live replication](setting-repl-config-perm-overview.md).

###### Note

- If you want to replicate encrypted objects, you also must grant the necessary
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key permissions. For more information, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md).

- To use Object Lock with replication, you must grant two additional
permissions on the source S3 bucket in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you use
to set up replication. The two additional permissions are
`s3:GetObjectRetention` and `s3:GetObjectLegalHold`.
If the role has an `s3:Get*` permission statement, that statement
satisfies the requirement. For more information, see [Using Object Lock with S3 Replication](object-lock-managing.md#object-lock-managing-replication).

To configure a replication rule when the destination bucket is in the same AWS account as
the source bucket, follow these steps.

If the destination bucket is in a different account from the source bucket, you must add a
bucket policy to the destination bucket to grant the owner of the source bucket account
permission to replicate objects in the destination bucket. For more information, see [(Optional) Step 3: Granting permissions when the source and destination buckets are owned by different AWS accounts](setting-repl-config-perm-overview.md#setting-repl-config-crossacct).

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

03. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you
     want.

04. Choose the **Management** tab, scroll down to **Replication**
    **rules**, and then choose **Create replication rule**.

05. In the **Replication rule configuration** section, under
     **Replication rule name**, enter a name for your rule to help identify
     the rule later. The name is required and must be unique within the bucket.

06. Under **Status**, **Enabled** is selected by default.
     An enabled rule starts to work as soon as you save it. If you want to enable the rule later,
     choose **Disabled**.

07. If the bucket has existing replication rules, you are instructed to set a priority for
     the rule. You must set a priority for the rule to avoid conflicts caused by objects that are
     included in the scope of more than one rule. In the case of overlapping rules, Amazon S3 uses the
     rule priority to determine which rule to apply. The higher the number, the higher the
     priority. For more information about rule priority, see [Replication configuration file elements](replication-add-config.md).

08. Under **Source bucket**, you have the following options for setting the
     replication source:

- To replicate the whole bucket, choose **Apply to all objects**
**in the bucket**.

- To replicate all objects that have the same prefix, choose **Limit the scope**
**of this rule using one or more filters**. This limits replication to all
objects that have names that begin with the prefix that you specify (for example
`pictures`). Enter a prefix in the **Prefix** box.

###### Note

If you enter a prefix that is the name of a folder, you must use
**/** (forward slash) as the last character (for example,
`pictures/`).

- To replicate all objects with one or more object tags, choose **Add**
**tag** and enter the key-value pair in the boxes. Repeat the procedure to add
another tag. You can combine a prefix and tags. For more information about object tags,
see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

The new replication configuration XML schema supports prefix and tag filtering and the
prioritization of rules. For more information about the new schema, see [Backward compatibility considerations](replication-add-config.md#replication-backward-compat-considerations). For more information about
the XML used with the Amazon S3 API that works behind the user interface, see [Replication configuration file elements](replication-add-config.md). The new schema
is described as _replication configuration XML V2_.

09. Under **Destination**, choose the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to
     replicate objects.

    ###### Note

    The number of destination buckets is limited to the number of AWS Regions in a given
    partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. AWS currently has three partitions:
    `aws` (Standard Regions), `aws-cn` (China Regions), and
    `aws-us-gov` (AWS GovCloud (US) Regions). To request an increase in your
    destination bucket quota, you can use [service\
    quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

- To replicate to a bucket or buckets in your account, choose **Choose a**
**bucket in this account**, and enter or browse for the destination bucket
names.

- To replicate to a bucket or buckets in a different AWS account, choose
**Specify a bucket in another account**, and enter the destination
bucket account ID and bucket name.

If the destination is in a different account from the source bucket, you must add a
bucket policy to the destination buckets to grant the owner of the source bucket account
permission to replicate objects. For more information, see [(Optional) Step 3: Granting permissions when the source and destination buckets are owned by different AWS accounts](setting-repl-config-perm-overview.md#setting-repl-config-crossacct).

Optionally, if you want to help
standardize ownership of new objects in the destination bucket, choose **Change**
**object ownership to the destination bucket owner**. For more information about
this option, see [Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](about-object-ownership.md).

###### Note

If versioning is not enabled on the destination bucket, you get a warning that
contains an **Enable versioning** button. Choose this button to enable
versioning on the bucket.

10. Set up an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your
     behalf.

    To set up an IAM role, in the **IAM role** section, select one of
     the following from the **IAM role** dropdown list:

- We highly recommend that you choose **Create new role** to have
Amazon S3 create a new IAM role for you. When you save the rule, a new policy is generated
for the IAM role that matches the source and destination buckets that you
choose.

- You can choose to use an existing IAM role. If you do, you must choose a role that
grants Amazon S3 the necessary permissions for replication. Replication fails if this role
does not grant Amazon S3 sufficient permissions to follow your replication rule.

###### Important

When you add a replication rule to a bucket, you must have the
`iam:PassRole` permission to be able to pass the IAM role that grants Amazon S3
replication permissions. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to pass a\
role to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

11. To replicate objects in the source bucket that are encrypted with server-side encryption
     with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), under **Encryption**, select
     **Replicate objects encrypted with AWS KMS**. Under **AWS KMS keys**
    **for encrypting destination objects** are the source keys that you allow
     replication to use. All source KMS keys are included by default. To narrow the KMS key
     selection, you can choose an alias or key ID.

    Objects encrypted by AWS KMS keys that you do not select are not replicated. A
     KMS key or a group of KMS keys is chosen for you, but you can choose the KMS keys if
     you want. For information about using AWS KMS with replication, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md).

    ###### Important

    When you replicate objects that are encrypted with AWS KMS, the AWS KMS request rate
    doubles in the source Region and increases in the destination Region by the same amount.
    These increased call rates to AWS KMS are due to the way that data is re-encrypted by using
    the KMS key that you define for the replication destination Region. AWS KMS has a request
    rate quota that is per calling account per Region. For information about the quota
    defaults, see [AWS KMS Quotas -\
    Requests per Second: Varies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html#requests-per-second) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

    If your current Amazon S3 `PUT` object request rate during replication is more
    than half the default AWS KMS rate limit for your account, we recommend that you request an
    increase to your AWS KMS request rate quota. To request an increase, create a case in the
    Support Center at [Contact Us](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us). For example,
    suppose that your current `PUT` object request rate is 1,000 requests per
    second and you use AWS KMS to encrypt your objects. In this case, we recommend that you ask
    Support to increase your AWS KMS rate limit to 2,500 requests per second, in both your source
    and destination Regions (if different), to ensure that there is no throttling by AWS KMS.

    To see your `PUT` object request rate in the source bucket, view
    `PutRequests` in the Amazon CloudWatch request metrics for Amazon S3. For information about
    viewing CloudWatch metrics, see [Using the S3 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configure-request-metrics-bucket.html#configure-metrics).

    If you chose to replicate objects encrypted with AWS KMS, do the following:
    1. Under **AWS KMS key for encrypting destination objects**,
        specify your KMS key in one of the following ways:

- To choose from a list of available KMS keys, choose **Choose from your**
**AWS KMS keys**, and choose your **KMS key** from
the list of available keys.

Both the AWS managed key ( `aws/s3`) and your customer managed keys appear in
this list. For more information about customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and AWS\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- To enter the KMS key Amazon Resource Name (ARN), choose **Enter**
**AWS KMS key ARN**, and enter your KMS key ARN in the field that
appears. This encrypts the replicas in the destination bucket. You can find the ARN
for your KMS key in the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), under **Encryption keys**.

- To create a new customer managed key in the AWS KMS console, choose **Create a**
**KMS key**.

For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see [Creating\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Important

You can only use KMS keys that are enabled in the same AWS Region as the
bucket. When you choose **Choose from your KMS keys**, the S3
console lists only 100 KMS keys per Region. If you have more than 100 KMS keys in
the same Region, you can see only the first 100 KMS keys in the S3 console. To use a
KMS key that is not listed in the console, choose **Enter AWS KMS key**
**ARN**, and enter your KMS key ARN.

When you use an AWS KMS key for server-side encryption in Amazon S3, you must choose
a symmetric encryption KMS key. Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys
and not asymmetric KMS keys. For more information, see [Identifying symmetric and\
asymmetric KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-symm-asymm.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer_
_Guide_.

For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see [Creating keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_. For more information about using AWS KMS with
Amazon S3, see [Using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)](usingkmsencryption.md).
12. Under **Destination storage**
    **class**, if you want to replicate your data into a specific storage class in the destination,
     choose **Change the storage class for the replicated objects**. Then
     choose the storage class that you want to use for the replicated objects in the
     destination. If you don't choose this option, the storage class for replicated objects
     is the same class as the original objects.

13. You have the following additional options while setting the **Additional**
    **replication options**:

- If you want to enable S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC) in your replication configuration, select
**Replication Time Control (RTC)**. For more information about this
option, see [Meeting compliance requirements with S3 Replication Time Control](replication-time-control.md).

- If you want to enable S3 Replication metrics in your replication configuration, select
**Replication metrics and events**. For more information, see [Monitoring replication with metrics, event notifications, and statuses](replication-metrics.md).

- If you want to enable delete marker replication in your replication configuration, select
**Delete marker replication**. For more information, see [Replicating delete markers between buckets](delete-marker-replication.md).

- If you want to enable Amazon S3 replica modification sync in your replication configuration,
select **Replica modification sync**. For more information, see [Replicating metadata changes with replica modification sync](replication-for-metadata-changes.md).

###### Note

When you use S3 RTC or S3 Replication metrics, additional fees apply.

14. To finish, choose **Save**.

15. After you save your rule, you can edit, enable, disable, or delete your rule by
     selecting your rule and choosing **Edit rule**.

To use the AWS CLI to set up replication when the source and destination buckets are
owned by the same AWS account, you do the following:

- Create source and destination buckets.

- Enable versioning on the buckets.

- Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that gives Amazon S3 permission to replicate
objects.

- Add the replication configuration to the source bucket.

To verify your setup, you test it.

###### To set up replication when the source and destination buckets are owned by the same AWS account

1. Set a credentials profile for the AWS CLI. This example uses the profile
    name `acctA`. For information about setting credential profiles
    and using named profiles, see [Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

###### Important

The profile that you use for this example must have the necessary
permissions. For example, in the replication configuration, you specify
the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume. You can do this only if the profile
that you use has the `iam:PassRole` permission. For more
information, see [Grant a user\
permissions to pass a role to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_. If you use administrator
credentials to create a named profile, you can perform all the tasks.

2. Create a source bucket and enable versioning on it by using the following
    AWS CLI commands. To use these commands, replace the `user
                                   input placeholders` with your own information.

The following `create-bucket` command creates a source bucket
    named `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` in the US East (N. Virginia)
    ( `us-east-1`) Region:

```nohighlight

aws s3api create-bucket \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket \
   --region us-east-1 \
   --profile acctA
```

The following `put-bucket-versioning` command enables S3 Versioning on the
    `amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket` bucket:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket \
   --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled \
   --profile acctA
```

3. Create a destination bucket and enable versioning on it by using the
    following AWS CLI commands. To use these commands, replace the
    `user input placeholders` with
    your own information.

###### Note

To set up a replication configuration when both source and destination
buckets are in the same AWS account, you use the same profile for the
source and destination buckets. This example uses `acctA`.

To test a replication configuration when the buckets are owned by
different AWS accounts, specify different profiles for each account.
For example, use an `acctB` profile for the destination
bucket.

The following `create-bucket` command creates a destination
    bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` in the
    US West (Oregon) ( `us-west-2`) Region:

```nohighlight

aws s3api create-bucket \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2 \
   --profile acctA
```

The following `put-bucket-versioning` command enables
    S3 Versioning on the `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` bucket:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
   --bucket amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket \
   --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled \
   --profile acctA
```

4. Create an IAM role. You specify this role in the replication
    configuration that you add to the source bucket later. Amazon S3 assumes this
    role to replicate objects on your behalf. You create an IAM role in two
    steps:

- Create a role.

- Attach a permissions policy to the role.

1. Create the IAM role.
      1. Copy the following trust policy and save it to a file
          named `s3-role-trust-policy.json` in the
          current directory on your local computer. This policy grants
          the Amazon S3 service principal permissions to assume the
          role.
         JSON

         ```json

         {
            "Version":"2012-10-17",
            "Statement":[
               {
                  "Effect":"Allow",
                  "Principal":{
                     "Service":"s3.amazonaws.com"
                  },
                  "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
               }
            ]
         }

         ```

      2. Run the following command to create a role.

         ```nohighlight

         $ aws iam create-role \
         --role-name replicationRole \
         --assume-role-policy-document file://s3-role-trust-policy.json  \
         --profile acctA
         ```
2. Attach a permissions policy to the role.
      1. Copy the following permissions policy and save it to a
          file named `s3-role-permissions-policy.json` in
          the current directory on your local computer. This policy
          grants permissions for various Amazon S3 bucket and object
          actions.
         JSON

         ```json

         {
            "Version":"2012-10-17",
            "Statement":[
               {
                  "Effect":"Allow",
                  "Action":[
                     "s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
                     "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
                     "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging"
                  ],
                  "Resource":[
                     "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket/*"
                  ]
               },
               {
                  "Effect":"Allow",
                  "Action":[
                     "s3:ListBucket",
                     "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration"
                  ],
                  "Resource":[
                     "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket"
                  ]
               },
               {
                  "Effect":"Allow",
                  "Action":[
                     "s3:ReplicateObject",
                     "s3:ReplicateDelete",
                     "s3:ReplicateTags"
                  ],
                  "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
               }
            ]
         }

         ```

         ###### Note

- If you want to replicate encrypted objects, you also must grant the necessary
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key permissions. For more information, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md).

- To use Object Lock with replication, you must grant two additional
permissions on the source S3 bucket in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you use
to set up replication. The two additional permissions are
`s3:GetObjectRetention` and `s3:GetObjectLegalHold`.
If the role has an `s3:Get*` permission statement, that statement
satisfies the requirement. For more information, see [Using Object Lock with S3 Replication](object-lock-managing.md#object-lock-managing-replication).

      2. Run the following command to create a policy and attach it
          to the role. Replace the `user input
                                                         placeholders` with your own
          information.

         ```nohighlight

         $ aws iam put-role-policy \
         --role-name replicationRole \
         --policy-document file://s3-role-permissions-policy.json \
         --policy-name replicationRolePolicy \
         --profile acctA
         ```
5. Add a replication configuration to the source bucket.

1. Although the Amazon S3 API requires that you specify the replication
       configuration as XML, the AWS CLI requires that you specify the
       replication configuration as JSON. Save the following JSON in a file
       called `replication.json` to the local directory on your
       computer.

      ```json

      {
        "Role": "IAM-role-ARN",
        "Rules": [
          {
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Priority": 1,
            "DeleteMarkerReplication": { "Status": "Disabled" },
            "Filter" : { "Prefix": "Tax"},
            "Destination": {
              "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

2. Update the JSON by replacing the values for the
       `amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket` and
       `IAM-role-ARN` with
       your own information. Save the changes.

3. Run the following `put-bucket-replication` command to
       add the replication configuration to your source bucket. Be sure to
       provide the source bucket name:

      ```nohighlight

      $ aws s3api put-bucket-replication \
      --replication-configuration file://replication.json \
      --bucket amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket \
      --profile acctA
      ```

To retrieve the replication configuration, use the
`get-bucket-replication` command:

```nohighlight

$ aws s3api get-bucket-replication \
--bucket amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket \
--profile acctA
```

6. Test the setup in the Amazon S3 console, by doing the following steps:
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Buckets**.
       In the **General purpose buckets** list, choose the
       source bucket.

3. In the source bucket, create a folder named
       `Tax`.

4. Add sample objects to the
       `Tax` folder in
       the source bucket.

      ###### Note

      The amount of time that it takes for Amazon S3 to replicate an
      object depends on the size of the object. For information about
      how to see the status of replication, see [Getting replication status information](replication-status.md).

      In the destination bucket, verify the following:

- That Amazon S3 replicated the objects.

- That the objects are replicas. On the
**Properties** tab for your objects,
scroll down to the **Object management**
**overview** section. Under **Management**
**configurations**, see the value under
**Replication status**. Make sure that
this value is set to `REPLICA`.

- That the replicas are owned by the source bucket account.
You can verify the object ownership on the
**Permissions** tab for your objects.

If the source and destination buckets are owned by
different accounts, you can add an optional configuration to
tell Amazon S3 to change the replica ownership to the destination
account. For an example, see [How to change the replica owner](replication-change-owner.md#replication-walkthrough-3).

Use the following code examples to add a replication configuration to a bucket
with the AWS SDK for Java and AWS SDK for .NET, respectively.

###### Note

- If you want to replicate encrypted objects, you also must grant the necessary
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key permissions. For more information, see [Replicating encrypted objects (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, DSSE-KMS, SSE-C)](replication-config-for-kms-objects.md).

- To use Object Lock with replication, you must grant two additional
permissions on the source S3 bucket in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you use
to set up replication. The two additional permissions are
`s3:GetObjectRetention` and `s3:GetObjectLegalHold`.
If the role has an `s3:Get*` permission statement, that statement
satisfies the requirement. For more information, see [Using Object Lock with S3 Replication](object-lock-managing.md#object-lock-managing-replication).

Java

To add a replication configuration to a bucket and then retrieve and verify the configuration using the AWS SDK for Java, you can use the S3Client to manage replication settings programmatically.

For examples of how to configure replication with the AWS SDK for Java, see [Set replication configuration on a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_PutBucketReplication_section.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

C#

The following AWS SDK for .NET code example adds a replication configuration
to a bucket and then retrieves it. To use this code, provide the names
for your buckets and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your IAM role.
For information about setting up and running the code examples, see
[Getting Started with the AWS SDK for .NET](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config.html) in the
_AWS SDK for .NET Developer Guide_.
