# Deleting a Multi-Region Access Point

The following procedure explains how to delete a Multi-Region Access Point by using the Amazon S3
console. Be aware that deleting a Multi-Region Access Point doesn't delete the buckets associated with the Multi-Region Access Point. Instead, it only deletes the
Multi-Region Access Point itself.

###### Note

S3 Multi-Region Access Points using buckets in AWS opt-in Regions is currently only supported through
AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI. To delete a Multi-Region Access Point using buckets in an opt-in Region,
make sure to specify which AWS opt-in Regions your account can use first.
Otherwise, if you try to delete a Multi-Region Access Point that uses buckets in disabled AWS opt-in
Regions, you'll receive an error.

###### To delete a Multi-Region Access Point

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose
    **Multi-Region Access Points**.

3. Select the option button next to the name of your Multi-Region Access Point.

4. Choose **Delete**.

5. In the **Delete Multi-Region Access Point** dialog
    box, enter the name of the AWS bucket that you want to delete.

###### Note

Make sure to enter a valid bucket name. Otherwise, the
**Delete** button will be disabled.

6. Choose **Delete** to confirm deletion of your
    Multi-Region Access Point.

You can use the AWS CLI to delete a Multi-Region Access Point. This action does not delete the
buckets associated with the Multi-Region Access Point, only the Multi-Region Access Point itself. To use this example
command, replace the `user input
                        placeholders` with your own information.
