# Troubleshooting

When you apply the Bucket owner enforced setting for
S3 Object Ownership, access control lists (ACLs) are disabled and you, as the bucket owner, automatically own all
objects in your bucket. ACLs no longer affect permissions for the objects in your bucket. You can use policies to grant
permissions. All S3 `PUT` requests must either specify the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL
or not specify an ACL, or these requests will fail. For more information, see
[Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket](about-object-ownership.md).

If an invalid ACL is specified or bucket ACL permissions grant access outside of your
AWS account, you might see the following error responses.

## AccessControlListNotSupported

After you apply the Bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled.
Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail with a `400` error and return
the **`AccessControlListNotSupported`** error code. Requests to
read ACLs are still supported. Requests to read ACLs always return a response that
shows full control for the bucket owner. In your `PUT` operations, you
must either specify bucket owner full control ACLs or not specify an ACL. Otherwise,
your `PUT` operations fail.

The following example `put-object` AWS CLI command includes the
`public-read` canned ACL.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --key object-key-name --body doc-example-body --acl public-read
```

If the bucket uses the Bucket owner enforced setting to disable ACLs, this operation fails,
and the uploader receives the following error message:

**`An error occurred (AccessControlListNotSupported) when calling the**
**PutObject operation: The bucket does not allow ACLs`**

## InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership

If you want to apply the Bucket owner enforced setting to disable ACLs, your bucket ACL
must give full control only to the bucket owner. Your bucket ACL cannot give access
to an external AWS account or any other group. For example, if your
`CreateBucket` request sets Bucket owner enforced and specifies a
bucket ACL that provides access to an external AWS account, your request fails
with a `400` error and returns the
**`InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership`** error code.
Similarly, if your `PutBucketOwnershipControls` request sets Bucket owner
enforced on a bucket that has a bucket ACL that grants permissions to others, the
request fails.

###### Example: Existing bucket ACL grants public read access

For example, if an existing bucket ACL grants public read access, you cannot apply the
Bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership until you migrate these ACL
permissions to a bucket policy and reset your bucket ACL to the default private
ACL. For more information, see [Prerequisites for disabling ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-migrating-acls-prerequisites.html).

This example bucket ACL grants public read access:

```nohighlight

{
    "Owner": {
        "ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID"
    },
    "Grants": [
        {
            "Grantee": {
                "ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID",
                "Type": "CanonicalUser"
            },
            "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
        },
        {
            "Grantee": {
                "Type": "Group",
                "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
            },
            "Permission": "READ"
        }
    ]
}
```

The following example `put-bucket-ownership-controls` AWS CLI command applies the
Bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-ownership-controls --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --ownership-controls Rules=[{ObjectOwnership=BucketOwnerEnforced}]
```

Because the bucket ACL grants public read access, the request fails and
returns the following error code:

**`An error occurred (InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership) when**
**calling the PutBucketOwnershipControls operation: Bucket cannot have ACLs**
**set with ObjectOwnership's BucketOwnerEnforced setting `**
