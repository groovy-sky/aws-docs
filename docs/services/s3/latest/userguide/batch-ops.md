# Performing object operations in bulk with Batch Operations

You can use S3 Batch Operations to perform large-scale batch operations on Amazon S3 objects. S3 Batch Operations
can perform a single operation on lists of Amazon S3 objects that you specify. A single job can perform a
specified operation on billions of objects containing exabytes of data. Amazon S3 tracks progress, sends
notifications, and stores a detailed completion report of all actions, providing a fully managed,
auditable, and serverless experience. You can use S3 Batch Operations through the Amazon S3 console, AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API.

Use S3 Batch Operations to copy objects, update server-side encryption of objects, and set object tags or
access control lists (ACLs). You can also initiate object restores from S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or
invoke an AWS Lambda function to perform custom actions using your objects. You can perform these
operations on a custom list of objects, or you can use an Amazon S3 Inventory report to easily generate lists
of objects. Amazon S3 Batch Operations use the same Amazon S3 API operations that you already use with Amazon S3.

## S3 Batch Operations basics

You can use S3 Batch Operations to perform large-scale batch operations on Amazon S3 objects.
S3 Batch Operations can run a single operation or action on lists of Amazon S3 objects that you specify.

### Terminology

This section uses the terms _manifests_,
_jobs_, _operations_, and _tasks_,
which are defined as follows:

**Manifest**

A manifest is an Amazon S3 object that contains the object keys that you want Amazon S3 to act
upon. If you want to create a Batch Operations job, you must supply a manifest. Your
user-generated manifest must contain the bucket name, object key, and optionally, the
object version for each object. If you supply a user-generated manifest, it must be in
the form of an Amazon S3 Inventory report or a CSV file.

You can also have Amazon S3 generate a manifest automatically based on object filter
criteria that you specify when you create your job. This option is available for
Batch Operations jobs that you create by using the Amazon S3 console, or for any job type that you
create by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API.

**Job**

A job is the basic unit of work for S3 Batch Operations. A job contains all of the
information necessary to run the specified operation on the objects listed in the
manifest. After you provide this information and request that the job begin, the job
performs the operation for each object in the manifest.

**Operation**

The operation is the type of API [action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Operations.html), such as copying objects, that you want the Batch Operations job to run. Each
job performs a single type of operation across all objects that are specified in the
manifest.

**Task**

A task is the unit of execution for a job. A task represents a single call to an
Amazon S3 or AWS Lambda API operation to perform the job's operation on a single object. Over
the course of a job's lifetime, S3 Batch Operations create one task for each object specified
in the manifest.

### How an S3 Batch Operations job works

A job is the basic unit of work for S3 Batch Operations. A job contains all of the information
necessary to run the specified operation on a list of objects. To create a job, you give
S3 Batch Operations a list of objects and specify the action to perform on those objects. For
information about the operations that S3 Batch Operations supports, see [Operations supported by S3 Batch Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/batch-ops-operations.html).

A batch job performs a specified operation on every object that's included in its
_manifest_. A manifest lists the objects that you want a batch job to
process and it is stored as an object in a bucket. You can use a comma-separated values
(CSV)-formatted [Cataloging and analyzing your data with S3 Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage-inventory.html) report
as a manifest, which makes it easy to create large lists of objects located in a bucket. You
can also specify a manifest in a simple CSV format that enables you to perform batch
operations on a customized list of objects contained within a single bucket.

After you create a job, Amazon S3 processes the list of objects in the manifest and runs the
specified operation against each object. While a job is running, you can monitor its progress
programmatically or through the Amazon S3 console. You can also configure a job to generate a
completion report when it finishes. The completion report describes the results of each task
that was performed by the job. For more information about monitoring jobs, see [Managing S3 Batch Operations jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/batch-ops-managing-jobs.html).

There are costs associated with S3 Batch Operations. You are billed for creating Batch
Operations jobs, including jobs that are canceled before completion. For more information, see
[Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

S3 Batch Operations jobs by default can process up to 4 billion objects for all
operations. Specifically Copy, Object Tagging, Object Lock, invoking an AWS Lambda function,
and Batch Replication jobs can support up to 20 billion objects. There is a limit of 6 active
Batch Replication jobs per AWS account. To get started creating a Batch Operations job, see
[Creating an S3 Batch Operations job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/batch-ops-create-job.html).
