The following topics can help you troubleshoot issues that you might encounter when
setting up logging with Amazon S3.

## Common error messages when setting up logging

The following common error messages can appear when you're enabling logging through
the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS SDKs:

Error: **`Cross S3 location logging not allowed`**

If the
destination bucket
(also known as a
_target_
_bucket_)
is in a different Region than the source bucket, a **`Cross S3 location logging**
**not allowed`** error occurs. To resolve this error, make sure that the
destination
bucket configured to receive the access logs is in the same AWS Region and
AWS account as the source bucket.

Error: **`The owner for the bucket to be logged and the target bucket must be**
**the same`**

When you're enabling server access logging, this error occurs if the specified
destination
bucket belongs to a different account. To resolve this error, make sure that the
destination
bucket is in the same AWS account as the source bucket.

###### Note

We recommend that you choose a
destination
bucket that's different from the source bucket. When the source bucket and
destination
bucket are the same, additional logs are created for the logs that are written to
the bucket, which can increase your storage bill. These extra logs about logs can
also make it difficult to find the particular logs that you're looking for. For
simpler log management, we recommend saving access logs in a different bucket. For
more information, see [How do I enable log delivery?](serverlogs.md#server-access-logging-overview).

Error: **`The target bucket for logging does not exist`**

The
destination
bucket must exist prior to setting the configuration. This error indicates that the
destination
bucket doesn't exist or can't be found. Make sure that the bucket name is spelled
correctly, and then try again.

Error: **`Target grants not allowed for bucket owner enforced**
**buckets`**

This error indicates that the
destination
bucket uses the
Bucket
owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership. The
Bucket
owner enforced setting doesn't support destination
(target)
grants. For more information, see [Permissions for log delivery](enable-server-access-logging.md#grant-log-delivery-permissions-general).

## Troubleshooting delivery failures

To avoid server access logging issues, make sure that you're following these best
practices:

- **The S3 log delivery group has write access to the**
**destination**
**bucket** – The S3 log delivery group delivers server access
logs to the
destination
bucket. A bucket policy or bucket access control list (ACL) can be used to grant
write access to the
destination
bucket. However, we recommend that you use a bucket policy instead of an ACL.
For more information about how to grant write access to your
destination
bucket, see [Permissions for log delivery](enable-server-access-logging.md#grant-log-delivery-permissions-general).

###### Note

If the
destination
bucket uses the
Bucket
owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, be aware of the following:

- ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. This means
that you can't update your bucket ACL to grant access to the S3 log
delivery group. Instead, to grant access to the logging service
principal, you must update the bucket policy for the
destination
bucket.

- You can't include
destination
grants in your `PutBucketLogging` configuration.

- **The bucket policy for the**
**destination**
**bucket allows access to the logs** – Check the bucket policy
of the
destination
bucket. Search the bucket policy for any statements that contain `"Effect":
                          "Deny"`. Then, verify that the `Deny` statement isn't
preventing access logs from being written to the bucket.

- **S3 Object Lock isn't enabled on the**
**destination**
**bucket** – Check if the
destination
bucket has Object Lock enabled. Object Lock blocks server access log delivery.
You must choose a
destination
bucket that doesn't have Object Lock enabled.

- **Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) is selected if default encryption is enabled**
**on the**
**destination**
**bucket** – You can use default bucket encryption on the
destination
bucket only if you use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
Default server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) is not
supported for server access logging
destination
buckets. For more information about how to enable default encryption, see [Configuring default encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/default-bucket-encryption.html).

- **The**
**destination**
**bucket does not have Requester Pays enabled** – Using a
Requester Pays bucket as the
destination
bucket for server access logging is not supported. To allow delivery of server
access logs, disable the Requester Pays option on the
destination
bucket.

- **Review your AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) and resource control policies (RCPs)** – When
you're using AWS Organizations, check the service control policies and resource control policies to make sure that Amazon S3
access is allowed. These policies specify the maximum permissions for
principals and resources in the affected accounts. Search the policies for any statements that
contain `"Effect": "Deny"` and verify that `Deny`
statements aren't preventing any access logs from being written to the bucket.
For more information, see [Authorization policies in AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_authorization_policies.html) in the _AWS Organizations User_
_Guide_.

- **Allow some time for recent logging configuration changes**
**to take effect** – Enabling server access logging for the
first time, or changing the
destination
bucket for logs, requires time to fully take effect. It might take longer than
an hour for all requests to be properly logged and delivered.

To check for log delivery failures, enable request metrics in Amazon CloudWatch. If the
logs are not delivered within a few hours, look for the `4xxErrors`
metric, which can indicate log delivery failures. For more information about
enabling request metrics, see [Creating a CloudWatch metrics configuration for all the objects in your bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configure-request-metrics-bucket.html).
