## S3 Tables AWS Regions and endpoints

For a list of Regions S3 Tables is currently available in, see [Amazon S3 endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_region). To connect
programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. For more information, see [AWS service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html).

S3 Tables supports dual-stack endpoints for public access and AWS PrivateLink. Dual-stack endpoints allow you to access S3 tables buckets using the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), in addition to the IPv4 protocol, depending on what your network supports.

S3 Tables dual-stack endpoints use the following naming convention:
`s3tables.aws-region.api.aws`
