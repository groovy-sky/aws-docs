# Prerequisites for disabling ACLs

A bucket access control list (ACL) in Amazon S3 is a mechanism that allows you to define granular permissions for individual objects within an S3 bucket, specifying which AWS accounts or groups can access and modify those objects. A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs. We recommend that you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and bucket policies to manage access, and to keep ACLs disabled, except in circumstances where you need to control access for each object individually.

If you have ACLs enabled on your bucket, before you disable ACLs, complete the following prerequisites:

###### Topics

- [Review bucket and object ACLs and migrate ACL permissions](#object-ownership-acl-permissions)

- [Identify requests that required an ACL for authorization](#object-ownership-acl-identify)

- [Review and update bucket policies that use ACL-related condition keys](#object-ownership-bucket-policies)

- [Example use cases](#object-ownership-migrating-acls)

## Review bucket and object ACLs and migrate ACL permissions

When you disable ACLs, permissions granted by bucket and object ACLs no longer
affect access. Before you disable ACLs, review your bucket and object ACLs.

Each of your existing bucket and object ACLs has an equivalent in an IAM policy. The
following bucket policy examples show you how `READ` and `WRITE`
permissions for bucket and object ACLs map to IAM permissions. For more information
about how each ACL translates to IAM permissions, see [Mapping of ACL permissions and access policy permissions](acl-overview.md#acl-access-policy-permission-mapping).

Before you disable ACLs:

- If your bucket ACL grants access outside of your AWS account, first, you must migrate your bucket ACL permissions to your bucket policy.

- Next, reset your bucket ACL to the default private ACL.

- We also recommend that you review your object-level ACL permissions and migrate them to your bucket policy.

If your bucket ACLs grant read or write permissions to others outside of your account, before you can disable ACLs, you must migrate these permissions to your bucket policy. After you migrate these permissions, you can set **Object Ownership** to the _Bucket_
_owner enforced_ setting. If you don't migrate bucket ACLs that grant read or write
access outside of your account, your request to apply the Bucket owner enforced
setting fails and returns the [InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership](object-ownership-error-responses.md#object-ownership-error-responses-invalid-acl)
error code.

If your bucket ACL grants access outside of your AWS account, before you disable ACLs, you
must migrate your bucket ACL permissions to your bucket policy and reset your bucket ACL
to the default private ACL. If you don't migrate and reset, your request to
apply the Bucket owner enforced setting to disable ACLs fails and returns the [InvalidBucketAclWithObjectOwnership](object-ownership-error-responses.md#object-ownership-error-responses-invalid-acl)
error code. We also recommend that you review your object ACL permissions and migrate
them to your bucket policy.

To review and migrate ACL permissions to bucket policies, see the following
topics.

- [Using the AWS CLI to review and migrate ACL permissions](#review-migrate-acl-cli)

### Bucket policies examples

These example bucket policies show you how to migrate `READ` and
`WRITE` bucket and object ACL permissions for a third-party
AWS account to a bucket policy. `READ_ACP` and `WRITE_ACP`
ACLs are less relevant for policies because they grant ACL-related permissions
( `s3:GetBucketAcl`, `s3:GetObjectAcl`,
`s3:PutBucketAcl`, and `s3:PutObjectAcl`).

###### Example– `READ` ACL for a bucket

If your bucket had a `READ` ACL that grants AWS account
`111122223333`
permission to list the contents of your bucket, you can write a bucket policy
that grants `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:ListBucketVersions`,
`s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads` permissions for your bucket.

JSON

```json

{
		"Version":"2012-10-17",
		"Statement": [
			{
				"Sid": "Permission to list the objects in a bucket",
				"Effect": "Allow",
				"Principal": {
					"AWS": [

						"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
					]
				},
				"Action": [
					"s3:ListBucket",
					"s3:ListBucketVersions",
					"s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
				],
				"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket"
			}
		]
	}

```

###### Example– `READ` ACLs for every object in a bucket

If every object in your bucket has a `READ` ACL that grants access to
AWS account `111122223333`,
you can write a bucket policy that grants `s3:GetObject` and
`s3:GetObjectVersion` permissions to this account for every
object in your bucket.

JSON

```json

{
		"Version":"2012-10-17",
		"Statement": [
			{
				"Sid": "Read permission for every object in a bucket",
				"Effect": "Allow",
				"Principal": {
					"AWS": [
						"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
					]
				},
				"Action": [
					"s3:GetObject",
					"s3:GetObjectVersion"
				],
				"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
			}
		]
	}

```

This example resource element grants access to a specific object.

```nohighlight

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/OBJECT-KEY"
```

###### Example– `WRITE` ACL that grants permissions to write objects to a bucket

If your bucket has a `WRITE` ACL that grants AWS account
`111122223333`
permission to write objects to your bucket, you can write a bucket policy that
grants `s3:PutObject` permission for your bucket.

JSON

```json

{
		"Version":"2012-10-17",
		"Statement": [
			{
				"Sid": "Permission to write objects to a bucket",
				"Effect": "Allow",
				"Principal": {
					"AWS": [
						"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
					]
				},
				"Action": [
					"s3:PutObject"
				],
				"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
			}
		]
	}

```

### Using the S3 console to review and migrate ACL permissions

###### To review a bucket's ACL permissions

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the **Buckets** list, choose the bucket name.

3. Choose the **Permissions** tab.

4. Under **Access control list (ACL)**, review your bucket
    ACL permissions.

###### To review an object's ACL permissions

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the **Buckets** list, choose the bucket name
    containing your object.

3. In the **Objects** list, choose your object name.

4. Choose the **Permissions** tab.

5. Under **Access control list (ACL)**, review your object
    ACL permissions.

###### To migrate ACL permissions and update your bucket ACL

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the **Buckets** list, choose the bucket name.

3. On the **Permissions** tab, under **Bucket**
**policy**, choose **Edit**.

4. In the **Policy** box, add or update your bucket
    policy.

For example bucket policies, see [Bucket policies examples](#migrate-acl-permissions-bucket-policies) and [Example use cases](#object-ownership-migrating-acls).

5. Choose **Save changes**.

6. [Update your bucket ACL](managing-acls.md) to remove ACL
    grants to other groups or AWS accounts.

7. [Apply the Bucket owner\
    enforced setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-existing-bucket.html) for Object Ownership.

### Using the AWS CLI to review and migrate ACL permissions

1. To return the bucket ACL for your bucket, use the [get-bucket-acl](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-acl.html) AWS CLI command:

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket
```

For example, this bucket ACL grants `WRITE` and
    `READ` access to a third-party account. In this ACL, the
    third-party account is identified by the [canonical user ID](../../../accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.md#FindCanonicalId). To apply the Bucket owner enforced setting
    and disable ACLs, you must migrate these permissions for the third-party
    account to a bucket policy.

```JSON

{
   		"Owner": {
   			"ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID"
   		},
   		"Grants": [
   			{
   				"Grantee": {
   					"ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID",
   					"Type": "CanonicalUser"
   				},
   				"Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
   			},
   			{
   				"Grantee": {
   					"ID": "72806de9d1ae8b171cca9e2494a8d1335dfced4ThirdPartyAccountCanonicalUserID",
   					"Type": "CanonicalUser"
   				},
   				"Permission": "READ"
   			},
   			{
   				"Grantee": {
   					"ID": "72806de9d1ae8b171cca9e2494a8d1335dfced4ThirdPartyAccountCanonicalUserID",
   					"Type": "CanonicalUser"
   				},
   				"Permission": "WRITE"
   			}
   		]
   	}
```

For other example ACLs, see [Example use cases](#object-ownership-migrating-acls).

2. Migrate your bucket ACL permissions to a bucket policy:

This example bucket policy grants `s3:PutObject` and
    `s3:ListBucket` permissions for a third-party account. In the
    bucket policy, the third-party account is identified by the AWS account ID
    ( `111122223333`).

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --policy file://policy.json

   	policy.json:
   	{
   		"Version": "2012-10-17",
   		"Statement": [
   			{
   				"Sid": "PolicyForCrossAccountAllowUpload",
   				"Effect": "Allow",
   				"Principal": {
   					"AWS": [
   						"arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
   					]
   				},
   				"Action": [
   					"s3:PutObject",
   					"s3:ListBucket"
   				],
   				"Resource": [
   					"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
   					"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
   			}
   		]
   	}
```

For more example bucket policies, see [Bucket policies examples](#migrate-acl-permissions-bucket-policies) and [Example use cases](#object-ownership-migrating-acls).

3. To return the ACL for a specific object, use the [get-object-acl](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-object-acl.html) AWS CLI command.

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-object-acl --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --key EXAMPLE-OBJECT-KEY
```

4. If required, migrate object ACL permissions to your bucket policy.

This example resource element grants access to a specific object in a
    bucket policy.

```nohighlight

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/EXAMPLE-OBJECT-KEY"
```

5. Reset the ACL for your bucket to the default ACL.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --acl private
```

6. [Apply the Bucket owner enforced\
    setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-existing-bucket.html) for Object Ownership.

## Identify requests that required an ACL for authorization

To identify Amazon S3 requests that required ACLs for authorization, you can use the
`aclRequired` value in Amazon S3 server access logs or AWS CloudTrail. If the
request required an ACL for authorization or if you have `PUT` requests
that specify an ACL, the string is `Yes`. If no ACLs were required, or if
you are setting a `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL, or if the
requests are allowed by your bucket policy, the `aclRequired` value
string is " `-`" in Amazon S3 server access logs and is absent in CloudTrail. For
more information about the expected `aclRequired` values, see [aclRequired values for common Amazon S3 requests](acl-overview.md#aclrequired-s3).

If you have `PutBucketAcl` or `PutObjectAcl` requests with headers
that grant ACL-based permissions, with the exception of the
`bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL, you must remove those headers
before you can disable ACLs. Otherwise, your requests will fail.

For all other requests that required an ACL for authorization, migrate those ACL
permissions to bucket policies. Then, remove any bucket ACLs before you enable the
bucket owner enforced setting.

###### Note

Do not remove object ACLs. Otherwise, applications that rely on object ACLs
for permissions will lose access.

If you see that no requests required an ACL for authorization, you can proceed to
disable ACLs. For more information about identifying requests, see [Using Amazon S3 server access logs to identify requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-s3-access-logs-to-identify-requests.html) and [Identifying Amazon S3 requests using CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-request-identification.html).

## Review and update bucket policies that use ACL-related condition keys

After you apply the Bucket owner enforced setting to disable ACLs, new objects can
be uploaded to your bucket only if the request uses bucket owner full control ACLs
or doesn't specify an ACL. Before disabling ACLs, review your bucket policy for
ACL-related condition keys.

If your bucket policy uses an ACL-related condition key to require the
`bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL (for example,
`s3:x-amz-acl`), you don't need to update your bucket policy. The
following bucket policy uses the `s3:x-amz-acl` to require the
`bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL for S3 `PutObject`
requests. This policy _still_ requires the object
writer to specify the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL. However,
buckets with ACLs disabled still accept this ACL, so requests continue to succeed
with no client-side changes required.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "OnlyAllowWritesToMyBucketWithBucketOwnerFullControl",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/ExampleUser"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

However, if your bucket policy uses an ACL-related condition key that requires a
different ACL, you must remove this condition key. This example bucket policy
requires the `public-read` ACL for S3 `PutObject` requests and
therefore must be updated before disabling ACLs.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Only allow writes to my bucket with public read access",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/ExampleUser"                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "public-read"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example use cases

The following examples show you how to migrate ACL permissions to bucket policies
for specific use cases.

###### Topics

- [Grant access to the S3 log delivery group for server access logging](#object-ownership-server-access-logs)

- [Grant public read access to the objects in a bucket](#object-ownership-public-read)

- [Grant Amazon ElastiCache (Redis OSS) access to your S3 bucket](#object-ownership-elasticache-redis)

### Grant access to the S3 log delivery group for server access logging

If you want to apply the Bucket owner enforced setting to disable ACLs for a server access
logging
destination
bucket (also known as a
_target_
_bucket_),
you must migrate bucket ACL permissions for the S3 log delivery group to the
logging service principal ( `logging.s3.amazonaws.com`) in a bucket
policy. For more information about log delivery permissions, see [Permissions for log delivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-server-access-logging.html#grant-log-delivery-permissions-general).

This bucket ACL grants `WRITE` and `READ_ACP` access to
the S3 log delivery group:

```nohighlight

{
    "Owner": {
        "ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID"
    },
    "Grants": [
        {
            "Grantee": {
                "Type": "CanonicalUser",
                "ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID"
            },
            "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
        },
        {
            "Grantee": {
                "Type": "Group",
                "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery"
            },
            "Permission": "WRITE"
        },
        {
            "Grantee": {
                "Type": "Group",
                "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery"
            },
            "Permission": "READ_ACP"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### To migrate bucket ACL permissions for the S3 log delivery group to the logging service principal in a bucket policy

1. Add the following bucket policy to your
    destination
    bucket, replacing the example values.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --policy file://policy.json

policy.json:						{
       {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "S3ServerAccessLogsPolicy",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": "logging.s3.amazonaws.com"
               },
               "Action": [
                   "s3:PutObject"
               ],
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/EXAMPLE-LOGGING-PREFIX*",
               "Condition": {
                   "ArnLike": {
                       "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::SOURCE-BUCKET-NAME"
                   },
                   "StringEquals": {
                       "aws:SourceAccount": "SOURCE-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
}
```

2. Reset the ACL for your
    destination
    bucket to the default ACL.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --acl private
```

3. [Apply the Bucket owner enforced\
    setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-existing-bucket.html) for Object Ownership to your
    destination
    bucket.

### Grant public read access to the objects in a bucket

If your object ACLs grant public read access to all of the objects in your
bucket, you can migrate these ACL permissions to a bucket policy.

This object ACL grants public read access to an object in a bucket:

```nohighlight

{
    "Owner": {
        "ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID"
    },
    "Grants": [
        {
            "Grantee": {
                "ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID",
                "Type": "CanonicalUser"
            },
            "Permission": "FULL_CONTROL"
        },
        {
            "Grantee": {
                "Type": "Group",
                "URI": "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
            },
            "Permission": "READ"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### To migrate public read ACL permissions to a bucket policy

1. To grant public read access to all of the objects in your bucket, add
    the following bucket policy, replacing the example values.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --policy file://policy.json

policy.json:
{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
}
```

To grant public access to a specific object in a bucket policy, use
    the following format for the `Resource` element.

```nohighlight

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/OBJECT-KEY"
```

To grant public access to all of the objects with a specific prefix,
    use the following format for the `Resource` element.

```nohighlight

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/PREFIX/*"
```

2. [Apply the Bucket owner enforced\
    setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-existing-bucket.html) for Object Ownership.

### Grant Amazon ElastiCache (Redis OSS) access to your S3 bucket

You can [export your\
ElastiCache (Redis OSS) backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/backups-exporting.html) to an S3 bucket, which gives you access to the backup
from outside ElastiCache. To export your backup to an S3 bucket, you must grant ElastiCache
permissions to copy a snapshot to the bucket. If you've granted permissions to
ElastiCache in a bucket ACL, you must migrate these permissions to a bucket policy
before you apply the Bucket owner enforced setting to disable ACLs. For more
information, see [Grant ElastiCache access to your Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/backups-exporting.html#backups-exporting-grant-access) in the _Amazon ElastiCache User Guide_.

The following example shows the bucket ACL permissions that grant permissions
to ElastiCache.

```nohighlight

    "Owner": {
        "ID": "852b113e7a2f25102679df27bb0ae12b3f85be6BucketOwnerCanonicalUserID"
    },

###### To migrate bucket ACL permissions for ElastiCache (Redis OSS) to a bucket policy

1. Add the following bucket policy to your bucket, replacing the example
    values.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --policy file://policy.json

policy.json:
{
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "Stmt15399483",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": "Region.elasticache-snapshot.amazonaws.com"
               },
               "Action": [
                   "s3:PutObject",
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:ListBucket",
                   "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                   "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                   "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
}
```

2. Reset the ACL for your bucket to the default ACL:

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-bucket-acl --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --acl private
```

3. [Apply the Bucket owner enforced\
    setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-ownership-existing-bucket.html) for Object Ownership.
