# Create a Batch Replication job for existing replication rules

In Amazon S3, live replication doesn't replicate any objects that already existed in your
source bucket before you created a replication configuration. Live replication automatically
replicates only new and updated objects that are written to the bucket after the replication
configuration is created. To replicate already existing objects, you can use
S3 Batch Replication to replicate these objects on demand.

You can configure S3 Batch Replication for an existing replication configuration by
using the AWS SDKs, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Amazon S3 console. For an overview of
Batch Replication, see [Replicating existing objects with Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-batch.md).

When the Batch Replication job finishes, you receive a completion report. For more
information about how to use the report to examine the job, see [Tracking job status and completion reports](batch-ops-job-status.md).

###### Prerequisites

Before creating your Batch Replication job, you must create a Batch Operations AWS Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role to grant Amazon S3 permissions to perform actions on your behalf. For more
information, see [Configuring an IAM role for S3 Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-policies.md).

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the left navigation pane, choose
     **Batch Operations**.

03. Choose **Create job**.

04. Verify that the **AWS Region** section shows the Region
     where you want to create your job.

05. In the **Manifest** section, specify the manifest format
     that you want to use. The manifest is a list of all of the objects that you
     want to run the specified action on. To learn more about Batch Operations
     manifests, see [Specifying a manifest](batch-ops-create-job.md#specify-batchjob-manifest).

- If you have a manifest prepared, choose **S3 inventory**
**report (manifest.json)** or **CSV**.
If your manifest is in a versioned bucket, you can specify the
version ID for the manifest. If you don't specify a version ID,
Batch Operations uses the current version of your manifest. For more
information about creating a manifest, see [Specifying a manifest](batch-ops-create-job.md#specify-batchjob-manifest).

###### Note

If the objects in your manifest are in a versioned bucket, you
must specify the version IDs for the objects. For more
information, see [Specifying a manifest](batch-ops-create-job.md#specify-batchjob-manifest).

- To create a manifest based on your replication configuration,
choose **Create manifest using S3 Replication**
**configuration**. Then choose the source bucket of your
replication configuration.

06. (Optional) If you chose **Create manifest using S3 Replication**
    **configuration**, you can include additional filters, such as
     the object creation date and replication status. For examples of how to
     filter by replication status, see [Specifying a manifest for a Batch Replication job](s3-batch-replication-batch.md#batch-replication-manifest).

07. (Optional) If you chose **Create manifest using S3 Replication**
    **configuration**, you can save the generated manifest. To save
     this manifest, select **Save Batch Operations manifest**. Then
     specify the destination bucket for the manifest and choose whether to
     encrypt the manifest.

    ###### Note

    The generated manifest must be stored in the same AWS Region as the
    source bucket.

08. Choose **Next**.

09. On the **Operations** page, choose
     **Replicate**, then choose **Next**.

10. (Optional) Provide a **Description**.

11. Adjust the **Priority** of the job if needed. Higher
     numbers indicate higher priority. Amazon S3 attempts to run higher priority jobs
     before lower priority jobs. For more information about job priority, see
     [Assigning job priority](batch-ops-job-priority.md).

12. (Optional) Generate a completion report. To generate this report, select
     **Generate completion report**.

    If you choose to generate a completion report, you must choose either to
     report **Failed tasks only** or **All**
    **tasks**, and provide a destination bucket for the
     report.

13. In the **Permissions** section, make sure that you choose
     an IAM role that has the required permissions for Batch Replication. One
     of the most common causes of replication failures is insufficient
     permissions in the provided IAM role. For information about creating this
     role, see [Configuring an IAM role for S3 Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-policies.md).

14. (Optional) Add job tags to the Batch Replication job.

15. Choose **Next**.

16. Review your job configuration, and then choose **Create**
    **job**.

The following example `create-job` command creates an
S3 Batch Replication job by using an S3 generated manifest for the AWS account
`111122223333`. This example
replicates existing objects and objects that previously failed to replicate. For
information about filtering by replication status, see [Specifying a manifest for a Batch Replication job](s3-batch-replication-batch.md#batch-replication-manifest).

To use this command, replace the `user input
                    placeholders` with your own information. Replace the IAM
role `role/batch-Replication-IAM-policy` with
the IAM role that you previously created. For more information, see [Configuring an IAM role for S3 Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-policies.md).

```nohighlight

aws s3control create-job --account-id 111122223333 \
--operation '{"S3ReplicateObject":{}}' \
--report '{"Bucket":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-completion-report-bucket",\
"Prefix":"batch-replication-report", \
"Format":"Report_CSV_20180820","Enabled":true,"ReportScope":"AllTasks"}' \
--manifest-generator '{"S3JobManifestGenerator": {"ExpectedBucketOwner": "111122223333", \
"SourceBucket": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket", \
"EnableManifestOutput": false, "Filter": {"EligibleForReplication": true, \
"ObjectReplicationStatuses": ["NONE","FAILED"]}}}' \
--priority 1 \
--role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/batch-Replication-IAM-policy \
--no-confirmation-required \
--region source-bucket-region
```

###### Note

You must initiate the job from the same AWS Region as the replication source
bucket.

After you have successfully initiated a Batch Replication job, you receive the
job ID as the response. You can monitor this job by using the following
`describe-job` command. To use this command, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your
own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3control describe-job --account-id 111122223333 --job-id job-id --region source-bucket-region
```

The following example creates an S3 Batch Replication job by using a
user-defined manifest for AWS account
`111122223333`. If the
objects in your manifest are in a versioned bucket, you must specify the version IDs
for the objects. Only the object with the version ID specified in the manifest will
be replicated. For more information about creating a manifest, see [Specifying a manifest](batch-ops-create-job.md#specify-batchjob-manifest).

To use this command, replace the `user input
                    placeholders` with your own information. Replace the IAM
role `role/batch-Replication-IAM-policy` with
the IAM role that you previously created. For more information, see [Configuring an IAM role for S3 Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-policies.md).

```nohighlight

aws s3control create-job --account-id 111122223333 \

"Prefix":"batch-replication-report", \
"Format":"Report_CSV_20180820","Enabled":true,"ReportScope":"AllTasks"}' \
--manifest '{"Spec":{"Format":"S3BatchOperations_CSV_20180820",\
"Fields":["Bucket","Key","VersionId"]},\
"Location":{"ObjectArn":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-manifest-bucket/manifest.csv",\
"ETag":"Manifest Etag"}}' \
--priority 1 \
--role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/batch-Replication-IAM-policy \

--region source-bucket-region
```
