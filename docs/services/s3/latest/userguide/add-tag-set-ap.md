# Add a tag-set through an access point for a general purpose bucket

This section explains how to add a tag-set through an access point for a general purpose bucket using the AWS Management Console,
AWS Command Line Interface, or REST API. For more information, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

###### To add a tag-set through an access point in your AWS account

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the
     currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region that you want to
     list access points for.

03. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose
     **Access Points**.

04. (Optional) Search for access points by name. Only access points in your selected AWS Region will appear here.

05. Choose the name of the access point you want to manage or use.

06. Under the **Objects** tab, select the name of
     the object you wish to add a tag-set to.

07. Under the **Properties** tab, find the **Tags** sub-header and choose **Edit**.

08. Review the objects listed, and choose **Add tag**.

09. Each object tag is a key-value pair. Enter a **Key** and a
     **Value**. To add another tag, choose **Add Tag**.

    You can enter up to 10 tags for an object.

10. Choose **Save changes**.

The following `put-object-tagging` example command shows how you can
use the AWS CLI to add a tag-set through an access point.

The following command adds a tag-set for existing object `puppy.jpg` using access point
`my-access-point`.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object-tagging --bucket arn:aws:s3:AWS Region:111122223333:accesspoint/my-access-point --key puppy.jpg --tagging TagSet=[{Key="animal",Value="true"}]
```

###### Note

S3 automatically generate access point aliases for all access points and access point aliases can be used
anywhere a bucket name is used to perform object-level operations. For more
information, see [Access point aliases](access-points-naming.md#access-points-alias).

For more information and examples, see [put-object-tagging](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/put-object-tagging.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

You can use the REST API to add a tag-set to an object through an access point. For more information, see [PutObjectTagging](../api/api-putobjecttagging.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.
