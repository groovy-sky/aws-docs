# Understanding the Amazon S3 Storage Lens export schemas

S3 Storage Lens export schemas vary depending on your export destination. Choose the appropriate
schema based on whether you're exporting to S3 general purpose buckets or S3 tables.

###### Topics

- [Export schemas for S3 tables](#storage_lens_s3_tables_schema)

## Export schema for S3 general purpose buckets

The following table contains the schema of your S3 Storage Lens metrics export when exporting
to S3 general purpose buckets.

Attribute name Data typeColumn nameDescription`VersionNumber`String`version_number`The version of the S3 Storage Lens metrics being used.`ConfigurationId`String`configuration_id`The ` configuration_id` of your S3 Storage Lens configuration.`ReportDate`String `report_date`The date that the metrics were tracked.`AwsAccountNumber` String `aws_account_number`Your AWS account number.`AwsRegion` String `aws_region`The AWS Region for which the metrics are being tracked.`StorageClass` String `storage_class`The storage class of the bucket in question.`RecordType` ENUM `record_type` The type of artifact that is being reported ( `ACCOUNT`,
`BUCKET`, or `PREFIX`).
`RecordValue` String `record_value`The value of the `RecordType` artifact.

###### Note

The `record_value` is URL-encoded.

`BucketName` String `bucket_name`The name of the bucket that is being reported.`MetricName` String `metric_name`The name of the metric that is being reported.`MetricValue` Long `metric_value`The value of the metric that is being reported.

### Example of an S3 Storage Lens metrics export

The following is an example of an S3 Storage Lens metrics export based on this schema.

###### Note

You can identify metrics for Storage Lens groups by looking for the
`STORAGE_LENS_GROUP_BUCKET` or `STORAGE_LENS_GROUP_ACCOUNT`
values in the `record_type` column. The `record_value` column will
display the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Storage Lens group, for example,
`arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:storage-lens-group/slg-1`.

data.

## Export schemas for S3 tables

When exporting S3 Storage Lens metrics to S3 tables, the data is organized into three separate
table schemas: storage metrics, bucket property metrics, and activity metrics.

- [Bucket property metrics table schema](#storage_lens_s3_tables_bucket_property_metrics)

- [Activity metrics table schema](#storage_lens_s3_tables_activity_metrics)
