## Setting up Kiro with S3 Storage Lens tables

Kiro is an AI coding assistant that provides seamless integration with S3 Tables through the MCP Server. Kiro can help you install and configure the MCP Server directly through its interface, simplifying the setup process.

For more information about Kiro, see [Kiro AI](https://kiro.ai/).

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:

- Kiro installed on your system. Download from [https://kiro.ai/](https://kiro.ai/)

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

- An S3 Storage Lens configuration with S3 Tables export enabled

- Permissions to query S3 Tables. For more information, see [Permissions for S3 Storage Lens tables](storage-lens-s3-tables-permissions.md).

### Step 1: Install the S3 Tables MCP Server

You can install the S3 Tables MCP Server in two ways:

###### Option 1: Using Kiro's built-in MCP server management

Kiro can help you discover and install MCP servers directly through its interface:

1. Open Kiro

2. Access the MCP server management interface (typically through settings or command palette)

3. Search for "S3 Tables" or "awslabs.s3-tables-mcp-server"

4. Follow Kiro's prompts to install and configure the server

###### Option 2: Manual installation using uvx

Alternatively, you can manually install the MCP Server using `uvx`, a Python package runner:

```

uvx awslabs.s3-tables-mcp-server@latest
```

For more information about installing the MCP Server, see the [AWS S3 Tables MCP Server documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/s3-tables-mcp-server).

### Step 2: Configure Kiro MCP settings

Create or update your Kiro MCP configuration file at `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` with the following content:

```json

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.s3-tables-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.s3-tables-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your-aws-profile` with your AWS CLI profile name and `us-east-1` with your AWS Region.

### Step 3: Verify the configuration

After configuring the MCP Server, restart Kiro and verify that the S3 Tables tools are available. You can check the available MCP servers in Kiro's settings or by asking Kiro to list available tools.

## Example use cases with AI assistants

The following examples demonstrate how to use natural language prompts with AI assistants to interact with S3 Storage Lens data.

### Example 1: Query top storage consumers

**Prompt:** "Show me the top 10 buckets by storage consumption from my S3 Storage Lens data."

The AI assistant will use the MCP Server to query your S3 Storage Lens tables and return the results, including bucket names, storage classes, and storage amounts.

### Example 2: Analyze storage growth

**Prompt:** "Analyze my storage growth over the last 30 days and show me the trend."

The AI assistant will query the storage metrics table, calculate daily storage totals, and present the growth trend.

### Example 3: Identify cost optimization opportunities

**Prompt:** "Find buckets with incomplete multipart uploads older than 7 days that are wasting storage."

The AI assistant will query the storage metrics table for incomplete multipart uploads and provide a list of buckets with potential cost savings.

### Example 4: Find cold data candidates

**Prompt:** "Identify prefixes with no activity in the last 100 days that are stored in hot storage tiers."

The AI assistant will analyze both storage and activity metrics to identify data that could be moved to colder storage tiers for cost optimization.

### Example 5: Generate storage reports

**Prompt:** "Create a summary report of my S3 storage showing total storage, object counts, and request patterns for the last week."

The AI assistant will query multiple tables, aggregate the data, and generate a comprehensive report.

## Best practices for using AI assistants

Follow these best practices when using AI assistants with S3 Storage Lens data:

- **Be specific in your prompts** \- Provide clear, specific instructions about what data you want to analyze and what insights you're looking for.

- **Verify AI-generated queries** \- Always review and validate the SQL queries and recommendations that the AI assistant generates before executing them or taking action. AI assistants may occasionally produce incorrect queries or recommendations that need to be verified against your specific use case and data.

- **Use appropriate permissions** \- Ensure that the IAM credentials used by the AI assistant have only the necessary permissions. For read-only analysis, grant only SELECT permissions.

- **Monitor usage** \- Track the queries executed by AI assistants using AWS CloudTrail to maintain audit trails.

- **Start with simple queries** \- Begin with straightforward queries to understand how the AI assistant interprets your prompts, then progress to more complex analysis.

## Logging and traceability

When using the S3 Tables MCP Server with AI assistants, you have multiple ways to audit operations:

- **Local logs** \- The MCP Server logs requests and responses locally. You can specify a log directory using the `--log-dir` configuration option.

- **AWS CloudTrail** \- All S3 Tables operations via the MCP Server using PyIceberg will have `awslabs/mcp/s3-tables-mcp-server/<version>` as the user agent string. You can filter CloudTrail logs by this user agent to trace actions performed by AI assistants.

- **AI assistant history** \- AI assistants like Kiro and Cline maintain history logs that record natural language requests, LLM responses, and instructions provided to the MCP Server.

## Security considerations

When using AI assistants with S3 Storage Lens data, follow these security best practices:
