# Delete your access point for directory buckets

This section explains how to delete your access point using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, REST API, or AWS SDKs.

###### Note

Before you can delete a directory bucket attached to an access point, you must delete the access point.

###### To delete access points for directory buckets in your AWS account

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region that you want to list access points for.

3. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Access points for directory buckets**.

4. (Optional) Search for access points by name. Only access points in your selected AWS Region will appear here.

5. Choose the name of the access point you want to delete.

6. Choose **Delete**.

7. To confirm deletion, type `confirm` and choose **Delete**.

The following `delete-access-point` example command shows how you can use
the AWS CLI to delete your access point.

The following command deletes the access point `my-access-point`-- `zoneID`--xa-s3 for AWS account `111122223333`.

```bash,zsh,sh

aws s3control delete-access-point --name my-access-point--zoneID--xa-s3 --account-id 111122223333
```
