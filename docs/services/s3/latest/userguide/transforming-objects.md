# Transforming objects with S3 Object Lambda

###### Note

As of November 7th, 2025, S3 Object Lambda is available only to existing customers that are currently using the service as well as to select AWS Partner Network (APN) partners. For capabilities similar to S3 Object Lambda, learn more here - [Amazon S3 Object Lambda availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/amazons3-ol-change.html).

With Amazon S3 Object Lambda, you can add your own code to Amazon S3 `GET`, `LIST`,
and `HEAD` requests to modify and process data as it is returned to an
application. You can use custom code to modify the data returned by S3 `GET`
requests to filter rows, dynamically resize and watermark images, redact confidential data,
and more. You can also use S3 Object Lambda to modify the output of S3 `LIST` requests to
create a custom view of all objects in a bucket and S3 `HEAD` requests to modify
object metadata such as object name and size. You can use S3 Object Lambda as an origin for your
Amazon CloudFront distribution to tailor data for end users, such as automatically resizing images,
transcoding older formats (like from JPEG to WebP), or stripping metadata. For more information, see the
AWS Blog post

Powered by AWS Lambda
functions, your code runs on infrastructure that is fully managed by AWS. Using S3 Object Lambda
reduces the need to create and store derivative copies of your data or to run proxies, all
with no need to change your applications.

###### How S3 Object Lambda works

S3 Object Lambda uses AWS Lambda functions to automatically process the output of standard S3
`GET`, `LIST`, or `HEAD` requests. AWS Lambda is a
serverless compute service that runs customer-defined code without requiring management
of underlying compute resources. You can author and run your own custom Lambda functions,
tailoring the data transformation to your specific use cases.

After you configure a Lambda function, you attach it to an S3 Object Lambda service endpoint, known as
an _Object Lambda Access Point_. The Object Lambda Access Point uses a standard S3 access point, known as a
_supporting access point_, to access data.

When you send a request to your Object Lambda Access Point, Amazon S3 automatically calls your Lambda function. Any
data retrieved by using an S3 `GET`, `LIST`, or `HEAD`
request through the Object Lambda Access Point returns a transformed result back to the application. All other
requests are processed as normal, as illustrated in the following diagram.
