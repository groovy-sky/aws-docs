# Monitoring and logging access points for directory buckets

You can log requests made through access points and requests made to the APIs that
manage access points, such as `CreateAccessPoint` and
`GetAccessPointPolicy,` by using AWS CloudTrail. CloudTrail log entries for requests made through access points include the access point ARN (which includes the access point name) in the
`resources` section of the log.

For example, suppose you have the following configuration:

- A bucket named
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--zone-id--x-s3`
in Region `region` that contains an
object named `my-image.jpg`.

- An access point named `my-bucket-ap--zoneID--xa-s3` that is
associated with
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket--zone-id--x-s3`

- An AWS account ID of
`123456789012`

The following example shows the `resources` section of a CloudTrail log entry
for the preceding configuration:

```nohighlight

"resources": [
        {"type": "AWS::S3Express::Object",

            "ARN": "arn:aws:s3express-region:123456789012:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket--zone-id--x-s3/my-image.jpg"
        },
        {"accountId": "c",
            "type": "AWS::S3Express::DirectoryBucket",
            "ARN": "arn:aws::s3express:region:123456789012:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket--zone-id--x-s3"
        },
        {"accountId": "123456789012",
            "type": "AWS::S3::AccessPoint",
            "ARN": "arn:aws:s3express:region:123456789012:accesspoint/my-bucket-ap--zoneID--xa-s3"
        }
    ]
```
