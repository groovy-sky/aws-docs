# IAM identity-based policies for directory buckets

Before you can create directory buckets, you must grant the necessary permissions to your
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role or users. This example policy allows access to the
`CreateSession` API operation (for use with Zonal endpoint \[object level\] API
operations) and all of the Regional endpoint (bucket-level) API operations. This policy
allows the `CreateSession` API operation for use with all directory buckets, but
the Regional endpoint API operations are allowed only for use with the specified directory
bucket. To use this example policy, replace the `user input
                placeholders` with your own information.
