# Viewing metrics with Amazon S3 Storage Lens

S3 Storage Lens aggregates your metrics and displays the information in the **Account snapshot** section on the
Amazon S3 console **Buckets** page. S3 Storage Lens also provides an interactive dashboard that you can use to visualize insights and
trends, flag outliers, and receive recommendations for optimizing storage costs and applying data protection best practices. Your dashboard has
drill-down options to generate and visualize insights at the organization, account, AWS Region, storage class, bucket, prefix, or
Storage Lens group level. You can also send a daily metrics report in CSV or Parquet format to a general purpose S3 bucket or export
the metrics directly to an AWS-managed S3 table bucket.

By default, all dashboards are configured with free metrics, which include metrics that
you can use to understand usage and activity across your S3 storage, optimize your storage
costs, and implement data-protection and access-management best practices. Free metrics are
aggregated down to the bucket level. With free metrics, data is available for queries for up to 14
days.

Advanced metrics and recommendations include the following additional features that you
can use to gain further insight into usage and activity across your storage and best practices
for optimizing your storage:

- Contextual recommendations (available only in the dashboard)

- Advanced metrics (including activity metrics aggregated by bucket)

- Prefix aggregation

- Storage Lens group aggregation

- Storage Lens group aggregation

- Amazon CloudWatch publishing

Advanced metrics data is available for queries for 15 months. There are additional charges
for using S3 Storage Lens with advanced metrics. For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing). For more information about free and advanced metrics,
