# Maintenance for tables

S3 Tables offers maintenance operations to enhance the management and performance of your individual
tables. The following options are enabled by default for all tables in table buckets. You can edit or
disable these by specifying maintenance configuration files for your S3 table.

Editing this configuration requires the
`s3tables:GetTableMaintenanceConfiguration` and
`s3tables:PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` permissions.

###### Note

You can track S3 Tables automated maintenance operations on your tables through CloudTrail logs, for more information, see [CloudTrail management events for S3 Tables maintenance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-logging.html#s3-tables-maintenance-events).

## Compaction

Compaction is configured at the table level and combines multiple smaller objects into fewer, larger objects to improve Apache Iceberg
query performance. When combining objects, compaction also applies the effects of
row-level deletes in your table.

Compaction is enabled by default for all tables, with a default target file size of 512MB, or a custom value you specify between 64MB to 512MB. The compacted files are
written as the most recent snapshot of your table.

###### Note

Compaction is supported on Apache Parquet, Avro, and ORC file types.

### Compaction Strategies

You can choose from multiple compaction strategies which can further increase query performance depending on your query patterns and table sort order.

S3 Tables supports these compaction strategies for tables:

- **Auto (Default)**

- Amazon S3 selects the best compaction strategy based on your table sort order. This is the default compaction strategy for all tables.

- For tables with a defined sort order in their metadata, `auto` will automatically apply `sort` compaction.

- For tables without a sort order, `auto` will default to using `binpack` compaction.

- **Binpack**

- Combines small files into larger files, typically targeting sizes over 100MB, while applying any pending deletes. This is the default compaction strategy for unsorted tables.

- **Sort**

- Organizes data based on specified columns which are sorted automatically by hierarchy during compaction, improving query performance for filtered operations. This strategy is recommended when your queries frequently filter on specific columns. When you use this strategy, S3 Tables automatically applies hierarchical sorting on columns when a `sort_order` is defined in table properties.

- **Z-order**

- Optimizes data organization by blending multiple attributes into a single scalar value that can be used for sorting, allowing efficient querying across multiple dimensions. This strategy is recommended when you need to query data across multiple dimensions simultaneously. This strategy requires you to define a sort order in your Iceberg table properties using the `sort_order` table property.

Compaction will incur additional costs. The `z-order` and `sort` compaction strategies may incur a higher cost than `binpack`. For more information, see the pricing information in the . [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

### Compaction Examples

The following examples show configurations for table compaction.

**To configure the compaction target file size by using the AWS CLI**

The minimum target compaction file size is 64MB; the maximum is 512MB.

The following example will change the target file size to 256MB using the
`PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` API.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables put-table-maintenance-configuration \
   --table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 \
   --type icebergCompaction \
   --namespace mynamespace \
   --name testtable \
   --value='{"status":"enabled","settings":{"icebergCompaction":{"targetFileSizeMB":256}}}'
```

For more information, see [put-table-maintenance-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3tables/put-table-maintenance-configuration.html) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

**To configure the compaction strategy by using the AWS CLI**

The following example will change the compaction strategy to `sort` using the
`PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` API. When setting compaction you can choose from the following compaction strategies: `auto`, `binpack`, `sort`, or `z-order`

###### Note

To set the compaction strategy to `sort` or `z-order` you need the following prerequisites:

- A sort order defined in your Iceberg table properties.

- The `s3tables:GetTableData` permission.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables put-table-maintenance-configuration \
   --table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket \
   --type icebergCompaction \
   --namespace mynamespace \
   --name testtable \
   --value='{"status":"enabled","settings":{"icebergCompaction":{"strategy":"sort"}}}'
```

For more information, see [put-table-maintenance-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3tables/put-table-maintenance-configuration.html) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

**To disable compaction by using the AWS CLI**

The following example will disable compaction using the
`PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` API.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables put-table-maintenance-configuration \
   --table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket \
   --type icebergCompaction \
   --namespace mynamespace \
   --name testtable \
   --value='{"status":"disabled","settings":{"icebergCompaction":{"targetFileSizeMB":256}}}'
```

## Snapshot management

Snapshot management determines the number of active snapshots for your table.
This is based on the `MinimumSnapshots` (1 by default) and
`MaximumSnapshotAge` (120 hours by default). Snapshot management expires
and removes table snapshots based on these configurations.

When a snapshot expires, Amazon S3 marks any objects referenced only by that snapshot as noncurrent. These
noncurrent objects are deleted after the number of days specified by the `NoncurrentDays`
property in your unreferenced file removal policy.

###### Note

Deletes of noncurrent objects are permanent with no way to recover these objects.

To view or recover objects that has been marked as noncurrent you must contact AWS Support. For
information about contacting AWS Support, see [Contact AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us) or the [AWS Support\
Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/aws-support).

Snapshot management determines the objects to delete from your table with
references only to that table. References to these objects from outside the table will not prevent snapshot management from deleting them.

###### Note

Snapshot management does not support retention values you configure as Iceberg
table properties in the `metadata.json` file or through an
`ALTER TABLE SET TBLPROPERTIES` SQL command, including branch or
tag-based retention. Snapshot management is disabled when you
configure a branch or tag-based retention policy, or configure a retention policy on
the `metadata.json` file that is longer than the values
configured through the `PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` API. In these
cases S3 will not expire or remove snapshots and you will need to manually delete
snapshots or remove the properties from your Iceberg table to avoid storage
charges.

You can only configure snapshot management at the table level. For more information,
see the pricing information in the [Amazon S3\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

### Snapshot Management Examples

The following examples show configurations for table snapshot management.

**To configure the snapshot management by using the AWS CLI**

The following example will set the `MinimumSnapshots` to 10 and
the `MaximumSnapshotAge` to 2500 hours using the
`PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` API.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables put-table-maintenance-configuration \
--table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket \
--namespace my_namespace \
--name my_table \
--type icebergSnapshotManagement \
--value '{"status":"enabled","settings":{"icebergSnapshotManagement":{"minSnapshotsToKeep":10,"maxSnapshotAgeHours":2500}}}'
```

**To disable snapshot management by using the AWS CLI**

The following example will disable snapshot management using the
`PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` API.

```nohighlight

aws s3tables put-table-maintenance-configuration \
--table-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket \
--namespace my_namespace \
--name my_table \
--type icebergSnapshotManagement \
--value '{"status":"disabled","settings":{"icebergSnapshotManagement":{"minSnapshotsToKeep":1,"maxSnapshotAgeHours":120}}}'
```
