# Specifying dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS)

You can apply encryption when you are either uploading a new object or copying an existing
object.

You can specify DSSE-KMS by using the Amazon S3 console, Amazon S3 REST API, and the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI). For more information, see the following topics.

###### Note

You can use multi-Region AWS KMS keys in Amazon S3. However, Amazon S3 currently treats multi-Region keys
as though they were single-Region keys, and does not use the multi-Region features of the key. For more
information, see
[Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Note

If you want to use a KMS key that is owned by a different
account, you must have permission to use the key. For more information about cross-account permissions for KMS keys,
see [Creating KMS keys that other accounts can use](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.html#cross-account-console) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

This section describes how to set or change the type of encryption of an object to
use dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (DSSE-KMS) by
using the Amazon S3 console.

###### Note

- You can change an object's encryption if your object is less than 5 GB. If your object is greater than 5 GB, you must use the [AWS CLI](mpu-upload-object.md#UsingCLImpUpload) or [AWS SDKs](copyingobjectsmpuapi.md) to change an object's encryption.

- For a list of additional permissions required to change an object's encryption, see [Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations](using-with-s3-policy-actions.md). For example policies that grant this permission, see [Identity-based policy examples for Amazon S3](example-policies-s3.md).

- If you change an object's encryption, a new object is created to replace the old one.
If S3 Versioning is enabled, a new version of the object is created, and the existing
object becomes an older version. The role that changes the property also becomes the owner
of the new object (or object version).

###### To add or change encryption for an object

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Buckets**, and then choose
     the **General purpose buckets** tab. Navigate to the Amazon S3 bucket or
     folder that contains the objects you want to change.

03. Select the check box for the objects you want to
     change.

04. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Edit server-side encryption** from
     the list of options that appears.

05. Scroll to the **Server-side encryption** section.

06. Under **Encryption settings**, choose **Use bucket settings for default encryption** or **Override bucket settings for default encryption**.

07. If you chose **Override bucket settings for default encryption**,
     configure the following encryption settings.
    1. Under **Encryption type**, choose **Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service keys (DSSE-KMS)**.

    2. Under **AWS KMS key**, do one of the following to choose your
        KMS key:

- To choose from a list of available KMS keys, choose **Choose from your**
**AWS KMS keys**, and then choose your **KMS key** from
the list of available keys.

Both the AWS managed key ( `aws/s3`) and your customer managed keys appear in this
list. For more information about customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and AWS\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- To enter the KMS key ARN, choose **Enter AWS KMS key ARN**,
and then enter your KMS key ARN in the field that appears.

- To create a new customer managed key in the AWS KMS console, choose **Create a**
**KMS key**.

For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see [Creating\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Important

You can use only KMS keys that are available in the same AWS Region
as the bucket. The Amazon S3 console lists only the first 100 KMS keys in
the same Region as the bucket. To use a KMS key that is not listed,
you must enter your KMS key ARN. If you want to use a KMS key that
is owned by a different account, you must first have permission to use
the key, and then you must enter the KMS key ARN.

Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys, and not asymmetric
KMS keys. For more information, see [Identifying\
asymmetric KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-symm-asymm.html) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
08. For **Bucket Key**, choose **Disable**.
     S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported for DSSE-KMS.

09. Under **Additional copy settings**, choose whether you want to **Copy source settings**, **Don’t specify settings**, or **Specify settings**. **Copy source settings** is the default option. If you only want to copy the object without the source settings attributes, choose **Don’t specify settings**. Choose **Specify settings** to specify settings for storage class, ACLs, object tags, metadata, server-side encryption, and additional checksums.

10. Choose **Save changes**.

###### Note

This action applies encryption to all specified objects. When you're encrypting folders,
wait for the save operation to finish before adding new objects to the folder.

When you create an object—that is, when you upload a new object or copy an
existing object—you can specify the use of dual-layer server-side encryption
with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS) to encrypt your data. To do this, add the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to the request. Set the value
of the header to the encryption algorithm `aws:kms:dsse`. Amazon S3 confirms
that your object is stored with DSSE-KMS encryption by returning the response header
`x-amz-server-side-encryption`.

If you specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header with a value of
`aws:kms:dsse`, you can also use the following request headers:

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id: SSEKMSKeyId`

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context: SSEKMSEncryptionContext`

### Amazon S3 REST API operations that support DSSE-KMS

The following REST API operations accept the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption`,
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, and
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-context` request headers.

- [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md) – When you upload data by
using the `PUT` API operation, you can specify these request
headers.

- [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md) – When you copy an object,
you have both a source object and a target object. When you pass
DSSE-KMS headers with the `CopyObject` operation, they are applied
only to the target object. When you're copying an existing object,
regardless of whether the source object is encrypted or not, the
destination object is not encrypted unless you explicitly request
server-side encryption.

- [POST Object](../api/restobjectpost.md)
– When you use a `POST` operation to upload an object,
instead of the request headers, you provide the same information in the
form fields.

- [CreateMultipartUpload](../api/api-createmultipartupload.md) – When you
upload large objects by using a multipart upload, you can specify these
headers in the `CreateMultipartUpload` request.

The response headers of the following REST API operations return the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption` header when an object is stored
with server-side encryption.

- [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md)

- [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md)

- [POST\
Object](../api/restobjectpost.md)

- [CreateMultipartUpload](../api/api-createmultipartupload.md)

- [UploadPart](../api/api-uploadpart.md)

- [UploadPartCopy](../api/api-uploadpartcopy.md)

- [CompleteMultipartUpload](../api/api-completemultipartupload.md)

- [GetObject](../api/api-getobject.md)

- [HeadObject](../api/api-headobject.md)

###### Important

- All `GET` and `PUT` requests for an object that's
protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them by using Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature
Version 4.

- If your object uses DSSE-KMS, don't send encryption request headers for
`GET` requests and `HEAD` requests, or
you'll get an **`HTTP 400 (Bad Request)`**
error.

### Encryption context ( `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`)

If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse`, the Amazon S3 API
supports an encryption context with the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`
header. An encryption context is a set of key-value pairs that contain additional
contextual information about the data.

Amazon S3 automatically uses the object's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) as the
encryption context pair; for example,
`arn:aws:s3:::object_ARN`.

You can optionally provide an additional encryption context pair by using the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-context` header. However, because the
encryption context is not encrypted, make sure it does not include sensitive information.
Amazon S3 stores this additional key pair alongside the default encryption context.

For information about the encryption context in Amazon S3, see [Encryption context](usingkmsencryption.md#encryption-context). For general
information about the encryption context, see [AWS Key Management Service Concepts -\
Encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

### AWS KMS key ID ( `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`)

You can use the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header to
specify the ID of the customer managed key that's used to protect the data. If you specify
the `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse` header but don't
provide the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header,
Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed key ( `aws/s3`) to protect the data. If
you want to use a customer managed key, you must provide the
`x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header of the
customer managed key.

###### Important

When you use an AWS KMS key for server-side encryption in Amazon S3, you must choose a symmetric encryption KMS key.
Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys. For more information about these keys, see
[Symmetric encryption KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#symmetric-cmks) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

When you upload a new object or copy an existing object, you can specify the use
of DSSE-KMS to encrypt your data. To do this, add the `--server-side-encryption
                    aws:kms:dsse` parameter to the request. Use the `--ssekms-key-id
                        example-key-id` parameter to add your
[customer managed\
AWS KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk) that you created. If you specify
`--server-side-encryption aws:kms:dsse`, but do not provide an AWS KMS
key ID, then Amazon S3 will use the AWS managed key ( `aws/s3`).

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --key example-object-key --server-side-encryption aws:kms:dsse --ssekms-key-id example-key-id --body filepath
```

You can encrypt an unencrypted object to use DSSE-KMS by copying the object back
in place.

```nohighlight

aws s3api copy-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket --key example-object-key --copy-source amzn-s3-demo-bucket/example-object-key --server-side-encryption aws:kms:dsse --ssekms-key-id example-key-id
```
