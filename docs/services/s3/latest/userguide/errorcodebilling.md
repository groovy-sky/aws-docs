# Billing for Amazon S3 error responses

In general, S3 bucket owners are billed for requests with
HTTP `200 OK` successful responses and HTTP `4XX` client error responses. Bucket owners aren't billed for HTTP `5XX` server error responses, such as HTTP `503 Slow Down` errors.

For more information about billing charges if your bucket is configured as a Requester Pays bucket, see [How Requester Pays charges work](requesterpaysbuckets.md#ChargeDetails).

The following table lists specific error codes under HTTP `3XX` and `4XX` status codes that aren't billed. For buckets configured with website hosting,
applicable request and other charges will still apply when S3 returns a [custom error document](customerrordocsupport.md) or for custom redirects.

###### Note

For `AccessDenied` (HTTP `403 Forbidden`), S3 doesn't charge the bucket owner when the request is initiated outside of the bucket owner's individual AWS account or the bucket owner's AWS organization.

HTTP status codeError codeDescription of error code301 Moved PermanentlyPermanentRedirectThe bucket that you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified
endpoint. Send all future requests to this endpoint.PermanentRedirectControlErrorThe API operation you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Send all future requests to this endpoint.307 Temporary RedirectTemporaryRedirectYou are being redirected to the bucket while the Domain Name System (DNS) server is
being updated.400 Bad RequestAuthorizationHeaderMalformedThe authorization header that you provided is not valid.AuthorizationQueryParametersErrorThe authorization query parameters that you provided are not valid.ConnectionClosedByRequesterReturned to the original caller when an error is encountered while reading the WriteGetObjectResponse body.DeviceNotActiveErrorThe device is not currently active.EndpointNotFoundDirect requests to the correct endpoint.ExpiredTokenThe provided token has expired.IllegalLocationConstraintExceptionYou are trying to access a bucket from a different Region than where the bucket exists.
To avoid this error, use the `--region` option. For example:
`aws s3 cp awsexample.txt
							s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/ --region
							ap-east-1`.InvalidArgument

This error might occur for the following reasons:

- The specified argument was not valid.

- The request was missing a required header.

format.

- The specified argument must have a length greater than or equal to 3.

InvalidBucketOwnerAWSAccountIDThe value of the expected bucket owner parameter must be an AWS account ID.InvalidDigestThe Content-MD5 or checksum value that you specified is not valid.InvalidEncryptionAlgorithmErrorThe encryption request that you specified is not valid. The valid value is
`AES256`.InvalidHostHeaderThe host headers provided in the request used the incorrect style addressing.InvalidHttpMethodThe request is made using an unexpected HTTP method.InvalidRequest

This error might occur for the following reasons:

- The request is using the wrong signature version. Use `AWS4-HMAC-SHA256`
(Signature Version 4).

- An access point can be created only for an existing bucket.

- The access point is not in a state where it can be deleted.

- An access point can be listed only for an existing bucket.

- SOAP requests must be made over an HTTPS
connection.

names.

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is not supported for buckets with periods (.) in their
names.

- The Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration endpoint supports only virtual style requests.

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is not configured on this bucket.

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is disabled on this bucket.

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is not supported on this bucket. For assistance, contact
[Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration cannot be enabled on this bucket. For assistance, contact
[Support](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us).

InvalidSessionExceptionReturned if the session doesn't exist anymore because it timed out or expired.InvalidSignatureThe request signature that the server calculated does not match the signature that you provided. Check your AWS secret access key and signing method. For more information, see [Signing and authenticating REST requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RESTAuthentication.html).InvalidSOAPRequestThe SOAP request body is not valid.InvalidStorageClassThe storage class that you specified is not valid.InvalidTagYour request contains tag input that is not valid. For example, your request might
contain duplicate keys, keys or values that are too long, or system
tags.InvalidTokenThe provided token is malformed or otherwise not valid.InvalidURIThe specified URI couldn't be parsed.KeyTooLongErrorYour key is too long.KMS.DisabledExceptionThe request was rejected because the specified KMS key is not enabled.KMS.InvalidKeyUsageExceptionThe request was rejected for one of the following reasons:

- The KeyUsage value of the KMS key is incompatible with the API operation.

- The encryption algorithm or signing algorithm specified for the operation is incompatible with the type of key material in the KMS key (KeySpec).

For encrypting, decrypting, re-encrypting, and generating data keys, the KeyUsage must be ENCRYPT\_DECRYPT. For signing and verifying messages, the KeyUsage must be SIGN\_VERIFY. For generating and verifying message authentication codes (MACs), the KeyUsage must be GENERATE\_VERIFY\_MAC. For deriving key agreement secrets, the KeyUsage must be KEY\_AGREEMENT. To find the KeyUsage of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.

To find the encryption or signing algorithms supported for a particular KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation.KMS.KMSInvalidStateExceptionThe request was rejected because the state of the specified resource is not valid for this request.
This exception means one of the following:

- The key state of the KMS key is not compatible with the operation.

To find the key state, use the DescribeKey operation. For more information about which key states are compatible with each KMS operation, see [Key states of AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- For cryptographic operations on KMS keys in custom key stores, this exception represents a general failure with many possible causes. To identify the cause, see the error message that accompanies the exception.
