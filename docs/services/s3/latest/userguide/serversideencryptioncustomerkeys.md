# Using server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)

Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption encrypts only
the object data, not the object metadata. You can use server-side encryption with
customer-provided keys (SSE-C) in your general purpose buckets to encrypt your data with your own encryption keys. With the encryption
key that you provide as part of your request, Amazon S3 manages data encryption as it writes to
disks and data decryption when you access your objects. Therefore, you don't need to
maintain any code to perform data encryption and decryption. The only thing that you need to
do is manage the encryption keys that you provide.

Most modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer use SSE-C because it lacks the flexibility of server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). SSE-C's requirement to provide the encryption key each time you interact with your SSE-C encrypted data makes it impractical to share your SSE-C key with other users, roles, or AWS services who read data from your S3 buckets in order to operate on your data. Due to the widespread support for SSE-KMS across AWS, most modern workloads do not use SSE-C encryption because it lacks the flexibility of SSE-KMS. To learn more about SSE-KMS, see [Using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)](usingkmsencryption.md).

If you want to prevent SSE-C encryption from being used for objects written to your bucket, you can block SSE-C encryption when changing your bucket's default encryption configuration. When SSE-C is blocked for a general purpose bucket, any `PutObject`, `CopyObject`, `PostObject`, Multipart Upload or replication requests that specify SSE-C encryption will be rejected with an `HTTP 403 AccessDenied` error. To learn more about blocking SSE-C, see [Blocking or unblocking SSE-C for a general purpose bucket](blocking-unblocking-s3-c-encryption-gpb.md).

There are no additional charges for using SSE-C. However, requests to configure and use SSE-C
incur standard Amazon S3 request charges. For information about pricing, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

###### Important

As [announced on November 19, 2025](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/advanced-notice-amazon-s3-to-disable-the-use-of-sse-c-encryption-by-default-for-all-new-buckets-and-select-existing-buckets-in-april-2026), Amazon Simple Storage Service is deploying a new default bucket security setting that automatically disables server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) for all new general purpose buckets. For existing buckets in AWS accounts with no SSE-C encrypted objects, Amazon S3 will also disable SSE-C for all new write requests. For AWS accounts with SSE-C usage, Amazon S3 will not change the bucket encryption configuration on any of the existing buckets in those accounts. This deployment started on April 6, 2026, and will complete over the next few weeks in 37 AWS Regions, including the AWS China and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

With these changes, applications that need SSE-C encryption must deliberately enable SSE-C by using the [PutBucketEncryption](../api/api-putbucketencryption.md) API operation after creating a new bucket. For more information about this change, see [Default SSE-C setting for new buckets FAQ](default-s3-c-encryption-setting-faq.md).

## Considerations before using SSE-C

- S3 never stores the encryption key when you use SSE-C. You must supply the encryption key
every time you want anyone to download your SSE-C encrypted data from S3.

- You manage a mapping of which encryption key was used to encrypt which object. You are
responsible for tracking which encryption key you provided for which
object. That also means if you lose the encryption key, you lose the
object.

- Because you manage encryption keys on the client side, you manage any additional
safeguards, such as key rotation, on the client side.

- This design can make it difficult to share your SSE-C key with other users, roles, or
AWS services you to operate on your data. Due to the widespread
support for SSE-KMS across AWS, most modern workloads do not use SSE-C
because it lacks the flexibility of SSE-KMS. To learn more about
SSE-KMS, see [Using server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS)](usingkmsencryption.md).

- This means that objects encrypted with SSE-C cannot be natively decrypted by AWS
managed services.

- You must use HTTPS when specifying SSE-C headers on your requests.

- Amazon S3 rejects any requests made over HTTP when using SSE-C. For security considerations,
we recommend that you consider any key that you erroneously send over
HTTP to be compromised. Discard the key and rotate as appropriate.

- If your bucket is versioning-enabled, each object version that you upload can have its own
encryption key. You are responsible for tracking which encryption key was used
for which object version.

- SSE-C is not supported in the Amazon S3 Console. You cannot use the Amazon S3 console to upload an
object and specify SSE-C encryption. You also cannot use the console to update
(for example, change the storage class or add metadata) an existing object
stored using SSE-C.
