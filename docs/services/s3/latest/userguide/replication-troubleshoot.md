## Troubleshooting tips for S3 Replication

If object replicas don't appear in the destination bucket after you configure replication,
use these troubleshooting tips to identify and fix issues.

- The majority of objects replicate within 15 minutes. The time that it takes Amazon S3 to
replicate an object depends on several factors, including the source and destination
Region pair, and the size of the object. For large objects, replication can take up to
several hours. For visibility into replication times, you can use [S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC)](replication-time-control.md#enabling-replication-time-control).

If the object that is being replicated is large, wait a while before checking to see
whether it appears in the destination. You can also check the replication status of the
source object. If the object replication status is `PENDING`, Amazon S3 hasn't
completed the replication. If the object replication status is `FAILED`, check
the replication configuration that's set on the source bucket.

Additionally, to receive information about failures during replication, you can set up
Amazon S3 Event Notifications replication to receive failure events. For more information, see
[Receiving replication failure events with Amazon S3 Event Notifications](replication-metrics.md).

- To check the replication status of an object, you can call the `HeadObject`
API operation. The `HeadObject` API operation returns the `PENDING`,
`COMPLETED`, or `FAILED` replication status of an object. In a
response to a `HeadObject` API call, the replication status is returned in the
`x-amz-replication-status` header.

###### Note

To run `HeadObject`, you must have read access to the object that you're
requesting. A `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET`
request, without performing a `GET` operation. For example, to run a
`HeadObject` request by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you can run the
following command. Replace the `user input
                placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api head-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket --key index.html
```

- If `HeadObject` returns objects with a `FAILED` replication
status, you can use S3 Batch Replication to replicate those failed objects. For more
information, see [Replicating existing objects with Batch Replication](s3-batch-replication-batch.md). Alternatively, you can
re-upload the failed objects to the source bucket, which will initiate replication for the
new objects.

- In the replication configuration on the source bucket, verify the following:

- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the destination bucket is correct.

- The key name prefix is correct. For example, if you set the configuration to
replicate objects with the prefix `Tax`, then only objects with key names
such as `Tax/document1` or `Tax/document2` are replicated. An
object with the key name `document3` is not replicated.

- The status of the replication rule is `Enabled`.

- Verify that versioning hasn't been suspended on any bucket in the replication
configuration. Both the source and destination buckets must have versioning
enabled.

- If a replication rule is set to **Change object ownership to the destination**
**bucket owner**, then the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that's used for replication
must have the `s3:ObjectOwnerOverrideToBucketOwner` permission. This permission
is granted on the resource (in this case, the destination bucket). For example, the
following `Resource` statement shows how to grant this permission on the
destination bucket:

```nohighlight

{
    "Effect":"Allow",
    "Action":[
      "s3:ObjectOwnerOverrideToBucketOwner"
    ],
    "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
}
```

- If the destination bucket is owned by another account, the owner of the destination
bucket must also grant the `s3:ObjectOwnerOverrideToBucketOwner` permission to
the source bucket owner through the destination bucket policy. To use the following
example bucket policy, replace the `user input
                placeholders` with your own information:
JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1644945280205",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "Stmt1644945277847",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/s3-replication-role"
        },
        "Action": [
          "s3:ReplicateObject",
          "s3:ReplicateTags",
          "s3:ObjectOwnerOverrideToBucketOwner"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket/*"
      }
    ]
}

```

###### Note

If the destination bucket's object ownership settings include **Bucket owner**
**enforced**, then you don't need to update the setting to **Change**
**object ownership to the destination bucket owner** in the replication rule.
The object ownership change will occur by default. For more information about changing
replica ownership, see [Changing the replica\
owner](replication-change-owner.md).

- If you're setting the replication configuration in a cross-account scenario, where the
source and destination buckets are owned by different AWS accounts, the destination
buckets can't be configured as a Requester Pays bucket. For more information, see [Using Requester Pays general purpose buckets for storage transfers and usage](requesterpaysbuckets.md).

- If a bucket's source objects are encrypted by using server-side encryption with
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), then the replication rule must be configured to include
AWS KMS-encrypted objects. Make sure to select **Replicate objects encrypted with**
**AWS KMS** under your **Encryption** settings in the Amazon S3
console. Then, select an AWS KMS key for encrypting the destination objects.

###### Note

If the destination bucket is in a different account, specify an AWS KMS customer managed key
that is owned by the destination account. Don't use the default Amazon S3 managed key
( `aws/s3`). Using the default key encrypts the objects with the Amazon S3
managed key that's owned by the source account, preventing the object from being shared
with another account. As a result, the destination account won't be able to access the
objects in the destination bucket.

To use an AWS KMS key that belongs to the destination account to encrypt the destination
objects, the destination account must grant the `kms:GenerateDataKey` and
`kms:Encrypt` permissions to the replication role in the KMS key policy. To
use the following example statement in your KMS key policy, replace the
`user input placeholders` with your own
information:

```nohighlight

{
      "Sid": "AllowS3ReplicationSourceRoleToUseTheKey",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/s3-replication-role"
      },
      "Action": ["kms:GenerateDataKey", "kms:Encrypt"],
      "Resource": "*"
}
```

If you use an asterisk ( `*`) for the `Resource` statement in the
AWS KMS key policy, the policy grants permission to use the KMS key to only the
replication role. The policy doesn't allow the replication role to elevate its
permissions.

By default, the KMS key policy grants the root user full permissions to the key. These
permissions can be delegated to other users in the same account. Unless there are
`Deny` statements in the source KMS key policy, using an IAM policy to
grant the replication role permissions to the source KMS key is sufficient.

###### Note

KMS key policies that restrict access to specific CIDR ranges, virtual private
cloud (VPC) endpoints, or S3 access points can cause replication to fail.

If either the source or destination KMS keys grant permissions based on the
encryption context, confirm that Amazon S3 Bucket Keys are turned on for the buckets. If the
buckets have S3 Bucket Keys turned on, the encryption context must be the bucket-level resource,
like this:

```nohighlight

"kms:EncryptionContext:arn:aws:arn": [
       "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket"
       ]
"kms:EncryptionContext:arn:aws:arn": [
       "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-destination-bucket"
       ]
```

In addition to the permissions granted by the KMS key policy, the source account
must add the following minimum permissions to the replication role's IAM policy:

```nohighlight

{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "kms:Decrypt",
          "kms:GenerateDataKey"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "Source-KMS-Key-ARN"
      ]
},
{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "kms:GenerateDataKey",
          "kms:Encrypt"
      ],
      "Resource": [
          "Destination-KMS-Key-ARN"
      ]
}
```

###### Important

If you use S3 Batch Replication to replicate datasets cross region and your objects
previously had their server-side encryption type updated from SSE-S3 to SSE-KMS, you may
need additional permissions. On the source region bucket, you must have `kms:decrypt`
permissions. Then, you will need the `kms:decrypt` and `kms:encrypt`
permissions for the bucket in the destination region.

For more information about how to replicate objects that are encrypted with AWS KMS, see
[Replicating encrypted\
objects](replication-walkthrough-4.md).

- If the destination bucket is owned by another AWS account, verify that the bucket
owner has a bucket policy on the destination bucket that allows the source bucket owner to
replicate objects. For an example, see [Configuring replication for buckets in different accounts](replication-walkthrough-2.md).

- To use Object Lock with replication, you must grant two additional permissions on the
source S3 bucket in the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you use to set up replication. The two
additional permissions are `s3:GetObjectRetention` and
`s3:GetObjectLegalHold`. If the role has an `s3:Get*` permission
statement, that statement satisfies the requirement. For more information, see [Using Object Lock with S3 Replication](object-lock-managing.md#object-lock-managing-replication).

- If your objects still aren't replicating after you've validated the permissions, check
for any explicit `Deny` statements in the following locations:

- `Deny` statements in the source or destination bucket policies.
Replication fails if the bucket policy denies access to the replication role for any
of the following actions:

Source bucket:

```json

             "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration",
             "s3:ListBucket",
             "s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
             "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl",
             "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging"
```

Destination buckets:

```json

             "s3:ReplicateObject",
             "s3:ReplicateDelete",
             "s3:ReplicateTags"
```

- `Deny` statements or permissions boundaries attached to the IAM role
can cause replication to fail.

- `Deny` statements in AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) that are
attached to either the source or destination accounts can cause replication to
fail.

- `Deny` statements in AWS Organizations resource control policies (RCPs) that are
attached to either the source or destination buckets can cause replication to
fail.

- If an object replica doesn't appear in the destination bucket, the following issues
might have prevented replication:

- Amazon S3 doesn't replicate an object in a source bucket that is a replica created by
another replication configuration. For example, if you set a replication configuration
from bucket A to bucket B to bucket C, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate object replicas in
bucket B to bucket C.

- A source bucket owner can grant other AWS accounts permission to upload objects.
By default, the source bucket owner doesn't have permissions for the objects created
by other accounts. The replication configuration replicates only the objects for which
the source bucket owner has access permissions. To avoid this problem, the source
bucket owner can grant other AWS accounts permissions to create objects
conditionally, requiring explicit access permissions on those objects. For an example
policy, see [Grant cross-account permissions to upload objects while ensuring that the bucket owner has full control](example-bucket-policies.md#example-bucket-policies-acl-2).

- Suppose that in the replication configuration, you add a rule to replicate a subset of
objects that have a specific tag. In this case, you must assign the specific tag key and
value at the time the object is created in order for Amazon S3 to replicate the object. If you
first create an object and then add the tag to the existing object, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate
the object.

- Use Amazon S3 Event Notifications to notify you of instances when objects don't replicate
to their destination AWS Region. Amazon S3 Event Notifications are available through
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), or AWS Lambda. For more information, see [Receiving replication failure events with Amazon S3 Event Notifications](replication-metrics-events.md).

You can also view replication failure reasons by using Amazon S3 Event Notifications. To
review the list of failure reasons, see [Amazon S3 replication failure\
reasons](replication-failure-codes.md).

## Batch Replication errors

To troubleshoot objects that aren't replicating to the destination bucket, check the
different types of permissions for your buckets, replication role, and IAM role that's used
to create the Batch Replication job. Also, make sure to check the Block Public Access
settings and S3 Object Ownership settings for your buckets.

For additional troubleshooting tips for working with Batch Operations, see [Troubleshooting S3 Batch Operations](troubleshooting-batch-operations.md).

If you've set up replication and objects aren't replicating, see [Why aren't my Amazon S3 objects replicating when I set up replication between my buckets?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-troubleshoot-replication) in the AWS re:Post Knowledge Center.

While using Batch Replication, you might encounter one of these errors:

- **`Manifest generation found no keys matching the filter**
**criteria.`**

This error occurs for one of the following reasons:

- When objects in the source bucket are stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes.

To use Batch Replication on these objects, first restore them to the S3 Standard
storage class by using a **Restore**
( `S3InitiateRestoreObjectOperation`) operation in a Batch Operations job. For
more information, see [Restoring an archived object](restoring-objects.md) and [Restore objects (Batch Operations)](batch-ops-initiate-restore-object.md).
After you've restored the objects, you can replicate them by using a
Batch Replication job.

- When the provided filter criteria doesn’t match any valid objects in the source
bucket.

Verify and correct the filter criteria. For example, in the Batch Replication
rule, the filter criteria is looking for all objects in the source bucket with the
prefix `Tax/`. If the prefix name was entered inaccurately, with a slash in
the beginning and the end `/Tax/` instead of only at the end, then no S3
objects were found. To resolve the error, correct the prefix, in this case, from
`/Tax/` to `Tax/` in the replication rule.

- **`Batch operation status is failed with reason: The job report could not be**
**written to your report bucket.`**

This error occurs if the IAM role that's used for the Batch Operations job is unable to
put the completion report into the location that was specified when you created the job.
To resolve this error, check that the IAM role has the `s3:PutObject`
permission for the bucket where you want to save the Batch Operations completion report. We
recommend delivering the report to a bucket different from the source bucket.

- **`Batch operation is completed with failures and Total failed is not**
**0.`**

This error occurs if there are insufficient object permissions issues with the
Batch Replication job that is running. If you're using a replication rule for your
Batch Replication job, make sure that the IAM role that's used for replication has the
proper permissions to access objects from either the source or destination bucket. You can
also check the [Batch Replication completion report](s3-batch-replication-batch.md#batch-replication-completion-report) to review the specific [Amazon S3\
replication failure reason](replication-failure-codes.md).

- **`Batch job ran successfully but the number of objects expected in**
**destination bucket is not the same.`**

This error occurs when there's a mismatch between the objects listed in the manifest
that's supplied in the Batch Replication job and the filters that you selected when you
created the job. You might also receive this message when the objects in your source bucket don't match any replication rules and aren't included in the generated manifest.

### Batch Operations failures occur after adding a new replication rule to an existing replication configuration

Batch Operations attempts to perform existing object replication for every rule in the
source bucket's replication configuration. If there are problems with any of the
existing replication rules, failures might occur.

The Batch Operations job's completion report explains the job failure reasons. For a list of
common errors, see [Amazon S3 replication failure reasons](replication-metrics-events.md#replication-failure-codes).
