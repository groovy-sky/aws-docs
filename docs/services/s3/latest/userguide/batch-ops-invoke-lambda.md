# Invoke AWS Lambda function

You can use Amazon S3 Batch Operations to perform large-scale batch operations on Amazon S3 objects.
The **Invoke AWS Lambda function** Batch Operations operation initiates AWS Lambda
functions to perform custom actions on objects that are listed in a manifest. This section
describes how to create a Lambda function to use with S3 Batch Operations and how to create a job
to invoke the function. The S3 Batch Operations job uses the `LambdaInvoke` operation
to run a Lambda function on every object listed in a manifest.

You can work with S3 Batch Operations by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs,
or Amazon S3 REST API. For more information about using Lambda, see [Getting Started with AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

The following sections explain how you can get started using S3 Batch Operations with
Lambda.

## Using Lambda with Batch Operations

When using S3 Batch Operations with AWS Lambda, you must create new Lambda functions
specifically for use with S3 Batch Operations. You can't reuse existing Amazon S3 event-based
functions with S3 Batch Operations. Event functions can only receive messages; they don't
return messages. The Lambda functions that are used with S3 Batch Operations must accept and
return messages. For more information about using Lambda with Amazon S3 events, see [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

You create an S3 Batch Operations job that invokes your Lambda function. The job runs the
same Lambda function on all of the objects listed in your manifest. You can control what
versions of your Lambda function to use while processing the objects in your manifest.
S3 Batch Operations support unqualified Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), aliases, and specific
versions. For more information, see [Introduction to AWS Lambda Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/versioning-intro.html) in the
_AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

If you provide the S3 Batch Operations job with a function ARN that uses an alias or the
`$LATEST` qualifier, and you update the version that either of those
points to, S3 Batch Operations starts calling the new version of your Lambda function. This
can be useful when you want to update functionality part of the way through a large job.
If you don't want S3 Batch Operations to change the version that's used, provide the specific
version in the `FunctionARN` parameter when you create your job.

A single AWS Lambda job with S3 Batch Operations can support a manifest with up to 20 billion objects.

### Using Lambda and Batch Operations with directory buckets

Directory buckets are a type of Amazon S3 bucket that's designed for workloads or
performance-critical applications that require consistent single-digit millisecond
latency. For more information, see [Directory\
buckets](directory-buckets-overview.md).

There are special requirements for using Batch Operations to invoke Lambda functions that
act on directory buckets. For example, you must structure your Lambda request using
an updated JSON schema, and specify [InvocationSchemaVersion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_LambdaInvokeOperation.html#AmazonS3-Type-control_LambdaInvokeOperation-InvocationSchemaVersion) 2.0 (not 1.0) when you
create the job. This updated schema allows you to specify optional key-value pairs
for [UserArguments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_LambdaInvokeOperation.html#AmazonS3-Type-control_LambdaInvokeOperation-UserArguments), which you can use to modify certain
parameters of existing Lambda functions. For more information, see [Automate object processing in Amazon S3 directory buckets with S3 Batch Operations and\
AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/automate-object-processing-in-amazon-s3-directory-buckets-with-s3-batch-operations-and-aws-lambda) in the AWS Storage Blog.

### Response and result codes

S3 Batch Operations invokes the Lambda function with one or more keys, each of which has
a `TaskID` associated with it. S3 Batch Operations expects a per-key result
code from Lambda functions. Any task IDs sent in the request which aren't returned
with a per-key result code will be given the result code from the
`treatMissingKeysAs` field. `treatMissingKeysAs` is an
optional request field and defaults to `TemporaryFailure`. The following
table contains the other possible result codes and values for the
`treatMissingKeysAs` field.

Response codeDescription`Succeeded`The task completed normally. If you requested a job completion
report, the task's result string is included in the report.`TemporaryFailure`The task suffered a temporary failure and will be redriven before
the job completes. The result string is ignored. If this is the
final redrive, the error message is included in the final
report.`PermanentFailure`The task suffered a permanent failure. If you requested a
job-completion report, the task is marked as `Failed` and
includes the error message string. Result strings from failed tasks
are ignored.

## Creating a Lambda function to use with S3 Batch Operations

This section provides example AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions that you must use with
your Lambda function. It also contains an example Lambda function to use with
S3 Batch Operations. If you have never created a Lambda function before, see [Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html)
in the _AWS Lambda Developer Guide_.

You must create Lambda functions specifically for use with S3 Batch Operations. You can't
reuse existing Amazon S3 event-based Lambda functions because Lambda functions that are used
for S3 Batch Operations must accept and return special data fields.

###### Important

AWS Lambda functions written in Java accept either [RequestHandler](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/blob/master/aws-lambda-java-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/lambda/runtime/RequestHandler.java) or [RequestStreamHandler](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/blob/master/aws-lambda-java-core/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/lambda/runtime/RequestStreamHandler.java) handler interfaces. However, to
support S3 Batch Operations request and response format, AWS Lambda requires the
`RequestStreamHandler` interface for custom serialization and
deserialization of a request and response. This interface allows Lambda to pass an
InputStream and OutputStream to the Java `handleRequest` method.

Be sure to use the `RequestStreamHandler` interface when using Lambda
functions with S3 Batch Operations. If you use a `RequestHandler`
interface, the batch job will fail with "Invalid JSON returned in Lambda payload" in
the completion report.

For more information, see [Handler\
interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-handler.html#java-handler-interfaces) in the _AWS Lambda User Guide_.

### Example IAM permissions

The following are examples of the IAM permissions that are necessary to use a
Lambda function with S3 Batch Operations.

###### Example— S3 Batch Operations trust policy

The following is an example of the trust policy that you can use for the
Batch Operations IAM role. This IAM role is specified when you create the job and
gives Batch Operations permission to assume the IAM role.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "batchoperations.s3.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}

```

###### Example— Lambda IAM policy

The following is an example of an IAM policy that gives S3 Batch Operations
permission to invoke the Lambda function and read the input manifest.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "BatchOperationsLambdaPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "lambda:InvokeFunction"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

### Example request and response

This section provides request and response examples for the Lambda function.

###### Example Request

The following is a JSON example of a request for the Lambda function.

```json

{
    "invocationSchemaVersion": "1.0",
    "invocationId": "YXNkbGZqYWRmaiBhc2RmdW9hZHNmZGpmaGFzbGtkaGZza2RmaAo",
    "job": {
        "id": "f3cc4f60-61f6-4a2b-8a21-d07600c373ce"
    },
    "tasks": [
        {
            "taskId": "dGFza2lkZ29lc2hlcmUK",
            "s3Key": "customerImage1.jpg",
            "s3VersionId": "1",
            "s3BucketArn": "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:0123456788:amzn-s3-demo-bucket1"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### Example Response

The following is a JSON example of a response for the Lambda function.

```json

{
  "invocationSchemaVersion": "1.0",
  "treatMissingKeysAs" : "PermanentFailure",
  "invocationId" : "YXNkbGZqYWRmaiBhc2RmdW9hZHNmZGpmaGFzbGtkaGZza2RmaAo",
  "results": [
    {
      "taskId": "dGFza2lkZ29lc2hlcmUK",
      "resultCode": "Succeeded",
      "resultString": "[\"Mary Major", \"John Stiles\"]"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Lambda function for S3 Batch Operations

The following example Python Lambda removes a delete marker from a versioned
object.

As the example shows, keys from S3 Batch Operations are URL encoded. To use Amazon S3 with
other AWS services, it's important that you URL decode the key that is passed from
S3 Batch Operations.

```python

import logging
from urllib import parse
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel("INFO")

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    Removes a delete marker from the specified versioned object.

    :param event: The S3 batch event that contains the ID of the delete marker
                  to remove.
    :param context: Context about the event.
    :return: A result structure that Amazon S3 uses to interpret the result of the
             operation. When the result code is TemporaryFailure, S3 retries the
             operation.

## Creating an S3 Batch Operations job that invokes a Lambda function

When creating an S3 Batch Operations job to invoke a Lambda function, you must provide the
following:

- The ARN of your Lambda function (which might include the function alias or a
specific version number)

- An IAM role with permission to invoke the function

- The action parameter `LambdaInvokeFunction`

For more information about creating an S3 Batch Operations job, see [Creating an S3 Batch Operations job](batch-ops-create-job.md) and [Operations supported by S3 Batch Operations](batch-ops-operations.md).

The following example creates an S3 Batch Operations job that invokes a Lambda function by
using the AWS CLI. To use this example, replace the `user input
                    placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3control create-job
    --account-id account-id
    --operation  '{"LambdaInvoke": { "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:LambdaFunctionName" } }'
    --manifest '{"Spec":{"Format":"S3BatchOperations_CSV_20180820","Fields":["Bucket","Key"]},"Location":{"ObjectArn":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-manifest-bucket","ETag":"ManifestETag"}}'
    --report '{"Bucket":"arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket","Format":"Report_CSV_20180820","Enabled":true,"Prefix":"ReportPrefix","ReportScope":"AllTasks"}'
    --priority 2
    --role-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/BatchOperationsRole
    --region region
    --description "Lambda Function"
```

## Providing task-level information in Lambda manifests

When you use AWS Lambda functions with S3 Batch Operations, you might want additional data
to accompany each task or key that's operated on. For example, you might want to have
both a source object key and a new object key provided. Your Lambda function could then
copy the source key to a new S3 bucket under a new name. By default, Batch Operations lets you
specify only the destination bucket and a list of source keys in the input manifest to
your job. The following examples describe how you can include additional data in your
manifest so that you can run more complex Lambda functions.

To specify per-key parameters in your S3 Batch Operations manifest to use in your Lambda
function's code, use the following URL-encoded JSON format. The `key` field
is passed to your Lambda function as if it were an Amazon S3 object key. But it can be
interpreted by the Lambda function to contain other values or multiple keys, as shown in
the following examples.

###### Note

The maximum number of characters for the `key` field in the manifest is
1,024.

###### Example— Manifest substituting the "Amazon S3 keys" with JSON strings

The URL-encoded version must be provided to S3 Batch Operations.

```python

amzn-s3-demo-bucket,{"origKey": "object1key", "newKey": "newObject1Key"}
amzn-s3-demo-bucket,{"origKey": "object2key", "newKey": "newObject2Key"}
amzn-s3-demo-bucket,{"origKey": "object3key", "newKey": "newObject3Key"}
```

###### Example— Manifest URL-encoded

This URL-encoded version must be provided to S3 Batch Operations. The non-URL-encoded
version does not work.

```python

amzn-s3-demo-bucket,%7B%22origKey%22%3A%20%22object1key%22%2C%20%22newKey%22%3A%20%22newObject1Key%22%7D
amzn-s3-demo-bucket,%7B%22origKey%22%3A%20%22object2key%22%2C%20%22newKey%22%3A%20%22newObject2Key%22%7D
amzn-s3-demo-bucket,%7B%22origKey%22%3A%20%22object3key%22%2C%20%22newKey%22%3A%20%22newObject3Key%22%7D
```

###### Example— Lambda function with manifest format writing results to the job report

This URL-encoded manifest example contains pipe-delimited object keys for the following Lambda function to parse.

```python

amzn-s3-demo-bucket,object1key%7Clower
amzn-s3-demo-bucket,object2key%7Cupper
amzn-s3-demo-bucket,object3key%7Creverse
amzn-s3-demo-bucket,object4key%7Cdelete
```

This Lambda function shows how to parse a pipe-delimited task that's encoded into
the S3 Batch Operations manifest. The task indicates which revision operation is applied
to the specified object.

```python

import logging
from urllib import parse
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel("INFO")

s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    """
    Applies the specified revision to the specified object.

    :param event: The Amazon S3 batch event that contains the ID of the object to
                  revise and the revision type to apply.
    :param context: Context about the event.
    :return: A result structure that Amazon S3 uses to interpret the result of the
             operation.

    obj_key, revision = parse.unquote_plus(task["s3Key"], encoding="utf-8").split("|")
    bucket_name = task["s3BucketArn"].split(":")[-1]

    logger.info("Got task: apply revision %s to %s.", revision, obj_key)

    try:
        stanza_obj = s3.Bucket(bucket_name).Object(obj_key)

            pass
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Can't handle revision type '{revision}'.")

        if revision == "delete":
            stanza_obj.delete()

            result_string = (
                f"Applied revision type '{revision}' to " f"stanza {stanza_obj.key}."
            )

        logger.info(result_string)
        result_code = "Succeeded"
    except ClientError as error:
        if error.response["Error"]["Code"] == "NoSuchKey":
            result_code = "Succeeded"
            result_string = (
                f"Stanza {obj_key} not found, assuming it was deleted "
                f"in an earlier revision."
            )

                f"to {obj_key}: {error}."
            )
            logger.exception(result_string)
    finally:
