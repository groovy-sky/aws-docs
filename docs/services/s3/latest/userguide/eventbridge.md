# Using EventBridge

Amazon S3 can send events to Amazon EventBridge whenever certain events happen in your bucket. Unlike
other destinations, you don't need to select which event types you want to deliver. After
EventBridge is enabled, all events below are sent to EventBridge. You can use EventBridge rules to route events
to additional targets. The following lists the events Amazon S3 sends to EventBridge.

Event type Description

_Object Created_

An object was created.

The reason field in the event message structure indicates which S3 API was used
to create the object: [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md), [POST\
Object](../api/restobjectpost.md), [CopyObject](../api/api-copyobject.md), or [CompleteMultipartUpload](../api/api-completemultipartupload.md).

_Object Deleted (DeleteObject)_

_Object Deleted (Lifecycle expiration)_

An object was deleted.

When an object is deleted using an S3 API call, the reason field is set to
DeleteObject. When an object is deleted by an S3 Lifecycle expiration rule, the
reason field is set to Lifecycle Expiration. For more information, see [Expiring objects](lifecycle-expire-general-considerations.md).

When an unversioned object is deleted, or a versioned object is permanently
deleted, the deletion-type field is set to Permanently Deleted. When a delete
marker is created for a versioned object, the `deletion-type` field is set to
Delete Marker Created. For more information, see [Deleting object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket](deletingobjectversions.md).

_Object Restore Initiated_

An object restore was initiated from S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
storage class or from S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tier.
For more information, see [Working with archived objects](archived-objects.md).

_Object Restore Completed_

An object restore was completed.

_Object Restore Expired_

The temporary copy of an object restored from S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive expired and was deleted.

_Object Storage Class Changed_

An object was transitioned to a different storage class. For more
information, see [Transitioning objects using Amazon S3 Lifecycle](lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.md).

_Object Access Tier Changed_

An object was transitioned to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier or
Deep Archive Access tier. For more information, see [Managing storage costs with Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering](intelligent-tiering.md).

_Object ACL Updated_

An object's access control list (ACL) was set using `PutObjectAcl`.
An event is not generated when a request results in no change to an object’s ACL. For more
information, see [Access control list (ACL) overview](acl-overview.md).

_Object Tags Added_

A set of tags was added to an object using `PutObjectTagging`. For
more information, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

_Object Tags Deleted_

All tags were removed from an object using `DeleteObjectTagging`. For
more information, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

###### Note

For more information about how Amazon S3 event types map to EventBridge event types, see [Amazon EventBridge mapping and troubleshooting](ev-mapping-troubleshooting.md).

You can use Amazon S3 Event Notifications with EventBridge to write rules that take actions when an event occurs
in your bucket. For example, you can have it send you a notification. For more information, see [What is EventBridge?](../../../eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.md) in the
_Amazon EventBridge User Guide_.

For more information about the actions and data types you can interact with using the EventBridge API, see the [Amazon EventBridge API Reference](../../../../reference/eventbridge/latest/apireference/welcome.md) in the _Amazon EventBridge API Reference_.
