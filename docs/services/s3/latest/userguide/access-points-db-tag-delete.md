SDK for Java 2.x

This example shows you how to delete tags from a directory bucket by using the AWS SDK for Java 2.x. To use the command replace the `user input placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

import software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3control.S3ControlClient;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3control.model.ListTagsForResourceRequest;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3control.model.ListTagsForResourceResponse;

public class ListTagsForResourceExample {
    public static void listTagsForResourceExample() {
        S3ControlClient s3Control = S3ControlClient.builder().region(Region.US_WEST_2).build();

        UntagResourceRequest untagResourceRequest = UntagResourceRequest.builder()
                .resourceArn("arn:aws::s3:region:111122223333:accesspoint/my-access-point/*")
                .accountId("111122223333")
                .tagKeys("key1")
                .build();

        UntagResourceResponse response = s3Control.untagResource(untagResourceRequest);
        System.out.println("Status code (should be 204):");
        System.out.println(response.sdkHttpResponse().statusCode());
    }
}

```
