# Downloading objects

This section explains how to download objects from an Amazon S3 bucket. With Amazon S3, you can store
objects in one or more buckets, and each single object can be up to 50 TB in size. Any Amazon S3
object that is not archived is accessible in real time. Archived objects, however, must be
restored before they can be downloaded. For information about downloading archived objects, see
[Downloading archived objects](#download-archived-objects).

You can download a single object by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs,
or Amazon S3 REST API. To download an object up to 5 TB from S3 without writing any code or running
any commands, use the S3 console. For more information, see [Downloading an object](#download-an-object).

To download objects larger than 5 TB, use concurrent `GetObject` requests with
either `Range` HTTP header to read specific byte ranges or `partNumber` to
download specific part of an object. Single GET requests are limited to 5 TB, and you will
receive a `405 - Method Not Allowed` error for GET requests beyond 5 TB.

For large object downloads, use the S3 Transfer Manager in the Java v1/v2, Python, or AWS CLI
SDKs. For the best performance, use the latest AWS Common Runtime (CRT) with these SDKs, which
has been optimized for better resource utilization. CRT automatically scales the size of
individual GETs to optimize throughput. You can improve overall transfer throughput by
allocating more memory using memory limit parameters such as
`maxNativeMemoryLimitInBytes` for Java SDK. You can opt out of this behavior by
setting an explicit part size using request parameters such as `multipart_chunksize`
for AWS CLI and `minimumPartSizeInBytes` for Java SDK in your download request.

To download multiple objects, use AWS CloudShell, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs. For more
information, see [Downloading multiple objects](#download-multiple-objects).

If you need to download part of an object, you use extra parameters with the AWS CLI or REST
API to specify only the bytes that you want to download. For more information, see [Downloading part of an object](#download-objects-parts).

If you need to download an object that you don't own, ask the object owner to generate a
presigned URL that allows you to download the object. For more information, see [Downloading an object from another AWS account](#download-objects-from-another-account).

When you download objects outside of the AWS network, data-transfer fees apply. Data
transfer within the AWS network is free within the same AWS Region, but you will be charged
for any `GET` requests. For more information about data-transfer costs and
data-retrieval charges, see [Amazon S3\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing).

## Downloading an object

You can download an object by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST
API.

This section explains how to use the Amazon S3 console to download an object from an S3
bucket.

###### Note

- You can download only one object at a time.

- If you use the Amazon S3 console to download an object whose key name ends with a
period ( `.`), the period is removed from the key name of the
downloaded object. To retain the period at the end of the name of the downloaded
object, you must use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST API.

###### To download an object from an S3 bucket

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets** or **Directory buckets**.

3. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that you
    want to download an object from.

4. You can download an object from an S3 bucket in any of the following ways:

- Select the check box next to the object, and choose
**Download**. If you want to download the object to a
specific folder, on the **Actions** menu, choose
**Download as**.

- If you want to download a specific version of the object, turn on
**Show versions** (located next to the search box).
Select the check box next to the version of the object that you want, and
choose **Download**. If you want to download the object to
a specific folder, on the **Actions** menu, choose
**Download as**.

The following `get-object` example command shows how you can use the AWS CLI
to download an object from Amazon S3. This command gets the object
`folder/my_image` from the bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. You must include an `outfile`, which is a file name for the downloaded object, such as
`my_downloaded_image.jpg`.

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key folder/my_image my_downloaded_image.jpg
```

For more information and examples, see [get-object](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-object.html) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

For examples of how to download an object with the AWS SDKs, see [Code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_GetObject_section.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

For general information about using different AWS SDKs, see [Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDKs](../../../../reference/amazons3/latest/api/sdk-general-information-section.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

You can use the REST API to retrieve objects from Amazon S3. For more information, see [GetObject](../api/api-getobject.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Downloading multiple objects

You can download multiple objects by using AWS CloudShell, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs.

AWS CloudShell is a browser-based, pre-authenticated shell that you can launch directly from
the AWS Management Console.

For more information about AWS CloudShell, see [What is CloudShell?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html) in the
_AWS CloudShell User Guide_.

###### Important

With AWS CloudShell, your home directory has storage up to 1GB per AWS Region.
Therefore you cannot sync buckets with objects totaling over this amount. For more limitations, see [Service quotas and restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/limits.html) in the
_AWS CloudShell User Guide_.

###### To download objects by using AWS CloudShell

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudShell console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell).

2. Run the following command to sync objects in your bucket to CloudShell. The
    following command syncs objects from the bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`
    and creates a folder named `temp` in
    CloudShell. CloudShell syncs your objects to this folder. To use this command,
    replace the `user input placeholders` with your
    own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3 sync s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 ./temp
```

###### Note

The `sync` command is not compatible with directory buckets.

To perform pattern matching to either exclude or include particular objects, you
can use the `--exclude "value"` and
`--include "value"` parameters with the
`sync` command.

3. Run the following command to zip your objects in the folder named
    `temp` to a file named
    `temp.zip`.

```nohighlight

zip temp.zip -r temp/
```

4. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Download**
**file**.

5. Enter the file name `temp.zip` and then
    choose **Download**.

6. (Optional) Delete the `temp.zip`
    file and the objects that are synced to the
    `temp` folder in CloudShell. With
    AWS CloudShell, you have persistent storage of up to 1 GB for each AWS Region.

You can use the following example command to delete your `.zip`
    file and your folder. To use this example command, replace the `user
                     input placeholders` with your own information.

```nohighlight

rm temp.zip && rm -rf temp/
```

The following example shows how you can use the AWS CLI to download all of the files or
objects under the specified directory or prefix. This command copies all objects from the
bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` to your current directory. To use this example
command, use your bucket name in place of `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`.

```nohighlight

aws s3 cp s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 . --recursive
```

The following command downloads all of the objects under the prefix
`logs` in the bucket
`amzn-s3-demo-bucket1` to your current directory. It also uses the
`--exclude` and `--include` parameters to copy only objects with
the suffix `.log`. To use this example
command, replace the `user input placeholders` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3 cp s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket1/logs/ . --recursive --exclude "*" --include "*.log"
```

For more information and examples, see [cp](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/cp.html) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

For examples of how to download all objects in an Amazon S3 bucket with the AWS SDKs, see
[Code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3_example_s3_DownloadBucketToDirectory_section.html) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

For general information about using different AWS SDKs, see [Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDKs](../../../../reference/amazons3/latest/api/sdk-general-information-section.md) in the _Amazon S3 API Reference_.

## Downloading part of an object

You can download part of an object by using the AWS CLI or REST API. To do so, you use
additional parameters to specify which part of an object that you want to download.

The following example command performs a `GET` request for a range of bytes
in the object named `folder/my_data` in the
bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket1`. In the request, the byte range must be
prefixed with `bytes=`. The partial object is downloaded to the output file
named `my_data_range`. To use this example
command, replace the `user input placeholders` with
your own information.

```nohighlight

aws s3api get-object --bucket amzn-s3-demo-bucket1 --key folder/my_data --range bytes=0-500 my_data_range
```

For more information and examples, see [get-object](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-object.html) in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

For more information about the HTTP `Range` header, see [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html) on the RFC
Editor website.

###### Note

Amazon S3 doesn't support retrieving multiple ranges of data in a single `GET`
request.

You can use the `partNumber` and `Range` parameters in the REST
API to retrieve object parts from Amazon S3. For more information, see [GetObject](../api/api-getobject.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

## Downloading an object from another AWS account

You can use a presigned URL to grant others time-limited access to your objects without
updating your bucket policy.

The presigned URL can be entered in a browser or used by a program to download an object. The
credentials used by the URL are those of the AWS user who generated the URL. After the URL
is created, anyone with the presigned URL can download the corresponding object until the URL
expires.

You can use the Amazon S3 console to generate a presigned URL for sharing an object in a general purpose bucket by
following these steps. When using the console, the maximum expiration time for a presigned URL
is 12 hours from the time of creation.

###### To generate a presigned URL by using the Amazon S3 console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

3. In the buckets list, choose the name of the bucket that
    contains the object that you want a presigned URL for.

4. In the **Objects** list, select the object that you want to
    create a presigned URL for.

5. On the **Object actions** menu, choose **Share with a**
**presigned URL**.

6. Specify how long you want the presigned URL to be valid.

7. Choose **Create presigned URL**.

8. When a confirmation message appears, the URL is automatically copied to your
    clipboard. You will see a button to copy the presigned URL if you need to copy it
    again.

9. To download the object, paste the URL into any browser, and the object will
    attempt to download.

For more information about presigned URLs and other methods for creating them, see [Download and upload objects with presigned URLs](using-presigned-url.md).

## Downloading archived objects

To reduce your storage costs for infrequently accessed objects, you can _archive_ those objects. When you archive an object, it is moved into
low-cost storage, which means that you can't access it in real time. To download an archived
object, you must first restore it.

You can restore archived objects in minutes or hours, depending on the storage class. You
can restore an archived object by using the Amazon S3 console, S3 Batch Operations, the Amazon S3 REST API,
the AWS SDKs, and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).

For instructions, see [Restoring an archived object](restoring-objects.md). After you restore the archived object, you can download it.

## Downloading objects based on metadata

You can add preconditions to download an object based
on it's metadata using a conditional read request. You can return an object based on it's Entity tag (ETag) or last modified date. This can limit an S3 operation to objects
updated since a specified date or only return a specific object version.

You can use conditional writes for [GetObject](../api/api-getobject.md) or
[HeadObject](../api/api-headobject.md) requests.

For more information about conditional requests see, [Add preconditions to S3 operations with conditional requests](conditional-requests.md).

## Troubleshooting downloading objects

Insufficient permissions or incorrect bucket or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policies can cause
errors when you're trying to download objects from Amazon S3. These problems can often cause Access
Denied (403 Forbidden) errors, where Amazon S3 is unable to allow access to a resource.

For common causes of Access Denied (403 Forbidden) errors, see [Troubleshoot access denied (403 Forbidden) errors in Amazon S3](troubleshoot-403-errors.md).

If you're getting a 404 NoSuchKey error when trying to access an object, see [How can I troubleshoot the 404 NoSuchKey error from Amazon S3?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/404-error-nosuchkey-s3) in the AWS re:Post Knowledge Center.
