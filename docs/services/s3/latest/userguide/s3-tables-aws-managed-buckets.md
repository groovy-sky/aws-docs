# Working with AWS managed table buckets

AWS managed table buckets are specialized Amazon S3 table buckets designed to store AWS managed tables, such
as [S3 Metadata](metadata-tables-overview.md) journal and live inventory tables. Unlike
customer-managed table buckets that you create and manage directly, AWS managed table buckets are automatically
provisioned by AWS when you configure features that require AWS managed tables. When managed tables
are created, they belong to a predefined namespace that's based on the name of the source bucket. This
predefined namespace can't be modified.

Each AWS account has one AWS managed table bucket per Region, following the naming convention
`aws-s3`. This bucket serves as a centralized location for all managed tables associated with
your account's resources in that Region.

The following table compares AWS managed table buckets with customer-managed table buckets.

## Permissions to work with AWS managed table buckets and to query tables

To work with AWS managed table buckets, you need permissions to create AWS managed table buckets and
tables and to specify encryption settings for AWS managed tables. You also need permissions to query
the tables in your AWS managed table buckets.

The following example policy allows you to create an AWS managed table bucket through an S3
Metadata configuration:

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Sid":"PermissionsToWorkWithMetadataTables",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
             "s3:CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration",
             "s3tables:CreateTableBucket",
             "s3tables:CreateNamespace",
             "s3tables:CreateTable",
             "s3tables:GetTable",
             "s3tables:PutTablePolicy"
             "s3tables:PutTableEncryption",
             "kms:DescribeKey"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3:::bucket/amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket",
            "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/aws-s3",
            "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/aws-s3/table/*",
            "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
         ]
       }
    ]
}
```

The following example policy allows you to query tables in AWS managed table buckets:

```nohighlight

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Sid":"PermissionsToQueryMetadataTables",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
             "s3tables:GetTable",
             "s3tables:GetTableData",
             "s3tables:GetTableMetadataLocation",
             "kms:Decrypt"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/aws-s3",
            "arn:aws:s3tables:us-east-1:111122223333:bucket/aws-s3/table/*",
            "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111122223333:key/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef"
         ]
       }
    ]
}
```

## Querying tables in AWS managed table buckets

You can query AWS managed tables in AWS managed table buckets using access methods and engines supported by
S3 Tables. The following are some example queries.

Using standard SQL

The following example shows how to query AWS managed tables using standard SQL
syntax:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "s3tablescatalog/aws-s3"."b_amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket"."inventory"
LIMIT 10;
```

The following example shows how to join AWS managed tables with your own
tables:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM "s3tablescatalog/aws-s3"."b_amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket"."inventory" a
JOIN "s3tablescatalog/amzn-s3-demo-table-bucket"."my_namespace"."my_table" b
ON a.key = b.key
LIMIT 10;
```

Using Spark

The following example shows how to query your table with
Spark:

```python

spark.sql("""
    SELECT *
    FROM ice_catalog.inventory a
    JOIN ice_catalog.my_table b
    ON a.key = b.key
""").show(10, true)
```

The following example shows how to joining your AWS managed table with another
table:

```sql

SELECT *
FROM inventory a
JOIN my_table b
ON a.key = b.key
LIMIT 10;
```

## Encryption for AWS managed table buckets

By default, AWS managed table buckets are encrypted with server-side encryption using Amazon S3
managed keys (SSE-S3). After your AWS managed table bucket is created, you can use [PutTableBucketEncryption](../api/api-s3buckets-puttablebucketencryption.md) to set the bucket's default encryption setting to
use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).

During creation of your AWS managed tables, you can choose to encrypt them with SSE-KMS.
If you choose to use SSE-KMS, you must provide a customer managed KMS key in the same Region as your
AWS managed table bucket. You can set the encryption type for your AWS managed tables only during
table creation. After an AWS managed table is created, you can't change its encryption setting.

If you want the AWS managed table bucket and the tables stored in it to use the same
KMS key, make sure to use the same KMS key that you used to encrypt your tables to encrypt your
table bucket after it's been created. After you've changed the default encryption settings for your
table bucket to use SSE-KMS, those encryption settings are used for any future tables that are created
in the bucket.
