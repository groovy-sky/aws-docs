# Upload an object through an access point for a general purpose bucket

This section explains how to upload an object through an access point for a general purpose bucket using the AWS Management Console,
AWS Command Line Interface, or REST API.

###### To upload an object through an access point in your AWS account

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

02. In the navigation bar on the top of the page, choose the name of the
     currently displayed AWS Region. Next, choose the Region that you want to
     list access points for.

03. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose
     **Access Points**.

04. (Optional) Search for access points by name. Only access points in your selected AWS Region will appear here.

05. Choose the name of the access point you want to manage or use.

06. Under the **Objects** tab, select **Upload**.

07. Drag and drop files and folders you want to upload here, or choose **Add files** or **Add folder**.

    ###### Note

    The maximum size of a file that you can upload by using the Amazon S3 console is 160 GB.
    To upload a file larger than 160 GB, use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST
    API.

08. To change access control list permissions, choose **Permissions**.

09. Under **Access control list (ACL)**, edit the permissions.

    For information about object access permissions, see [Using the S3 console to set ACL permissions for an object](managing-acls.md#set-object-permissions). You can grant
     read access to your objects to the public (everyone in the world) for all of the files that
     you're uploading. However, we recommend not changing the default setting for public read
     access. Granting public read access is applicable to a small subset of use cases, such as
     when buckets are used for websites. You can always change the object permissions after you
     upload the object.

10. To configure other additional properties, choose **Properties**.

11. Under **Storage class**, choose the storage class for the files that
     you're uploading.

    For more information about storage classes, see [Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes](storage-class-intro.md).

12. To update the encryption settings for your objects, under **Server-side encryption**
    **settings**, do the following.
    1. Choose **Specify an encryption key**.

    2. Under
        **Encryption settings**, choose **Use**
       **bucket settings for default encryption** or **Override**
       **bucket settings for default encryption**.

    3. If you chose **Override bucket settings for default encryption**,
        you must configure the following encryption settings.

- To encrypt the uploaded files by using keys that are managed by Amazon S3, choose **Amazon S3**
**managed key (SSE-S3)**.

For more information, see [Using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)](usingserversideencryption.md).

- To encrypt the uploaded files by using keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), choose
**AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)**. Then choose one of the following
options for **AWS KMS key**:

- To choose from a list of available KMS keys, choose **Choose from your**
**AWS KMS keys**, and then choose your **KMS key** from
the list of available keys.

Both the AWS managed key ( `aws/s3`) and your customer managed keys appear in this
list. For more information about customer managed keys, see [Customer keys and AWS\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-mgmt) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

- To enter the KMS key ARN, choose **Enter AWS KMS key ARN**,
and then enter your KMS key ARN in the field that appears.

- To create a new customer managed key in the AWS KMS console, choose **Create a**
**KMS key**.

For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see [Creating\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

###### Important

You can use only KMS keys that are available in the same AWS Region as
the bucket. The Amazon S3 console lists only the first 100 KMS keys in the same
Region as the bucket. To use a KMS key that is not listed, you must enter
your KMS key ARN. If you want to use a KMS key that is owned by a different
account, you must first have permission to use the key and then you must enter the
KMS key ARN.

Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys, and not asymmetric KMS keys. For
more information, see [Identifying symmetric and\
asymmetric KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/find-symm-asymm.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
13. To use additional checksums, choose **On**. Then for
     **Checksum function**, choose the function that you would like to use.
     Amazon S3 calculates and stores the checksum value after it receives the entire object. You can
     use the **Precalculated value** box to supply a precalculated value. If you
     do, Amazon S3 compares the value that you provided to the value that it calculates. If the two
     values do not match, Amazon S3 generates an error.

    Additional checksums enable you to specify the checksum algorithm that you would
     like to use to verify your data. For more information about additional checksums, see [Checking object integrity in Amazon S3](checking-object-integrity.md).

14. To add tags to all of the objects that you are uploading, choose **Add**
    **tag**. Enter a tag name in the **Key** field. Enter a value for
     the tag.

    Object tagging gives you a way to categorize storage. Each tag is a key-value pair. Key
     and tag values are case sensitive. You can have up to 10 tags per object. A tag key can be
     up to 128 Unicode characters in length, and tag values can be up to 255 Unicode characters
     in length. For more information about object tags, see [Categorizing your objects using tags](object-tagging.md).

15. To add metadata, choose **Add metadata**.
    1. Under **Type**, choose **System defined** or **User defined**.

       For system-defined metadata, you can select common HTTP headers, such as
        **Content-Type** and **Content-Disposition**. For a
        list of system-defined metadata and information about whether you can add the value, see
        [System-defined object metadata](usingmetadata.md#SysMetadata). Any metadata starting with
        the prefix `x-amz-meta-` is treated as user-defined metadata. User-defined
        metadata is stored with the object and is returned when you download the object. Both
        the keys and their values must conform to US-ASCII standards. User-defined metadata can
        be as large as 2 KB. For more information about system-defined and user-defined
        metadata, see [Working with object metadata](usingmetadata.md).

    2. For **Key**, choose a key.

    3. Type a value for the key.
16. To upload your objects, choose **Upload**.

    Amazon S3 uploads your object. When the upload completes, you can see a success message on the **Upload: status** page.

The following `put-object` example command shows how you can
use the AWS CLI to upload an object through an access point.

The following command uploads the object `puppy.jpg` for AWS account
`111122223333` using access point
`my-access-point`.

```nohighlight

aws s3api put-object --bucket arn:aws:s3:AWS Region:111122223333:accesspoint/my-access-point --key puppy.jpg --body puppy.jpg
```

###### Note

S3 automatically generate access point aliases for all access points and access point aliases can be used
anywhere a bucket name is used to perform object-level operations. For more
information, see [Access point aliases](access-points-naming.md#access-points-alias).

For more information and examples, see [put-object](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html) in the
_AWS CLI Command Reference_.

You can use the REST API to upload an object through an access point. For more information, see [PutObject](../api/api-putobject.md) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_.

You can use the AWS SDK for Python to upload an object through an access point.

Python

In the following example, the file named
`hello.txt` is
uploaded for AWS account `111122223333`
using the access point named
`my-access-point`.

```nohighlight

import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.upload_file('/tmp/hello.txt', 'arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:111122223333:accesspoint/my-access-point', 'hello.txt')
```
