# Step scaling policies for Application Auto Scaling

A step scaling policy scales your application's capacity in predefined increments based on
CloudWatch alarms. You can define separate scaling policies to handle scaling out (increasing capacity)
and scaling in (decreasing capacity) when an alarm threshold is breached.

With step scaling policies, you create and manage the CloudWatch alarms that invoke the scaling
process. When an alarm is breached, Application Auto Scaling initiates the scaling policy associated with that
alarm.

The step scaling policy scales capacity using a set of adjustments, known as _step_
_adjustments_. The size of the adjustment varies based on the magnitude of the alarm
breach.

- If the breach exceeds the first threshold, Application Auto Scaling will apply the first step
adjustment.

- If the breach exceeds the second threshold, Application Auto Scaling will apply the second step adjustment,
and so on.

This allows the scaling policy to respond appropriately to both minor and major changes in
the alarm metric.

The policy will continue to respond to additional alarm breaches, even while a scaling
activity is in progress. This means Application Auto Scaling will evaluate all alarm breaches as they occur. A
cooldown period is used to protect against over-scaling due to multiple alarm breaches occurring
in rapid succession.

Like target tracking, step scaling can help automatically scale your application's capacity
as traffic changes occur. However, target tracking policies tend to be easier to implement and
manage for steady scaling needs.
