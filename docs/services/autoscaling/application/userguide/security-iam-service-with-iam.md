# How Application Auto Scaling works with IAM

###### Note

In December 2017, there was an update for Application Auto Scaling, enabling several service-linked
roles for Application Auto Scaling integrated services. Specific IAM permissions _and_
an Application Auto Scaling service-linked role (or a service role for Amazon EMR auto scaling) are required so
that users can configure scaling.

Before you use IAM to manage access to Application Auto Scaling, learn what IAM features are
available to use with Application Auto Scaling.

To get a high-level view of how Application Auto Scaling and other AWS services work with most IAM
features, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Application Auto Scaling identity-based policies

**Supports identity-based policies:**

Yes

Identity-based policies are JSON permissions policy documents that you can attach to an identity, such as an IAM user, group of users, or role. These
policies control what actions users and roles can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions. To learn how to create an identity-based
policy, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and
resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. To learn about all of the elements that you can use in a
JSON policy, see [IAM JSON\
policy elements reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

### Identity-based policy examples for Application Auto Scaling

To view examples of Application Auto Scaling identity-based policies, see [Application Auto Scaling identity-based policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html).

### Actions

**Supports policy actions:**

Yes

In an IAM policy statement, you can specify any API action from any service that
supports IAM. For Application Auto Scaling, use the following prefix with the name of the API action:
`application-autoscaling:`. For example:
`application-autoscaling:RegisterScalableTarget`,
`application-autoscaling:PutScalingPolicy`, and
`application-autoscaling:DeregisterScalableTarget`.

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as shown
in the following example.

```nohighlight

"Action": [
      "application-autoscaling:DescribeScalingPolicies",
      "application-autoscaling:DescribeScalingActivities"
```

You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (\*). For example, to specify all
actions that begin with the word `Describe`, include the following
action.

```nohighlight

"Action": "application-autoscaling:Describe*"
```

For a list of Application Auto Scaling actions, see [Actions defined by AWS Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsapplicationautoscaling.html#awsapplicationautoscaling-actions-as-permissions) in the
_Service Authorization Reference_.

### Resources

**Supports policy resources:**

Yes

In an IAM policy statement, the `Resource` element specifies the object
or objects that the statement covers. For Application Auto Scaling, each IAM policy statement applies to
the scalable targets that you specify using their Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

The ARN resource format for scalable targets:

```nohighlight

arn:aws:application-autoscaling:region:account-id:scalable-target/unique-identifier
```

For example, you can indicate a specific scalable target in your statement using its
ARN as follows. The unique ID (1234abcd56ab78cd901ef1234567890ab123) is a value assigned
by Application Auto Scaling to the scalable target.

```json

"Resource": "arn:aws:application-autoscaling:us-east-1:123456789012:scalable-target/1234abcd56ab78cd901ef1234567890ab123"
```

You can specify all instances that belong to a specific account by replacing the
unique identifier with a wildcard (\*) as follows.

```json

"Resource": "arn:aws:application-autoscaling:us-east-1:123456789012:scalable-target/*"
```

To specify all resources, or if a specific API action does not support ARNs, use a
wildcard (\*) as the `Resource` element as follows.

```json

"Resource": "*"
```

For more information, see [Resource types defined by AWS Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsapplicationautoscaling.html#awsapplicationautoscaling-policy-keys) in the
_Service Authorization Reference_.

### Condition keys

**Supports service-specific policy condition keys:**

Yes

You can specify conditions in the IAM policies that control access to Application Auto Scaling
resources. The policy statement is effective only when the conditions are true.

Application Auto Scaling supports the following service-defined condition keys that you can use in
identity-based policies to determine who can perform Application Auto Scaling API actions.

- `application-autoscaling:scalable-dimension`

- `application-autoscaling:service-namespace`

To learn which Application Auto Scaling API actions you can use a condition key with, see
[Actions defined by AWS Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsapplicationautoscaling.html#awsapplicationautoscaling-actions-as-permissions) in the _Service Authorization Reference_. For more information
about using Application Auto Scaling condition keys, see [Condition keys for AWS Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsapplicationautoscaling.html#awsapplicationautoscaling-policy-keys).

To view the global condition keys that are available to all services, see [AWS global condition\
context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Resource-based policies

**Supports resource-based policies:**

No

Other AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service, support resource-based permissions policies. For
example, you can attach a permissions policy to an S3 bucket to manage access permissions to
that bucket.

Application Auto Scaling does not support resource-based policies.

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

**Supports ACLs:**

No

Application Auto Scaling does not support Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## ABAC with Application Auto Scaling

**Supports ABAC (tags in policies):**

Partial

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines
permissions based on attributes. In AWS, these attributes are called
_tags_. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users or roles) and to
many AWS resources. Tagging entities and resources is the first step of ABAC. Then you
design ABAC policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the tag on the
resource that they are trying to access.

ABAC is helpful in environments that are growing rapidly and helps with situations where
policy management becomes cumbersome.

To control access based on tags, you provide tag information in the [condition element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)
of a policy using the `aws:ResourceTag/key-name`,
`aws:RequestTag/key-name`, or
`aws:TagKeys` condition keys.

ABAC is possible for resources that support tags, but not everything supports tags.
Scheduled actions and scaling policies don't support tags, but scalable targets support
tags. For more information, see [Tagging support for Application Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/resource-tagging-support.html).

For more information about ABAC, see [What is\
ABAC?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html) in the _IAM User Guide_. To view a tutorial with steps
for setting up ABAC, see [Use\
attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Using temporary credentials with Application Auto Scaling

**Supports temporary credentials:**

Yes

Temporary credentials provide short-term access to AWS resources and are automatically created when you use federation or switch roles. AWS recommends that you
dynamically generate temporary credentials instead of using long-term access keys. For
more information, see [Temporary\
security credentials in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html) and [AWS services\
that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## Service roles

**Supports service roles:**

Yes

If your Amazon EMR cluster uses automatic scaling, this feature allows Application Auto Scaling to assume a
service role on your behalf. Similar to a service-linked role, a service role allows the
service to access resources in other services to complete an action on your behalf. Service
roles appear in your IAM account and are owned by the account. This means that an IAM
administrator can change the permissions for this role. However, doing so might break the
functionality of the service.

Application Auto Scaling supports service roles only for Amazon EMR. For documentation for the EMR service
role, see [Using automatic scaling with\
a custom policy for instance groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-automatic-scaling.html) in the
_Amazon EMR Management Guide_.

###### Note

With the introduction of service-linked roles, several legacy service roles are no
longer required, for example, for Amazon ECS and Spot Fleet.

## Service-linked roles

**Supports service-linked roles:**

Yes

A service-linked role is a type of service role that is linked to an AWS service. The service can assume the role to perform an action on your behalf.
Service-linked roles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can view,
but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.

For information about Application Auto Scaling service-linked roles, see [Service-linked roles for Application Auto Scaling](application-auto-scaling-service-linked-roles.md).
