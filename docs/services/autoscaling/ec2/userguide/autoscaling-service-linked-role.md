# Service-linked roles for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses service-linked roles for the permissions that it requires to call other
AWS services on your behalf. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that
is linked directly to an AWS service.

Service-linked roles provide a secure way to delegate permissions to other
AWS services because only the linked service can assume a service-linked role. For
more information, see [Create\
a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.
Service-linked roles also enable all API calls to be visible through AWS CloudTrail. This
helps with monitoring and auditing requirements because you can track all actions that
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling performs on your behalf. For more information, see [Log Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API calls with AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

The following sections describe how to create and manage Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service-linked
roles. Start by configuring permissions to allow an IAM identity (such as a user or
role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role.

## Overview

There are two types of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service-linked roles:

- The default service-linked role for your account, named
AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling. This role is
automatically assigned to your Auto Scaling groups unless you specify a different
service-linked role.

- A service-linked role with a custom suffix that you specify when you
create the role, for example,
AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling\_ `mysuffix`.

The permissions of a custom suffix service-linked role are identical to those of
the default service-linked role. In both cases, you cannot edit the roles, and you
also cannot delete them if they are still in use by an Auto Scaling group. The only
difference is the role name suffix.

You can specify either role when you edit your AWS Key Management Service key policies to allow
instances that are launched by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to be encrypted with your customer managed key.
However, if you plan to give granular access to a specific customer managed key, you should
use a custom suffix service-linked role. Using a custom suffix service-linked role
provides you with:

- More control over the customer managed key

- The ability to track which Auto Scaling group made an API call in your CloudTrail
logs

If you create customer managed keys that not all users should have access to, follow these
steps to allow the use of a custom suffix service-linked role:

1. Create a service-linked role with a custom suffix. For more information,
    see [Create a service-linked role (manual)](#create-service-linked-role-manual).

2. Give the service-linked role access to a customer managed key. For more information
    about the key policy that allows the key to be used by a service-linked
    role, see [Required AWS KMS key policy for use with encrypted volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/key-policy-requirements-EBS-encryption.html).

3. Give users access to the service-linked role that you created. For more
    information about creating the IAM policy, see [Control which service-linked role can be passed (using PassRole)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#policy-example-pass-role). If users try to specify a
    service-linked role without permission to pass that role to the service,
    they receive an error.

## Permissions granted by the service-linked role

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the service-linked role named
AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling or your custom suffix
service-linked role.

The service-linked role trusts the following service to assume the role:

- `autoscaling.amazonaws.com`

The role permissions policy, [AutoScalingServiceRolePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AutoScalingServiceRolePolicy.html), allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
to complete the following actions:

- `ec2` – Create, describe, modify, start/stop, and
terminate EC2 instances.

- `iam` – [Pass IAM\
roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/us-iam-role.html) to EC2 instances so that applications running on the
instances can access temporary credentials for the role.

- `iam` – Create the
**AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot** service-linked role to
allow Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to launch Spot Instances on your behalf.

- `elasticloadbalancing` – Register and deregister
instances with Elastic Load Balancing and check the health of registered targets.

- `cloudwatch` – Create, describe, modify, and delete CloudWatch
alarms for scaling policies and retrieve metrics used for predictive
scaling.

- `sns` – Publish notifications to Amazon SNS when instances
launch or terminate.

- `events` – Create, describe, update, and delete EventBridge
rules on your behalf.

- `ssm` – Read parameters from Parameter Store when using a
Systems Manager parameter as an alias for an AMI ID in a launch template.

- `vpc-lattice` – Register and deregister instances with
VPC Lattice and check the health of registered targets.

- `resource-groups` – Get all resource
names (ARNs) of the resources that are members of a specified resource group.

## Supported Regions for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service-linked roles

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports using service-linked roles in all of the AWS Regions where the
service is available.

## Create, edit, and delete a service linked role

### Create a service-linked role (automatic)

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates the AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling
service-linked role for you the first time that you create an Auto Scaling group, unless you
manually create a custom suffix service-linked role and specify it when creating the
group.

You must have IAM permissions to create the service-linked role. Otherwise,
the automatic creation fails. For more information, see [Service-linked role permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the
_IAM User Guide_ and [Create a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#ec2-auto-scaling-slr-permissions) in this guide.

### Create a service-linked role (manual)

###### To create a service-linked role (console)

1. Open the IAM console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**,
    **Create role**.

3. For **Select trusted entity**, choose **AWS**
**service**.

4. For **Choose the service that will use this role**,
    choose **EC2 Auto Scaling** and the **EC2 Auto**
**Scaling** use case.

5. Choose **Next: Permissions**, **Next:**
**Tags**, and then **Next: Review**. Note: You
    cannot attach tags to service-linked roles during creation.

6. On the **Review** page, leave **Role**
**name** blank to create a service-linked role with the name
    **AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling**, or enter a suffix to
    create a service-linked role with the name
    **AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling\_ `suffix`**.

7. (Optional) For **Role description**, edit the description
    for the service-linked role.

8. Choose **Create role**.

###### To create a service-linked role (AWS CLI)

Use the following [create-service-linked-role](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/create-service-linked-role.html) CLI command to create a service-linked
role for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with the name
**AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling\_ `suffix`**.

```nohighlight

aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name autoscaling.amazonaws.com --custom-suffix suffix
```

The output of this command includes the ARN of the service-linked role, which you
can use to give the service-linked role access to your customer managed key.

```json

{
    "Role": {
        "RoleId": "ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF",
        "CreateDate": "2018-08-30T21:59:18Z",
        "RoleName": "AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling_suffix",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling_suffix",
        "Path": "/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Action": [
                        "sts:AssumeRole"
                    ],
                    "Principal": {
                        "Service": [
                            "autoscaling.amazonaws.com"
                        ]
                    },
                    "Effect": "Allow"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

For more information, see [Create a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

### Edit the service-linked role

You cannot edit the service-linked roles that are created for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. After you
create a service-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role or its
permissions. However, you can edit the description of the role. For more
information, see [Edit a service-linked role description](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_update-service-linked-role.html#edit-service-linked-role-iam-console) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

### Delete the service-linked role

If you are not using an Auto Scaling group, we recommend that you delete its
service-linked role. Deleting the role prevents you from having an entity that is
not used or actively monitored and maintained.

You can delete a service-linked role only after first deleting the related
dependent resources. This protects you from inadvertently revoking Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
permissions to your resources. If a service-linked role is used with multiple Auto Scaling
groups, you must delete all Auto Scaling groups that use the service-linked role before you
can delete it. For more information, see [Delete your Auto Scaling infrastructure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-process-shutdown.html).

You can use IAM to delete a service-linked role. For more information, see
[Delete a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage_delete.html#id_roles_manage_delete_slr) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

If you delete the AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling service-linked
role, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates the role again when you create an Auto Scaling group and do not
specify a different service-linked role.
