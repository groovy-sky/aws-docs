# Control which Auto Scaling instances terminate during scale in

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses termination policies to decide the order for terminating instances. You
can use a predefined policy or create a custom policy to meet your specific
requirements. By using a custom policy or instance scale in protection, you can also
prevent your Auto Scaling group from terminating instances that aren't yet ready to
terminate.

## When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses termination policies

The following sections describe the scenarios in which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses termination
policies.

### Scale in events

A scale in event occurs when there is a new value for the desired capacity of
an Auto Scaling group that is lower than the current capacity of the group.

Scale in events occur in the following scenarios:

- When using dynamic scaling policies and the size of the group
decreases as a result of changes in a metric's value

- When using scheduled scaling and the size of the group decreases as a
result of a scheduled action

- When you manually decrease the size of the group

The following example shows how termination policies work when there is a
scale in event.

1. The Auto Scaling group in this example has one instance type, two Availability
    Zones, and a desired capacity of two instances. It also has a dynamic
    scaling policy that adds and removes instances when resource utilization
    increases or decreases. The two instances in this group are distributed
    across the two Availability Zones as shown in the following
    diagram.

2. When the Auto Scaling group scales out, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches a new instance. The
    Auto Scaling group now has three instances, distributed across the two
    Availability Zones as shown in the following diagram.

3. When the Auto Scaling group scales in, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates one of the
    instances.

4. If you did not assign a specific termination policy to the group,
    Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the default termination policy. It selects the
    Availability Zone with two instances, and terminates the instance that
    was launched from a launch configuration, a different launch template,
    or the oldest version of the current launch template. If the instances
    were launched from the same launch template and version, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
    selects the instance that is closest to the next billing hour and
    terminates it.

### Instance refresh

You can start an instance refresh to update the instances in your Auto Scaling group.
During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates instances in the group and then
launches replacements for the terminated instances. The termination policy for
the Auto Scaling group controls which instances are replaced first.

### Availability Zone rebalancing

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances your capacity evenly across the Availability Zones enabled
for your Auto Scaling group. This helps reduce the impact of an Availability Zone
outage. If the distribution of capacity across Availability Zones becomes out of
balance, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling rebalances the Auto Scaling group by launching instances in the
enabled Availability Zones with the fewest instances and terminating instances
elsewhere. The termination policy controls which instances are prioritized for
termination first.

There are a number of reasons why the distribution of instances across
Availability Zones can become out of balance.

Removing instances

If you detach instances from your Auto Scaling group, you put instances on
standby, or you explicitly terminate instances and decrement the
desired capacity, which prevents replacement instances from
launching, the group can become unbalanced. If this occurs, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
compensates by rebalancing the Availability Zones.

Using different Availability Zones than originally specified

If you expand your Auto Scaling group to include additional Availability
Zones, or you change which Availability Zones are used, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
launches instances in the new Availability Zones and terminates
instances in other zones to help ensure that your Auto Scaling group spans
Availability Zones evenly.

Availability outage

Availability outages are rare. However, if one Availability Zone
becomes unavailable and recovers later, your Auto Scaling group can become
unbalanced between Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tries to gradually
rebalance the group, and rebalancing might terminate instances in
other zones.

For example, imagine that you have an Auto Scaling group that has one
instance type, two Availability Zones, and a desired capacity of two
instances. In a situation where one Availability Zone fails,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically launches a new instance in the healthy
Availability Zone to replace the one in the unhealthy Availability
Zone. Then, when the unhealthy Availability Zone returns to a
healthy state later on, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically launches a new
instance in this zone, which in turn terminates an instance in the
unaffected zone.

###### Note

When rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the
old ones, so that rebalancing does not compromise the performance or
availability of your application.

Because Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch new instances before terminating the
old ones, being at or near the specified maximum capacity could impede or
completely stop rebalancing activities. To avoid this problem, the system
can temporarily exceed the specified maximum capacity of a group by a 10
percent margin (or by a margin of one instance, whichever is greater) during
a rebalancing activity. The margin is extended only if the group is at or
near maximum capacity and needs rebalancing, either because of
user-requested rezoning or to compensate for zone availability issues. The
extension lasts only as long as needed to rebalance the group.
