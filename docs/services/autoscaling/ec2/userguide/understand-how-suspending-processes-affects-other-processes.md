The following sections describe what happens when different processes are
suspended individually.

## `Launch` is suspended

- `AlarmNotification` is still active, but your Auto Scaling group
can't initiate scale-out activities for alarms that are in breach.

- `ScheduledActions` is active, but your Auto Scaling group can't
initiate scale-out activities for any scheduled actions that occur.

- `AZRebalance` stops rebalancing the group.

- `ReplaceUnhealthy` continues to terminate unhealthy
instances, but does not launch replacements. When you resume the
`Launch` process, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling immediately replaces any
instances that it terminated during the time that `Launch`
was suspended.

- `InstanceRefresh` does not replace instances.

## `Terminate` is suspended

- `AlarmNotification` is still active, but your Auto Scaling group
can't initiate scale in activities for alarms that are in breach.

- `ScheduledActions` is active, but your Auto Scaling group can't
initiate scale in activities for any scheduled actions that occur.

- `AZRebalance` is still active but does not function
properly. It can launch new instances without terminating the old ones.
This could cause your Auto Scaling group to grow up to 10 percent larger than
its maximum size, because this is allowed temporarily during rebalancing
activities. Your Auto Scaling group could remain above its maximum size until
you resume the `Terminate` process.

- `ReplaceUnhealthy` is inactive but not
`HealthCheck`. When `Terminate` resumes, the
`ReplaceUnhealthy` process immediately starts running. If
any instances were marked as unhealthy while `Terminate` was
suspended, they are immediately replaced.

- `InstanceRefresh` does not replace instances.

## `AddToLoadBalancer` is suspended

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches the instances but does not add them to the load
balancer target group or Classic Load Balancer. When you resume the
`AddToLoadBalancer` process, it resumes adding instances
to the load balancer when they are launched. However, it does not add
the instances that were launched while this process was suspended. You
must register those instances manually.

## `AlarmNotification` is suspended

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not invoke scaling policies when a CloudWatch alarm threshold
is in breach. When you resume `AlarmNotification`, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
considers policies with alarm thresholds that are currently in
breach.

## `AZRebalance` is suspended

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not attempt to redistribute instances after certain
events. However, if a scale-out or scale in event occurs, the scaling
process still tries to balance the Availability Zones. For example,
during scale out, it launches instances in the Availability Zone with
the fewest instances. If the group becomes unbalanced while
`AZRebalance` is suspended and you resume it, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
attempts to rebalance the group. It first calls `Launch` and
then `Terminate`.

- Warm pools are not affected when `AZRebalance` is suspended.

## `HealthCheck` is suspended

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling stops marking instances unhealthy as a result of EC2 and
Elastic Load Balancing health checks. Your custom health checks continue to function
properly. After you suspend `HealthCheck`, if you need to,
you can manually set the health state of instances in your group and
have `ReplaceUnhealthy` replace them.

## `InstanceRefresh` is suspended

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling stops replacing instances as a result of an instance refresh.
If there is an instance refresh in progress, this pauses the operation
without canceling it.

## `ReplaceUnhealthy` is suspended

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling stops replacing instances that are marked as unhealthy.
Instances that fail EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing health checks are still marked as
unhealthy. As soon as you resume the `ReplaceUnhealthy`
process, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces instances that were marked unhealthy while
this process was suspended. The `ReplaceUnhealthy` process
calls `Terminate` first and then `Launch`.

## `ScheduledActions` is suspended

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not run scheduled actions that are scheduled to run
during the suspension period. When you resume
`ScheduledActions`, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling only considers scheduled
actions whose scheduled time has not yet passed.

## Additional considerations

In addition, when `Launch` or `Terminate` are suspended,
the following features might not function correctly:

- Maximum instance lifetime – When
`Launch` or `Terminate` are suspended, the
maximum instance lifetime feature can't replace any instances.

- Spot Instance interruptions – If
`Terminate` is suspended and your Auto Scaling group has Spot
Instances, they can still terminate in the event that Spot capacity is
no longer available. While `Launch` is suspended, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
can't launch replacement instances from another Spot Instance pool or
from the same Spot Instance pool when it is available again.

- Capacity Rebalancing – If
`Terminate` is suspended and you use Capacity Rebalancing
to handle Spot Instance interruptions, the Amazon EC2 Spot service can still
terminate instances in the event that Spot capacity is no longer
available. If `Launch` is suspended, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can't launch
replacement instances from another Spot Instance pool or from the same
Spot Instance pool when it is available again.

- Attaching and detaching instances
– When `Launch` and `Terminate` are
suspended, you can detach instances that are attached to your Auto Scaling
group, but while `Launch` is suspended, you can't attach new
instances to the group.

- Standby instances – When
`Launch` and `Terminate` are suspended, you
can put an instance in the `Standby` state, but while
`Launch` is suspended, you can't return an instance in
the `Standby` state to service.
