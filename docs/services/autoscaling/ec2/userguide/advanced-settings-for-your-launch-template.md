# Create a launch template using advanced settings

This topic describes how to create a launch template with advanced settings from the
AWS Management Console.

###### To create a launch template using advanced settings

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose
    **Launch Templates**, and then choose **Create**
**launch template**.

3. Configure your launch template as described in the following topics:

- [Required settings](#configure-required-settings)

- [Advanced settings](#configure-advanced-settings)

4. Choose **Create launch template**.

## Required settings

When you create a launch template, you must include the following required
settings.

**Launch template name**

Enter a unique name that describes the launch template.

**Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**

Choose the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that you want to use. You can
either search or browse for the AMI you want to use. For best scaling
efficiency, choose a custom AMI that is fully configured to launch an
instance with your application code and requires few modifications on
launch.

**Instance type**

Choose an instance type that is compatible with your AMI. You can skip
adding an instance type to your launch template if you plan to use
multiple instances types that are embedded in the Auto Scaling group's own
resource definition. An instance type is only required if you don't plan
to create a [mixed instances group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html).

## Advanced settings

The advanced settings are optional. If you do not configure any advanced settings,
the specific capabilities will not be added to your instances.

Expand the **Advanced details** section to view the advanced
settings. The following sections describe the most useful advanced settings to focus
on when creating a launch template for an Auto Scaling group. For more information, see
[Advanced details](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/create-launch-template.md#lt-advanced-details) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**IAM instance profile**

The instance profile contains the IAM role that you want to use.
When your Auto Scaling group launches an EC2 instance, the permissions defined
in the associated IAM role are granted to applications running on the
instance. For more information, see [IAM role for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/us-iam-role.html).

**Termination protection**

When enabled, this feature prevents users from terminating an instance
using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI commands, and API operations. Termination
protection provides an extra safeguard against accidental termination.
It does not prevent Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from terminating an instance. To control
which instances Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate, see [Use instance scale-in protection to control instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html).

**Detailed CloudWatch monitoring**

You can enable detailed monitoring for your EC2 instances to allow
them to send metric data to Amazon CloudWatch at 1-minute intervals. By default,
EC2 instances send metric data to CloudWatch at 5-minute intervals. Additional
charges apply. For more information, see [Configure monitoring for Auto Scaling instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/enable-as-instance-metrics.html).

**Credit specification**

Amazon EC2 provides burstable performance instances, such as T2, T3, and
T3a, that allow applications to burst beyond the baseline CPU
performance when required. By default, these instances can burst for a
limited time before their CPU usage is throttled. You can optionally
enable unlimited mode so that the instances can burst beyond the
baseline for as long as needed. This allows applications to sustain high
CPU performance when required. Additional charges may apply. For more
information, see [Use an Auto Scaling group to launch a burstable performance instance as\
Unlimited](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/burstable-performance-instances-how-to.md#burstable-performance-instances-auto-scaling-grp) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**Placement group name**

You can specify a placement group and use a cluster or a partition
strategy to influence how your instances are physically located in the
AWS data center. For small Auto Scaling groups, you can also use the spread
strategy. For more information, see [Placement\
groups](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/placement-groups.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

There are some considerations when using placement groups with Auto Scaling
groups:

- If a placement group is specified in both the launch template
and the Auto Scaling group, the placement group for the Auto Scaling group takes
precedence.

- In CloudFormation, be careful if you define a placement group in the
launch template. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will launch instances into the
specified placement group. However, CloudFormation will not receive
signals from those instances if you use an [UpdatePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html) with your Auto Scaling group (though this
could change in the future).

**Purchasing option**

You can choose **Request Spot Instances** to request
Spot Instances at the Spot price, capped at the On-Demand price, and
choose **Customize** to change the default Spot
Instance settings. For an Auto Scaling group, you must specify a one-time
request with no end date (the default). For more information, see [Request Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-spot-instances.html). This setting may
be useful in special circumstances, but in general it's best to leave it
unspecified and create a mixed instances group instead. For more
information, see [Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html).

If you specify a Spot Instance request in your launch template, you
can't create a mixed instances group. If you try to use a launch
template that requests Spot Instances with a mixed instances group, you
receive the following error message: `Incompatible
                                    launch template: You cannot use a launch template that is set to
                                    request Spot Instances (InstanceMarketOptions) when you
                                    configure an Auto Scaling group with a mixed instances policy. Add a
                                    different launch template to the group and try
                                again.`

**Capacity Reservation**

Capacity Reservations allow you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2
instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. For more
information, see [On-Demand\
Capacity Reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

You can choose whether to launch instances into:

- any open Capacity Reservation
( **Open**)

- a specific Capacity Reservation ( **Target by**
**ID**)

- a group of Capacity Reservations ( **Target by**
**group**)

To target a specific Capacity Reservation, the instance type in your
launch template must match the instance type of the reservation. When
you create your Auto Scaling group, use the same Availability Zone as the
Capacity Reservation. Depending on the AWS Region you choose, you can
choose to target a Capacity Block instead. For more information, see
[Use Capacity Blocks for machine learning workloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-capacity-blocks.html).

To target a group of Capacity Reservations, see [Reserve capacity in specific Availability Zones with Capacity Reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/use-ec2-capacity-reservations.html). By targeting a
group of Capacity Reservations, you can have capacity distributed across
multiple Availability Zones to improve resiliency.

**Tenancy**

Amazon EC2 provides three options for the tenancy of your EC2 instances:

- Shared ( **Shared**) – Multiple
AWS accounts may share the same physical hardware. This is the
default tenancy option when launching an instance.

- Dedicated instances ( **Dedicated**) –
Your instance runs on single-tenant hardware. No other AWS
customer shares the same physical server. For more information,
see [Dedicated\
Instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-instance.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- Dedicated Hosts ( **Dedicated host**) –
The instance runs on a physical server that is dedicated to your
use. Using Dedicated Hosts makes it easier to bring your own
licenses (BYOL) that have dedicated hardware requirements to EC2
and meet compliance use cases. If you choose this option, you
must provide a host resource group for **Tenancy host**
**resource group**. For more information, see [Dedicated\
Hosts](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/dedicated-hosts-overview.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Support for Dedicated Hosts is only available if you specify a host
resource group. You can't target a specific host ID or use host
placement affinity.

- If you try to use a launch template that specifies a host ID,
you receive the following error message:
`Incompatible launch template:
                                              Tenancy host ID is not supported for Auto
                                              Scaling.`

- If you try to use a launch template that specifies host
placement affinity, you receive the following error message:
`Incompatible launch template:
                                              Auto Scaling does not support host placement
                                              affinity.`

**Tenancy host resource group**

With AWS License Manager, you can bring your own licenses to AWS and manage
them centrally. A host resource group is a group of Dedicated Hosts that
are linked to a specific License Manager license configuration. Host resource
groups allow you to easily launch EC2 instances onto Dedicated Hosts
that match your software licensing needs. You do not need to manually
allocate Dedicated Hosts ahead of time. They are automatically created
as needed. Note that when you associate an AMI with a license
configuration, that AMI can only be associated with one host resource
group at a time. For more information, see [Host resource groups in AWS License Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/host-resource-groups.html) in the
_License Manager User Guide_.

**License configurations**

With this setting, you can specify a license configuration for your
instances without restricting their tenancy to Dedicated Hosts. The
license configuration tracks the software licenses deployed on the
instances so you can monitor your license usage and compliance. For more
information, see [Create a self-managed license](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/create-license-configuration.html) in the
_License Manager User Guide_.

**Metadata accessible**

You can choose whether to enable or disable access to the HTTP
endpoint of the instance metadata service. By default, the HTTP endpoint
is enabled. If you choose to disable the endpoint, access to your
instance metadata is turned off. You can specify the condition to
require IMDSv2 only when the HTTP endpoint is enabled. For more
information, see [Configure the instance metadata options](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**Metadata version**

You can choose to require the use of Instance Metadata Service Version
2 (IMDSv2) when requesting instance metadata. If you do not specify a
value, the default is to support both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2. For more
information, see [Configure the instance metadata options](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**Metadata token response hop limit**

You can set the allowable number of network hops for the metadata
token. If you do not specify a value, the default is 1. For more
information, see [Configure the instance metadata options](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

**User data**

You can customize and finish configuring your instances at launch time
by specifying shell scripts or cloud-init directives as user data. The
user data runs when the instance initially starts up, allowing you to
automatically install applications, dependencies, or customizations at
launch time. For more information, see [Run commands on your\
Linux instance at launch](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/user-data.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

If you have large downloads or complex scripts, this adds to the time
it takes for the instance to become ready for use. In which case, you
may need to configure a lifecycle hook to delay an instance from
reaching the `InService` state until it's fully provisioned.
For more information about adding a lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling group,
see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html).
