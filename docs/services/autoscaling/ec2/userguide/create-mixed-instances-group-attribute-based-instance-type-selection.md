# Create mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type selection

Instead of manually choosing instance types for your mixed instances group, you can
specify a set of instance attributes that describe your compute requirements. As Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
launches instances, any instance types used by the Auto Scaling group must match your required
instance attributes. This is known as _attribute-based instance type selection_.

This approach is ideal for workloads and frameworks that can be flexible about which
instance types they use, such as containers, big data, and CI/CD.

The following are benefits of attribute-based instance type selection:

- Optimal flexibility for Spot Instances –
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can select from a wide range of instance types for launching Spot
Instances. This meets the Spot best practice of being flexible about instance types,
which gives the Amazon EC2 Spot service a better chance of finding and allocating your
required amount of compute capacity.

- Easily use the right instance types – With
so many instance types available, finding the right instance types for your workload
can be time consuming. When you specify instance attributes, the instance types will
automatically have the required attributes for your workload.

- Automatic use of new instance types – Your
Auto Scaling groups can use newer generation instance types as they're released. Newer
generation instance types are automatically used when they match your requirements
and align with the allocation strategies you choose for your Auto Scaling group.

## How attribute-based instance type selection works

With attribute-based instance type selection, instead of providing a list of specific
instance types, you provide a list of instance attributes that your instances require,
such as:

- vCPU count – The minimum and maximum
number of vCPUs per instance.

- Memory – The minimum and maximum GiBs of
memory per instance.

- Local storage – Whether to use EBS or
instance store volumes for local storage.

- Burstable performance – Whether to use
the T instance family, including T4g, T3a, T3, and T2 types.

There are many options available for defining your instance requirements. For a
description of each option and the default values, see [InstanceRequirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_InstanceRequirements.html) in the _Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference_.

When your Auto Scaling group needs to launch an instance, it will search for instance types
that match your specified attributes and are available in that Availability Zone. The
allocation strategy then determines which of the matching instance types to launch. By
default, attribute-based instance type selection has a price protection feature enabled
to prevent your Auto Scaling group from launching instance types that exceed your budget
thresholds.

By default, you use the number of instances as the unit of measurement when setting
the desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group, meaning each instance counts as one unit.

Alternatively, you can set the value for desired capacity to the number of vCPUs or
the amount of memory. To do so, use the **Desired capacity type**
dropdown field in the AWS Management Console or the `DesiredCapacityType` property in the
`CreateAutoScalingGroup` or `UpdateAutoScalingGroup` API
operation. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling then launches the number of instances required to meet the desired
vCPU or memory capacity. For example, if you use vCPUs as the desired capacity type and
use instances with 2 vCPUs each, a desired capacity of 10 vCPUs would launch 5
instances. This is a useful alternative to [instance\
weights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-instance-weighting.html).

## Price protection

With price protection, you can specify the maximum price you are willing to pay for
EC2 instances launched by your Auto Scaling group. Price protection is a feature that prevents
your Auto Scaling group from using instance types that you would consider too expensive even if
they happen to fit the attributes that you specified.

Price protection is enabled by default and has separate price thresholds for On-Demand
Instances and Spot Instances. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling needs to launch new instances, any instance
types priced above the relevant threshold are not launched.

###### Topics

- [On-Demand price protection](#on-demand-price-price-protection)

- [Spot price protection](#spot-price-price-protection)

- [Customize price protection](#customize-price-price-protection)

### On-Demand price protection

For On-Demand Instances, you define the maximum On-Demand price you're willing to
pay as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. The identified
On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R
instance type with your specified attributes.

If an On-Demand price protection value is not explicitly defined, a default
maximum On-Demand price of 20 percent higher than the identified On-Demand price
will be used.

### Spot price protection

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will automatically apply optimal Spot Instance price
protection to consistently select from a wide range of instance types. You can also
manually set the price protection yourself. However, letting Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling do it for you
can improve the likelihood that your Spot capacity is fulfilled.

You can manually specify the price protection using one of the following options.
If you manually set the price protection, we recommend using the first
option.

- A percentage of an identified _On-Demand_
_price_ – The identified On-Demand price is
the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type
with your specified attributes.

- A percentage higher than an identified
_Spot price_ – The identified
Spot price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R
instance type with your specified attributes. We do not recommend using this
option because Spot prices can fluctuate, and therefore your price
protection threshold might also fluctuate.

### Customize price protection

You can customize the price protection thresholds in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling console or using
the AWS CLI or SDKs.

- In the console, use the **On-Demand price protection**
and **Spot price protection** settings in
**Additional instance attributes**.

- In the [InstanceRequirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_InstanceRequirements.html) structure, to specify the On-Demand
Instance price protection threshold, use the
`OnDemandMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice` property. To
specify the Spot Instance price protection threshold, use either the
`MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice` or the
`SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice` property.

If you set **Desired capacity type**
( `DesiredCapacityType`) to **vCPUs** or
**Memory GiB**, the price protection applies based on the per
vCPU or per memory price instead of the per instance price.

You can also turn off price protection. To indicate no price protection threshold,
specify a high percentage value, such as `999999`.

###### Note

If no current generation C, M, or R instance types match your specified
attributes, price protection is still applicable. When no match is found, the
identified price is from the lowest priced current generation instance types, or
failing that, the lowest priced previous generation instance types, that match
your attributes.

## Performance protection

_Performance protection_ is a feature that ensures your Auto Scaling group uses instance types that are similar to or exceed a specified performance baseline.
To use performance protection, you specify an instance family as a baseline reference. The capabilities of the specified instance family establish the lowest acceptable level of performance.
When Auto Scaling selects instance types, it considers your specified attributes and the performance baseline. Instance types that fall below the performance baseline are automatically excluded from
selection, even if they match your other specified attributes. This ensures that all selected instance types offer performance similar to or better than the baseline established by the specified instance family.
Auto Scaling uses this baseline to guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every application.

Currently, this feature only supports CPU performance as a baseline performance factor. The CPU performance of the specified instance family serves as the performance baseline, ensuring that selected instance types are similar to or
exceed this baseline. Instance families with the same CPU processors lead to the same filtering results, even if their network or disk performance differs. For example, specifying either `c6in` or `c6i` as the baseline reference would
produce identical performance-based filtering results because both instance families use the same CPU processor.

###### Unsupported instance families

The following instance families are not supported for performance protection:

- `c1`

- `g3` \| `g3s`

- `hpc7g`

- `m1` \| `m2`

- `mac1` \| `mac2` \| `mac2-m1ultra` \|
`mac2-m2` \| `mac2-m2pro`

- `p3dn` \| `p4d` \| `p5`

- `t1`

- `u-12tb1` \| `u-18tb1` \| `u-24tb1` \|
`u-3tb1` \| `u-6tb1` \| `u-9tb1` \|
`u7i-12tb` \| `u7in-16tb` \| `u7in-24tb` \|
`u7in-32tb`

If you enable performance protection by specifying a supported instance family, the
returned instance types will exclude the above unsupported instance families.

###### Example: Set a CPU performance baseline

In the following example, the instance requirement is to launch with instance
types that have CPU cores that are as performant as the `c6i` instance
family. This will filter out instance types with less performant CPU processors,
even if they meet your other specified instance requirements such as the number of
vCPUs. For example, if your specified instance attributes include 4 vCPUs and 16 GB
of memory, an instance type with these attributes but with lower CPU performance
than `c6i` will be excluded from selection.

```JSON

"BaselinePerformanceFactors": {
        "Cpu": {
            "References": [
                {
                    "InstanceFamily": "c6i"
                }
            ]
        }
```

###### Considerations

Consider the following when using performance protection:

- You can specify either instance types or instance attributes, but not both at the same time.

- You can specify a maximum of four `InstanceRequirements` structures in a request configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Create a launch template. For more information, see [Create a launch template for an Auto Scaling group](create-launch-template.md).

- Verify that the launch template doesn't already request Spot Instances.

## Create a mixed instances group with attribute-based instance type selection (console)

Use the following procedure to create a mixed instances group by using attribute-based
instance type selection. To help you move through the steps efficiently, some optional
sections are skipped.

For most general purpose workloads, it's enough to specify the number of vCPUs and
memory that you need. For advanced use cases, you can specify attributes like storage
type, network interfaces, CPU manufacturer, and accelerator type.

To review the best practices for a mixed instances group, see [Setup overview for creating a mixed instances group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/mixed-instances-groups-set-up-overview.html).

###### To create a mixed instances group

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the same AWS Region
    that you used when you created the launch template.

3. Choose **Create an Auto Scaling group**.

4. On the **Choose launch template or configuration** page, for
    **Auto Scaling group name**, enter a name for your Auto Scaling
    group.

5. To choose your launch template, do the following:
1. For **Launch template**, choose an existing launch
       template.

2. For **Launch template version**, choose whether the
       Auto Scaling group uses the default, the latest, or a specific version of the
       launch template when scaling out.

3. Verify that your launch template supports all of the options that you
       are planning to use, and then choose **Next**.
6. On the **Choose instance launch options** page, do the
    following:
01. For **Instance type requirements**, choose
        **Override launch template**.

       ###### Note

       If you chose a launch template that already contains a set of
       instance attributes, such as vCPUs and memory, then the instance
       attributes are displayed. These attributes are added to the Auto Scaling
       group properties, where you can update them from the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
       console at any time.

02. Under **Specify instance attributes**, start by
        entering your vCPUs and memory requirements.

- For **vCPUs**, enter the desired minimum and
maximum number of vCPUs. To specify no limit, select
**No minimum**, **No**
**maximum**, or both.

- For **Memory (GiB)**, enter the desired
minimum and maximum amount of memory. To specify no limit,
select **No minimum**, **No**
**maximum**, or both.

03. (Optional) For **Additional instance attributes**,
        you can optionally specify one or more attributes to express your
        compute requirements in more detail. Each additional attribute adds
        further constraints to your request.

04. Expand **Preview matching instance types** to view
        the instance types that have your specified attributes.

05. Under **Instance purchase options**, for
        **Instances distribution**, specify the percentages
        of the group to launch as On-Demand Instances and as Spot Instances. If
        your application is stateless, fault tolerant, and can handle an
        instance being interrupted, you can specify a higher percentage of Spot
        Instances.

06. (Optional) When you specify a percentage for Spot Instances, select
        **Include On-Demand base capacity** and then
        specify the minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's initial capacity that
        must be fulfilled by On-Demand Instances. Anything beyond the base
        capacity uses the **Instances distribution** settings
        to determine how many On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances to launch.

07. Under **Allocation strategies**, **Lowest**
       **price** is automatically selected for the
        **On-Demand allocation strategy** and cannot be
        changed.

08. For **Spot allocation strategy**, choose an
        allocation strategy. **Price capacity optimized** is
        selected by default.

09. For **Capacity Rebalancing**, choose whether to
        enable or disable Capacity Rebalancing. Use Capacity Rebalancing to
        automatically respond when your Spot Instances approach termination from
        a Spot interruption. For more information, see [Capacity Rebalancing in Auto Scaling to replace at-risk Spot Instances](ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.md).

10. Under **Network**, for **VPC**,
        choose a VPC. The Auto Scaling group must be created in the same VPC as the
        security group you specified in your launch template.

11. For **Availability Zones and subnets**, choose one or
        more subnets in the specified VPC. Use subnets in multiple Availability
        Zones for high availability. For more information, see [Considerations when choosing VPC subnets](asg-in-vpc.md#as-vpc-considerations).

12. Choose **Next**, **Next**.
7. For the **Configure group size and scaling policies** step,
    do the following:
1. To measure your desired capacity in units other than instances, choose
       the appropriate option for **Group size**,
       **Desired capacity type**.
       **Units**, **vCPUs**, and
       **Memory GiB** are supported. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
       specifies **Units**, which translates into number of
       instances.

2. For **Desired capacity**, the initial size of your
       Auto Scaling group.

3. In the **Scaling** section, under **Scaling**
      **limits**, if your new value for **Desired**
      **capacity** is greater than **Min desired**
      **capacity** and **Max desired capacity**,
       the **Max desired capacity** is automatically increased
       to the new desired capacity value. You can change these limits as
       needed. For more information, see [Set scaling limits for your Auto Scaling group](asg-capacity-limits.md).
8. Choose **Skip to review**.

9. On the **Review** page, choose **Create Auto Scaling**
**group**.

## Create a mixed instances group with attribute-based instance type selection (AWS CLI)

###### To create a mixed instances group using the command line

Use one of the following commands:

- [create-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html) (AWS CLI)

- [New-ASAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-ASAutoScalingGroup.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

## Example configuration

To create an Auto Scaling group with attribute-based instance type selection by using the
AWS CLI, use the following [create-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html) command.

The following instance attributes are specified:

- `VCpuCount` – The instance types must have a minimum of four vCPUs
and a maximum of eight vCPUs.

- `MemoryMiB` – The instance types must have a minimum of 16,384 MiB
of memory.

- `CpuManufacturers` – The instance types must have an Intel
manufactured CPU.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --cli-input-json file://~/config.json
```

The following is an example `config.json` file.

```json

{
    "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
    "DesiredCapacityType": "units",
    "MixedInstancesPolicy": {
        "LaunchTemplate": {
            "LaunchTemplateSpecification": {
                "LaunchTemplateName": "my-launch-template",
                "Version": "$Default"
            },
            "Overrides": [{
                "InstanceRequirements": {
                    "VCpuCount": {"Min": 4, "Max": 8},
                    "MemoryMiB": {"Min": 16384},
                    "CpuManufacturers": ["intel"]
                }
            }]
        },
        "InstancesDistribution": {
            "OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity": 50,
            "SpotAllocationStrategy": "price-capacity-optimized"
        }
    },
    "MinSize": 0,
    "MaxSize": 100,
    "DesiredCapacity": 4,
    "DesiredCapacityType": "units",
    "VPCZoneIdentifier": "subnet-5ea0c127,subnet-6194ea3b,subnet-c934b782"
}
```

To set the value for desired capacity as the number of vCPUs or the amount of
memory, specify `"DesiredCapacityType": "vcpu"` or
`"DesiredCapacityType": "memory-mib"` in the file. The default
desired capacity type is `units`, which sets the value for desired
capacity as the number of instances.

Alternatively, you can use the following [create-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html) command to create the Auto Scaling group. This
references a YAML file as the sole parameter for your Auto Scaling group.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --cli-input-yaml file://~/config.yaml
```

The following is an example `config.yaml` file.

```YAML

---
AutoScalingGroupName: my-asg
DesiredCapacityType: units
MixedInstancesPolicy:
  LaunchTemplate:
    LaunchTemplateSpecification:
      LaunchTemplateName: my-launch-template
      Version: $Default
    Overrides:
    - InstanceRequirements:
         VCpuCount:
           Min: 2
           Max: 4
         MemoryMiB:
           Min: 2048
         CpuManufacturers:
         - intel
  InstancesDistribution:
    OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity: 50
    SpotAllocationStrategy: price-capacity-optimized
MinSize: 0
MaxSize: 100
DesiredCapacity: 4
DesiredCapacityType: units
VPCZoneIdentifier: subnet-5ea0c127,subnet-6194ea3b,subnet-c934b782
```

To set the value for desired capacity as the number of vCPUs or the amount of
memory, specify `DesiredCapacityType: vcpu` or
`DesiredCapacityType: memory-mib` in the file. The default
desired capacity type is `units`, which sets the value for desired
capacity as the number of instances.

For an example of how to use multiple launch templates with attribute-based instance type selection,
see [Use multiple launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-launch-template-overrides.html).

## Preview your instance types

You can preview the instance types that match your compute requirements without
launching them and adjust your requirements if necessary. When creating your Auto Scaling group
in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling console, a preview of the instance types appears in the
**Preview matching instance types** section on the **Choose**
**instance launch options** page.

Alternatively, you can preview the instance types by making an Amazon EC2 [GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-getinstancetypesfrominstancerequirements.md) API call using the AWS CLI or an
SDK. Pass the `InstanceRequirements` parameters in the request in the exact
format that you would use to create or update an Auto Scaling group. For more information, see
[Preview instance types with specified attributes](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/ec2-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.md#ec2fleet-get-instance-types-from-instance-requirements) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.
