# Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling offers the ability to add lifecycle hooks to your Auto Scaling groups. These hooks let
you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then
perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs. A
lifecycle hook provides a specified amount of time (one hour by default) to wait for the
action to complete before the instance transitions to the next state.

As an example of using lifecycle hooks with Auto Scaling instances:

- When a scale-out event occurs, your newly launched instance completes its startup
sequence and transitions to a wait state. While the instance is in a wait state, it
runs a script to download and install the needed software packages for your
application, making sure that your instance is fully ready before it starts
receiving traffic. When the script is finished installing software, it sends the
**complete-lifecycle-action** command to continue.

- When a scale-in event occurs, a lifecycle hook pauses the instance before it is
terminated and sends you a notification using Amazon EventBridge. While the instance is in the
wait state, you can invoke an AWS Lambda function or connect to the instance to
download logs or other data before the instance is fully terminated.

A popular use of lifecycle hooks is to control when instances are registered with Elastic Load Balancing.
By adding a launch lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling group, you can ensure that your bootstrap
scripts have completed successfully and the applications on the instances are ready to
accept traffic before they are registered to the load balancer at the end of the lifecycle
hook.

## Lifecycle hook availability

The following table lists the lifecycle hooks available for various scenarios.

EventInstance launch or termination¹[Maximum Instance\

¹ Applies to all launches and terminations, whether they are initiated
automatically or manually such as when you call the `SetDesiredCapacity` or
`TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup` operations. Does not apply when you
attach or detach instances, move instances in and out of standby mode, or delete the
group with the force delete option.

## Considerations and limitations for lifecycle hooks

When working with lifecycle hooks, keep in mind the following notes and
limitations:

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provides its own lifecycle to help with the management of Auto Scaling
groups. This lifecycle differs from that of other EC2 instances. For more
information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-lifecycle.html). Instances in a warm pool also
have their own lifecycle, as described in [Lifecycle state transitions for instances in a warm pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/warm-pool-instance-lifecycle.html#lifecycle-state-transitions).

- By default, termination lifecycle hooks operate on a best-effort basis. If a termination
lifecycle hook times out, or is abandoned, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling proceeds with terminating the instance
immediately. You can combine termination lifecycle hooks with an instance lifecycle policy
for instance retention. For more information, see [Control instance retention with instance lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/instance-lifecycle-policy.html).

- You can use lifecycle hooks with Spot Instances, but a lifecycle hook does not
prevent an instance from terminating in the event that capacity is no longer
available, which can happen at any time with a two-minute interruption notice.
For more information, see [Spot Instance interruptions](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/spot-interruptions.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_. However, you can enable Capacity
Rebalancing to proactively replace Spot Instances that have received a rebalance
recommendation from the Amazon EC2 Spot service, a signal that is sent when a Spot
Instance is at elevated risk of interruption. For more information, see [Capacity Rebalancing in Auto Scaling to replace at-risk Spot Instances](ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.md).

- Instances can remain in a wait state for a finite period of time. The default
timeout for a lifecycle hook is one hour (heartbeat timeout). There is also a
global timeout that specifies the maximum amount of time that you can keep an
instance in a wait state. The global timeout is 48 hours or 100 times the
heartbeat timeout, whichever is smaller.

- The result of the lifecycle hook can be either abandon or continue. If an
instance is launching, continue indicates that your actions were successful, and
that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can put the instance into service. Otherwise, abandon indicates
that your custom actions were unsuccessful, and that we can terminate and
replace the instance. If an instance is terminating, both abandon and continue
allow the instance to terminate. However, abandon stops any remaining actions,
such as other lifecycle hooks, and continue allows any other lifecycle hooks to
complete.

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling limits the rate at which it allows instances to launch if the
lifecycle hooks are failing consistently, so make sure to test and fix any
permanent errors in your lifecycle actions.

- Creating and updating lifecycle hooks using the AWS CLI, CloudFormation, or an SDK
provides options not available when creating a lifecycle hook from the
AWS Management Console. For example, the field to specify the ARN of an SNS topic or SQS
queue doesn't appear in the console, because Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling already sends events to
Amazon EventBridge. These events can be filtered and redirected to AWS services such as
Lambda, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS as needed.

- You can add multiple lifecycle hooks to an Auto Scaling group while you are creating
it, by calling the [CreateAutoScalingGroup](../../../../reference/autoscaling/ec2/apireference/api-createautoscalinggroup.md) API using the AWS CLI, CloudFormation, or an SDK.
However, each hook must have the same notification target and IAM role, if
specified. To create lifecycle hooks with different notification targets and
different roles, create the lifecycle hooks one at a time in separate calls to
the [PutLifecycleHook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_PutLifecycleHook.html) API.

- If you add a lifecycle hook for instance launch, the health check grace period
starts as soon as the instance reaches the `InService` state. For
more information, see [Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group](health-check-grace-period.md).

###### Scaling considerations

- Dynamic scaling policies scale in and out in response to CloudWatch metric data,
such as CPU and network I/O, that's aggregated across multiple instances. When
scaling out, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling doesn't immediately count a new instance towards the
aggregated instance metrics of the Auto Scaling group. It waits until the instance
reaches the `InService` state and the instance warmup has finished.
For more information, see [Scaling performance considerations](ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.md#scaling-performance-considerations) in the default instance
warmup topic.

- On scale in, the aggregated instance metrics might not instantly reflect the
removal of a terminating instance. The terminating instance stops counting
toward the group's aggregated instance metrics shortly after the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
termination workflow begins.

- In most cases when lifecycle hooks are invoked, scaling activities due to
simple scaling policies are paused until the lifecycle actions have completed
and the cooldown period has expired. Setting a long interval for the cooldown
period means that it will take longer for scaling to resume. For more
information, see [Lifecycle hooks can cause additional delays](ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.md#cooldowns-lifecycle-hooks) in the cooldown topic. In
general, we recommend against using simple scaling policies if you can use
either step scaling or target tracking scaling policies instead.
