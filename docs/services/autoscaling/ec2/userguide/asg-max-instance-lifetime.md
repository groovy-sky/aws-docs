# Replace Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime

The maximum instance lifetime specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that
an instance can be in service before it is terminated and replaced. A common use case
might be a requirement to replace your instances on a schedule because of internal
security policies or external compliance controls.

You must specify a value of at least 86,400 seconds (one day). To clear a previously
set value, specify a new value of 0. This setting applies to all current and future
instances in your Auto Scaling group.

## Considerations

The following are considerations when using this feature:

- Whenever an earlier instance is replaced and a new instance launches, the
new instance uses the launch template or launch configuration that is
currently associated with the Auto Scaling group. If your launch template or launch
configuration specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of a different
version of your application, this version of your application will be
deployed automatically.

- Setting the maximum instance lifetime too low can cause instances to be
replaced faster than desired. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will usually replace instances one at
a time, with a pause between replacements. However, if the specified maximum
instance lifetime doesn't provide enough time to replace each instance
individually, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling must replace more than one instance at a time.
Several instances might be replaced at once, by up to 10 percent of the
current capacity of your Auto Scaling group. To avoid replacing too many instances
at once, either set a longer maximum instance lifetime or use instance
scale-in protection to temporarily prevent individual instances from being
terminated. For more information, see [Use instance scale-in protection to control instance termination](ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.md).

- By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates a new scaling activity for terminating the
instance and then terminates it. While the instance is terminating, another
scaling activity launches a new instance. You can change this behavior to
launch before terminating by using an instance maintenance policy. For more
information, see [Instance maintenance policies](ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.md).

## Set the maximum instance lifetime

When you create an Auto Scaling group in the console, you cannot set the maximum instance
lifetime. However, after the group is created, you can edit it to set the maximum
instance lifetime.

###### To set the maximum instance lifetime for a group (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. Select the check box next to the Auto Scaling group.

A split pane opens up at the bottom of the **Auto Scaling**
**groups** page, showing information about the group you
    selected.

3. On the **Details** tab, choose **Advanced**
**configurations**, **Edit**.

4. For **Maximum instance lifetime**, enter the maximum
    number of seconds that an instance can be in service.

5. Choose **Update**.

On the **Activity** tab, under **Activity**
**history**, you can view the replacement of instances in the group
throughout its history.

###### To set the maximum instance lifetime for a group (AWS CLI)

You can also use the AWS CLI to set the maximum instance lifetime for new or
existing Auto Scaling groups.

For new Auto Scaling groups, use the [create-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --cli-input-json file://~/config.json
```

The following is an example `config.json` file that shows a maximum
instance lifetime of `2592000` seconds (30 days).

```json

{
    "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
    "LaunchTemplate": {
        "LaunchTemplateName": "my-launch-template",
        "Version": "$Default"
    },
    "MinSize": 1,
    "MaxSize": 5,
    "MaxInstanceLifetime": 2592000,
    "VPCZoneIdentifier": "subnet-5ea0c127,subnet-6194ea3b,subnet-c934b782",
    "Tags": []
}
```

For existing Auto Scaling groups, use the [update-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-existing-asg --max-instance-lifetime 2592000
```

###### To verify the maximum instance lifetime for an Auto Scaling group

Use the [describe-auto-scaling-groups](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg
```

## Limitations

- **Maximum lifetime not guaranteed to be exact for**
**every instance**: Instances are not guaranteed to be replaced
only at the end of their maximum duration. In some situations, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
might need to start replacing instances immediately after you update the
maximum instance lifetime parameter. The reason for this behavior is to
avoid replacing all instances at the same time.

- **Instance scale-in protection honored**:
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provides instance scale-in protection to help you control which
instances it can terminate. When this protection is enabled on an instance,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will not terminate the instance even if it has reached its maximum
instance lifetime.

- **Instances terminated before launch**: When
there is only one instance in the Auto Scaling group, the maximum instance lifetime
feature can result in an outage because Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates an instance and
then launches a new instance by default. To change this behavior to launch
before terminating, see [Instance maintenance policies](ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.md).
