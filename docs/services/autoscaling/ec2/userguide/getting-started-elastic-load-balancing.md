# Prepare to attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer

Before you attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to your Auto Scaling group, you must complete the
following prerequisites:

- You must have already created the load balancer and target group that is used
to route traffic to your Auto Scaling group.

There are two ways to create the load balancer and target group:

- Using Elastic Load Balancing – Follow the
procedures in the Elastic Load Balancing documentation to create and configure the load
balancer and target group before creating the Auto Scaling group. Skip the step
for registering your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically takes care
of registering (and deregistering) instances when you attach a target
group to your Auto Scaling group. For more information, see [Getting started with Elastic Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/load-balancer-getting-started.html) in the
_Elastic Load Balancing User Guide_.

- Using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling – Create,
configure, and attach the load balancer and target group with a basic
configuration from the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling console. For more information, see [Configure an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer from the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-create-load-balancer-console.html).

- Before creating a load balancer, know the type of load balancer that you need.
For more information, see [Elastic Load Balancing types](autoscaling-load-balancer.md#integrations-aws-elastic-load-balancing-types).

- The load balancer and its target group must be in the same AWS account, VPC,
and Region as your Auto Scaling group.

- The target group must specify a target type of `instance`. You
can't specify a target type of `ip` when using an Auto Scaling group.

- If the launch template for your Auto Scaling group does not contain the correct
security group to allow the necessary inbound traffic from the load balancer,
you must update the launch template. The recommended rules depend on the type of
load balancer and the types of backends that the load balancer uses. For
example, to route traffic to web servers, allow inbound HTTP access on port 80
from the load balancer. Existing instances are not updated with the new settings
when the launch template is modified. To update existing instances, you can
start an instance refresh to replace the instances. For more information, see
[Use an instance refresh to update instances in an Auto Scaling group](asg-instance-refresh.md).

- The security groups in the launch template must also allow access from the
load balancer on the correct port for Elastic Load Balancing to perform its health checks.

- When deploying virtual appliances behind a Gateway Load Balancer, the Amazon Machine Image
(AMI) in the launch template must specify the ID of an AMI that supports the
GENEVE protocol to allow the Auto Scaling group to exchange traffic with a Gateway Load Balancer. Also,
the security groups in the launch template must allow UDP traffic on port
6081.

###### Tip

If you have bootstrapping scripts that take a while to complete, you can
optionally add a launch lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling group to delay instances from
registering behind the load balancer before your bootstrap scripts have completed
successfully and the applications on the instances are ready to accept traffic. You
can't add a lifecycle hook when you initially create an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
console. However, you can add a lifecycle hook after the group is created. For more
information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md).

## Configure health checks for targets

You can configure health checks for your targets registered with an Elastic Load Balancing load
balancer to ensure they are able to handle traffic properly. The specific steps vary
based on the type of load balancer you are using. For more information, see the
following resources:

- Application Load Balancer – See [Health checks for your\
target groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html) in the _User Guide for Application Load Balancers_.

- Network Load Balancer – See [Health checks for your target groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-health-checks.html) in the
_User Guide for Network Load Balancers_.

- Gateway Load Balancer – See [Health checks for your target groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/gateway/health-checks.html) in the _User_
_Guide for Gateway Load Balancers_.

- Classic Load Balancer – See [Configure health checks for your\
Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html) in the _User Guide for Classic Load Balancers_.

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not consider an instance unhealthy and replace it if it
fails the Elastic Load Balancing health checks. The default health checks for an Auto Scaling group are EC2
health checks only. For more information, see [Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.md).

To enable Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to replace instances that are reported unhealthy by Elastic Load Balancing, you
can configure your Auto Scaling group to use Elastic Load Balancing health checks. By doing so, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
considers the instance unhealthy if it fails either the EC2 health checks or the
Elastic Load Balancing health checks. If you attach multiple load balancer target groups or Classic Load Balancers to
the group, all of them must report that an instance is healthy in order for it to
consider the instance healthy. If any one of them reports an instance as unhealthy,
the Auto Scaling group replaces the instance, even if others report it as healthy.

For information about how to enable these health checks for your Auto Scaling group, see
[Attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-load-balancer-asg.html).

###### Note

To make sure that these health checks start as soon as possible, make sure
your group's health check grace period is not set too high, but high enough for
your Elastic Load Balancing health checks to determine whether a target is available to handle
requests. For more information, see [Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group](health-check-grace-period.md).
