# Use Capacity Blocks for machine learning workloads

Capacity Blocks help you reserve highly sought-after GPU instances
on a future date to support your short-duration, machine learning (ML)
workloads.

For an overview of Capacity Blocks and how they work, see [Capacity Blocks for ML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-blocks.html) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

To start using Capacity Blocks, you create a capacity reservation
in a specific Availability Zone. Capacity Blocks are delivered as
`targeted` capacity reservations in a single Availability Zone. When
you create your launch template, specify the Capacity Block's reservation ID and
instance type. Then, update your Auto Scaling group to use the launch template you created
and the Capacity Block's Availability Zone. When your Capacity Block reservation
begins, use scheduled scaling to launch the same number of instances as your
Capacity Block reservation.

###### Important

Capacity Blocks are only available for certain Amazon EC2 instance
types and AWS Regions. For more information, see [Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-blocks-using.html#capacity-blocks-prerequisites) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

## Operational guidelines

The following are basic operational guidelines that you should follow when
using a Capacity Block with an Auto Scaling group.

- Scale in your Auto Scaling group to zero more than 30 minutes before the
Capacity Block reservation end time. Amazon EC2 will terminate any instances
that are still running 30 minutes before the end time of the Capacity
Block.

- We recommend that you use scheduled scaling to scale out (add
instances) and scale in (remove instances) at the appropriate
reservation times. For more information, see [Scheduled scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.md).

- Add lifecycle hooks as needed to perform a graceful shutdown of your
application inside the instances when scaling in. Leave enough time for
the lifecycle action to complete _before_ Amazon EC2
starts forcibly terminating your instances 30 minutes before the
Capacity Block reservation end time. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md).

- Make sure that the Auto Scaling group points to the correct version of the
launch template for the entire duration of the reservation. We recommend
pointing to a specific version of the launch template instead of the
`$Default` or `$Latest` version.

###### Note

If you leave a Capacity Block instance running until the end of the
reservation and Amazon EC2 reclaims it, the scaling activities for your Auto Scaling
group state that it was " `taken out of service in
                                response to an EC2 health check that indicated it had been
                                terminated or stopped`", even though it was
purposely reclaimed at the end of the Capacity Block. Similarly, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
will attempt to replace the instance in the same manner as it does for any
instance that fails a health check. For more information, see [Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.md).

## Specify a Capacity Block in your launch template

To create a launch template that targets a specific Capacity Block for your
Auto Scaling group, use one of the following methods:

Console

###### To specify a Capacity Block in your launch template (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the top navigation bar, select the AWS Region where
    you created your Capacity Block.

3. On the navigation pane, under
    **Instances**, choose **Launch**
**Templates**.

4. Choose **Create launch template**, and
    create the launch template. Include the ID of the Amazon
    Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, and any other launch
    template settings as needed.

5. Expand the **Advanced details** section
    to view the advanced settings.

6. For **Purchasing option**, choose
    **Capacity Blocks**.

7. For **Capacity reservation**, choose
    **Target by ID**, and then for
    **Capacity reservation - Target by**
**ID**, choose the capacity reservation ID of an
    existing Capacity Block.

8. When you have finished, choose **Create launch**
**template**.

For help creating an Auto Scaling group with a launch template,
    see [Create an Auto Scaling group using a launch template](create-asg-launch-template.md).

AWS CLI

###### To specify a Capacity Block in your launch template (AWS CLI)

Use the following [create-launch-template](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/create-launch-template.html) command to create a launch
template that specifies an existing Capacity Block reservation
ID. Replace each `user input
                                        placeholder` with your own information.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 create-launch-template --launch-template-name my-template-for-capacity-block  \
  --version-description AutoScalingVersion1 --region us-east-2 \
  --launch-template-data file://config.json
```

###### Tip

If this command throws an error, make sure that you have
updated the AWS CLI locally to the latest version.

Contents of `config.json`.

```json

{
    "ImageId": "ami-04d5cc9b88example",
    "InstanceType": "p4d.24xlarge",
    "SecurityGroupIds": [
        "sg-903004f88example"
    ],
    "KeyName": "MyKeyPair",
    "InstanceMarketOptions": {
        "MarketType": "capacity-block"
    },
    "CapacityReservationSpecification": {
        "CapacityReservationTarget": {
            "CapacityReservationId": "cr-02168da1478b509e0"
        }
    }
}
```

The following is example output.

```json

{
    "LaunchTemplate": {
        "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-068f72b724example",
        "LaunchTemplateName": "my-template-for-capacity-block",
        "CreateTime": "2023-10-27T15:12:44.000Z",
        "CreatedBy": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob",
        "DefaultVersionNumber": 1,
        "LatestVersionNumber": 1
    }
}
```

You can use the following [describe-launch-template-versions](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/describe-launch-template-versions.html) command to verify the
Capacity Block reservation ID associated with the launch
template.

```nohighlight

aws ec2 describe-launch-template-versions --launch-template-names my-template-for-capacity-block \
  --region us-east-2
```

The following is example output for a launch template that
specifies a Capacity Block reservation.

```json

{
    "LaunchTemplateVersions": [
        {
            "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-068f72b724example",
            "LaunchTemplateName": "my-template-for-capacity-block",
            "VersionNumber": 1,
            "CreateTime": "2023-10-27T15:12:44.000Z",
            "CreatedBy": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob",
            "DefaultVersion": true,
            "LaunchTemplateData": {
                "ImageId": "ami-04d5cc9b88example",
                "InstanceType": "p5.48xlarge",
                "SecurityGroupIds": [
                    "sg-903004f88example"
                ],
                "KeyName": "MyKeyPair",
                "InstanceMarketOptions": {
                    "MarketType": "capacity-block"
                },
                "CapacityReservationSpecification": {
                    "CapacityReservationTarget": {
                        "CapacityReservationId": "cr-02168da1478b509e0"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Limitations

- Support for Capacity Blocks is only available if your
Auto Scaling group has a compatible configuration. Mixed instances groups and
warm pools are not supported.

- You can only target one Capacity Block at a time.
