# Manual scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

You can manually adjust the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group at any time.
This process of changing the instance count manually is referred to as _manual scaling_. Manual scaling is an alternative to auto
scaling, especially if you want to make one-time capacity changes.

After you manually scale your group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resumes normal auto scaling activities
based on the scaling policies and scheduled actions that you defined. For groups with
default instance warmup enabled, any new instances go through a warmup period before
they start contributing to the metrics used for auto scaling. This warmup period assists
in stabilizing the group at the new capacity. For more information, see [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.md).

Sometimes, you may want to temporarily disable scaling policies and scheduled actions
before manually scaling a group. Doing so prevents conflicts from arising between manual
scaling actions and automated scaling activities. For more information, see [Turn off scaling activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/CHAP_Troubleshooting.html#turn-off-scaling-activities).

## Change the desired capacity of an existing Auto Scaling group

When you change the desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling manages the
process of launching and terminating instances to reach the new desired size.

Console

###### To change the size of your Auto Scaling group

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group.

A split pane displays at the bottom of the page.

3. On the **Details** tab, choose
    **Group details**,
    **Edit**.

4. For **Desired capacity**, increase or
    decrease the desired capacity. For example, to increase the size
    of the group by one, if the current value is `1`,
    enter `2`.

If your new value for **Desired capacity** is
    greater than **Min desired capacity** and
    **Max desired capacity**, the **Max**
**desired capacity** is automatically increased to
    the new desired capacity value.

5. When you are finished, choose
    **Update**.

Verify that the group size that you specified resulted in the same
amount of instances being launched. For example, if you increased the
size of the group by one, verify that your Auto Scaling group has launched one
additional instance.

###### To verify that the size of your Auto Scaling group has changed

1. On the **Activity** tab, in
    **Activity history**, you can view the
    progress of activities that are associated with the Auto Scaling group.
    The **Status** column shows the current status
    of your instance. While your instance is launching, the status
    column shows `Not yet in service`. The status changes
    to `Successful` after the instance is launched. You
    can also use the refresh icon to see the current status of your
    instance. For more information, see [Verify a scaling activity for an Auto Scaling group](as-verify-scaling-activity.md).

2. On the **Instance management** tab, in
    **Instances**, you can view the status of
    the instance. It takes a short time for an instance to launch.

- The **Lifecycle** column shows the
state of your instance. Initially, your instance is in
the `Pending` state. After an instance is
ready to receive traffic, its state is
`InService`.

- The **Health status** column shows
the result of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling health checks on your
instance.

AWS CLI

The following example assumes that you've created an Auto Scaling group with a
minimum size of 1 and a maximum size of 5. Therefore, the group
currently has one running instance.

###### To change the size of your Auto Scaling group

Use the [set-desired-capacity](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/set-desired-capacity.html) command to change the size of your
Auto Scaling group, as shown in the following example.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --desired-capacity 2
```

If you choose to honor the default cooldown period for your Auto Scaling
group, you must specify the `–-honor-cooldown` option as
shown in the following example. For more information, see [Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.md).

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --desired-capacity 2 --honor-cooldown
```

###### To verify the size of your Auto Scaling group

Use the [describe-auto-scaling-groups](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html) command to confirm that
the size of your Auto Scaling group has changed, as in the following
example.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg
```

The following is example output, which provides details about the
group and instances launched.

    ]
}

Notice that `DesiredCapacity` shows the new value. Your
Auto Scaling group has launched an additional instance.

## Terminate an instance in your Auto Scaling group (AWS CLI)

There are times when you might want to manually scale in your Auto Scaling group but want
to terminate a specific instance. You can manually scale in your Auto Scaling group by using
the [terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group.html) command and specifying the ID
of the instance you want to terminate and the
`--should-decrement-desired-capacity` option as shown in the
following example.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group \
  --instance-id i-026e4c9f62c3e448c --should-decrement-desired-capacity
```

The following is example output, which provides details about the scaling
activity.

```json

{
    "Activities": [
        {
            "ActivityId": "b8d62b03-10d8-9df4-7377-e464ab6bd0cb",
            "AutoScalingGroupName": "my-asg",
            "Description": "Terminating EC2 instance: i-026e4c9f62c3e448c",
            "Cause": "At 2023-09-23T06:39:59Z instance i-026e4c9f62c3e448c was taken out of service in response to a user request, shrinking the capacity from 1 to 0.",
            "StartTime": "2023-09-23T06:39:59.015000+00:00",
            "StatusCode": "InProgress",
            "Progress": 0,
            "Details": "{\"Subnet ID\":\"subnet-6194ea3b\",\"Availability Zone\":\"us-west-2c\"}"
        }
    ]
}
```

This option is not available in the console. However, you can use the
**Instances** page of the Amazon EC2 console to terminate an
instance in your Auto Scaling group. When you do so, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects that the instance is
no longer running and replaces it automatically as part of the health check process.
It takes a minute or two after you terminate the instance before a new instance
launches. For information about how to terminate an instance, see [Terminate an\
instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/terminating-instances.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

If you terminate instances in your group and that causes uneven distribution
across Availability Zones, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling rebalances the group to re-establish an even
distribution unless you suspend the `AZRebalance` process. For more
information, see [Suspend and resume Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling processes](as-suspend-resume-processes.md).
