# Create a launch configuration

###### Important

Limitations:

- As of **January 1, 2023**, new Amazon EC2 instance types are no longer supported in launch configurations. This includes support for any instance types added to an AWS Region after the initial Region launch.

- Accounts created on or after **June 1, 2023** cannot create new launch configurations using the console.

- Accounts created on or after **October 1, 2024** cannot create new launch configurations using any method (console, API, AWS CLI, or CloudFormation).

Migrate to launch templates to make sure that you don’t need to create new launch configurations now or in the future.
For information about migrating your Auto Scaling groups to launch templates, see
[Migrate your Auto Scaling groups to launch templates](migrate-to-launch-templates.md).

###### Note

You might be able to create a launch configuration with an instance type that is no longer supported in a Region. We recommend that you migrate to launch templates.

This topic describes how to create a launch configuration. We provide information about launch configurations for customers who have not yet migrated from launch configurations to launch templates.

After you create a launch configuration, you cannot modify it. Instead, you must
create a new launch configuration.

To associate a new launch configuration with an existing Auto Scaling group, see [Change the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/change-launch-config.html). To create a
new Auto Scaling group, see [Create an Auto Scaling group using a launch configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-launch-configuration.html).

## Create a launch configuration

###### To create a launch configuration (console)

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

02. On the top navigation bar, select your AWS Region.

03. On the left navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**,
     choose **Auto Scaling Groups**.

04. Choose **Launch configurations** near the top of the
     page. When prompted for confirmation, choose **View launch**
    **configurations** to confirm that you want to view the
     **Launch configurations** page.

05. Choose **Create launch configuration**, and enter a name
     for your launch configuration.

06. For **Amazon machine image (AMI)**, choose an AMI. To
     find a specific AMI, you can [find a suitable AMI](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/finding-an-ami.md), make note of its ID, and enter the ID as
     search criteria.

    To get the ID of the Amazon Linux 2 AMI:
    1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

    2. On the left navigation pane, under **Instances**,
        choose **Instances**, and then choose
        **Launch instances**.

    3. On the **Quick Start** tab of the
        **Choose an Amazon Machine Image** page, note
        the ID of the AMI next to **Amazon Linux 2 AMI**
       **(HVM)**.
07. For **Instance type**, select a hardware configuration
     for your instances.

08. Under **Additional configuration**, pay attention to the
     following fields:
    1. (Optional) For **Purchasing option**, you can
        choose **Request Spot Instances** to request Spot
        Instances at the Spot price, capped at the On-Demand price.
        Optionally, you can specify a maximum price per instance hour for
        your Spot Instances.

       ###### Note

       Spot Instances are a cost-effective choice compared to
       On-Demand Instances, if you can be flexible about when your
       applications run and if your applications can be interrupted.
       For more information, see [Request Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-spot-instances.html).

    2. (Optional) For **IAM instance profile**, choose a
        role to associate with the instances. For more information, see
        [IAM role for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances](us-iam-role.md).

    3. (Optional) For **Monitoring**, choose whether to
        enable the instances to publish metric data at 1-minute intervals to
        Amazon CloudWatch by enabling detailed monitoring. Additional charges apply.
        For more information, see [Configure monitoring for Auto Scaling instances](enable-as-instance-metrics.md).

    4. (Optional) For **Advanced details**,
        **User data**, you can specify user data to
        configure an instance during launch, or to run a configuration
        script after the instance starts.

    5. (Optional) For **Advanced details**, **IP**
       **address type**, choose whether to assign a [public IP address](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-instance-addressing.md#public-ip-addresses) to the group's instances. If you do
        not set a value, the default is to use the auto-assign public IP
        settings of the subnets that your instances are launched
        into.
09. (Optional) For **Storage (volumes)**, if you don't need
     additional storage, you can skip this section. Otherwise, to specify volumes
     to attach to the instances in addition to the volumes specified by the AMI,
     choose **Add new volume**. Then choose the desired options
     and associated values for **Devices**,
     **Snapshot**, **Size**,
     **Volume type**, **IOPS**,
     **Throughput**, **Delete on**
    **termination**, and **Encrypted**.

10. For **Security groups**, create or select the security
     group to associate with the group's instances. If you leave the
     **Create a new security group** option selected, a
     default SSH rule is configured for Amazon EC2 instances running Linux. A default
     RDP rule is configured for Amazon EC2 instances running Windows.

11. For **Key pair (login)**, choose an option under
     **Key pair options**.

    If you've already configured an Amazon EC2 instance key pair, you can choose it
     here.

    If you don't already have an Amazon EC2 instance key pair, choose
     **Create a new key pair** and give it a recognizable
     name. Choose **Download key pair** to download the key pair
     to your computer.

    ###### Important

    If you need to connect to your instances, do not choose
    **Proceed without a key pair**.

12. Select the acknowledgment check box, and then choose **Create**
    **launch configuration**.

###### To create a launch configuration from an existing launch configuration (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the top navigation bar, select your AWS Region.

3. On the left navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**,
    choose **Auto Scaling Groups**.

4. Choose **Launch configurations** near the top of the
    page. When prompted for confirmation, choose **View launch**
**configurations** to confirm that you want to view the
    **Launch configurations** page.

5. Select the launch configuration and choose **Actions**,
    **Copy launch configuration**. This sets up a new
    launch configuration with the same options as the original, but with "Copy"
    added to the name.

6. On the **Copy Launch Configuration** page, edit the
    configuration options as needed and choose **Create launch**
**configuration**.

###### To create a launch configuration using the command line

You can use one of the following commands:

- [create-launch-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html) (AWS CLI)

- [New-ASLaunchConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-ASLaunchConfiguration.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

## Configure the instance metadata options

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports configuring the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) in launch
configurations. This gives you the option of using launch configurations to
configure the Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling groups to require Instance Metadata
Service Version 2 (IMDSv2), which is a session-oriented method for requesting
instance metadata. For details about IMDSv2's advantages, see this article on the
AWS Blog about [enhancements to add defense in depth to the EC2 instance metadata\
service](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service).

You can configure IMDS to support both IMDSv2 and IMDSv1 (the default), or to
require the use of IMDSv2. If you are using the AWS CLI or one of the SDKs to
configure IMDS, you must use the latest version of the AWS CLI or the SDK to require
the use of IMDSv2.

You can configure your launch configuration for the following:

- Require the use of IMDSv2 when requesting instance metadata

- Specify the `PUT` response hop limit

- Turn off access to instance metadata

You can find more details on configuring the Instance Metadata Service in the
following topic: [Configuring the\
instance metadata service](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Use the following procedure to configure IMDS options in a launch configuration.
After you create your launch configuration, you can associate it with your Auto Scaling
group. If you associate the launch configuration with an existing Auto Scaling group, the
existing launch configuration is disassociated from the Auto Scaling group, and existing
instances will require replacement to use the IMDS options that you specified in the
new launch configuration. For more information, see [Change the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/change-launch-config.html).

###### To configure IMDS in a launch configuration (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the top navigation bar, select your AWS Region.

3. On the left navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**,
    choose **Auto Scaling Groups**.

4. Choose **Launch configurations** near the top of the
    page. When prompted for confirmation, choose **View launch**
**configurations** to confirm that you want to view the
    **Launch configurations** page.

5. Choose **Create launch configuration**, and create the
    launch configuration the usual way. Include the ID of the Amazon Machine
    Image (AMI), the instance type, and optionally, a key pair, one or more
    security groups, and any additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes
    for your instances.

6. To configure instance metadata options for all of the instances associated
    with this launch configuration, in **Additional**
**configuration**, under **Advanced details**,
    do the following:
1. For **Metadata accessible**, choose whether to
       enable or disable access to the HTTP endpoint of the instance
       metadata service. By default, the HTTP endpoint is enabled. If you
       choose to disable the endpoint, access to your instance metadata is
       turned off. You can specify the condition to require IMDSv2 only
       when the HTTP endpoint is enabled.

2. For **Metadata version**, you can choose to
       require the use of Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) when
       requesting instance metadata. If you do not specify a value, the
       default is to support both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2.

3. For **Metadata token response hop limit**, you
       can set the allowable number of network hops for the metadata token.
       If you do not specify a value, the default is 1.
7. When you have finished, choose **Create launch**
**configuration**.

###### To require the use of IMDSv2 in a launch configuration using the AWS CLI

Use the following [create-launch-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html) command with
`--metadata-options` set to `HttpTokens=required`.
When you specify a value for `HttpTokens`, you must also set
`HttpEndpoint` to enabled. Because the secure token header is set
to required for metadata retrieval requests, this opts in the instance to
require using IMDSv2 when requesting instance metadata.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration \
  --launch-configuration-name my-lc-with-imdsv2 \
  --image-id ami-01e24be29428c15b2 \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
      ...
  --metadata-options "HttpEndpoint=enabled,HttpTokens=required"
```

###### To turn off access to instance metadata

Use the following [create-launch-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html) command to turn off access to instance
metadata. You can turn access back on later by using the [modify-instance-metadata-options](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration \
  --launch-configuration-name my-lc-with-imds-disabled \
  --image-id ami-01e24be29428c15b2 \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
      ...
  --metadata-options "HttpEndpoint=disabled"
```

## Create a launch configuration using an EC2 instance

You also have the option to create a launch configuration using the attributes
from a running EC2 instance.

There are differences between creating a launch configuration from scratch and
creating a launch configuration from an existing EC2 instance. When you create a
launch configuration from scratch, you specify the image ID, instance type, optional
resources (such as storage devices), and optional settings (like monitoring). When
you create a launch configuration from a running instance, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling derives
attributes for the launch configuration from the specified instance. Attributes are
also derived from the block device mapping for the AMI from which the instance was
launched, ignoring any additional block devices that were added after launch.

When you create a launch configuration using a running instance, you can override
the following attributes by specifying them as part of the same request: AMI, block
devices, key pair, instance profile, instance type, kernel, instance monitoring,
placement tenancy, ramdisk, security groups, Spot (max) price, user data, whether
the instance has a public IP address, and whether the instance is
EBS-optimized.

###### Note

If the specified instance has properties that are not currently supported by
launch configurations, the instances launched by the Auto Scaling group might not be
identical to the original EC2 instance.

###### Important

The AMI used to launch the specified instance must still exist.

### Create a launch configuration from an EC2 instance (AWS CLI)

Use the following [create-launch-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html) command to create a launch
configuration from an instance using the same attributes as the instance. Any
block devices added after launch are ignored.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name my-lc-from-instance --instance-id i-a8e09d9c
```

You can use the following [describe-launch-configurations](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-launch-configurations.html) command to describe the launch
configuration and verify that its attributes match those of the instance.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations --launch-configuration-names my-lc-from-instance
```

The following is an example response.

```json

{
    "LaunchConfigurations": [
        {
            "UserData": null,
            "EbsOptimized": false,
            "LaunchConfigurationARN": "arn",
            "InstanceMonitoring": {
                "Enabled": false
            },
            "ImageId": "ami-05355a6c",
            "CreatedTime": "2014-12-29T16:14:50.382Z",
            "BlockDeviceMappings": [],
            "KeyName": "my-key-pair",
            "SecurityGroups": [
                "sg-8422d1eb"
            ],
            "LaunchConfigurationName": "my-lc-from-instance",
            "KernelId": "null",
            "RamdiskId": null,
            "InstanceType": "t1.micro",
            "AssociatePublicIpAddress": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Create a launch configuration from an instance and override the block devices (AWS CLI)

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the attributes from the EC2 instance that you
specify to create the launch configuration. However, the block devices come from
the AMI used to launch the instance, not the instance. To add block devices to
the launch configuration, override the block device mapping for the launch
configuration.

Use the following [create-launch-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html) command to create a launch
configuration using an EC2 instance but with a custom block device
mapping.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name my-lc-from-instance-bdm --instance-id i-a8e09d9c \
  --block-device-mappings "[{\"DeviceName\":\"/dev/sda1\",\"Ebs\":{\"SnapshotId\":\"snap-3decf207\"}},{\"DeviceName\":\"/dev/sdf\",\"Ebs\":{\"SnapshotId\":\"snap-eed6ac86\"}}]"
```

Use the following [describe-launch-configurations](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-launch-configurations.html) command to describe the launch
configuration and verify that it uses your custom block device mapping.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations --launch-configuration-names my-lc-from-instance-bdm
```

The following example response describes the launch configuration.

```json

{
    "LaunchConfigurations": [
        {
            "UserData": null,
            "EbsOptimized": false,
            "LaunchConfigurationARN": "arn",
            "InstanceMonitoring": {
                "Enabled": false
            },
            "ImageId": "ami-c49c0dac",
            "CreatedTime": "2015-01-07T14:51:26.065Z",
            "BlockDeviceMappings": [
                {
                    "DeviceName": "/dev/sda1",

                        "SnapshotId": "snap-3decf207"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "DeviceName": "/dev/sdf",
                    "Ebs": {
                        "SnapshotId": "snap-eed6ac86"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "KeyName": "my-key-pair",
            "SecurityGroups": [
                "sg-8637d3e3"
            ],
            "LaunchConfigurationName": "my-lc-from-instance-bdm",
            "KernelId": null,
            "RamdiskId": null,
            "InstanceType": "t1.micro",
            "AssociatePublicIpAddress": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Create a launch configuration and override the instance type (AWS CLI)

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the attributes from the EC2 instance you specify to
create the launch configuration. Depending on your requirements, you might want
to override attributes from the instance and use the values that you need. For
example, you can override the instance type.

Use the following [create-launch-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html) command to create a launch
configuration using an EC2 instance but with a different instance type (for
example `t2.medium`) than the instance (for example
`t2.micro`).

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name my-lc-from-instance-changetype \
  --instance-id i-a8e09d9c --instance-type t2.medium
```

Use the following [describe-launch-configurations](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-launch-configurations.html) command to describe the launch
configuration and verify that the instance type was overridden.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-launch-configurations --launch-configuration-names my-lc-from-instance-changetype
```

The following example response describes the launch configuration.

```json

{
    "LaunchConfigurations": [
        {
            "UserData": null,
            "EbsOptimized": false,
            "LaunchConfigurationARN": "arn",
            "InstanceMonitoring": {
                "Enabled": false
            },
            "ImageId": "ami-05355a6c",
            "CreatedTime": "2014-12-29T16:14:50.382Z",
            "BlockDeviceMappings": [],
            "KeyName": "my-key-pair",
            "SecurityGroups": [
                "sg-8422d1eb"
            ],
            "LaunchConfigurationName": "my-lc-from-instance-changetype",
            "KernelId": "null",
            "RamdiskId": null,
            "InstanceType": "t2.medium",
            "AssociatePublicIpAddress": true
        }
    ]
}
