# Set scaling limits for your Auto Scaling group

Scaling limits represent the minimum and maximum group size that you want for your
Auto Scaling group. You set limits separately for the minimum and maximum size.

The group's desired capacity can be resized to a number that's within the range of
your minimum and maximum size limits. The desired capacity must be equal to or greater
than the minimum group size, and equal to or less than the maximum group size.

- **Desired capacity**: Represents the initial capacity of the
Auto Scaling group at the time of creation. An Auto Scaling group attempts to maintain the
desired capacity. It starts by launching the number of instances that are
specified for the desired capacity, and maintains this number of instances as
long as there are no scaling policies or scheduled actions attached to the Auto Scaling
group.

- **Minimum capacity**: Represents the minimum group size. When
scaling policies are set, they cannot decrease the group's desired capacity
lower than the minimum capacity.

- **Maximum capacity**: Represents the maximum group size. When
scaling policies are set, they cannot increase the group's desired capacity
higher than the maximum capacity.

The minimum and maximum size limits also apply in the following scenarios:

- When you manually scale your Auto Scaling group by updating its desired
capacity.

- When scheduled actions run that update the desired capacity. If a scheduled
action runs without specifying new minimum and maximum size limits for the
group, then the group's current minimum and maximum size limits apply.

An Auto Scaling group always tries to maintain its desired capacity. In cases where an
instance terminates unexpectedly (for example, because of a Spot Instance interruption,
a health check failure, or human action), the group automatically launches a new
instance to maintain its desired capacity.

###### To manage these settings in the console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**, choose
    **Auto Scaling Groups**.

3. On the **Auto Scaling groups** page, select the check box next to
    your Auto Scaling group.

A split pane opens up in the bottom of the page.

4. In the lower pane, in the **Details** tab, view or change the
    current settings for the group's desired, minimum, and maximum capacity. For
    more information, see [Change the desired capacity of an existing Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-manually.html#change-desired-capacity).

Above the **Details** pane, you can find information such as the
current number of instances in the Auto Scaling group, the desired, minimum, and maximum
capacity, and a status column. If the Auto Scaling group uses instance weights, you can also
find the number of capacity units contributed to the desired capacity.

To add or remove columns from the list, choose the settings icon at the top of the
page. Then, for **Auto Scaling groups attributes**, turn each column on
or off, and choose **Confirm**.

###### To verify the size of your Auto Scaling group after making changes

The **Instances** column shows the number of instances that are
currently running. While an instance is being launched or terminated, the
**Status** column displays a status of _Updating_
_capacity_, as shown in the following image.

![Updating the capacity of an Auto Scaling group.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/asg-console-updating-capacity.png)

Wait for a few minutes, and then refresh the view to see the latest status. After a
scaling activity completes, the **Instances** column shows an updated
value.

You can view the number of instances and the status of the currently running instances
from the **Instance management** tab, under
**Instances**.
