# Design your applications to gracefully handle instance termination

This topic describes features that you can use to prevent your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group from terminating
Amazon EC2 instances that aren't yet ready to terminate. By default, Auto Scaling has no visibility into the
applications running on your instances. It can terminate instances before your application is able
to gracefully shut down or complete its assigned jobs. These features give your application
time to complete in-progress work, transfer state, or perform cleanup before instance terminations.
You can use them individually or in combination depending on your application's requirements.

These features are particularly useful for stateful workloads, where each instance in
your fleet holds different data, jobs, or state than other instances. Terminating stateful
instances without graceful shutdown could result in long-running jobs restarting from the
beginning, reduced data redundancy or data loss, and interrupted in-progress transactions
or computations. To gracefully shut down a stateful instance, its workload should be
either drained (completing all currently assigned jobs) or transferred (moving jobs, data,
or configuration to another active instance).

## Termination lifecycle hooks

A termination lifecycle hook extends the life of your Amazon EC2 instance that's already
selected for termination. It provides extra time to complete in-progress work
currently assigned to the instance, or to save progress and transfer the work to
another instance.

For many workloads, a termination lifecycle hook may be enough to gracefully shut down an
application on an instance that's selected for termination. This is a best-effort approach
and can't be used to prevent termination if a termination lifecycle action is abandoned.
If your workload has a low tolerance for termination lifecycle action failures, configure
[instance lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/instance-lifecycle-policy.html) in combination with your termination lifecycle hooks to
retain instances.

To use a termination lifecycle hook, you need to know when an instance is selected for
termination. You have two ways to know this:

OptionDescriptionBest used forLink to documentationInside the instance
The Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is a secure endpoint that you can
poll for the status of an instance directly from the instance. If the
metadata comes back with `Terminated`, then your instance is
scheduled to be terminated.

Applications where you must perform an action on the instance before
the instance is terminated.
[Retrieve the target lifecycle state](retrieving-target-lifecycle-state-through-imds.md)Outside the instance
When an instance is terminating, an event notification is generated.
You can create rules using Amazon EventBridge, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, or AWS Lambda to
capture these events, and invoke a response such as with a Lambda
function.

Applications that need to take action outside of the instance.
[Configure a notification target](prepare-for-lifecycle-notifications.md#lifecycle-hook-notification-target)

To use a lifecycle hook, you also need to know when your instance is ready to be fully
terminated. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will not terminate the instance until it receives a
[CompleteLifecycleAction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_CompleteLifecycleAction.html) API call or the timeout elapses, whichever happens first.

By default, an instance can continue running for one hour (heartbeat timeout) due to a
termination lifecycle hook. You can configure the default timeout if one hour is not
enough time to complete the lifecycle action. When a lifecycle action is in progress,
you can extend the timeout with
[RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat.html) API calls.

For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md).

## Instance scale-in protection

You can use instance scale-in protection to control which instances are selected for
termination during scale-in events, especially to prevent an instance that is actively
processing a long-running job from being terminated. For example, when running
containerized workloads, it's common to want to protect all instances and remove
protection only for instances with no current or scheduled tasks. Instances can continue
polling for new jobs and re-enable protection when there are new jobs assigned.

You can enable scale-in protection at the Auto Scaling group level and instance level. When you
enable scale-in protection at the Auto Scaling group level, only new instances are protected when
they're created. For existing instances, you can enable protection individually.

Applications can set protection either from the instances themselves, or from a
centralized control plane that manages whether each instance is terminable. We
recommend the centralized approach for large fleets or when protection needs to be
toggled frequently, as it allows you to batch calls to
[SetInstanceProtection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_SetInstanceProtection.html) and avoid API throttling issues.

For more information, see
[Use instance scale-in protection to control instance termination](ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.md).

## Custom termination policy

Like instance scale-in protection, a custom termination policy helps you prevent your
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group from terminating specific EC2 instances. Unhealthy instances can still be
terminated regardless of your custom termination policy.

Your Auto Scaling group uses a default termination policy to determine which Amazon EC2
instances it terminates first. If you want more control over which instances
terminate first, you can implement a custom termination policy using a Lambda
function. Auto Scaling calls this function whenever it needs to select an instance
for termination, and will only terminate instances that the function returns.
If the function errors, times out, or returns an empty list, Auto Scaling doesn't
terminate any instances unless the instance is unhealthy.

A custom termination policy is useful when your application can identify which
instances are idle or safe to terminate. This typically requires a control plane that
tracks workload across the group.

For more information, see
[Create a custom termination policy with Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lambda-custom-termination-policy.html).

## Instance lifecycle policy

Instance lifecycle policies provide protection against Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminations when a termination
lifecycle action is abandoned. Unlike lifecycle hooks alone, instance lifecycle policies are
designed to ensure that instances move to a retained state when graceful shutdown procedures
don't complete successfully.

When Auto Scaling selects an instance for termination, your configured termination
lifecycle hooks are invoked and your application begins graceful shutdown procedures.
If the termination lifecycle actions complete successfully with `CONTINUE`,
the instance terminates normally. However, if a termination lifecycle action is
abandoned for any reason, the instance lifecycle policy moves the instance to a
retained state rather than terminating it. Retained instances don't count
toward your Auto Scaling group's desired capacity, so replacement instances are launched
automatically. You will incur standard Amazon EC2 charges for both the retained instance
and its replacement until you manually terminate the retained instance using the
[TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup.html) API.

To use this feature, you must configure both an instance lifecycle policy with the
`TerminateHookAbandon` retention trigger set to `retain`, as well
as at least one termination lifecycle hook. Because retained instances incur ongoing Amazon EC2
costs and require manual action, monitoring is critical. You should enable CloudWatch metrics like
`GroupTerminatingRetainedInstances` and create CloudWatch alarms to alert you when
instances enter retained states.

For more information, see
[Control instance retention with instance lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/instance-lifecycle-policy.html).

## Suspend terminations altogether

If you require complete control over all EC2 instance terminations within your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
group, suspend the `Terminate` process. We only recommend using this option
if the above options do not offer you the control you need for your service. By calling
[SuspendProcesses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_SuspendProcesses.html) to suspend the `Terminate` process, you prevent Auto Scaling from
attempting terminations for any reason, except those initiated by a user request to the
[TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup.html) API.

For more information, see
[Suspend and resume Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling processes](as-suspend-resume-processes.md).

## Limitations

###### Important

When designing your application on Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to gracefully handle instance terminations,
keep the following limitations in mind.

### Unhealthy instances bypass some protections

If an instance is unhealthy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will start terminating it even if you have
custom termination policies or scale-in protection in place. The only way to
prevent replacement of unhealthy instances by Auto Scaling is to suspend the
`HealthCheck`, `ReplaceUnhealthy`, or `Terminate`
process. You can use lifecycle hooks and an instance lifecycle policy to allow the
application to shut down gracefully or copy any data that you need to recover
before the unhealthy instance is terminated.

### Lifecycle hooks alone do not guarantee graceful shutdown

By default, termination lifecycle hooks operate on a best-effort basis. If a
termination lifecycle action is abandoned, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling proceeds with terminating
the instance immediately. You can combine termination lifecycle hooks with an
instance lifecycle policy to retain instances when termination lifecycle actions
are abandoned. With this combination:

- Your termination lifecycle hooks attempt to gracefully shut down your
application after Auto Scaling triggers an instance termination and the draining
from any configured Elastic Load Balancing load balancers complete.

- If a termination lifecycle action is abandoned for any reason, the instance
moves to a retained state instead of being terminated.

- The retained instance stays in its current Amazon EC2 state, allowing you to manually
complete your shutdown procedures or investigate the failure.

- You can manually terminate retained instances by calling the
[TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup.html) API after completing the necessary actions.

For more information, see
[Control instance retention with instance lifecycle policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/instance-lifecycle-policy.html).

### Certain instance market options can be interrupted with limited notice

If you use instance market options such as Spot Instances and interruptible
capacity reservations in your Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 can interrupt and reclaim your
instances at any time. These interruptions bypass all Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling protection
mechanisms, including:

- Termination lifecycle hooks

- Instance scale-in protection

- Custom termination policies

- Instance lifecycle policies

- Suspended processes

When a Spot Instance receives an interruption notice, you have approximately two
minutes to perform graceful shutdown tasks. While you can use termination lifecycle
hooks to respond to Spot Instance interruptions, the instance will be forcibly
terminated at the end of the two-minute window, even if the lifecycle hook is still
in progress. Instance lifecycle policies also can't prevent Spot Instance interruptions.

For more information about handling Spot Instance interruptions, see
[Spot Instance interruptions](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/spot-interruptions.md) and
[Best practices for Amazon EC2 Spot](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/spot-best-practices.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

### Direct Amazon EC2 terminations bypass all protections

If you terminate an instance in your Auto Scaling group with the Amazon EC2
[TerminateInstances](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference/api-terminateinstances.md) API directly, the termination bypasses all
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling protection mechanisms.

To terminate instances in your Auto Scaling group while respecting your configured
protections, use the
[TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup.html) API instead.

## Example scenarios

When you use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can choose how much fleet management Auto Scaling handles on
your behalf versus how much direct control you retain over EC2 instance termination
decisions. The more sensitive your workload is to instance terminations, the
more control you may want to retain. The following examples describe workloads with
different tolerance levels and the recommended configurations:

### Example 1: Distributed database nodes (Low tolerance)

You run a distributed database where each EC2 instance holds a partition of your
data with a replication factor of 3. Losing multiple instances that hold replicas
of the same partition could cause data loss or make that partition unavailable.

**Challenge:** Auto Scaling might terminate instances
faster than data can be re-replicated to other nodes, and terminations might
reduce your capacity below what's needed to maintain your replication factor.

Consider the following configurations:

- Enable [instance scale-in protection](ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.md) on all database instances; remove it
programmatically only after confirming data is safely replicated elsewhere.

- Configure [termination lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md) with extended timeouts in combination
with an instance lifecycle policy to allow data transfer to complete.

- Set an [instance maintenance policy](ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.md) with a minimum healthy percentage of 100% to maintain your
required capacity.

### Example 2: Long-running job processing (Medium tolerance)

You have an Amazon SQS queue that collects incoming messages for long-running jobs. When
a new message arrives, an EC2 instance retrieves the message and starts a job that
takes 3 hours to process. As the queue grows, Auto Scaling adds instances based on your
scaling policies. As the queue shrinks, Auto Scaling terminates instances.

**Challenge:** Auto Scaling might terminate an instance
that is 3 hours into processing a job rather than an idle instance. The job can be
restarted on another instance, but you lose significant progress.

Consider the following configurations:

- Configure a [custom termination policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lambda-custom-termination-policy.html) that prioritizes terminating idle instances first.

- Use [termination lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md) to allow in-progress jobs to complete.

- Enable [instance scale-in protection](ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.md) programmatically when an instance starts a job, and remove it
when the job completes.

### Example 3: Worker fleet for test environments (High tolerance)

You run a fleet of EC2 instances that execute automated tests, CI/CD pipeline jobs,
or development workloads. These worker instances pull tasks from a queue, and test
results can be regenerated if a job fails.

**Challenge:** Test jobs may be interrupted during
scale-in events, but since tests can be retried without impact, you want to
optimize for cost and simplicity rather than zero-interruption availability.

Consider the following configurations:

- Use [termination lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md) to allow in-flight requests to complete.

- Consider using [Spot Instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-spot-instances.md) with capacity-optimized allocation strategy to further
reduce costs.
