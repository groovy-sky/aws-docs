# Auto Scaling launch templates

A launch template is similar to a [launch\
configuration](launch-configurations.md), in that it specifies instance configuration information. It
includes the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security
groups, and other parameters used to launch EC2 instances. However, defining a launch
template instead of a launch configuration allows you to have multiple versions of a launch
template.

With versioning of launch templates, you can create a subset of the full set of
parameters. Then, you can reuse it to create other versions of the same launch template. For
example, you can create a launch template that defines a base configuration without an AMI
or user data script. After you create your launch template, you can create a new version and
add the AMI and user data that has the latest version of your application for testing. This
results in two versions of the launch template. Storing a base configuration helps you to
maintain the required general configuration parameters. You can create a new version of your
launch template from the base configuration whenever you want. You can also delete the
versions used for testing your application when you no longer need them.

We recommend that you use launch templates to ensure that you're accessing the latest
features and improvements. Not all Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features are available when you use launch
configurations. For example, you cannot create an Auto Scaling group that launches both Spot and
On-Demand Instances or that specifies multiple instance types. You must use a launch
template to configure these features. For more information, see [Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options](ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.md).

With launch templates, you can also use newer features of Amazon EC2. This includes Systems Manager
parameters (AMI ID), the current generation of EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes (io2), EBS
volume tagging, T2 Unlimited instances, Capacity Reservations, Capacity
Blocks, and Dedicated Hosts, to name a few.

When you create a launch template, all parameters are optional. However, if a launch
template does not specify an AMI, you cannot add the AMI when you create your Auto Scaling group. If
you specify an AMI but no instance type, you can add one or more instance types when you
create your Auto Scaling group.

## Permissions to work with launch templates

The procedures in this section assume that you already have the required permissions
to create launch templates. For information about how an administrator grants you
permissions, see [Control access\
to launch templates with IAM permissions](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/permissions-for-launch-templates.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Note that if you do not have sufficient permissions to use and create resources
specified in a launch template, you receive an error that you're not authorized to use
the launch template when you try to specify it for an Auto Scaling group. For more information,
see [Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ts-as-launch-template.html).

For examples of IAM policies that let you call the
`CreateAutoScalingGroup`, `UpdateAutoScalingGroup`, and
`RunInstances` API operations with a launch template, see [Control Amazon EC2 launch template usage in Auto Scaling groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-launch-template-permissions.html).

## API operations supported by launch templates

For a list of API operations supported by launch templates, see [Amazon EC2 actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/OperationList-query-ec2.html) in the _[Amazon EC2 API Reference](../../../../reference/awsec2/latest/apireference.md)_.
