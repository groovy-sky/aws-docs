# Step and simple scaling policies for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

Step scaling and simple scaling policies scale the capacity of your Auto Scaling group in
predefined increments based on CloudWatch alarms. You can define separate scaling policies
to handle scaling out (increasing capacity) and scaling in (decreasing capacity)
when an alarm threshold is breached.

Auto Scaling group capacity is measured in terms of instances or capacity
units if you are using [instance weights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-instance-weighting.html). Also, there is a difference between
desired capacity and current capacity.

- Desired capacity – The number of instances (or capacity units) that you want to have in your group. Desired capacity can be adjusted manually or automatically using scaling policies.

- Current capacity – The number of instances (or capacity units) in
your group that have passed their warmup and cooldown periods and are running
and ready to be used.

With step scaling and simple scaling, you create and manage the CloudWatch alarms that
invoke the scaling process. When an alarm is breached, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling initiates the
scaling policy associated with that alarm.

We strongly recommend that you use target tracking scaling policies to scale on
metrics like average CPU utilization or average request count per target. Metrics
that decrease when capacity increases and increase when capacity decreases can be
used to proportionally scale out or in the number of instances using target
tracking. This helps ensure that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling follows the demand curve for your
applications closely. For more information, see [Target tracking scaling\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-target-tracking.html).

## How step scaling policies work

To use step scaling, you first create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors a metric for
your Auto Scaling group. Define the metric, threshold value, and number of evaluation
periods that determine an alarm breach. Then, create a step scaling policy that
defines how to scale your group when the alarm threshold is breached. You can use a
percentage of the current capacity of your Auto Scaling group or capacity units for the
scaling adjustment type. For more information, see [Scaling adjustment types](#as-scaling-adjustment).

Add the step adjustments in the policy. You can define different step
adjustments based on the breach size of the alarm. For example:

- Scale out by 10 instances if the alarm metric reaches 60
percent

- Scale out by 30 instances if the alarm metric reaches 75
percent

- Scale out by 40 instances if the alarm metric reaches 85
percent

When the alarm threshold is breached for the specified number of evaluation
periods, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will apply the step adjustments defined in the policy. The
adjustments can continue for additional alarm breaches until the alarm state
returns to `OK`.

Each instance has a warmup period to prevent scaling activities from being too
reactive to changes that occur over short periods of time. You can optionally
configure the warmup period for your scaling policy. However, we recommend using
the default instance warmup to make it easier to update all scaling policies
when the warmup time changes. For more information, see [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.md).

Simple scaling policies are similar to step scaling policies, except they're
based on a single scaling adjustment, with a cooldown period between each
scaling activity. For more information, see [Simple scaling policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/simple-scaling-policies.html).

## Step adjustments for step scaling

When you create a step scaling policy, you specify one or more step
adjustments that automatically scale the number of instances dynamically based
on the size of the alarm breach. Each step adjustment specifies the following:

- A lower bound for the metric value

- An upper bound for the metric value

- The amount by which to scale, based on the scaling adjustment type

CloudWatch aggregates metric data points based on the statistic for the metric
that's associated with your CloudWatch alarm. When the alarm is breached, the
appropriate scaling policy is invoked. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling applies the aggregation type to
the most recent metric data points from CloudWatch (as opposed to the raw metric
data). It compares this aggregated metric value against the upper and lower
bounds defined by the step adjustments to determine which step adjustment to
perform.

You specify the upper and lower bounds relative to the breach threshold. For
example, let's say you made a CloudWatch alarm and a scale-out policy for when the
metric is above 50 percent. You then made a second alarm and a scale-in policy
for when the metric is below 50 percent. You made a set of step adjustments with
an adjustment type of `PercentChangeInCapacity` (or **Percent**
**of group** in the console) for each policy:

Example: Step adjustments for scale-out policy**Lower bound****Upper bound****Adjustment**

0

10

0

10

20

10

30

Example: Step adjustments for scale-in policy**Lower bound****Upper bound****Adjustment**

-10

0

0

-20

-10

-10

null

-20

-30

This creates the following scaling configuration.

```nohighlight

Metric value

-infinity          30%    40%          60%     70%             infinity
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
          -30%      | -10% | Unchanged  | +10%  |       +30%
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Now, let's say that you use this scaling configuration on an Auto Scaling group that
has both a current capacity and a desired capacity of 10. The following points
summarize the behavior of the scaling configuration in relation to the desired
and current capacity of the group:

- The desired and current capacity is maintained while the aggregated
metric value is greater than 40 and less than 60.

- If the metric value gets to 60, the desired capacity of the group
increases by 1 instance, to 11 instances, based on the second step
adjustment of the scale-out policy (add 10 percent of 10 instances).
After the new instance is running and its specified warmup time has
expired, the current capacity of the group increases to 11 instances. If
the metric value rises to 70 even after this increase in capacity, the
desired capacity of the group increases by another 3 instances, to 14
instances. This is based on the third step adjustment of the scale-out
policy (add 30 percent of 11 instances, 3.3 instances, rounded down to 3
instances).

- If the metric value gets to 40, the desired capacity of the group
decreases by 1 instance, to 13 instances, based on the second step
adjustment of the scale-in policy (remove 10 percent of 14 instances,
1.4 instances, rounded down to 1 instance). If the metric value falls to
30 even after this decrease in capacity, the desired capacity of the
group decreases by another 3 instances, to 10 instances. This is based
on the third step adjustment of the scale-in policy (remove 30 percent
of 13 instances, 3.9 instances, rounded down to 3 instances).

When you specify the step adjustments for your scaling policy, note the
following:

- If you use the AWS Management Console, you specify the upper and lower bounds as
absolute values. If you use the AWS CLI or an SDK, you specify the upper
and lower bounds relative to the breach threshold.

- The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a
gap.

- Only one step adjustment can have a null lower bound (negative
infinity). If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there
must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

- Only one step adjustment can have a null upper bound (positive
infinity). If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there
must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

- The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step
adjustment.

- If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is
inclusive and the upper bound is exclusive. If the metric value is below
the breach threshold, the lower bound is exclusive and the upper bound
is inclusive.

## Scaling adjustment types

You can define a scaling policy that performs the optimal scaling action,
based on the scaling adjustment type that you choose. You can specify the
adjustment type as a percentage of the current capacity of your Auto Scaling group, or
in capacity units. Normally a capacity unit means one instance, unless you are
using the instance weights feature.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports the following adjustment types for step scaling and simple
scaling:

- `ChangeInCapacity` — Increment or decrement the
current capacity of the group by the specified value. A positive value
increases the capacity and a negative adjustment value decreases the
capacity. For example: If the current capacity of the group is 3 and the
adjustment is 5, then when this policy is performed, we add 5 capacity
units to the capacity for a total of 8 capacity units.

- `ExactCapacity` — Change the current capacity of the
group to the specified value. Specify a non-negative value with this
adjustment type. For example: If the current capacity of the group is 3
and the adjustment is 5, then when this policy is performed, we change
the capacity to 5 capacity units.

- `PercentChangeInCapacity` — Increment or decrement
the current capacity of the group by the specified percentage. A
positive value increases the capacity and a negative value decreases the
capacity. For example: If the current capacity is 10 and the adjustment
is 10 percent, then when this policy is performed, we add 1 capacity
unit to the capacity for a total of 11 capacity units.

###### Note

If the resulting value is not an integer, it is rounded as
follows:

- Values greater than 1 are rounded down. For example,
`12.7` is rounded to `12`.

- Values between 0 and 1 are rounded to 1. For example,
`.67` is rounded to `1`.

- Values between 0 and -1 are rounded to -1. For example,
`-.58` is rounded to `-1`.

- Values less than -1 are rounded up. For example,
`-6.67` is rounded to `-6`.

Show moreShow less

With `PercentChangeInCapacity`, you can also specify
the minimum number of instances to scale using the
`MinAdjustmentMagnitude` parameter. For
example, suppose that you create a policy that adds 25 percent and you specify a
minimum increment of 2 instances. If you have an Auto Scaling group with 4 instances and
the scaling policy is executed, 25 percent of 4 is 1 instance. However, because
you specified a minimum increment of 2, there are 2 instances added.

When you use [instance weights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups-instance-weighting.html), the effect of setting the
`MinAdjustmentMagnitude` parameter to a non-zero value changes.
The value is in capacity units. To set the minimum number of instances to scale,
set this parameter to a value that is at least as large as your largest instance
weight.

If you use instance weights, keep in mind that the current capacity of your
Auto Scaling group can exceed the desired capacity as needed. If your absolute number to
decrement, or the amount that the percentage says to decrement, is less than the
difference between current and desired capacity, no scaling action is taken. You
must take these behaviors into account when you look at the outcome of a scaling
policy when a threshold alarm is in breach. For example, suppose that the
desired capacity is 30 and the current capacity is 32. When the alarm is in
breach, if the scaling policy decrements the desired capacity by 1, then no
scaling action is taken.

## Instance warmup

For step scaling, you can optionally specify the number of seconds that it
takes for a newly launched instance to warm up. Until its specified warmup time
has expired, an instance is not counted toward the aggregated EC2 instance
metrics of the Auto Scaling group.

While instances are in the warmup period, your scaling policies only scale out
if the metric value from instances that are not warming up is greater than the
policy's alarm high threshold.

If the group scales out again, the instances that are still warming up are
counted as part of the desired capacity for the next scale-out activity.
Therefore, multiple alarm breaches that fall in the range of the same step
adjustment result in a single scaling activity. The intention is to continuously
(but not excessively) scale out.

For example, let's say that you create a policy with two steps. The first step
adds 10 percent when the metric gets to 60, and the second step adds 30 percent
when the metric gets to 70 percent. Your Auto Scaling group has a desired and current
capacity of 10. The desired and current capacity do not change while the
aggregated metric value is less than 60. Suppose that the metric gets to 60, so
1 instance is added (10 percent of 10 instances). Then, the metric gets to 62
while the new instance is still warming up. The scaling policy calculates the
new desired capacity based on the current capacity, which is still 10. However,
the desired capacity of the group has already increased to 11 instances, so the
scaling policy does not increase the desired capacity further. If the metric
gets to 70 while the new instance is still warming up, we should add 3 instances
(30 percent of 10 instances). However, the desired capacity of the group is
already 11, so we add only 2 instances, for a new desired capacity of 13
instances.

While the scale-out activity is in progress, all scale-in activities initiated
by scaling policies are blocked until the instances finish warming up. When the
instances finish warming up, if a scale-in event occurs, any instances currently
in the process of terminating will be counted towards the current capacity of
the group when calculating the new desired capacity. Therefore, we don't remove
more instances from the Auto Scaling group than necessary. For example, while an
instance is already terminating, if an alarm is in breach in the range of the
same step adjustment that decremented the desired capacity by 1, then no scaling
action is taken.

###### Default value

If no value is set, then the scaling policy will use the default value,
which is the value for the [default instance\
warmup](ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.md) defined for the group. If the default instance warmup is
null, then it falls back to the value of the [default cooldown](ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.md#set-default-cooldown).

## Considerations

The following considerations apply when working with step and simple scaling
policies:

- Consider whether you can predict the step adjustments on the
application accurately enough to use step scaling. If your scaling
metric increases or decreases proportionally to the capacity of the
scalable target, we recommend that you use a target tracking scaling
policy instead. You still have the option to use step scaling as an
additional policy for a more advanced configuration. For example, you
can configure a more aggressive response when utilization reaches a
certain level.

- Make sure to choose an adequate margin between the scale-out and
scale-in thresholds to prevent flapping. Flapping is an infinite loop of
scaling in and scaling out. That is, if a scaling action is taken, the
metric value would change and start another scaling action in the
reverse direction.
