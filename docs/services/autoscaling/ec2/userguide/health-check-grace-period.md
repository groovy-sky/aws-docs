# Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group

When an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling health check determines that an `InService` instance is
unhealthy, it replaces it with a new instance. The health check grace period specifies
the minimum amount of time (in seconds) to keep a new instance in service before
terminating it if it's found to be unhealthy.

An example use case might be a requirement for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to avoid taking action if the
Elastic Load Balancing health checks fail and the cause is that the instance is still initializing. Elastic Load Balancing
health checks run in parallel, starting when the instance is registered with the load
balancer. The grace period prevents Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling from marking your newly launched instances
`Unhealthy` and terminating them unnecessarily if they don't immediately
pass these health checks after they enter the `InService` state.

In the console, by default, the health check grace period is 300 seconds when you
create an Auto Scaling group. Its default value is 0 seconds when you create an Auto Scaling group using
the AWS CLI or an SDK. A value of 0 turns off the health check grace period.

Setting this value too high reduces the effectiveness of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling health checks.
If you use lifecycle hooks for instance launch, you can set the health check grace
period to 0. With lifecycle hooks, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling provides a way to make sure that instances
are always initialized before they enter the `InService` state. For more
information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html).

The grace period applies to the following instances:

- Newly launched instances

- Instances that are put back into service after being in standby

- Instances that you manually attach to the group

###### Important

During the health check grace period, if Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects that an instance is no
longer in the Amazon EC2 `running` state, it immediately marks the instance
`Unhealthy` and replaces it. For example, if you stop an instance in
an Auto Scaling group, it is marked `Unhealthy` and replaced.

## Set the health check grace period for a group

You can set the health check grace period for new and existing Auto Scaling groups.

Console

###### To modify the health check grace period for a new group

When you create the Auto Scaling group, enter the amount of time (in
seconds) on the **Configure advanced options**
page, **Health checks**, **Health check**
**grace period**. This is how long Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling must wait
before checking the health status of an instance after it enters the
`InService` state.

AWS CLI

###### To modify the health check grace period for a new group

Add the `--health-check-grace-period` option to the
[create-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html) command. The following
example configures the health check grace period with a value of
`60` seconds for a new
Auto Scaling group named
`my-asg`.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --health-check-grace-period 60 ...
```

Console

###### To modify the health check grace period for an existing group

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the
    AWS Region that you created your Auto Scaling group in.

3. Select the check box next to the Auto Scaling group.

A split pane opens up in the bottom of the page.

4. On the **Details** tab, choose
    **Health checks**,
    **Edit**.

5. Under **Health check grace period**, enter
    the amount of time, in seconds. This is how long Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling must
    wait before checking the health status of an instance after it
    enters the `InService` state.

6. Choose **Update**.

AWS CLI

###### To modify the health check grace period for an existing group

Add the `--health-check-grace-period` option to the
[update-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html) command. The following
example configures the health check grace period with a value of
`120` seconds for an
existing Auto Scaling group named
`my-asg`.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --health-check-grace-period 120
```

###### Note

We strongly recommend also setting the default instance warm-up time for your
Auto Scaling group. For more information, see [Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html).
