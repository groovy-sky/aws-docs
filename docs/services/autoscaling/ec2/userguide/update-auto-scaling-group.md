# Update an Auto Scaling group

You can update most of your Auto Scaling group's details. You can't update the name of an Auto Scaling
group or change its AWS Region.

###### To update an Auto Scaling group (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. Choose your Auto Scaling group to display information about the group, with tabs for
    **Details**, **Activity**,
    **Automatic scaling**, **Instance**
**management**, **Monitoring**, and
    **Instance refresh**.

3. Choose the tabs for the configuration areas that you're interested in and
    update the settings as needed. For each setting that you edit, choose
    **Update** to save your changes to the Auto Scaling group's
    configuration.

- **Details** tab

These are the general settings for your Auto Scaling group. You can edit and
manage these in the same way as during Auto Scaling group creation.

The **Advanced configurations** section has some
options that are not available when creating the group such as [termination\
policies](ec2-auto-scaling-termination-policies.md), [cooldown](ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.md), [suspended processes](as-suspend-resume-processes.md), and [maximum instance\
lifetime](asg-max-instance-lifetime.md). You can also view, but not edit the placement group and
[service-linked\
role](autoscaling-service-linked-role.md) of the Auto Scaling group.

- **Integrations** tab

- **Load balancing** – [Elastic Load Balancing](autoscaling-load-balancer.md)

If the group is associated with Elastic Load Balancing resources, see [Add an Availability Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-add-az-console.html) before changing
Availability Zones. Some restrictions on the load balancer might prevent
you from applying changes to your group's Availability Zones to your
load balancer's Availability Zones.

- **VPC Lattice integration options** – [VPC Lattice](ec2-auto-scaling-vpc-lattice.md)

- **ARC zonal shift** – [Auto Scaling group zonal shift](ec2-auto-scaling-zonal-shift.md)

- **Automatic scaling** tab

- **Dynamic scaling policies** – [Dynamic scaling\
policies](as-scale-based-on-demand.md)

- **Predictive scaling policies** –
[Predictive scaling policies](ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.md)

- **Scheduled actions** – [Scheduled\
actions](ec2-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.md)

- **Instance management** tab

- **Lifecycle hooks** – [Lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md)

- **Warm pool** – [Warm\
pools](ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.md)

- **Activity** tab

- **Activity notifications** – [Amazon SNS\
notifications](ec2-auto-scaling-sns-notifications.md)

- **Monitoring** tab

- There is just a single option in this tab, which lets you
enable or disable [CloudWatch\
group metrics collection](ec2-auto-scaling-metrics.md).

###### To update an Auto Scaling group using the command line

You can use one of the following commands:

- [update-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html) (AWS CLI)

- [Update-ASAutoScalingGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Update-ASAutoScalingGroup.html) (AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell)

## Update Auto Scaling instances

If you associate a new launch template or launch configuration with an Auto Scaling group,
all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to
run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. To apply your
changes to existing instances, you have the following options:

- Start an instance refresh to replace the older instances. For more
information, see [Use an instance refresh to update instances in an Auto Scaling group](asg-instance-refresh.md).

- Wait for scaling activities to gradually replace older instances with
newer instances based on your [termination policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html).

- Manually terminate them so that they are replaced by your Auto Scaling
group.

###### Note

You can change the following instance attributes by specifying them as part of
the launch template or launch configuration:

- Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

- block devices

- key pair

- instance type

- security groups

- user data

- monitoring

- IAM instance profile

- placement tenancy

- kernel

- ramdisk

- whether the instance has a public IP address

- the Availability Zone distribution strategy

## Auto Scaling group allocation strategy and capacity changes

When you change an Auto Scaling group allocation strategy, existing instances are
not replaced. Any new instances that are launched because of scale out events will
follow the new allocation strategy. Any future scale in events will follow the
[termination policy](ec2-auto-scaling-termination-policies.md) and
use the new allocation strategy if the termination policy is set to `Default` or `AllocationStrategy`.
For example, if you change the allocation strategy from `lowest-price` to `price-capacity-optimized`, there might
not be any instance terminations, but any new instances will be launched with the
new allocation strategy. Instance type changes do not affect existing instances.

When you change certain parameters such as the [OnDemandBaseCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_InstancesDistribution.html) or the
[OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_InstancesDistribution.html), Auto Scaling will automatically rebalance if the percentage of On-Demand Instances
and Spot Instances do not match the new specifications. For example, suppose an Auto Scaling group has the `OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity` set to 50 percent On-Demand Instances and 50 percent Spot Instances. Then, the `OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity`
is increased to 100 percent On-Demand Instances. The Auto Scaling group will proactively rebalance by launching new On-Demand Instances and terminating Spot Instances.
The [instance maintenance policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/instance-maintenance-policy-overview-and-considerations.html) that you defined determines the order of the launch and termination activities.
