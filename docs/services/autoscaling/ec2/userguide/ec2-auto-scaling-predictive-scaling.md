# Predictive scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

Predictive scaling works by analyzing historical load data to detect daily or weekly
patterns in traffic flows. It uses this information to forecast future capacity needs so
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can proactively increase the capacity of your Auto Scaling group to match the anticipated
load.

Predictive scaling is well suited for situations where you have:

- Cyclical traffic, such as high use of resources during regular business hours and
low use of resources during evenings and weekends

- Recurring on-and-off workload patterns, such as batch processing, testing, or
periodic data analysis

- Applications that take a long time to initialize, causing a noticeable latency
impact on application performance during scale-out events

In general, if you have regular patterns of traffic increases and applications that take a
long time to initialize, you should consider using predictive scaling. Predictive scaling
can help you scale faster by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load, compared to
using only dynamic scaling, which is reactive in nature. Predictive scaling can also
potentially save you money on your EC2 bill by helping you avoid the need to over provision
capacity.

For example, consider an application that has high usage during business hours and low
usage overnight. At the start of each business day, predictive scaling can add capacity
before the first influx of traffic. This helps your application maintain high availability
and performance when going from a period of lower utilization to a period of higher
utilization. You don't have to wait for dynamic scaling to react to changing traffic. You
also don't have to spend time reviewing your application's load patterns and trying to
schedule the right amount of capacity using scheduled scaling.
