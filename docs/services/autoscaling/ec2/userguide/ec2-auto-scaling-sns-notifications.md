# Amazon SNS notification options for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

You can configure your Auto Scaling group to notify you of important events that affect your
application. With notifications, you can also eliminate polling, and you won't encounter the
`RequestLimitExceeded` error that sometimes results from polling.

There are two ways to receive notifications about Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:

- Amazon Simple Notification Service – Amazon SNS can notify you when your Auto Scaling group
launches or terminates instances. You can only turn Amazon SNS notifications on or off. For more
information, see [Amazon SNS and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](#amazon-sns-and-ec2-auto-scaling).

- Amazon EventBridge – EventBridge provides more advanced, event-driven
notifications matched to specified criteria and sent to a variety of targets, including Amazon SNS.
EventBridge can also monitor a wider range of Auto Scaling events for more precise monitoring. For more
information, see [Use EventBridge to handle Auto Scaling events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/automating-ec2-auto-scaling-with-eventbridge.html).

You can optionally use notifications with lifecycle hooks to perform custom actions on
instances during launch or termination. For more information on how to configure the notifications
to use with lifecycle hooks, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md).

## Amazon SNS and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

This section shows how to use Amazon SNS to monitor when your Auto Scaling group launches or terminates
instances.

For example, if you configure your Auto Scaling group to use the `autoscaling:
    EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATE` notification type, and your Auto Scaling group terminates an instance, it
sends an email notification. This email contains the details of the terminated instance, such as
the instance ID and the reason that the instance was terminated.

Note that as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling adds or removes instances from the group, notifications about these
changes are sent to you, with one notification sent per instance. However, delivery of these
notifications is on a best-effort basis, and your instances could still fail after the initial
notification, for example, if a later health check fails. For more information about the health
check process, see [Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group](ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.md).

For more information about Amazon SNS generally, see the [Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg).

### Configure Amazon SNS notifications for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

To use Amazon SNS to send email notifications, you must first create a
_topic_ and then subscribe your email addresses to the topic.

#### Create an Amazon SNS topic

An SNS topic is a logical access point, a communication channel your Auto Scaling group uses to
send the notifications. You create a topic by specifying a name for your topic.

When you create a topic name, the name must meet the following requirements:

- Between 1 and 256 characters long

- Contain uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens

For more information, see [Creating an Amazon SNS\
topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html) in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

#### Subscribe to the Amazon SNS topic

To receive the notifications that your Auto Scaling group sends to the topic, you must subscribe
an endpoint to the topic. In this procedure, for **Endpoint**, specify the
email address where you want to receive the notifications from Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

For more information, see [Subscribing to an Amazon SNS\
topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html) in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

#### Confirm your Amazon SNS subscription

Amazon SNS sends a confirmation email to the email address you specified in the previous
step.

Make sure that you open the email from AWS
Notifications and choose the link to confirm the subscription before you continue
with the next step.

You will receive an acknowledgment message from AWS. Amazon SNS is now configured to receive
notifications and send the notification as an email to the email address that you
specified.

#### Configure your Auto Scaling group to send notifications

You can configure your Auto Scaling group to send notifications to Amazon SNS when a scaling event,
such as launching instances or terminating instances, takes place. Amazon SNS sends a notification
with information about the instances to the email address that you specified.

###### To configure Amazon SNS notifications for your Auto Scaling group (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group.

A split pane opens up in the bottom part of the page, showing information about the
    group that's selected.

3. On the **Activity** tab, choose **Activity**
**notifications**, **Create notification**.

4. On the **Create notifications** pane, do the following:
1. For **SNS Topic**, select your SNS topic.

2. For **Event types**, select the events to send the
       notifications.

3. Choose **Create**.

###### To configure Amazon SNS notifications for your Auto Scaling group (AWS CLI)

Use the following [put-notification-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/put-notification-configuration.html) command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling put-notification-configuration --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --topic-arn arn --notification-types "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCH" "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATE"
```

#### Test the notification

To generate a notification for a launch event, update the Auto Scaling group by increasing the
desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group by 1. You receive a notification within a few minutes after
instance launch.

###### To change the desired capacity (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group.

A split pane opens up in the bottom part of the **Auto Scaling groups**
    page, showing information about the group that's selected.

3. On the **Details** tab, choose **Group details**,
    **Edit**.

4. For **Desired capacity**, increase the current value by 1. If this
    value exceeds **Maximum capacity**, you must also increase the value of
    **Maximum capacity** by 1.

5. Choose **Update**.

6. After a few minutes, you'll receive notification for the event. If you do not need the
    additional instance that you launched for this test, you can decrease **Desired**
**capacity** by 1. After a few minutes, you'll receive notification for the
    event.

#### Delete the notification configuration

You can delete your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling notification configuration if it is no longer being
used.

###### To delete Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling notification configuration (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. Select your Auto Scaling group.

3. On the **Activity** tab, select the check box next to the notification
    you want to delete and then choose **Actions**,
    **Delete**.

###### To delete Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling notification configuration (AWS CLI)

Use the following **delete-notification-configuration** command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling delete-notification-configuration --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --topic-arn arn
```

For information about deleting the Amazon SNS topic and all subscriptions associated with your
Auto Scaling group, see [Deleting an Amazon SNS\
subscription and topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-delete-subscription-topic.html) in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

### Key policy for an encrypted Amazon SNS topic

The Amazon SNS topic you specify might be encrypted with a customer managed key created with the
AWS Key Management Service. To give Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling permission to publish to encrypted topics, you must first create
your KMS key and then add the following statement to the policy of the KMS key. Replace the
example ARN with the ARN of the appropriate service-linked role that is allowed access to the
key. For more information, see [Configuring AWS KMS\
permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-key-management.html#sns-what-permissions-for-sse) in the _Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide_.

In this example, the policy statement gives the service-linked role named
**AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling** permissions to use the customer managed key.
To learn more about the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service-linked role, see [Service-linked roles for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](autoscaling-service-linked-role.md).

```json

{
  "Sid": "Allow service-linked role use of the customer managed key",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling"
  },
  "Action": [
    "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
    "kms:Decrypt"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

The `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount` condition keys are not
supported in key policies that allow Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish to encrypted topics.
