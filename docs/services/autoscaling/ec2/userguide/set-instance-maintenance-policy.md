# Set an instance maintenance policy

To set an instance maintenance policy on an Auto Scaling group, use one of the following
methods:

Console

###### To set an instance maintenance policy on a new group (console)

1. Follow the instructions in [Create an Auto Scaling group using a launch template](create-asg-launch-template.md) and complete
    each step in the procedure, up to step 11.

2. On the **Configure group size and scaling**
**policies**, for **Desired**
**capacity**, enter the initial number of instances
    to launch.

3. In the **Scaling** section, under
    **Scaling limits**, if your new value for
    **Desired capacity** is greater than
    **Min desired capacity** and **Max**
**desired capacity**, the **Max desired**
**capacity** is automatically increased to the new
    desired capacity value. You can change these limits as
    needed.

4. For **Automatic scaling**, choose whether you
    want to create a target tracking scaling policy. You can also
    create this policy after your create your Auto Scaling group.

If you choose **Target tracking scaling**
**policy**, follow the directions in [Create a target tracking scaling policy](policy-creating.md)
    to create the policy.

5. In the **Instance maintenance policy**
    section, choose one of the available options:

- **Launch before terminating**: A new
instance must be provisioned first before an existing
instance can be terminated. This is a good choice for
applications that favor availability over cost
savings.

- **Terminate and launch**: New
instances are provisioned at the same time your existing
instances are terminated. This is a good choice for
applications that favor cost savings over availability.
It's also a good choice for applications that should not
launch more capacity than is currently available.

- **Custom policy**: This option lets
you set up your policy with a custom minimum and maximum
range for the amount of capacity that you want available
when replacing instances. This can help you achieve the
right balance between cost and availability.

6. For **Set healthy percentage**, enter values
    for one or both of the following fields. The enabled fields vary
    depending on the option that you chose in the preceding
    step.

- **Min**: Sets the minimum healthy
percentage that's required to proceed with replacing
instances.

- **Max**: Sets the maximum healthy
percentage that's possible when replacing
instances.

7. Expand the **View capacity during replacements based**
**on your desired capacity** section to confirm how
    the values for **Min** and
    **Max** apply to your group. The exact
    values used depend on the desired capacity value, which will
    change if the group scales.

8. Continue with the steps in [Create an Auto Scaling group using a launch template](create-asg-launch-template.md).

AWS CLI

###### To set an instance maintenance policy on a new group (AWS CLI)

Add the `--instance-maintenance-policy` option to the
[create-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html) command. The following
example set an instance maintenance policy on a new Auto Scaling group named
`my-asg`.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group \
  --launch-template LaunchTemplateName=my-launch-template,Version='1' \
  --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --min-size 1 \
  --max-size 10 \
  --desired-capacity 5 \
  --default-instance-warmup 20 \
  --instance-maintenance-policy '{
      "MinHealthyPercentage": 90,
      "MaxHealthyPercentage": 120
    }' \
  --vpc-zone-identifier "subnet-5e6example,subnet-613example,subnet-c93example"
```

Console

###### To set an instance maintenance policy on an existing group (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the
    AWS Region that you created your Auto Scaling group in.

3. Select the check box next to the Auto Scaling group.

A split pane opens up in the bottom of the page.

4. On the **Details** tab, choose
    **Instance maintenance policy**,
    **Edit**.

5. To set an instance maintenance policy on the group, choose one
    of the available options:

- **Launch before terminating**: A new
instance must be provisioned first before an existing
instance can be terminated. This is a good choice for
applications that favor availability over cost
savings.

- **Terminate and launch**: New
instances are provisioned at the same time your existing
instances are terminated. This is a good choice for
applications that favor cost savings over availability.
It's also a good choice for applications that should not
launch more capacity than is currently available.

- **Custom policy**: This option lets
you set up your policy with a custom minimum and maximum
range for the amount of capacity that you want available
when replacing instances. This can help you achieve the
right balance between cost and availability.

6. For **Set healthy percentage**, enter values
    for one or both of the following fields. The enabled fields vary
    depending on the option that you chose in the preceding
    step.

- **Min**: Sets the minimum healthy
percentage that's required to proceed with replacing
instances.

- **Max**: Sets the maximum healthy
percentage that's possible when replacing
instances.

7. Expand the **View capacity during replacements based**
**on your desired capacity** section to confirm how
    the values for **Min** and
    **Max** apply to your group. The exact
    values used depend on the desired capacity value, which will
    change if the group scales.

8. Choose **Update**.

AWS CLI

###### To set an instance maintenance policy on an existing group (AWS CLI)

Add the `--instance-maintenance-policy` option to the
[update-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html) command. The following
example sets an instance maintenance policy on the specified Auto Scaling
group.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --instance-maintenance-policy '{
      "MinHealthyPercentage": 90,
      "MaxHealthyPercentage": 120
    }'
```
