# Configure monitoring for Auto Scaling instances

Amazon EC2 collects and processes raw data from instances into readable, near real-time
metrics that describe the CPU and other usage data for your Auto Scaling group. You can
configure the interval for monitoring these metrics by choosing one-minute or
five-minute granularity.

Instance monitoring is enabled whenever an instance is launched, using either basic
monitoring (five-minute granularity) or detailed monitoring (one-minute granularity).
For detailed monitoring, additional charges apply. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing) and [Monitoring your instances using\
CloudWatch](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/using-cloudwatch.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

Before creating an Auto Scaling group, you should create a launch template or launch
configuration that permits the type of monitoring that is appropriate to your
application. If you add a scaling policy to your group, we strongly recommend that you
use detailed monitoring to get metric data for EC2 instances at a one-minute
granularity, because that achieves a faster response to changes in load.

## Enable detailed monitoring (console)

By default, basic monitoring is enabled when you use the AWS Management Console to create a
launch template or launch configuration.

###### To enable detailed monitoring in a launch template

When you create the launch template using the AWS Management Console, in the
**Advanced details** section, for **Detailed CloudWatch**
**monitoring**, choose **Enable**.
Otherwise, basic monitoring is enabled. For more information, see [Create a launch template using advanced settings](advanced-settings-for-your-launch-template.md).

###### To enable detailed monitoring in a launch configuration

When you create the launch configuration using the AWS Management Console, in the
**Additional configuration** section, select
**Enable EC2 instance detailed monitoring within**
**CloudWatch**. Otherwise, basic monitoring is enabled. For more
information, see [Create a launch configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-config.html).

## Enable detailed monitoring (AWS CLI)

By default, basic monitoring is enabled when you create a launch template using
the AWS CLI. Detailed monitoring is enabled by default when you create a launch
configuration using the AWS CLI.

###### To enable detailed monitoring in a launch template

For launch templates, use the [create-launch-template](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/create-launch-template.html) command and pass a JSON file that contains
the information for creating the launch template. Set the monitoring attribute
to `"Monitoring":{"Enabled":true}` to enable detailed monitoring or
`"Monitoring":{"Enabled":false}` to enable basic monitoring.

###### To enable detailed monitoring in a launch configuration

For launch configurations, use the [create-launch-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-launch-configuration.html) command with the
`--instance-monitoring` option. Set this option to
`true` to enable detailed monitoring or `false` to
enable basic monitoring.

```nohighlight

--instance-monitoring Enabled=true
```

## Switch between basic and detailed monitoring

To change the type of monitoring enabled on new EC2 instances, update the launch
template or update the Auto Scaling group to use a new launch template or launch
configuration. Existing instances continue to use the previously enabled monitoring
type. To update all instances, terminate them so that they are replaced by your Auto Scaling
group or update instances individually using [monitor-instances](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/monitor-instances.html) and
[unmonitor-instances](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/unmonitor-instances.html).

###### Note

With the instance refresh and maximum instance lifetime features, you can also
replace all instances in the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances that use the new
settings. For more information, see [Replace the instances in your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-group-replacing-instances.html).

When you switch between basic and detailed monitoring:

If you have CloudWatch alarms associated with the step scaling policies or simple
scaling policies for your Auto Scaling group, use the [put-metric-alarm](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
command to update each alarm. Make each period match the monitoring type (300
seconds for basic monitoring and 60 seconds for detailed monitoring). If you change
from detailed monitoring to basic monitoring but do not update your alarms to match
the five-minute period, they continue to check for statistics every minute. They
might find no data available for as many as four out of every five periods.

## Collect additional metrics using the CloudWatch agent

To collect operating system-level metrics like available and used memory, you must
install the CloudWatch agent. Additional fees may apply. You can use the CloudWatch agent to
collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances. For more
information, see [Metrics collected by the CloudWatch agent](../../../amazoncloudwatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-cloudwatch-agent.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.
