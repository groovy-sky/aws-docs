# Set up a custom health check for your Auto Scaling group

You can use custom health checks to complement the existing health check options
provided by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. By combining custom health checks with the other health check
types, you can create a comprehensive health monitoring system tailored to your
application's needs.

To get started, create custom tests to verify that the instances in your Auto Scaling group
are working correctly and can handle incoming traffic. If the health check that you
configure detects that an instance isn't responding, then mark that particular instance
as `Unhealthy`, which causes Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to immediately replace it.

You can send the health status of an instance directly to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling by using the AWS CLI
or an SDK. The following examples show you how to use the AWS CLI to configure the health
status of an instance and then verify the instance's health status.

Use the following [set-instance-health](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/set-instance-health.html) command to set the health status of the specified
instance to `Unhealthy`.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling set-instance-health --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --health-status Unhealthy
```

By default, this command respects the health check grace period. However, you can
override this behavior and not respect the grace period by including the
`--no-should-respect-grace-period` option.

Use the following [describe-auto-scaling-groups](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html) command to verify that the instance's health
status is `Unhealthy`.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --auto-scaling-group-names my-asg
```

The following is an example response that shows you that the health status of the
instance is `Unhealthy`, and that the instance is terminating.
