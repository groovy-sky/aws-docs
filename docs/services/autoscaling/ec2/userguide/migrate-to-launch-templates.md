# Migrate your Auto Scaling groups to launch templates

As of **January 1, 2023**, new instance types are no longer supported in launch
configurations. This applies to any instance types added to an AWS Region after the initial Region launch.
In addition, you might be able to create a launch configuration with an
instance type that is no longer supported in a Region. For more information, see [Auto Scaling launch configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-configurations.html).

To migrate your Auto Scaling groups from launch configurations to launch templates, see the
following steps.

###### Important

Verify that you have the permissions required to work with
launch templates. For more information, see [Permissions to work with launch templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html#launch-templates-permissions).

Make sure that resources associated with the launch configuration, such as security groups and IAM instance profiles, are not deleted unintentionally.

Test the rollback operation to make sure that changes can be safely reverted.

## Step 1: Find Auto Scaling groups that use launch configurations

To identify whether you have Auto Scaling groups that are still using launch
configurations, run the following [describe-auto-scaling-groups](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/describe-auto-scaling-groups.html) command using the AWS CLI. Replace
`REGION` with your AWS Region.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --region REGION \
  --query 'AutoScalingGroups[?LaunchConfigurationName!=`null`]'
```

The following is example output.

```json

[
    {
	"AutoScalingGroupName": "group-1",
	"AutoScalingGroupARN": "arn",
	"LaunchConfigurationName": "my-launch-config",
	"MinSize": 1,
	"MaxSize": 5,
	"DesiredCapacity": 2,
	"DefaultCooldown": 300,
	"AvailabilityZones": [
            "us-west-2a",
            "us-west-2b",
            "us-west-2c"
        ],
	"LoadBalancerNames": [],
	"TargetGroupARNs": [],
	"HealthCheckType": "EC2",
	"HealthCheckGracePeriod": 300,
	"Instances": [
            {
                "ProtectedFromScaleIn": false,
                "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2a",
                "LaunchConfigurationName": "my-launch-config",
                "InstanceId": "i-05b4f7d5be44822a6",
                "InstanceType": "t3.micro",
                "HealthStatus": "Healthy",
                "LifecycleState": "InService"
            },
            {
                "ProtectedFromScaleIn": false,
                "AvailabilityZone": "us-west-2b",
                "LaunchConfigurationName": "my-launch-config",
                "InstanceId": "i-0c20ac468fa3049e8",
                "InstanceType": "t3.micro",
                "HealthStatus": "Healthy",
                "LifecycleState": "InService"
            }
	],
	"CreatedTime": "2023-03-09T22:15:11.611Z",
	"SuspendedProcesses": [],
	"VPCZoneIdentifier": "subnet-5ea0c127,subnet-6194ea3b,subnet-c934b782",
	"EnabledMetrics": [],
	"Tags": [
            {
		"ResourceId": "group-1",
		"ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
		"Key": "environment",
		"Value": "production",
		"PropagateAtLaunch": true
            }
        ],
	"TerminationPolicies": [
	    "Default"
	],
	"NewInstancesProtectedFromScaleIn": false,
	"ServiceLinkedRoleARN": "arn",
       "TrafficSources": []
    },

    ... additional groups ...

]
```

Alternatively, to remove everything except the Auto Scaling group names with the names of
their respective launch configurations and tags in the output, run the following
command:

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --region REGION \
  --query 'AutoScalingGroups[?LaunchConfigurationName!=`null`].{AutoScalingGroupName: AutoScalingGroupName, LaunchConfigurationName: LaunchConfigurationName, Tags: Tags}'
```

The following shows example output.

```json

[
    {
        "AutoScalingGroupName": "group-1",
        "LaunchConfigurationName": "my-launch-config",
        "Tags": [
            {
                "ResourceId": "group-1",
                "ResourceType": "auto-scaling-group",
                "Key": "environment",
                "Value": "production",
                "PropagateAtLaunch": true
            }
        ]
    },

    ... additional groups ...

]
```

in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

## Step 2: Copy a launch configuration to a launch template

You can copy a launch configuration to a launch template using the following
procedure. Then, you can add it to your Auto Scaling group.

Copying multiple launch configurations results in identically named launch
templates. To change the name given to a launch template during the copying process,
you must copy the launch configurations one by one.

###### Note

The copying feature is available only from the console.

###### To copy a launch configuration to a launch template (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the left navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**,
    choose **Auto Scaling Groups**.

3. Choose **Launch configurations** near the top of the
    page. When prompted for confirmation, choose **View launch**
**configurations** to confirm that you want to view the
    **Launch configurations** page.

4. Select the launch configuration you want to copy and choose **Copy**
**to launch template, Copy selected**. This sets up a new launch
    template with the same name and options as the launch configuration that you
    selected.

5. For **New launch template name**, you can use the name of
    the launch configuration (the default) or enter a new name. Launch template
    names must be unique.

6. (Optional) Select **Create an Auto Scaling group using the new**
**template**.

You can skip this step to finish copying the launch configuration. You do
    not need to create a new Auto Scaling group.

7. Choose **Copy**.

###### To copy all launch configurations to launch templates (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. On the navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**, choose
    **Launch Configurations**.

3. Choose **Copy to launch template, Copy all**. This copies
    each launch configuration in the current Region to a new launch template
    with the same name and options.

4. Choose **Copy**.

## Step 3: Update an Auto Scaling group to use a launch template

After creating a launch template, you're ready to add it to your Auto Scaling group.

###### To update an Auto Scaling group to use a launch template (console)

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2), and choose **Auto Scaling Groups** from the navigation pane.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group.

A split pane opens up in the bottom part of the page, showing information
    about the group that's selected.

3. On the **Details** tab, choose **Launch**
**configuration**, **Edit**.

4. Choose **Switch to launch template**.

5. For **Launch template**, select your launch
    template.

6. For **Version**, select the launch template version, as
    needed. After you create versions of a launch template, you can choose
    whether the Auto Scaling group uses the default or the latest version of the launch
    template when scaling out.

7. Choose **Update**.

###### To update an Auto Scaling group to use a launch template (AWS CLI)

The following [update-auto-scaling-group](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/update-auto-scaling-group.html) command updates the specified Auto Scaling group
to use the initial version of the specified launch template.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
  --launch-template LaunchTemplateName=my-template-for-auto-scaling,Version='1'
```

For more examples of using CLI commands to update an Auto Scaling group to use a launch
template, see [Update an Auto Scaling group to use a launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/examples-launch-templates-aws-cli.html#update-asg-launch-template-cli).

## Step 4: Replace your instances

After you replace the launch configuration with a launch template, any new
instances will use the new launch template. Existing instances are not affected.

To update the existing instances, you can start an instance refresh to replace the
instances in your Auto Scaling group instead of manually replacing instances a few at a
time. For more information, see [Use an instance refresh to update instances in an Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html). If the group is large, an instance
refresh can be particularly helpful.

Alternatively, you can allow automatic scaling to gradually replace existing
instances with new instances based on the group's [termination policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html), or you can
terminate them. Manual termination forces your Auto Scaling group to launch new instances to
maintain the group's desired capacity. For more information, see [Terminate an instance](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/terminating-instances.md#terminating-instances-console) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.
