# Complete a lifecycle action in an Auto Scaling group

When an Auto Scaling group responds to a lifecycle event, it puts the instance in a wait state
and sends an event notification. You can perform a custom action while the instance is
in a wait state.

Completing the lifecycle action with a result of `CONTINUE` is helpful if
you finish before the timeout period has expired. If you don't complete the lifecycle
action, the lifecycle hook goes to the status that you specified for **Default**
**result** after the timeout period ends.

## Complete a lifecycle action (manual)

The following procedure is for the command line interface and is not supported in
the console. Information that must be replaced, such as the instance ID or the name
of an Auto Scaling group, are shown in italics.

###### To complete a lifecycle action (AWS CLI)

1. If you need more time to complete the custom action, use the [record-lifecycle-action-heartbeat](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/record-lifecycle-action-heartbeat.html) command to restart the
    timeout period and keep the instance in a wait state. For example, if the
    timeout period is one hour, and you call this command after 30 minutes, the
    instance remains in a wait state for an additional hour, or a total of 90
    minutes.

You can specify the lifecycle action token that you received with the
    [notification](prepare-for-lifecycle-notifications.md#notification-message-example), as
    shown in the following command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling record-lifecycle-action-heartbeat --lifecycle-hook-name my-launch-hook \
     --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --lifecycle-action-token bcd2f1b8-9a78-44d3-8a7a-4dd07d7cf635
```

Alternatively, you can specify the ID of the instance that you received
    with the [notification](prepare-for-lifecycle-notifications.md#notification-message-example),
    as shown in the following command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling record-lifecycle-action-heartbeat --lifecycle-hook-name my-launch-hook \
     --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg --instance-id i-1a2b3c4d
```

2. If you finish the custom action before the timeout period ends, use the
    [complete-lifecycle-action](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/complete-lifecycle-action.html) command so that the Auto Scaling group can
    continue launching or terminating the instance. You can specify the
    lifecycle action token, as shown in the following command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling complete-lifecycle-action --lifecycle-action-result CONTINUE \
     --lifecycle-hook-name my-launch-hook --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
     --lifecycle-action-token bcd2f1b8-9a78-44d3-8a7a-4dd07d7cf635
```

Alternatively, you can specify the ID of the instance, as shown in the
    following command.

```nohighlight

aws autoscaling complete-lifecycle-action --lifecycle-action-result CONTINUE \
     --instance-id i-1a2b3c4d --lifecycle-hook-name my-launch-hook \
     --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg
```

## Complete a lifecycle action (automatic)

If you have a user data script that configures your instances after they launch,
you do not need to manually complete lifecycle actions. You can add the [complete-lifecycle-action](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/complete-lifecycle-action.html) command to the script. The script can
retrieve the instance ID from the instance metadata and signal Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when the
bootstrap scripts have completed successfully.

If you are not doing so already, update your script to retrieve the instance ID of
the instance from the instance metadata. For more information, see [Retrieve instance\
metadata](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/instancedata-data-retrieval.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

If you use Lambda, you can also set up a callback in your function's code to let
the lifecycle of the instance proceed if the custom action is successful. For more
information, see [Tutorial: Configure a lifecycle hook that invokes a Lambda function](tutorial-lifecycle-hook-lambda.md).
