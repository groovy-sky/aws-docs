# Retrieve the target lifecycle state through instance metadata

Each Auto Scaling instance that you launch goes through several lifecycle states. To invoke
custom actions from within an instance that act on specific lifecycle state transitions,
you must retrieve the target lifecycle state through instance metadata.

For example, you might need a mechanism to detect instance termination from inside the
instance to run some code on the instance before it's terminated. You can do this by
writing code that polls for the lifecycle state of an instance directly from the
instance. You can then add a lifecycle hook to the Auto Scaling group to keep the instance
running until your code sends the **complete-lifecycle-action** command
to continue.

The Auto Scaling instance lifecycle has two primary steady
states— `InService` and `Terminated`—and two side
steady states— `Detached` and `Standby`. If you use a warm
pool, the lifecycle has four additional steady
states— `Warmed:Hibernated`, `Warmed:Running`,
`Warmed:Stopped`, and `Warmed:Terminated`.

When an instance prepares to transition to one of the preceding steady states,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling updates the value of the instance metadata item
`autoscaling/target-lifecycle-state`. To get the target lifecycle state
from within the instance, you must use the Instance Metadata Service to retrieve it from the instance
metadata.

###### Note

_Instance metadata_ is data about an Amazon EC2 instance that
applications can use to query instance information. The _Instance Metadata Service_ is an on-instance component that local code uses to
access instance metadata. Local code can include user data scripts or applications
running on the instance.

Local code can access instance metadata from a running instance using one of two
methods: Instance Metadata Service Version 1 (IMDSv1) or Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2). IMDSv2
uses session-oriented requests and mitigates several types of vulnerabilities that could
be used to try to access the instance metadata. For details about these two methods, see
[Use\
IMDSv2](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.md) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

IMDSv2

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/autoscaling/target-lifecycle-state
```

IMDSv1

```nohighlight

[ec2-user ~]$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/autoscaling/target-lifecycle-state
```

The following is example output.

InService
```

The target lifecycle state is the state that the instance is transitioning to. The
current lifecycle state is the state that the instance is in. These can be the same
after the lifecycle action is complete and the instance finishes its transition to the
target lifecycle state. You cannot retrieve the current lifecycle state of the instance
from the instance metadata.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling started generating the target lifecycle state on March 10, 2022. If your
instance transitions to one of the target lifecycle states after that date, the target
lifecycle state item is present in your instance metadata. Otherwise, it is not present,
and you receive an HTTP 404 error.

For more information about retrieving instance metadata, see [Retrieve instance metadata](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/instancedata-data-retrieval.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

For a tutorial that shows you how to create a lifecycle hook with a custom action in a
user data script that uses the target lifecycle state, see [Tutorial: Use data script and instance metadata to retrieve lifecycle state](tutorial-lifecycle-hook-instance-metadata.md).

###### Important

To ensure that you can invoke a custom action as soon as possible, your local code
should poll IMDS frequently and retry on errors.
