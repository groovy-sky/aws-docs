# Troubleshoot unhealthy instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

The following are error messages returned by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, the potential causes, and the
steps you can take to resolve the issues.

To retrieve an error message, see [View the reason for health check failures](replace-unhealthy-instance.md).

## An instance was taken out of service in response to an EC2 instance status check failure

**Problem**: Auto Scaling instances fail the Amazon EC2 status
checks.

**Cause 1**: If there are issues that cause Amazon EC2 to
consider the instances in your Auto Scaling group impaired, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically replaces
the instances as part of its health checks.

**Solution 1**: When an instance status check fails,
you typically must address the problem yourself by making instance configuration
changes until your application is no longer exhibiting any problems. To resolve this
issue, follow these steps:

1. Manually create an Amazon EC2 instance that is not part of the Auto Scaling group and
    investigate the problem. For general help with investigating impaired
    instances, see [Troubleshoot\
    instances with failed status checks](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/troubleshootinginstances.md) in the
    _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

2. After you confirm that your instance launched successfully and is healthy,
    deploy a new, error-free instance configuration to the Auto Scaling group.

3. Delete the instance that you created to avoid ongoing charges to your
    AWS account.

## An instance was taken out of service in response to an EC2 health check that indicated it had been terminated or stopped

**Problem**: Auto Scaling instances that have been stopped,
rebooted, or terminated are replaced.

**Cause 1**: A user manually stopped, rebooted, or
terminated the instance.

**Solution 1**: If you need to stop or reboot the
instances in your Auto Scaling group, we recommend that you put the instances on standby
first. For more information, see [Temporarily remove instances from your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-enter-exit-standby.html).

**Cause 2**: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to replace Spot
Instances after the Amazon EC2 Spot service interrupts the instances, because the Spot
price increases above your maximum price or capacity is no longer available.

**Solution 2**: There is no guarantee that a Spot
Instance exists to fulfill the request at any given point in time. However, you can
try the following:

- Use a higher Spot maximum price (possibly the On-Demand price). By setting
your maximum price higher, it gives the Amazon EC2 Spot service a better chance
of launching and maintaining your required amount of capacity.

- Increase the number of different capacity pools that you can launch
instances from by running multiple instance types in multiple Availability
Zones. For more information, see [Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html).

- If you use multiple instance types, consider enabling the Capacity
Rebalancing feature. This is useful if you want the Amazon EC2 Spot service to
attempt to launch a new Spot Instance before a running instance is
terminated. For more information, see [Capacity Rebalancing in Auto Scaling to replace at-risk Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.html).

**Cause 3**: With Capacity Blocks, Amazon EC2 terminates
any instances that are still running 30 minutes before the end time of the Capacity
Block. This abrupt termination causes your Auto Scaling group to try to launch new instances
to maintain its desired capacity, even as the Capacity Block is ending.

**Solution 3**: To resolve this issue, try the
following:

- Decrease the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group to prevent it from trying
to launch new instances. For more information, see [Manual scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-manually.html).

- Make sure you scale in your Auto Scaling group 30 minutes before the Capacity
Block end time so that you do not encounter this error frequently. Make sure
any lifecycle hooks have completed 30 minutes before the Capacity Block end
time. For more information, see [Use Capacity Blocks for machine learning workloads](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-capacity-blocks.html).

## An instance was taken out of service in response to an ELB system health check failure

**Problem**: Auto Scaling instances might pass the EC2 status
checks. But they might fail the Elastic Load Balancing health checks for the target groups or Classic Load Balancers
with which the Auto Scaling group is registered.

**Cause 1**: If your Auto Scaling group relies on health
checks provided by Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling determines the health status of your instances by
checking the results of both the EC2 status checks and the Elastic Load Balancing health checks. The
load balancer performs health checks by sending a request to each instance and
waiting for the correct response, or by establishing a connection with the instance.
An instance might fail the Elastic Load Balancing health check because an application running on the
instance has issues that cause the load balancer to consider the instance out of
service.

**Solution 1**: To pass the Elastic Load Balancing health checks:

- Verify that the health check settings of your target groups are correctly
configured. You define health check settings for your load balancer per
target group. For more information, see [Configure health checks for targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/getting-started-elastic-load-balancing.html#elb-health-checks-for-targets).

- Make note of the success codes that the load balancer is expecting, and
verify that your application is configured correctly to return these codes
on success.

- Verify that the security groups for your load balancer and Auto Scaling group are
correctly configured.

- Verify that the load balancer is configured in the same Availability Zones
as your Auto Scaling group.

**Solution 2**: Update the Auto Scaling group to turn off
Elastic Load Balancing health checks. For instructions for how to turn off these health checks, see [Detach a target group or Classic Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-load-balancer-asg.html#as-remove-load-balancer).

**Cause 2**: There is a mismatch between the health
check grace period and the instance startup time.

**Solution 3**: Edit the health check grace period
for your Auto Scaling group. Set the grace period to a long enough time period to support
the number of consecutive successful health checks required before Elastic Load Balancing considers a
newly launched instance healthy. For more information, see [Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group](health-check-grace-period.md).
