# Tutorial: Create your first Auto Scaling group

This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling through the AWS Management Console.
You'll create a launch template that defines your EC2 instances and an Auto Scaling group with a
single instance in it. After launching your Auto Scaling group, you'll terminate the instance
and verify that the instance was removed from service and replaced. To maintain a
constant number of instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects and responds to Amazon EC2 health and
reachability checks automatically.

When you sign up for AWS, you can get started with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for free using the
[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free). You can use the free
tier to launch and use a `t2.micro` instance for free for 12 months (in
Regions where `t2.micro` is unavailable, you can use a `t3.micro`
instance under the free tier). If you launch an instance that is not within the free
tier, you incur the standard Amazon EC2 usage fees for the instance. For more information,
see [Amazon EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing).

## Prepare for the walkthrough

This walkthrough assumes that you are familiar with launching EC2 instances and
that you have already created a key pair and a security group.

To get started using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use the _default_ VPC
for your AWS account. The default VPC includes a default public subnet in each
Availability Zone and an internet gateway that is attached to your VPC. You can view
your VPCs on the [Your VPCs\
page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?%2F=) of the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) console.

## Step 1: Create a launch template

In this step, you create a launch template that specifies the type of EC2 instance
that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling creates for you. Include information such as the ID of the Amazon
Machine Image (AMI) to use, the instance type, the key pair, and security
groups.

###### To create a launch template

01. Open the Amazon EC2 console and go to the [Launch templates\
     page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2).

02. On the top navigation bar, select an AWS Region. The launch template and
     Auto Scaling group that you create are tied to the Region that you specify.

03. Choose **Create launch template**.

04. For **Launch template name**, enter
     `my-template-for-auto-scaling`.

05. Under **Auto Scaling guidance**, select the check box.

06. For **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**,
     choose a version of Amazon Linux 2 (HVM) from the **Quick**
    **Start** list. The AMI serves as a basic configuration template
     for your instances.

07. For **Instance type**, choose a hardware configuration
     that is compatible with the AMI that you specified.

08. (Optional) For **Key pair (login)**, choose an existing
     key pair. You use key pairs to connect to an Amazon EC2 instance with SSH.
     Connecting to an instance is not included as part of this tutorial.
     Therefore, you don't need to specify a key pair unless you intend to connect
     to your instance using SSH.

09. For **Network settings**, expand **Advanced**
    **network configuration** and do the following:
    1. Choose **Add network interface** to configure the
        primary network interface.

    2. For **Auto-assign public IP**, specify whether
        your instance receives a public IPv4 address. By default, Amazon EC2
        assigns a public IPv4 address if the EC2 instance is launched into a
        default subnet or if the instance is launched into a subnet that's
        been configured to automatically assign a public IPv4 address. If
        you don't need to connect to your instance, choose
        **Disable**.

    3. For **Security group ID**, choose a security
        group in the same VPC that you plan to use as the VPC for your Auto Scaling
        group. If you don't specify a security group, your instance is
        automatically associated with the default security group for the
        VPC.

    4. For **Delete on termination**, choose
        **Yes** to delete the network interface when
        the instance is deleted.
10. Choose **Create launch template**.

11. On the confirmation page, choose **Create Auto Scaling**
    **group**.

## Step 2: Create a single-instance Auto Scaling group

Use the following procedure to continue where you left off after creating a launch
template.

###### To create an Auto Scaling group

1. On the **Choose launch template or configuration** page,
    for **Auto Scaling group name**, enter
    `my-first-asg`.

2. Choose **Next**.

The **Choose instance launch options** page appears,
    allowing you to choose the VPC network settings you want the Auto Scaling group to
    use and giving you options for launching On-Demand and Spot Instances.

3. In the **Network** section, keep **VPC**
    set to the default VPC for your chosen AWS Region, or select your own VPC.
    The default VPC is automatically configured to provide internet connectivity
    to your instance. This VPC includes a public subnet in each Availability
    Zone in the Region.

4. For **Availability Zones and subnets**, choose a subnet
    from each Availability Zone that you want to include. Use subnets in
    multiple Availability Zones for high availability. For more information, see
    [Considerations when choosing VPC subnets](asg-in-vpc.md#as-vpc-considerations).

5. In the **Instance type requirements** section, use the
    default setting to simplify this step. (Do not override the launch
    template.) For this tutorial, you will launch only one On-Demand Instance
    using the instance type specified in your launch template.

6. Keep the rest of the defaults for this tutorial and choose **Skip**
**to review**.

###### Note

The initial size of the group is determined by its desired capacity.
The default value is `1` instance.

7. On the **Review** page, review the information for the
    group, and then choose **Create Auto Scaling group**.

## Step 3: Verify your Auto Scaling group

Now that you have created an Auto Scaling group, you are ready to verify that the group
has launched an EC2 instance.

###### Tip

In the following procedure, you look at the **Activity**
**history** and **Instances** sections for the Auto Scaling
group. In both, the named columns should already be displayed. To display hidden
columns or change the number of rows shown, choose the gear icon on the top
right corner of each section to open the preferences modal, update the settings
as needed, and choose **Confirm**.

###### To verify that your Auto Scaling group has launched an EC2 instance

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups \
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?) of the Amazon EC2 console.

2. Select the check box next to the Auto Scaling group that you just created.

A split pane opens up in the bottom of the **Auto Scaling**
**groups** page. The first tab available is the
    **Details** tab, showing information about the Auto Scaling
    group.

3. Choose the second tab, **Activity**. Under
    **Activity history**, you can view the progress of
    activities that are associated with the Auto Scaling group. The
    **Status** column shows the current status of your
    instance. While your instance is launching, the status column shows
    `Not yet in service`. The status changes to
    `Successful` after the instance is launched. You can also use
    the refresh button to see the current status of your instance.

4. On the **Instance management** tab, under
    **Instances**, you can view the status of the
    instance.

5. Verify that your instance launched successfully. It takes a short time for
    an instance to launch.

- The **Lifecycle** column shows the state of your
instance. Initially, your instance is in the `Pending`
state. After an instance is ready to receive traffic, its state is
`InService`.

- The **Health status** column shows the result of
the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling health checks on your instance.

## Step 4: Terminate an instance in your Auto Scaling group

Use these steps to learn more about how Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling works, specifically, how it
launches new instances when necessary. The minimum size for the Auto Scaling group that you
created in this tutorial is one instance. Therefore, if you terminate that running
instance, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling must launch a new instance to replace it.

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups \
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?) of the Amazon EC2 console.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group.

3. On the **Instance management** tab, under
    **Instances**, select the ID of the instance.

This takes you to the **Instances** page of the Amazon EC2
    console, where you can terminate the instance.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Instance State**,
    **Terminate**. When prompted for confirmation, choose
    **Yes, Terminate**.

5. On the navigation pane, under **Auto Scaling**, choose
    **Auto Scaling Groups**. Select your Auto Scaling group and choose the
    **Activity** tab.

When you terminate an instance from the **Instances**
    page, it takes a minute or two after you terminate the instance before a new
    instance launches. In the activity history, when the scaling activity
    starts, you see an entry for the termination of the first instance and an
    entry for the launch of a new instance. Use the refresh button until you see
    the new entries.

6. On the **Instance management** tab, the
    **Instances** section shows the new instance only.

7. On the navigation pane, under **Instances**, choose
    **Instances**. This page shows both the terminated
    instance and the new running instance.

## Step 5: Next steps

Go to the next step if you would like to delete the basic infrastructure that you
just created. Otherwise, you can use this infrastructure as your base and try one or
more of the following:

- Connect to your Linux instance using Session Manager or SSH. For more
information, see [Connect to your EC2 instance using Session Manager](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/connect-with-systems-manager-session-manager.md) and
[Connect to your Linux instance using SSH](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/connect-to-linux-instance.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- Configure an Amazon SNS notification to notify you whenever your Auto Scaling group
launches or terminates instances. For more information, see [Amazon SNS notification\
options](ec2-auto-scaling-sns-notifications.md).

- Manually scale your Auto Scaling group to test the SNS notification. For more
information, see [Change the desired capacity of\
your Auto Scaling group](ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-manually.md#change-desired-capacity).

You can also start familiarizing yourself with auto scaling concepts by reading
about [Target tracking scaling\
policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-target-tracking.html). If the load on your
application changes, your Auto Scaling group can scale out (add instances) and scale in (run
fewer instances) automatically by adjusting the desired capacity of the group
between the minimum and maximum capacity limits. For more information about setting
these limits, see [Set scaling limits for your Auto Scaling group](asg-capacity-limits.md).

## Step 6: Clean up

You can either delete your scaling infrastructure or delete just your Auto Scaling group
and keep your launch template to use later.

If you launched an instance that is not within the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free), you should terminate your
instance to prevent additional charges. When you terminate the instance, the data
associated with it will also be deleted.

###### To delete your Auto Scaling group

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups \
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?) of the Amazon EC2 console.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group
    ( `my-first-asg`).

3. Choose **Delete**.

4. When prompted for confirmation, type `delete` to
    confirm deleting the specified Auto Scaling group and then choose
    **Delete**.

A loading icon in the **Name** column indicates that the
    Auto Scaling group is being deleted. When the deletion has occurred, the
    **Desired**, **Min**, and
    **Max** columns show `0` instances for the
    Auto Scaling group. It takes a few minutes to terminate the instance and delete the
    group. Refresh the list to see the current state.

Skip the following procedure if you would like to keep your launch
template.

###### To delete your launch template

1. Open the [Launch templates\
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2) of the Amazon EC2 console.

2. Select your launch template
    ( `my-template-for-auto-scaling`).

3. Choose **Actions**, **Delete**
**template**.

4. When prompted for confirmation, type `Delete` to
    confirm deleting the specified launch template and then choose
    **Delete**.
