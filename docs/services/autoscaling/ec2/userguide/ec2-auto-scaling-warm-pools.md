# Decrease latency for applications with long boot times using warm pools

A warm pool gives you the ability to decrease latency for your applications that have
exceptionally long boot times, for example, because instances need to write massive amounts
of data to disk. With warm pools, you no longer have to over-provision your Auto Scaling groups to
manage latency in order to improve application performance. For
more information, see the following blog post [Scaling your applications faster with EC2 Auto Scaling Warm\
Pools](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/scaling-your-applications-faster-with-ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools).

###### Important

Creating a warm pool when it's not required can lead to unnecessary costs. If your
first boot time does not cause noticeable latency issues for your application, there
probably isn't a need for you to use a warm pool.

## Core concepts

Before you get started, familiarize yourself with the following core concepts:

**Warm pool**

A warm pool is a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that sits alongside
an Auto Scaling group. Whenever your application needs to scale out, the Auto Scaling group
can draw on the warm pool to meet its new desired capacity. This helps you
to ensure that instances are ready to quickly start serving application
traffic, accelerating the response to a scale-out event. As instances leave
the warm pool, they count toward the desired capacity of the group. This is
known as a _warm start_.

While instances are in the warm pool, your scaling policies only scale out
if the metric value from instances that are in the `InService`
state is greater than the scaling policy's alarm high threshold (which is
the same as the target utilization of a target tracking scaling
policy).

**Warm pool size**

By default, the size of the warm pool is calculated as the difference
between the Auto Scaling group's maximum capacity and its desired capacity. For
example, if the desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group is 6 and the maximum
capacity is 10, the size of your warm pool will be 4 when you first set up
the warm pool and the pool is initializing.

To specify the warm pool's maximum capacity separately, use the custom
specification ( `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity`) option and set a
custom value for it that is greater than the current capacity of the group.
If you provide a custom value, the size of the warm pool is calculated as
the difference between the custom value and the current desired capacity of
the group. For example, if the desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group is 6, if
the maximum capacity is 20, and if the custom value is 8, the size of your
warm pool will be 2 when you first set up the warm pool and the pool is
initializing.

You might only need to use the custom specification
( `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity`) option when working with large
Auto Scaling groups to manage the cost benefits of having a warm pool. For example,
an Auto Scaling group with 1,000 instances, a maximum capacity of 1,500 (to provide
extra capacity for emergency traffic spikes), and a warm pool of 100
instances might help you achieve your goals better than keeping 500
instances reserved for future use inside the warm pool.

**Minimum warm pool size**

Consider using the minimum size setting ( `MinSize`) to statically set the minimum
number of instances to maintain in the warm pool. There is no minimum size set by default.
The `MinSize` setting is useful when you specify `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity` to ensure that
a minimum number of instances are maintained in the warm pool even when the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group
is higher than the `MaxGroupPreparedCapacity`.

**Warm pool instance state**

You can keep instances in the warm pool in one of three states:
`Stopped`, `Running`, or `Hibernated`.
Keeping instances in a `Stopped` state is an effective way to
minimize costs. With stopped instances, you pay only for the volumes that
you use and the Elastic IP addresses attached to the instances.

Alternatively, you can keep instances in a `Hibernated` state
to stop instances without deleting their memory contents (RAM). When an
instance is hibernated, this signals the operating system to save the
contents of your RAM to your Amazon EBS root volume. When the instance is started
again, the root volume is restored to its previous state and the RAM
contents are reloaded. While the instances are in hibernation, you pay only
for the EBS volumes, including storage for the RAM contents, and the Elastic
IP addresses attached to the instances.

Keeping instances in a `Running` state inside the warm pool is
also possible, but is highly discouraged to avoid incurring unnecessary
charges. When instances are stopped or hibernated, you are saving the cost
of the instances themselves. You pay for the instances only when they are
running.

**Lifecycle hooks**

You use [lifecycle\
hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/warm-pool-instance-lifecycle.html) to put instances into a wait state so that you can perform
custom actions on the instances. Custom actions are performed as the
instances launch or before they terminate.

In a warm pool configuration, lifecycle hooks delay instances from being
stopped or hibernated and from being put in service during a scale-out event
until they have finished initializing. If you add a warm pool to your Auto Scaling
group without a lifecycle hook, instances that take a long time to finish
initializing could be stopped or hibernated and then put in service during a
scale-out event before they are ready.

**Instance reuse policy**

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates your instances when your Auto Scaling group scales
in. Then, it launches new instances into the warm pool to replace the
instances that were terminated.

If you want to return instances to the warm pool instead, you can specify
an instance reuse policy. This lets you reuse instances that are already
configured to serve application traffic. To make sure that your warm pool is
not over-provisioned, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can terminate instances in the warm pool to
reduce its size when it is larger than necessary based on its settings. When
terminating instances in the warm pool, it uses the [default termination policy](ec2-auto-scaling-termination-policies.md#default-termination-policy)
to choose which instances to terminate first.

###### Important

If you want to hibernate instances on scale in and there are existing
instances in the Auto Scaling group, they must meet the requirements for
instance hibernation. If they don't, when instances return to the warm
pool, they will fallback to being stopped instead of being
hibernated.

###### Note

Currently, you can only specify an instance reuse policy by using the
AWS CLI or an SDK. This feature is not available from the console.

## Prerequisites

Before you create a warm pool for your Auto Scaling group, decide how you will use lifecycle
hooks to initialize new instances with an appropriate initial state.

To perform custom actions on instances while they are in a wait state due to a
lifecycle hook, you have two options:

- For simple scenarios where you want to run commands on your instances at
launch, you can include a user data script when you create a launch template or
launch configuration for your Auto Scaling group. User data scripts are just normal
shell scripts or cloud-init directives that are run by
cloud-init when your instances start. The script can also control
when your instances transition to the next state by using the ID of the instance
on which it runs. If you are not doing so already, update your script to
retrieve the instance ID of the instance from the instance metadata. For more
information, see [Access instance metadata](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/instancedata-data-retrieval.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

###### Tip

To run user data scripts when an instance restarts, the user data must be
in the MIME multi-part format and specify the following in the
`#cloud-config` section of the user data:

```yaml

#cloud-config
cloud_final_modules:
 - [scripts-user, always]
```

- For advanced scenarios where you need a service such as AWS Lambda to do
something as instances are entering or leaving the warm pool, you can create a
lifecycle hook for your Auto Scaling group and configure the target service to perform
custom actions based on lifecycle notifications. For more information, see [Supported notification targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/warm-pool-instance-lifecycle.html#warm-pools-supported-notification-targets).

###### Prepare instances for hibernation

To prepare Auto Scaling instances to use the `Hibernated` pool state, create a
new launch template or launch configuration that is set up correctly to support
instance hibernation, as described in the [Hibernation\
prerequisites](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/hibernating-prerequisites.md) topic in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_. Then,
associate the new launch template or launch configuration with the Auto Scaling group and
start an instance refresh to replace the instances associated with a previous launch
template or launch configuration. For more information, see [Use an instance refresh to update instances in an Auto Scaling group](asg-instance-refresh.md).

## Update the instances in a warm pool

To update the instances in a warm pool, you create a new launch template or launch
configuration and associate it with the Auto Scaling group. Any new instances are launched using
the new AMI and other updates that are specified in the launch template or launch
configuration, but existing instances are not affected.

To force replacement warm pool instances to launch that use the new launch template or
launch configuration, you can start an instance refresh to do a rolling update of your
group. An instance refresh first replaces `InService` instances. Then it
replaces instances in the warm pool. For more information, see [Use an instance refresh to update instances in an Auto Scaling group](asg-instance-refresh.md).

## Limitations

- Warm pool limitations for an Auto Scaling group with mixed instances types:

- Warm pools aren’t supported with weighted mixed instance groups. If your
Auto Scaling group uses instance weighting, you can’t add a warm pool.

- Warm pools don’t support Spot Instances within mixed instance groups. Your
mixed instances policy must be configured for On-Demand instances only when
using warm pools.

- When using warm pools with mixed instance groups in hibernated state, you
must configure `HibernationOptions` in your launch template.

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can put an instance in a `Stopped` or
`Hibernated` state only if it has an Amazon EBS volume as its root
device. Instances that use instance stores for the root device cannot be stopped
or hibernated.

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can put an instance in a `Hibernated` state only if meets
all of the requirements listed in the [Hibernation\
prerequisites](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/hibernating-prerequisites.md) topic in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- If your warm pool is depleted when there is a scale-out event, instances will
launch directly into the Auto Scaling group (a _cold start_). You
could also experience cold starts if an Availability Zone is out of
capacity.

- If an instance within the warm pool encounters an issue during the launch
process, preventing it from reaching the `InService` state, the
instance will be considered a failed launch and terminated. This applies
regardless of the underlying cause, such as an insufficient capacity error or
any other factor.

- If you try using a warm pool with an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) managed node group,
instances that are still initializing might register with your Amazon EKS cluster. As
a result, the cluster might schedule jobs on an instance as it is preparing to
be stopped or hibernated.

- Likewise, if you try using a warm pool with an Amazon ECS cluster, instances might
register with the cluster before they finish initializing. To solve this
problem, you must configure a launch template or launch configuration that
includes a special agent configuration variable in the user data. For more
information, see [Using a warm pool for your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/asg-capacity-providers.html#using-warm-pool) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.
