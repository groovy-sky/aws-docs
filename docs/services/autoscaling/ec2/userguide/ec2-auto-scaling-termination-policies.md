# Configure termination policies for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

A termination policy provides the criteria that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling follows to terminate
instances in a specific order. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses a termination policy that's designed to terminate
instances that are using outdated configurations first. You can change the termination policy to control which instances are most important to terminate first.

When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates instances, it tries to maintain balance across the
Availability Zones that are enabled for your Auto Scaling group. Maintaining Zonal balance
takes precedence over the termination policy. If one Availability Zone has more
instances than others, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling applies the termination policy to the imbalanced
zone first. If the Availability Zones are balanced, it applies the termination
policy across all Zones.

###### Note

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling applies termination policies only to instances that
are not considered unhealthy by the Auto Scaling group. As a result,
instances marked as unhealthy by Auto Scaling health checks will bypass
termination policy evaluation.

## How the default termination policy works

When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling needs to terminate an instance, it first identifies which
Availability Zone (or Zones) has the most instances and at least one instance
that is not protected from scale in. Then, it proceeds to evaluate unprotected
instances within the identified Availability Zone as follows:

###### Instances that use outdated configurations

- **For groups that use a launch template**
– Determine whether any of the instances use outdated
configurations, prioritizing in this order:

1. First, check for instances launched with a launch
    configuration.

2. Then, check for instances launched using a different launch
    template instead of the current launch template.

3. Finally, check for instances using the oldest version of the
    current launch template.

- For groups that use a launch
configuration – Determine whether any of the
instances use the oldest launch configuration.

If no instances with outdated configurations are found, or there are multiple
instances to choose from, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling considers the next criteria of instances
approaching their next billing hour.

###### Instances approaching next billing hour

Determine whether any of the instances that meet the previous criteria are
closest to the next billing hour. If multiple instances are equally close,
terminate one at random. This helps you maximize the use of your instances
that are billed hourly. However, most EC2 usage is now billed per second, so
this optimization provides less benefit. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing).

The following flow diagram illustrates how the default termination policy
works for groups that use a launch template.

## Default termination policy and mixed instances groups

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling applies additional criteria when terminating instances in [mixed instances\
groups](ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.md).

When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling needs to terminate an instance, it first identifies which
purchase option (Spot or On-Demand) should be terminated based on the settings
of the group. This makes sure that the group trends toward the specified ratio
of Spot and On-Demand instances over time.

It then applies the termination policy independently within each Availability
Zone. It determines which Spot or On-Demand Instance in which Availability Zone
to terminate to keep the Availability Zones balanced. The same logic applies to
a mixed instances group with weights defined for the instance types.

Within each zone, the default termination policy works as follows to determine
which unprotected instance within the identified purchase option can be
terminated:

1. Determine whether any of the instances can be terminated to improve
    alignment with the specified [allocation strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/allocation-strategies.html) for the Auto Scaling group. If no instances are
    identified for optimization, or there are multiple instances to choose
    from, the evaluation continues.

2. Determine whether any of the instances use outdated configurations,
    prioritizing in this order:

1. First, check for instances launched with a launch
    configuration.

2. Then, check for instances launched using a different launch
    template instead of the current launch template.

3. Finally, check for instances using the oldest version of the
    current launch template.

If no instances with outdated configurations are found, or there are
multiple instances to choose from, the evaluation continues.

3. Determine whether any of the instances are closest to the next billing
    hour. If multiple instances are equally close, choose one at
    random.

## Predefined termination policies

You choose from the following predefined termination policies:

- `Default` – Terminate
instances according to the default termination policy.

- `AllocationStrategy`
– Terminate instances in the Auto Scaling group to align the remaining
instances to the allocation strategy for the type of instance that is
terminating (either a Spot Instance or an On-Demand Instance). This
policy is useful when your preferred instance types have changed. If the
Spot allocation strategy is `lowest-price`, you can gradually
rebalance the distribution of Spot Instances across your N lowest priced
Spot pools. If the Spot allocation strategy is
`capacity-optimized`, you can gradually rebalance the
distribution of Spot Instances across Spot pools where there is more
available Spot capacity. You can also gradually replace On-Demand
Instances of a lower priority type with On-Demand Instances of a higher
priority type.

- `OldestLaunchTemplate`
– Terminate instances that have the oldest launch template. With
this policy, instances that use the noncurrent launch template are
terminated first, followed by instances that use the oldest version of
the current launch template. This policy is useful when you're updating
a group and phasing out the instances from a previous
configuration.

- `OldestLaunchConfiguration`
– Terminate instances that have the oldest launch configuration.
This policy is useful when you're updating a group and phasing out the
instances from a previous configuration. With this policy, instances
that use the noncurrent launch configuration are terminated
first.

- `ClosestToNextInstanceHour`
– Terminate instances that are closest to the next billing hour.
This policy helps you maximize the use of your instances that have an
hourly charge.

- `NewestInstance` –
Terminate the newest instance in the group. This policy is useful when
you're testing a new launch configuration but don't want to keep it in
production.

- `OldestInstance` –
Terminate the oldest instance in the group. This option is useful when
you're upgrading the instances in the Auto Scaling group to a new EC2 instance
type. You can gradually replace instances of the old type with instances
of the new type.

###### Note

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling always balances instances across Availability Zones
first, regardless of which termination policy is used. As a result,
you might encounter situations in which some newer instances are
terminated before older instances. For example, when there is a more
recently added Availability Zone, or when one Availability Zone has
more instances than the other Availability Zones that are used by
the group.
