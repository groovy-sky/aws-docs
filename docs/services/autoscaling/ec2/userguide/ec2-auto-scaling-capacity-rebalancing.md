# Capacity Rebalancing in Auto Scaling to replace at-risk Spot Instances

Capacity Rebalancing in Auto Scaling helps you maintain your workload
availability by proactively replacing Spot Instances at risk of interruption.

When Spot Instances are at an elevated risk of interruption, the Amazon EC2 Spot service sends
an EC2 instance rebalance recommendation to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. If you enable Capacity Rebalancing,
Auto Scaling attempts to proactively replace the Spot Instances in your group that have received an EC2 instance rebalance recommendation. This
provides an opportunity to rebalance your workload to new Spot Instances that aren't at an elevated risk of interruption.

When you don't use Capacity Rebalancing, Auto Scaling doesn't replace Spot Instances until
after the Amazon EC2 Spot service interrupts the instances and their health check fails. Before
interrupting an instance, Amazon EC2 always gives both an EC2 instance rebalance recommendation
and a Spot two-minute instance interruption notice.

## Overview

To use Capacity Rebalancing with your Auto Scaling group, the basic steps are:

1. Configure your Auto Scaling group to use multiple instance types and Availability
    Zones. This way, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can look at the available capacity for Spot Instances
    in each Availability Zone. For more information, see [Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html).

2. Add lifecycle hooks as needed to perform a graceful shutdown of your
    application inside the instances that receive the rebalance notification. For
    more information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html).

The following are some reasons why you might use a lifecycle hook:

- For graceful shutdown of Amazon SQS workers

- To complete deregistration from the Domain Name System (DNS)

- To pull system or application logs and upload them to Amazon Simple Storage Service
(Amazon S3)

3. Develop a custom action for the lifecycle hook. To invoke your custom action
    as soon as possible, you need to know when an instance is ready to be
    terminated. Find this out by detecting the lifecycle state of the instance.

- To invoke an action outside of the instance, write an EventBridge rule and
automate what action to take when an event pattern matches the rule.

- To invoke an action inside of the instance, configure the instance to
run a shutdown script and retrieve the lifecycle state through instance
metadata.

It's critical to design the custom action to finish in under two minutes. This
makes sure there's enough time to complete tasks before instance
termination.

After you complete these steps, you can begin using Capacity Rebalancing.

## Capacity Rebalancing behavior

With Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling behaves in the following way when an instance
receives a rebalance recommendation:

- When the new Spot Instance launches, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits until the new instance
passes its health check before it terminates the previous instance. When
replacing more than one instance, the termination of each previous instance
starts after the new instance has launched and passed its health check.

- Because Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch new instances before terminating previous
ones, being at or near the specified maximum capacity could impede or completely
halt rebalancing activities. To avoid this problem, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can temporarily
exceed the group's maximum size by up to 10 percent of the desired
capacity.

- If you didn't add a lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling starts
terminating the previous instances as soon as the new instances pass their
health check.

- If you added a lifecycle hook, this extends the amount of time it takes before
we start terminating the previous instances by the timeout value you specified
for the lifecycle hook.

- If you are using scaling policies or scheduled scaling, the scaling activities
run in parallel. If a scaling activity is in progress and your Auto Scaling group is
below its new desired capacity, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scales out first before terminating the
previous instances.

If there is no capacity for your instance types in one Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
keeps trying to launch Spot Instances in other enabled Availability Zones until it
succeeds.

In the worst case scenario, if new instances fail to launch or their health checks
fail, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling keeps trying to relaunch them. While it's trying to launch new instances,
your previous ones will eventually be interrupted and forcibly terminated with a
two-minute interruption notice.

## Considerations

Consider the following when using Capacity Rebalancing:

**Design your application to be tolerant to Spot**
**interruptions**

Your application should be able to handle dynamic changes in the number of
instances and the possibility of a Spot Instance being interrupted early.
For example, if your Auto Scaling group is behind an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
waits for the instance to deregister from the load balancer before calling
your lifecycle hook. If the time to deregister the instance and complete the
lifecycle action takes too long, the instance might be interrupted while
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for your lifecycle action to complete before terminating the
instance.

It's not always possible for Amazon EC2 to send the rebalance recommendation
signal before the two-minute Spot Instance interruption notice. Sometimes,
the rebalance recommendation signal arrives at the same time as the
two-minute interruption notice. When this happens, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling calls the
lifecycle hook and attempts to launch a new Spot Instance
immediately.

**Avoid an elevated risk of interruption of replacement**
**Spot Instances**

Your replacement Spot Instances might be at an elevated risk of
interruption if you use the `lowest-price` allocation strategy.
This is because we launch instances in the lowest priced pool that has
available capacity at that moment, even if your replacement Spot Instances
are likely to be interrupted soon after they launch. To avoid an elevated
risk of interruption, we strongly recommend that you do not use the
`lowest-price` allocation strategy. Instead, we recommend the
`price-capacity-optimized` allocation strategy. This strategy
launches replacement Spot Instances in Spot pools that are least likely to
be interrupted and have the lowest possible price. Therefore, they're less
likely to be interrupted in the near future.

**Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will only launch a new instance if availability**
**is the same or better**

One of the goals of Capacity Rebalancing is to improve a Spot Instance's
availability. If an existing Spot Instance receives a rebalance
recommendation, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will only launch a new instance if the new instance
provides the same or better availability than the existing instance. If the
risk of interruption of a new instance will be worse than the existing
instance, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will not launch a new instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will,
however, continue to assess the Spot capacity pools based on information
provided by the Amazon EC2 Spot service, and will launch a new instance if
availability improves.

There is a chance that your existing instance will be interrupted without
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling proactively launching a new instance. When this happens, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
attempts to launch a new instance as soon as it receives the Spot Instance
interruption notice. This happens regardless of whether the new instance has
a high risk of interruption.

**Capacity Rebalancing does not increase your Spot**
**Instance interruption rate**

When you enable Capacity Rebalancing, it does not increase your [Spot Instance\
interruption rate](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/spot-interruptions.md) (the number of Spot Instances that are
reclaimed when Amazon EC2 needs the capacity back). However, if Capacity
Rebalancing detects an instance is at risk of interruption, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will
immediately attempt to launch a new instance. Therefore, more instances
might be replaced than if you waited for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to launch a new instance
after the at-risk instance was interrupted.

While you might replace more instances with Capacity Rebalancing enabled,
you benefit from being proactive rather than reactive. This gives you more
time to take action before your instances are interrupted. With a [Spot Instance interruption notice](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/spot-instance-termination-notices.md), you typically only have up
to two minutes to gracefully shut down your instance. With Capacity
Rebalancing launching a new instance in advance, you give existing processes
a better chance of completing on your at-risk instance. You can also start
your instance shutdown procedures, prevent new work from being scheduled on
your at-risk instance, and prepare the newly launched instance to take over
the application. With proactive replacement in Capacity Rebalancing, you
benefit from graceful continuity.

The following theoretical example demonstrates the risks and benefits of
using Capacity Rebalancing:

- 2:00 PM – A rebalance recommendation is received for
instance A. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling immediately attempts to launch replacement
instance B, giving you time to start your shutdown
procedures.

- 2:30 PM – A rebalance recommendation is received for
instance B, which is replaced with instance C. This gives you time
to start your shutdown procedures.

- 2:32 PM – If Capacity Rebalancing isn’t enabled, and if a
Spot Instance interruption notice would've been received at 2:32 PM
for instance A, you would have had only two minutes to take action.
However, Instance A would have continued running until this
time.
