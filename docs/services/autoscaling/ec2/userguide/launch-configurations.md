# Auto Scaling launch configurations

###### Important

Limitations:

- As of **January 1, 2023**, new Amazon EC2 instance types are no longer supported in launch configurations. This includes support for any instance types added to an AWS Region after the initial Region launch.

- Accounts created on or after **June 1, 2023** cannot create new launch configurations using the console.

- Accounts created on or after **October 1, 2024** cannot create new launch configurations using any method (console, API, AWS CLI, or CloudFormation).

Migrate to launch templates to make sure that you don’t need to create new launch configurations now or in the future.
For information about migrating your Auto Scaling groups to launch templates, see
[Migrate your Auto Scaling groups to launch templates](migrate-to-launch-templates.md).

###### Note

You might be able to create a launch configuration with an instance type that is no longer supported in a Region. We recommend that you migrate to launch templates.

We provide information about launch configurations for customers who have not yet migrated from launch configurations to launch templates. A _launch configuration_ is an instance configuration template that an
Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. When you create a launch configuration, you specify
information for the instances. Include the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the
instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping. If
you've launched an EC2 instance before, you specified the same information in order to
launch the instance.

You can specify your launch configuration with multiple Auto Scaling groups. However, you can only
specify one launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group at a time, and you can't modify a launch
configuration after you've created it. To change the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group,
you must create a launch configuration and then update your Auto Scaling group with it.
