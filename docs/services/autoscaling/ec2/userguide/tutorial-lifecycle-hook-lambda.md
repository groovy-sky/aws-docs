# Tutorial: Configure a lifecycle hook that invokes a Lambda function

In this exercise, you create an Amazon EventBridge rule that includes a filter pattern that when
matched, invokes an AWS Lambda function as the rule target. We provide the filter pattern
and sample function code to use.

If everything is configured correctly, at the end of this tutorial, the Lambda function
performs a custom action when instances launch. The custom action simply logs the event
in the CloudWatch Logs log stream associated with the Lambda function.

The Lambda function also performs a callback to let the lifecycle of the instance
proceed if this action is successful, but lets the instance abandon the launch and
terminate if the action fails.

The following illustration summarizes the flow for a scale-out event when you use a
Lambda function to perform a custom action. After an instance launches, the lifecycle of
the instance is paused until the lifecycle hook is completed, either by timing out or by
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling receiving a signal to continue.

###### Note

Depending on your use case, you can configure a lifecycle hook by following the steps below and
creating an EventBridge rule. Or, you can use a Lambda function to configure a lifecycle hook directly
without creating an EventBridge rule.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, create an Auto Scaling group, if you don't have one
already. To create an Auto Scaling group, open the [Auto Scaling groups \
page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?) of the Amazon EC2
console and choose **Create Auto Scaling group**.

## Step 1: Create an IAM role with permissions to complete lifecycle actions

Before you create a Lambda function, you must first create an execution role and a
permissions policy to allow Lambda to complete lifecycle hooks.

###### To create the policy

1. Open the [Policies\
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) of the IAM console, and then choose **Create**
**policy**.

2. Choose the **JSON** tab.

3. In the **Policy Document** box, paste the following
    policy document into the box, replacing the text in _`italics`_ with your account
    number and the name of your Auto Scaling group.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "autoscaling:CompleteLifecycleAction"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:autoscaling:*:123456789012:autoScalingGroup:*:autoScalingGroupName/my-asg"
       }
     ]
}

```

4. Choose **Next**.

5. For **Policy name**, enter
    `LogAutoScalingEvent-policy`. Choose
    **Create policy**.

When you finish creating the policy, you can create a role that uses it.

###### To create the role

1. In the navigation pane on the left, choose
    **Roles**.

2. Choose **Create role**.

3. For **Select trusted entity**, choose **AWS**
**service**.

4. For your use case, choose **Lambda** and then choose
    **Next**.

5. Under **Add permissions**, choose the policy that you
    created ( **LogAutoScalingEvent-policy**) and the policy
    named **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole**. Then, choose
    **Next**.

###### Note

The **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** policy has the
permissions that the function needs to write logs to CloudWatch Logs.

6. On the **Name, review, and create** page, for
    **Role name**, enter
    `LogAutoScalingEvent-role` and choose
    **Create role**.

## Step 2: Create a Lambda function

Create a Lambda function to serve as the target for events. The sample Lambda
function, written in Node.js, is invoked by EventBridge when a matching event is emitted by
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

###### To create a Lambda function

01. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) on the Lambda console.

02. Choose **Create function**, **Author from**
    **scratch**.

03. Under **Basic information**, for **Function**
    **name**, enter
     `LogAutoScalingEvent`.

04. For **Runtime**, choose **Node.js**
    **18.x**.

05. Scroll down and choose **Change default execution role**,
     and then for **Execution role**, choose **Use an**
    **existing role**.

06. For **Existing role**, choose
     **LogAutoScalingEvent-role**.

07. Leave the other default values.

08. Choose **Create function**. You are returned to the
     function's code and configuration.

09. With your `LogAutoScalingEvent` function still open in the
     console, under **Code source**, in the editor, paste the
     following sample code into the file named index.mjs.

    ```javascript

    import { AutoScalingClient, CompleteLifecycleActionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-auto-scaling";
    export const handler = async(event) => {
      console.log('LogAutoScalingEvent');
      console.log('Received event:', JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
      var autoscaling = new AutoScalingClient({ region: event.region });
      var eventDetail = event.detail;
      var params = {
        AutoScalingGroupName: eventDetail['AutoScalingGroupName'], /* required */
        LifecycleActionResult: 'CONTINUE', /* required */
        LifecycleHookName: eventDetail['LifecycleHookName'], /* required */
        InstanceId: eventDetail['EC2InstanceId'],
        LifecycleActionToken: eventDetail['LifecycleActionToken']
      };
      var response;
      const command = new CompleteLifecycleActionCommand(params);
      try {
        var data = await autoscaling.send(command);
        console.log(data); // successful response
        response = {
          statusCode: 200,
          body: JSON.stringify('SUCCESS'),
        };
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err, err.stack); // an error occurred
        response = {
          statusCode: 500,
          body: JSON.stringify('ERROR'),
        };
      }
      return response;
    };
    ```

    This code simply logs the event so that, at the end of this tutorial, you
     can see an event appear in the CloudWatch Logs log stream that's associated with this
     Lambda function.

10. Choose **Deploy**.

## Step 3: Create an EventBridge rule

Create an EventBridge rule to run your Lambda function. For more information about using
EventBridge, see [Use EventBridge to handle Auto Scaling events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/automating-ec2-auto-scaling-with-eventbridge.html).

###### To create a rule using the console

1. Open the [EventBridge\
    console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Rules**.

3. Choose **Create rule**.

4. For **Define rule detail**, do the following:
1. For **Name**, enter
       `LogAutoScalingEvent-rule`.

2. For **Event bus**, choose
       **default**. When an AWS service in your
       account generates an event, it always goes to your account's default
       event bus.

3. For **Rule type**, choose **Rule with an**
      **event pattern**.

4. Choose **Next**.
5. For **Build event pattern**, do the following:
1. For **Event source**, choose **AWS**
      **events or EventBridge partner events**.

2. Scroll down to **Event pattern**, and do the
       following:

      1. For **Event source**, choose
                **AWS services**.

      2. For **AWS service**, choose
          **Auto Scaling**.

      3. For **Event type**, choose
          **Instance Launch and**
         **Terminate**.

      4. By default, the rule matches any scale-in or scale-out
          event. To create a rule that notifies you when there is a
          scale-out event and an instance is put into a wait state due
          to a lifecycle hook, choose **Specific instance**
         **event(s)** and select **EC2**
         **Instance-launch Lifecycle Action**.

      5. By default, the rule matches any Auto Scaling group in the Region.
          To make the rule match a specific Auto Scaling group, choose
          **Specific group name(s)** and select
          the group.

      6. Choose **Next**.
6. For **Select target(s)**, do the following:
1. For **Target types**, choose
       **AWS service**.

2. For **Select a target**, choose **Lambda**
      **function**.

3. For **Function**, choose
       **LogAutoScalingEvent**.

4. Choose **Next** twice.
7. On the **Review and create** page, choose
    **Create rule**.

## Step 4: Add a lifecycle hook

In this section, you add a lifecycle hook so that Lambda runs your function on
instances at launch.

###### To add a lifecycle hook

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups \
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?) of the Amazon EC2 console.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group. A split pane opens up in the
    bottom of the page.

3. In the lower pane, on the **Instance management** tab, in
    **Lifecycle hooks**, choose **Create lifecycle**
**hook**.

4. To define a lifecycle hook for scale out (instances launching), do the
    following:
1. For **Lifecycle hook name**, enter
       `LogAutoScalingEvent-hook`.

2. For **Lifecycle transition**, choose
       **Instance launch**.

3. For **Heartbeat timeout**, enter
       `300` for the number of seconds to wait for
       a callback from your Lambda function.

4. For **Default result**, choose
       **ABANDON**. This means that the Auto Scaling group
       will terminate a new instance if the hook times out without
       receiving a callback from your Lambda function.

5. (Optional) Leave **Notification metadata** empty.
       The event data that we pass to EventBridge contains all of the necessary
       information to invoke the Lambda function.
5. Choose **Create**.

## Step 5: Test and verify the event

To test the event, update the Auto Scaling group by increasing the desired capacity of the
Auto Scaling group by 1. Your Lambda function is invoked within a few seconds after
increasing the desired capacity.

###### To increase the size of the Auto Scaling group

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups \
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?) of the Amazon EC2 console.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group to view details in a lower
    pane and still see the top rows of the upper pane.

3. In the lower pane, on the **Details** tab, choose
    **Group details**, **Edit**.

4. For **Desired capacity**, increase the current value by
    1.

5. Choose **Update**. While the instance is being launched,
    the **Status** column in the upper pane displays a status
    of _Updating capacity_.

After increasing the desired capacity, you can verify that your Lambda function was
invoked.

###### To view the output from your Lambda function

1. Open the [Log groups\
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home) of the CloudWatch console.

2. Select the name of the log group for your Lambda function
    ( `/aws/lambda/LogAutoScalingEvent`).

3. Select the name of the log stream to view the data provided by the
    function for the lifecycle action.

Next, you can verify that your instance has successfully launched from the
description of scaling activities.

###### To view the scaling activity

1. Return to the **Auto Scaling groups** page and select your
    group.

2. On the **Activity** tab, under **Activity history**, the **Status** column shows whether your Auto Scaling group has successfully
    launched an instance.

- If the action was successful, the scaling activity will have a
status of "Successful".

- If it failed, after waiting a few minutes, you will see a scaling
activity with a status of "Cancelled" and a status message of
"Instance failed to complete user's Lifecycle Action: Lifecycle
Action with token e85eb647-4fe0-4909-b341-a6c42EXAMPLE was
abandoned: Lifecycle Action Completed with ABANDON Result".

###### To decrease the size of the Auto Scaling group

If you do not need the additional instance that you launched for this test,
you can open the **Details** tab and decrease **Desired capacity** by 1.

## Step 6: Clean up

If you are done working with the resources that you created just for this
tutorial, use the following steps to delete them.

###### To delete the lifecycle hook

1. Open the [Auto Scaling groups \
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?) of the Amazon EC2 console.

2. Select the check box next to your Auto Scaling group.

3. On the **Instance management** tab, in
    **Lifecycle hooks**, choose the lifecycle hook
    ( `LogAutoScalingEvent-hook`).

4. Choose **Actions**, **Delete**.

5. Choose **Delete** again to confirm.

###### To delete the Amazon EventBridge rule

1. Open the [Rules\
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home?) in the Amazon EventBridge console.

2. Under **Event bus**, choose the event bus that is
    associated with the rule ( `Default`).

3. Select the check box next to your rule
    ( `LogAutoScalingEvent-rule`).

4. Choose **Delete**.

5. When prompted for confirmation, type the name of the rule and then choose
    **Delete**.

    ( `/aws/lambda/LogAutoScalingEvent`).

3. Choose **Actions**, **Delete log**
**group(s)**.

4. In the **Delete log group(s)** dialog box, choose
    **Delete**.

###### To delete the execution role

1. Open the [Roles\
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) of the IAM console.

2. Select the function's role ( `LogAutoScalingEvent-role`).

3. Choose **Delete**.

4. When prompted for confirmation, type the name of the role and then choose
    **Delete**.

###### To delete the IAM policy

1. Open the [Policies\
    page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?) of the IAM console.

2. Select the policy that you created
    ( `LogAutoScalingEvent-policy`).

3. Choose **Actions**, **Delete**.

4. When prompted for confirmation, type the name of the policy and then
    choose **Delete**.
