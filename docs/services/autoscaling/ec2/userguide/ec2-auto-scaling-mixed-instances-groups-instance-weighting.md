# Configure an Auto Scaling group to use instance weights

When you use multiple instance types, you can specify how many units to associate with
each instance type, and then specify the capacity of your group with the same unit of
measurement. This capacity specification option is known as weights.

For example, let's say that you run a compute-intensive application that performs best
with at least 8 vCPUs and 15 GiB of RAM. If you use `c5.2xlarge` as your base
unit, any of the following EC2 instance types would meet your application needs.

Instance types exampleInstance typevCPUMemory (GiB)`c5.2xlarge` 8 16`c5.4xlarge`1632`c5.12xlarge`4896`c5.18xlarge`72144`c5.24xlarge`96192

By default, all instance types have equal weight regardless of size. In other words,
whether Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches a large or small instance type, each instance counts the same
toward the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group.

With weights, however, you assign a number value that specifies how many units to
associate with each instance type. For example, if the instances are of different sizes,
a `c5.2xlarge` instance could have the weight of 2, and a
`c5.4xlarge` (which is two times bigger) could have the weight of 4, and
so on. Then, when Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scales the group, these weights translate into the number of
units that each instance counts toward your desired capacity.

The weights do not change which instance types Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling chooses to launch; instead,
the allocation strategies do that. For more information, see [Allocation strategies for multiple instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/allocation-strategies.html).

###### Important

To configure an Auto Scaling group to fulfill its desired capacity using the number of
vCPUs or the amount of memory of each instance type, we recommend using
attribute-based instance type selection. Setting the
`DesiredCapacityType` parameter automatically specifies the number of
units to associate with each instance type based on the value that you set for this
parameter. For more information, see [Create mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type selection](create-mixed-instances-group-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.md).

## Considerations

This section discusses key considerations for effectively implementing
weights.

- Choose a few instance types that match your application's performance
needs. Decide the weight each instance type should count toward the desired
capacity of your Auto Scaling group based on its capabilities. These weights apply
to current and future instances.

- Avoid large ranges between weights. For example, don't specify a weight of
1 for an instance type when the next larger instance type has a weight of
200\. The difference between the smallest and largest weights shouldn't be
extreme, either. Extreme weight differences can negatively impact
cost-performance optimization.

- Specify the group's desired capacity in units, not instances. For example,
if you use vCPU-based weights, set your desired number of cores and also the
minimum and maximum.

- Set your weights and desired capacity so that the desired capacity is at
least two to three times larger than your largest weight.

Note the following when updating existing groups:

- When you add weights to an existing group, include weights for all
instance types currently in use.

- When you add or change weights, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will launch or terminate
instances to reach the desired capacity based on the new weight
values.

- If you remove an instance type, running instances of that type keep their
last weight, even if no longer defined.

## Instance weight behaviors

When you use instance weights, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling behaves in the following way:

- Current capacity will either be at the desired capacity or above it.
Current capacity can exceed the desired capacity if instances launched that
exceed the remaining desired capacity units. For example, suppose that you
specify two instance types, `c5.2xlarge` and
`c5.12xlarge`, and you assign instance weights of 2 for
`c5.2xlarge` and 12 for `c5.12xlarge`. If there
are five units remaining to fulfill the desired capacity, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
provisions a `c5.12xlarge`, the desired capacity is exceeded by
seven units.

- When launching instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling prioritizes distributing capacity
across Availability Zones and respecting allocation strategies over
exceeding the desired capacity.

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can exceed the maximum capacity limit to maintain balance across
Availability Zones, using your preferred allocation strategies. The hard
limit enforced by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is your desired capacity plus your largest
weight.
