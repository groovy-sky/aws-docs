# Instance maintenance policies

You can configure an instance maintenance policy for your Auto Scaling group to meet specific
capacity requirements during events that cause instances to be replaced, such as an instance
refresh or the health check process.

For example, suppose you have an Auto Scaling group that has a small number of instances. You want
to avoid the potential disruptions from terminating and then replacing an instance when
health checks indicate an impaired instance. With an instance maintenance policy, you can
make sure that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling first launches a new instance and then waits for it to be fully
ready before terminating the unhealthy instance.

An instance maintenance policy also helps you minimize any potential disruptions in cases
where multiple instances are replaced at the same time. You set the minimum and maximum
healthy percentage parameters for the policy, and your Auto Scaling group can only increase and
decrease capacity within that minimum-maximum range when replacing instances. A larger range
increases the number of instances that can be replaced at the same time.
