## Health check types

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can determine the health status of an `InService` instance by
using one or more of the following health checks:

Health check typeWhat it checks

Amazon EC2 status checks and scheduled events

- Checks that the instance is running.

- Checks for underlying hardware or software issues that
might impair the instance.

This is the default health check type for an Auto Scaling group.

Elastic Load Balancing health checks

- Checks whether the load balancer reports the instance
as healthy, confirming whether the instance is available
to handle requests.

To run this health check type, you must turn it on for your
Auto Scaling group.

VPC Lattice health checks

- Checks whether VPC Lattice reports the instance as
healthy, confirming whether the instance is available to
handle requests.

To run this health check type, you must turn it on for your
Auto Scaling group.

Amazon EBS health checks

- Checks whether EBS volumes are reachable and passing
I/O status checks.

To run this health check type, you must turn it on for your
Auto Scaling group.

Custom health checks

- Checks for any other problems that might indicate
instance health issues, according to your custom health
checks.

## Amazon EC2 health checks

After an instance launches, it's attached to the Auto Scaling group and enters the
`InService` state. For more information about the different lifecycle
states for instances in an Auto Scaling group, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-lifecycle.html).

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling periodically checks the health status of all instances within the Auto Scaling
group to make sure that they're running and in good condition.

###### Status checks

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the results of the Amazon EC2 instance status checks and system
status checks to determine the health status of an instance. If the instance is
in any Amazon EC2 state other than `running`, or if its status for the
status checks becomes `impaired`, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling considers the instance to
be unhealthy and replaces it. This includes when the instance has any of the
following states:

- `stopping`

- `stopped`

- `shutting-down`

- `terminated`

The Amazon EC2 status checks do not require any special configuration and are always
enabled. For more information, see [Types of status checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html#types-of-instance-status-checks) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

###### Important

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lets the status checks fail occasionally, without taking any action.
When a status check fails, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits a few minutes for AWS to fix the
issue. It does not immediately mark an instance `Unhealthy` when its
status for the status checks becomes `impaired`. Additionally, EC2 Auto Scaling
doesn't mark the instance as `Unhealthy` if a status check returns `insufficient-data`.

However, if Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects that an instance is no longer in the
`running` state, this situation is treated as an immediate
failure. In this case, it immediately marks the instance as
`Unhealthy` and replaces it.

###### Scheduled events

Amazon EC2 can occasionally schedule events on your instances to be run after a
particular timestamp. For more information, see [Scheduled\
events for your instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/monitoring-instances-status-check-sched.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

If one of your instances is affected by a scheduled event, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling considers the
instance to be unhealthy and replaces it. The instance doesn't start shutting down
until the date and time that's specified in the timestamp is reached.

## Elastic Load Balancing health checks

When you turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks for your Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can use the
results of those health checks to determine the health status of an instance.

Before you can turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks for your Auto Scaling group, you must configure
an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer and configure a health check for it to determine if your
instances are healthy. For more information, see [Prepare to attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/getting-started-elastic-load-balancing.html).

After you attach the load balancer to your Auto Scaling group, the following occurs:

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling registers the instances in the Auto Scaling group with the load
balancer.

- After an instance finishes registering, it enters the
`InService` state and becomes available for use with the load
balancer.

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ignores the results of the Elastic Load Balancing health checks. After you
turn on these health checks for your Auto Scaling group, when Elastic Load Balancing reports a registered
instance as
`Unhealthy`,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling marks the instance `Unhealthy` on its next periodic health check
and replaces it.

If connection draining (deregistration delay) is enabled for your load balancer,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for either in-flight requests to complete or the maximum timeout to
expire before it terminates unhealthy instances.

###### Note

For instructions for how to attach the load balancer and turn on Elastic Load Balancing health
checks for your Auto Scaling group, see [Attach an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-load-balancer-asg.html).

When you turn on Elastic Load Balancing health checks for a group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can replace
instances that Elastic Load Balancing reports as unhealthy, but only after the load balancer is
in the `InService` state. For more information, see [Verify the attachment status of your load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/load-balancer-status.html).

## VPC Lattice health checks

By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ignores the results of the VPC Lattice health checks. You can
optionally turn on these health checks for your Auto Scaling group. After you do this, when
VPC Lattice reports a registered instance as `Unhealthy`, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling marks the
instance `Unhealthy` on its next periodic health check and replaces it.
The process of registering instances and then checking their health is the same as
how Elastic Load Balancing health checks work.

###### Note

For instructions for how to attach the VPC Lattice target group and turn on
VPC Lattice health checks for your Auto Scaling group, see [Attach a VPC Lattice target group to your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/attach-vpc-lattice-target-group-asg.html).

When you turn on VPC Lattice health checks for a group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can replace
instances that VPC Lattice reports as unhealthy, but only after the target group is
in the `InService` state. For more information, see [Verify the attachment status of your VPC Lattice target group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/verify-target-group-attachment-status.html).

## How Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling minimizes downtime

By default, new instances are provisioned at the same time your existing instances
are terminated, which might prevent new requests from being accepted until the new
instances are fully operational.

If Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling determines that any instances are no longer running (or they were
marked `Unhealthy` with the [set-instance-health](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/set-instance-health.html) command), it immediately replaces them. However, if
other instances are found to be unhealthy, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the following approach to
recover from failures. This approach minimizes any downtime that might occur because
of temporary issues or misconfigured health checks.

- If a scaling activity is in progress and your Auto Scaling group is less than its
desired capacity by 10 percent or more, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the in-progress
scaling activity before replacing the unhealthy instances.

- When scaling out, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the instances to pass an initial
health check. It also waits for the default instance warmup to finish to
make sure that the new instances are ready.

- After the instances finish warming up and the group has risen to more than
90 percent of its desired capacity, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling replaces the unhealthy
instances as follows:

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling only replaces up to 10 percent of the group's desired
capacity at a time. It does this until all of the unhealthy
instances are replaced.

- When replacing instances, it waits for the new instances to pass
an initial health check. It also waits for the default instance
warmup to finish before continuing.

###### Note

- If the size of an Auto Scaling group is small enough that the resulting value of 10
percent is less than one, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling instead replaces the unhealthy instances one
at a time. This might result in some downtime for the group.

- You can modify the default 10 percent value by [setting an instance \
maintenance policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/set-instance-maintenance-policy-on-group.html) to change the rate at which Auto Scaling replaces unhealthy instances.
However, Auto Scaling might still throttle the rate it marks instances as unhealthy.

For example, if all instances in an Auto Scaling group are reported unhealthy by Elastic Load Balancing health
checks and the load balancer is in the `InService` state, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
might mark fewer instances unhealthy at a time. This can result in much fewer
instances replaced at a time than the 10 percent applied in other scenarios.
This provides you with time to fix the problem without Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically
terminating the entire group.

## Health checks for instances in a warm pool

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also performs health checks on instances in a warm pool. For more
information, see [View health check status and the reason for health check failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/warm-pools-health-checks-monitor-view-status.html).

## Health check considerations

The following are considerations when using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling health checks.

- If you need something to happen on the instance that is terminating, or on
the instance that is starting up, you can use lifecycle hooks. These hooks
let you perform a custom action as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches or terminates
instances. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html).

- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not provide a way of removing the Amazon EC2 status checks and
scheduled events from its health checks. If you do not want instances to be
replaced, we recommend that you suspend the `ReplaceUnhealthy`
and `HealthCheck` process for individual Auto Scaling groups. For more
information, see [Suspend and resume Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling processes](as-suspend-resume-processes.md).

- To manually set an unhealthy instance's health status back to
`Healthy`, you can try to use the [set-instance-health](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/set-instance-health.html) command. If you get an error, this is
probably because the instance is already terminating. Generally, setting an
instance's health status back to `Healthy` with the [set-instance-health](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/autoscaling/set-instance-health.html) command is only useful in cases where
either the `ReplaceUnhealthy` process or the
`Terminate` process is suspended.

- If you need to troubleshoot an instance without interference from health
checks, you can put the instance in `Standby` state. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
does not perform health checks on instances that are in the
`Standby` state until you put the instances back in service.
For more information, see [Temporarily remove instances from your Auto Scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-enter-exit-standby.html).

- When your instance is terminated, any associated Elastic IP addresses are
disassociated and are not automatically associated with the new instance.
You must manually associate the Elastic IP addresses with the new instance,
or do it automatically with a lifecycle hook-based solution. For more
information, see [Elastic IP addresses](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.md) in the
_Amazon EC2 User Guide_.

- Similarly, when your instance is terminated, its attached EBS volumes are
detached (or deleted depending on the volume's
`DeleteOnTermination` attribute). You must manually attach
these EBS volumes to the new instance, or do it automatically with a
lifecycle hook-based solution. For more information, see [Attach an Amazon EBS\
volume to an instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-attaching-volume.html) in the _Amazon EBS User_
_Guide_.
