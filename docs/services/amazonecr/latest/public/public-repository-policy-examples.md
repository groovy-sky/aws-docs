# Public repository policy examples in Amazon ECR Public

The following examples show policy statements that you use to control the permissions
that users have to your public repositories.

###### Note

All public repositories are visible on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. Using a repository
policy to deny access to view or pull from a public repository is not supported.

###### Important

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
`ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken` and `sts:GetServiceBearerToken` API through an IAM policy before they
can authenticate to a registry and push any images to an Amazon ECR
repository.

## Example: Allow an IAM user within your account

The following repository policy allows users within your account to push
images.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPush",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/push-pull-user-1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/push-pull-user-2"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "ecr-public:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr-public:PutImage",
                "ecr-public:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr-public:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr-public:CompleteLayerUpload"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Allow another account

The following repository policy allows a specific account to push images.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCrossAccountPush",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
            },
            "Action": [
                "ecr-public:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr-public:PutImage",
                "ecr-public:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr-public:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr-public:CompleteLayerUpload"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```
