# Pushing a multi-architecture image to a public repository in Amazon ECR public

Amazon ECR Public supports creating and pushing Docker manifest lists which are used for
multi-architecture images. A _manifest list_ is a list of images that
is created by specifying one or more image names. Typically the manifest list is created
from images that serve the same function but for different operating systems or
architectures, but this is not required. For more information, see [docker\
manifest](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest).

###### Important

Your Docker CLI must have experimental features enabled to use this feature. For
more information, see [Experimental features](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli).

A manifest list can be pulled or referenced in an Amazon ECS task definition or Amazon EKS pod
spec like other Amazon ECR Public images.

The following steps can be used to create and push a Docker manifest list to an Amazon ECR
public repository. You must already have the images pushed to your public repository to
reference in the Docker manifest. For information on pushing an image, see [Pushing an image to a public repository in Amazon ECR public](docker-push-ecr-image.md).

###### To push a multi-architecture Docker image to an Amazon ECR public repository

1. Authenticate your Docker client to the Amazon ECR public registry to which you
    intend to push your image. Authentication tokens are valid for 12 hours. For
    more information, see [Registry authentication in Amazon ECR public](public-registry-auth.md).

2. List the images in your public repository, confirming the image tags.

```nohighlight

aws ecr-public describe-images \
        --repository-name my-web-app
        --region us-east-1
```

3. Create the Docker manifest list. The `manifest create` command
    verifies that the referenced images are already in your public repository and
    creates the manifest locally.

```nohighlight

docker manifest create public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/my-web-app public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/my-web-app:image_one_tag public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/my-web-app:image_two
```

4. (Optional) Inspect the Docker manifest list. This enables you to confirm the
    size and digest for each image manifest referenced in the manifest list.

```nohighlight

docker manifest inspect public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/my-web-app
```

5. Push the Docker manifest list to your Amazon ECR public repository.

```nohighlight

docker manifest push public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/my-web-app
```
