# Setting a repository policy statement in Amazon ECR Public

You can add an access policy statement to a public repository in the AWS Management Console by
following these steps. You can add multiple policy statements per public repository. For
example policies, see [Public repository policy examples in Amazon ECR Public](public-repository-policy-examples.md).

###### Important

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
`ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken` and `sts:GetServiceBearerToken` API through an IAM policy before they
can authenticate to a registry and push any images to an Amazon ECR
repository.

###### To set a repository policy statement

01. Open the Amazon ECR console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

02. From the navigation bar, choose the AWS Region that contains the repository
     to set a policy statement on.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Repositories**.

04. On the **Repositories** page, select the
     **Public** tab, and then choose the repository to set a
     policy statement on.

05. In the navigation pane, choose **Permissions**,
     **Edit**.

06. On the **Edit permissions** page, choose **Add**
    **statement**.

07. For **Statement name**, enter a name for the
     statement.

08. For **Effect**, choose whether the policy statement results
     in an allow or an explicit deny.

    ###### Note

    All public repositories are visible on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. Using a repository
    policy to deny access to view or pull from a public repository is not supported.

09. For **Principal**, choose the scope to apply the policy
     statement to. For more information, see [AWS JSON\
     Policy Elements: Principal](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-elements-principal.md) in the
     _IAM User Guide_.

- You can apply the statement to all authenticated AWS users by
selecting the **Everyone (\*)** check box.

- For **Service principal**, specify the service
principal name (for example, `ecs.amazonaws.com`) to apply
the statement to a specific service.

- For **AWS Account IDs**, specify an AWS account
number (for example, `111122223333`) to apply the
statement to all users under a specific AWS account. Multiple accounts
can be specified by using a comma-separated list.

- For **IAM Entities**, select the roles or users
under your AWS account to apply the statement to.

###### Note

For more complicated repository policies that are not
currently supported in the AWS Management Console, you can apply the policy with the [**set-repository-policy**](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/set-repository-policy.md) AWS CLI command.

10. For **Actions**, choose the scope of the Amazon ECR API operations
     that the policy statement applies to from the list of individual API
     operations.

11. When you're finished, choose **Save** to set the
     policy.

12. Repeat the previous step for each repository policy to add.
