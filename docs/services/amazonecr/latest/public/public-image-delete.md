# Deleting an image in a public repository in Amazon ECR public

If you are done using an image, you can delete it from your public repository. You can
delete an image using the AWS Management Console, or the AWS CLI.

###### Note

If you are done with a public repository, you can delete the entire repository and
all of the images within it. For more information, see [Deleting a public repository policy statement Amazon ECR public](public-repository-delete.md).

###### To delete a public image with the AWS Management Console

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the image to
    delete.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Repositories**.

4. On the **Repositories** page, select the
    **Public** tab and then select the repository containing
    the image to delete.

5. On the **Repositories:**
**`repository_name`** page, select the box
    to the left of the image to delete and choose
    **Delete**.

6. In the **Delete image(s)** dialog box, verify that the
    selected images should be deleted and choose **Delete**.

###### To delete a public image with the AWS CLI

1. List the image tags in your repository.

```nohighlight

aws ecr-public describe-image-tags \
         --repository-name my-repo \
         --region us-east-1
```

2. (Optional) Delete any unwanted tags for the image by specifying the tag of the
    image you want to delete.

###### Note

When you delete the last tag for an image, the image is deleted.

```nohighlight

aws ecr-public batch-delete-image \
         --repository-name my-repo \
         --image-ids imageTag=latest \
         --region us-east-1
```

3. Delete the image by specifying the digest of the image to delete.

###### Note

When you delete an image by referencing its digest, the image and all of
its tags are deleted.

```nohighlight

aws ecr-public batch-delete-image \
         --repository-name my-repo \
         --image-ids imageDigest=sha256:4f70ef7a4d29e8c0c302b13e25962d8f7a0bd304c7c2c1a9d6fa3e9de6bf552d
         --region us-east-1
```
