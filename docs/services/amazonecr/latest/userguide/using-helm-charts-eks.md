# Installing a Helm chart on an Amazon EKS cluster

Helm charts hosted in Amazon ECR can be installed on your Amazon EKS clusters.

**Prerequisites**

- Install the latest version of the Helm client. These steps were written using
Helm version `3.9.0`. For more information, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).

- You have at least version `1.23.9` or `2.6.3` of the
AWS CLI installed on your computer. For more information, see [Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](../../../cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.md).

- You have pushed a Helm chart to your Amazon ECR repository. For more information,
see [Pushing a Helm chart to an Amazon ECR private repository](push-oci-artifact.md).

- You have configured `kubectl` to work with Amazon EKS. For more
information, see [Create a\
`kubeconfig` for Amazon EKS](../../../eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.md) in the
_Amazon EKS User Guide_. If the following commands succeeds
for your cluster, you're properly configured.

```nohighlight

kubectl get svc
```

###### To install a Helm chart on an Amazon EKS cluster

1. Authenticate your Helm client to the Amazon ECR registry that your Helm chart is
    hosted. Authentication tokens must be obtained for each registry used, and the
    tokens are valid for 12 hours. For more information, see [Private registry authentication in Amazon ECR](registry-auth.md).

```nohighlight

aws ecr get-login-password \
        --region us-west-2 | helm registry login \
        --username AWS \
        --password-stdin aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
```

2. Install the chart. Replace `helm-test-chart` with
    your repository and `0.1.0` with your Helm chart's
    tag.

```nohighlight

helm install ecr-chart-demo oci://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/helm-test-chart --version 0.1.0
```

The output should look similar to this:

```
NAME: ecr-chart-demo
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue May 31 17:38:56 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

3. Verify the chart installation.

```nohighlight

helm list -n default
```

Example output:

```
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
ecr-chart-demo  default         1               2022-06-01 15:56:40.128669157 +0000 UTC deployed        helm-test-chart-0.1.0   1.16.0
```

4. (Optional) See the installed Helm chart `ConfigMap`.

```nohighlight

kubectl describe configmap helm-test-chart-configmap
```

5. When you are finished, you can remove the chart release from your
    cluster.

```nohighlight

helm uninstall ecr-chart-demo
```
