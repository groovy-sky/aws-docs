# Amazon ECR service-linked role for repository creation templates

Amazon ECR uses a service-linked role named
**AWSServiceRoleForECRTemplate** which gives permission for Amazon ECR
to perform actions on your behalf to complete repository creation template actions.

## Service-linked role permissions for Amazon ECR

The **AWSServiceRoleForECRTemplate** service-linked role trusts
the following service to assume the role.

- `ecr.amazonaws.com`

**Permissions details**

The `ECRTemplateServiceRolePolicy` permissions policy is
attached to the service-linked role. This managed policy grants Amazon ECR
permission to perform repository creation actions on your behalf.

The `ECRTemplateServiceRolePolicy` policy contains the
following JSON.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
	    "Sid": "CreateRepositoryWithTemplate",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:CreateRepository"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity (for example a user,
group, or role) to create, edit, or delete a service-linked role. For more
information, see [Service-linked role permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Creating a service-linked role for Amazon ECR

You don't need to manually create the Amazon ECR service-linked role for
repository creation template. When you create a repository creation template rule
for your private registry in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API,
Amazon ECR creates the service-linked role for you.

If you delete this service-linked role and need to create it again, you can use
the same process to recreate the role in your account. When you create a repository
creation rule for your private registry, Amazon ECR creates the service-linked
role for you again if it doesn't already exist.

## Editing a service-linked role for Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR doesn't allow manually editing the
**AWSServiceRoleForECRTemplate** service-linked role. After the
service-linked role is created, you can't change the name of the role because
various entities might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of
the role using IAM. For more information, see [Editing a service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## Deleting the service-linked role for Amazon ECR

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked
role, we recommend that you delete that role. That way, you don’t have an unused
entity that isn't actively monitored or maintained. However, you must delete the
repository creation rules for your registry in every Region before you can manually
delete the service-linked role.

###### Note

If you try to delete resources while the Amazon ECR service is still using
the role, your delete action might fail. If that happens, wait for a few minutes
and try again.

###### To delete Amazon ECR resources used by the **AWSServiceRoleForECRTemplate** service-linked role

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region where your repository creation
    rules are created.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Private**
**registry**.

4. On the **Private registry** page, on the
    **Repository creation templates** section, choose
    **Edit**.

5. For each repository creation rule you have created, select the rule and
    then choose **Delete rule**.

**To manually delete the service-linked role using**
**IAM**

Use the IAM console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API to delete the
**AWSServiceRoleForECRTemplate** service-linked role. For more
information, see [Deleting a Service-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the
_IAM User Guide_.
