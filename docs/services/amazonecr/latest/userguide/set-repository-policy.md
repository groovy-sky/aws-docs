# Setting a private repository policy statement in Amazon ECR

You can add an access policy statement to a repository in the AWS Management Console by following
the steps below. You can add multiple policy statements per repository. For example
policies, see [Private repository policy examples in Amazon ECR](repository-policy-examples.md).

###### Important

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
`ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` API through an IAM policy before they
can authenticate to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR
repository. Amazon ECR provides several managed IAM policies to control user access at
varying levels. For more information, see [Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy examples](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md).

###### To set a repository policy statement

01. Open the Amazon ECR console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

02. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository to set
     a policy statement on.

03. In the navigation pane, choose **Repositories**.

04. On the **Repositories** page, choose the repository to set a
     policy statement on to view the contents of the repository.

05. From the repository image list view, in the navigation pane, choose
     **Permissions**, **Edit**.

    ###### Note

    If you don't see the **Permissions** option in the
    navigation pane, ensure that you are in the repository image list
    view.

06. On the **Edit permissions** page, choose **Add**
    **statement**.

07. For **Statement name**, enter a name for the
     statement.

08. For **Effect**, choose whether the policy statement will
     result in an allow or an explicit deny.

09. For **Principal**, choose the scope to apply the policy
     statement to. For more information, see [AWS JSON\
     Policy Elements: Principal](../../../iam/latest/userguide/reference-policies-elements-principal.md) in the
     _IAM User Guide_.

- You can apply the statement to all authenticated AWS users by
selecting the **Everyone (\*)** check box.

- For **Service principal**, specify the service
principal name (for example, `ecs.amazonaws.com`) to apply
the statement to a specific service.

- For **AWS Account IDs**, specify an AWS account
number (for example, `111122223333`) to apply the
statement to all users under a specific AWS account. Multiple accounts
can be specified by using a comma delimited list.

###### Important

The account you are granting permissions to must have the Region
you are creating the repository policy in enabled, otherwise an
error will occur.

- For **IAM Entities**, select the roles or users
under your AWS account to apply the statement to.

###### Note

For more complicated repository policies that are not
currently supported in the AWS Management Console, you can apply the policy with the [**set-repository-policy**](../../../cli/latest/reference/ecr/set-repository-policy.md) AWS CLI command.

10. For **Actions**, choose the scope of the Amazon ECR API operations
     that the policy statement should apply to from the list of individual API
     operations.

11. When you are finished, choose **Save** to set the
     policy.

12. Repeat the previous step for each repository policy to add.
