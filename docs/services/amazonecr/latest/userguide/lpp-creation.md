# Creating a lifecycle policy preview in Amazon ECR

You can use a lifecycle policy preview to see the impact of a lifecycle policy on an
image repository before you apply it. It is considered best practice to do a preview
before applying a lifecycle policy to a repository.

###### Note

If you are using Amazon ECR replication to make copies of a repository across different
Regions or accounts, note that a lifecycle policy can only take an action on
repositories in the Region it was created in. Therefore, if you have replication
turned on you may want to create a lifecycle policy in each Region and account you
are replicating your repositories to.

###### To create a lifecycle policy preview (AWS Management Console)

01. Open the Amazon ECR console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

02. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the repository on
     which to perform a lifecycle policy preview.

03. In the navigation pane, under **Private registry**, choose
     **Repositories**.

04. On the **Private repositories** page, select a repository and
     that use the **Actions** drop down to choose
     **Lifecycle policies**.

05. On the lifecycle policy rules page for the repository, choose **Edit**
    **test rules**, **Create rule**.

06. Specify the following details for each test lifecycle policy rule.
    1. For **Rule priority**, type a number for the rule
        priority. The rule priority determines in what order the lifecycle
        policy rules are applied. A lower number means higher priority. For
        example, a rule with priority 1 takes precedence over a rule with
        priority 2.

    2. For **Rule description**, type a description for the
        lifecycle policy rule.

    3. For **Image status**, choose **Tagged**
       **(wildcard matching)**, **Tagged (prefix**
       **matching)**, **Untagged**, or
        **Any**.

       ###### Important

       If you specify multiple tags, only the images with all specified
       tags are selected.

    4. If you chose **Tagged (wildcard matching)** for
        **Image status**, then for **Specify tags**
       **for wildcard matching**, you can specify a list of image
        tags with a wildcard ( **\***) on which to take action
        with your lifecycle policy. For example, if your images are tagged as
        `prod`, `prod1`, `prod2`, and so
        on, you would specify `prod*` to take action on all of them.
        If you specify multiple tags, only the images with all specified tags
        are selected.

       ###### Important

       There is a maximum limit of four wildcards ( `*`) per
       string. For example, `["*test*1*2*3", "test*1*2*3*"]` is
       valid but `["test*1*2*3*4*5*6"]` is invalid.

    5. If you chose **Tagged (prefix matching)** for
        **Image status**, then for **Specify tags**
       **for prefix matching**, you can specify a list of image tags
        on which to take action with your lifecycle policy.

    6. For **Match criteria**, choose **Days since image created**, **Days since last recorded pull time**, **Days since image archived**, or **Image count** and then specify a value.

    7. For **Rule action**, choose either **Expire** or **Archive**.

    8. Choose **Save**.
07. Create additional test lifecycle policy rules by repeating steps 5–7.

08. To run the lifecycle policy preview, choose **Save and run**
    **test**.

09. Under **Image matches for test lifecycle rules**, review the
     impact of your lifecycle policy preview.

10. If you are satisfied with the preview results, choose **Apply as**
    **lifecycle policy** to create a lifecycle policy with the specified
     rules. You should expect that after applying a lifecycle policy, the affected
     images are expired or archived within 24 hours.

11. If you aren't satisfied with the preview results, you may delete one or more
     test lifecycle rules and create one or more rules to replace them and then
     repeat the test.
