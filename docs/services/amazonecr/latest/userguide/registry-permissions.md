# Private registry permissions in Amazon ECR

Amazon ECR uses a **registry policy** to grant permissions to an AWS
principal at the private registry level.

The scope is set by choosing the registry policy version. There are two versions with
different registry policy scope: version 1 (V1) and version 2 (V2). V2 is the expanded
registry policy scope that includes all ECR permissions. For the full list of API
actions, see the _[Amazon ECR API Guide](../../../../reference/amazonecr/latest/apireference/welcome.md)_.
The V2 version is the default registry policy scope. For more information about viewing
or setting your registry policy scope, see [Switching to the extended registry policy scope](registry-permissions-account-settings.md). For information about
general settings for your Amazon ECR private registry, see [Private registry settings in Amazon ECR](registry-settings.md).

The versions are detailed as follows.

- **V1** – For version 1, Amazon ECR only
enforces the following permissions at the private registry level.

- `ecr:ReplicateImage` – Grants permission to another
account, referred to as the source registry, to replicate its images to
your registry. This is only used for cross-account replication.

- `ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage` – Grants permission
to retrieve the external image and import it to your private registry.

- `ecr:CreateRepository` – Grants permission to create
a repository in a private registry. This permission is required if the
repository storing either the replicated or cached images doesn't
already exist in the private registry.

- **V2** – For version 2, Amazon ECR allows all
ECR actions in the policy and enforces the registry policy in all ECR requests.

You can use the console or the CLI to view or change your registry policy
scope.

###### Note

While it is possible to add the `ecr:*` action to a private registry
policy, it is considered best practice to only add the specific actions required
based on the feature you're using rather than use a wildcard.
