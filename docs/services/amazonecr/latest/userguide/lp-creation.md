# Creating a lifecycle policy for a repository in Amazon ECR

Use a lifecycle policy to create a set of rules that expire or archive unused repository images.
After creating a lifecycle policy, the affected images are expired or archived within 24
hours.

###### Note

If you are using Amazon ECR replication to make copies of a repository across different
Regions or accounts, note that a lifecycle policy can only take an action on
repositories in the Region it was created in. Therefore, if you have replication
turned on you may want to create a lifecycle policy in each Region and account you
are replicating your repositories to.

## Prerequisite

**Best practice:** Create a lifecycle policy preview to
verify that the images expired or archived by your lifecycle policy rules are what you intend. For
instructions, see [Creating a lifecycle policy preview in Amazon ECR](lpp-creation.md).

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region that contains the
    repository for which to create a lifecycle policy.

3. In the navigation pane, under **Private registry**,
    choose **Repositories**.

4. On the **Private repositories** page, select a
    repository and that use the **Actions** drop down to
    choose **Lifecycle policies**.

5. On the lifecycle policy rules page for the repository, choose
    **Create rule**.

6. Enter the following details for your lifecycle policy rule.
1. For **Rule priority**, type a number for the
       rule priority. The rule priority determines in what order the
       lifecycle policy rules are applied. A lower rule priority number
       means higher priority. For example, a rule with priority 1 takes
       precedence over a rule with priority 2.

2. For **Rule description**, type a description
       for the lifecycle policy rule.

3. For **Image status**, choose **Tagged**
      **(wildcard matching)**, **Tagged (prefix**
      **matching)**, **Untagged**, or
       **Any**.

      ###### Important

      If you specify multiple tags, only the images with all specified
      tags are selected.

4. If you chose **Tagged (wildcard matching)**
       for **Image status**, then for
       **Specify tags for wildcard matching**, you
       can specify a list of image tags with a wildcard
       ( **\***) on which to take action with your
       lifecycle policy. For example, if your images are tagged as
       `prod`, `prod1`, `prod2`,
       and so on, you would specify `prod*` to take action
       on all of them. If you specify multiple tags, only the images
       with all specified tags are selected.

      ###### Important

      There is a maximum limit of four wildcards
      ( `*`) per string. For example,
      `["*test*1*2*3", "test*1*2*3*"]` is valid but
      `["test*1*2*3*4*5*6"]` is invalid.

5. If you chose **Tagged (prefix matching)** for
       **Image status**, then for
       **Specify tags for prefix matching**, you
       can specify a list of image tags on which to take action with
       your lifecycle policy.

6. For **Match criteria**, choose **Days since image created**, **Days since last recorded pull time**, **Days since image archived**, or **Image count** and then specify a value.

7. For **Rule action**, choose either **Expire** or **Archive**.

8. Choose **Save**.
7. Create additional lifecycle policy rules by repeating steps
    5–7.

1. Obtain the name of the repository for which to create the lifecycle
    policy.

```nohighlight

aws ecr describe-repositories
```

2. Create a local file named `policy.json` with the contents
    of the lifecycle policy. For lifecycle policy examples, see [Examples of lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR](lifecycle-policy-examples.md).

3. Create a lifecycle policy by specifying the repository name and
    reference the lifecycle policy JSON file you created.

```nohighlight

aws ecr put-lifecycle-policy \
         --repository-name repository-name \
         --lifecycle-policy-text file://policy.json
```
