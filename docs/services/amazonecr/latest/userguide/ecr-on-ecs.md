# Using Amazon ECR images with Amazon ECS

You can use your Amazon ECR private repositories to host container images and artifacts that
your Amazon ECS tasks may pull from. For this to work, the Amazon ECS, or Fargate, container agent
must have permissions to make the `ecr:BatchGetImage`,
`ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`, and `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`
APIs.

## Required IAM permissions

The following table shows the IAM role to use, for each launch type, that provides
the required permissions for your tasks to pull from an Amazon ECR private repository. Amazon ECS
provides managed IAM policies that include the required permissions.

Launch typeIAM roleAWS managed IAM policyAmazon ECS on Amazon EC2 instances

Use the container instance IAM role, which is associated with
the Amazon EC2 instance registered to your Amazon ECS cluster. For more
information, see [Container instance IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_

Amazon ECS on Fargate

Use the task execution IAM role that you reference in your Amazon ECS
task definition. For more information, see [Task execution IAM role](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/task-execution-iam-role.md) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

`AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`

For more information, see [AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy) in
the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

Amazon ECS on external instances

Use the container instance IAM role, which is associated with
the on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) registered to your
Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see [Container instance Amazon ECS role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html) in the
_Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

`AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role`

For more information, see [AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role)
in the _Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide_.

###### Important

The AWS managed IAM policies contain additional permissions that you may not
require for your use. In this case, these are the minimum required permissions to
pull from an Amazon ECR private repository.

    ]
}

## Specifying an Amazon ECR image in an Amazon ECS task definition

When creating an Amazon ECS task definition, you can specify a container image hosted in an
Amazon ECR private repository. In the task definition, ensure that you use the full
`registry/repository:tag` naming for your Amazon ECR images. For example,
`aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com` `/my-repository:latest`.

The following task definition snippet shows the syntax you would use to specify a
container image hosted in Amazon ECR in your Amazon ECS task definition.

```JSON

{
    "family": "task-definition-name",
    ...
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "container-name",
            "image": "aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-repository:latest",
            ...
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```
