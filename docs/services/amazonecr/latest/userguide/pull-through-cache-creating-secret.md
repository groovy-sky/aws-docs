# Storing your upstream repository credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret

When creating a pull through cache rule for an upstream repository that requires
authentication, you must store the credentials in a Secrets Manager secret. There may be a
cost for using an Secrets Manager secret. For more information, see [AWS Secrets Manager pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/pricing).

The following procedures walk you through how to create an Secrets Manager secret for each
supported upstream repository. You can optionally use the create pull through cache
rule workflow in the Amazon ECR console to create the secret instead of creating the
secret using the Secrets Manager console. For more information, see [Creating a pull through cache rule in Amazon ECR](pull-through-cache-creating-rule.md).

Docker Hub

###### To create a Secrets Manager secret for your Docker Hub credentials (AWS Management Console)

1. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager).

2. Choose **Store a new secret**.

3. On the **Choose secret type** page, do the
    following.
1. For **Secret type**, choose
       **Other type of secret**.

2. In **Key/value pairs**, create two
       rows for your Docker Hub credentials. You can store up
       to 65536 bytes in the secret.
      1. For the first key/value pair, specify
          `username` as the key and your Docker
          Hub username as the value.

      2. For the second key/value pair, specify
          `accessToken` as the key and your Docker Hub
          access token as the value. For more information on
          creating a Docker Hub access token, see [Create and manage access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens) in the
          Docker documentation.
3. For **Encryption key**, keep the
       default **aws/secretsmanager**
       AWS KMS key value and then choose
       **Next**. There is no cost for
       using this key. For more information, see [Secret encryption and decryption in Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/security-encryption.md)
       in the _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

      ###### Important

      You must use the default
      `aws/secretsmanager` encryption key to
      encrypt your secret. Amazon ECR doesn't support using a
      customer managed key (CMK) for this.
4. On the **Configure secret** page, do the
    following.
1. Enter a descriptive **Secret name**
       and **Description**. Secret names must
       contain 1-512 Unicode characters and be prefixed with
       `ecr-pullthroughcache/`.

      ###### Important

      The Amazon ECR AWS Management Console only displays Secrets Manager secrets
      with names using the
      `ecr-pullthroughcache/` prefix.

2. (Optional) In the **Tags** section,
       add tags to your secret. For tagging strategies, see
       [Tag Secrets Manager secrets](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/managing-secrets-tagging.md) in the
       _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_. Don't store
       sensitive information in tags because they aren't
       encrypted.

3. (Optional) In **Resource**
      **permissions**, to add a resource policy to
       your secret, choose **Edit**
      **permissions**. For more information, see
       [Attach a permissions policy to an Secrets Manager\
       secret](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-resource-policies.md) in the
       _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

4. (Optional) In **Replicate secret**,
       to replicate your secret to another AWS Region, choose
       **Replicate secret**. You can
       replicate your secret now or come back and replicate it
       later. For more information, see [Replicate a secret to other Regions](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create-manage-multi-region-secrets.md) in the
       _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_.

5. Choose **Next**.
5. (Optional) On the **Configure rotation**
    page, you can turn on automatic rotation. You can also keep
    rotation off for now and then turn it on later. For more
    information, see [Rotate Secrets Manager secrets](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.md) in the
    _AWS Secrets Manager User Guide_. Choose
    **Next**.

6. On the **Review** page, review your secret
    details, and then choose **Store**.

Secrets Manager returns to the list of secrets. If your new secret
    doesn't appear, choose the refresh button.

GitHub Container Registry

###### To create an Secrets Manager secret for your GitHub Container Registry credentials (AWS Management Console)

1. Open the Secrets Manager console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager).

2. Choose **Store a new secret**.

3. On the **Choose secret type** page, do the
    following.
1. For **Secret type**, choose
       **Other type of secret**.

2. In **Key/value pairs**, create two
       rows for your GitHub credentials. You can store up to
       65536 bytes in the secret.
      1. For the first key/value pair, specify
          `username` as the key and your GitHub
          username as the value.

      2. For the second key/value pair, specify
          `accessToken` as the key and your
          GitHub access token as the value. For more
          information on creating a GitHub access token, see
          [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) in
          the GitHub documentation.
3. For **Encryption key**, keep the
       default **aws/secretsmanager**
       AWS KMS key value and then choose
       **Next**. There is no cost for
       using this key. For more information, see [Secret encryption and decryption in Secrets Manager](../../../secretsmanager/latest/userguide/security-encryption.md)
