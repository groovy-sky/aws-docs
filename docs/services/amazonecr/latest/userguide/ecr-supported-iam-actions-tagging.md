# Using Tag-Based Access Control

The Amazon ECR `CreateRepository` API action enables you to specify tags when you create the
repository. For more information, see [Tagging a private repository in Amazon ECR](ecr-using-tags.md).

To enable users to tag repositories on creation, they must have permissions to use the
action that creates the resource (for example, `ecr:CreateRepository`). If tags
are specified in the resource-creating action, Amazon performs additional authorization on
the `ecr:CreateRepository` action to verify if users have permissions to create
tags.

You can use tag-based access control through IAM policies. The following are
examples.

The following policy would only allow a user to create or tag a repository as
`key=environment,value=dev`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCreateTaggedRepository",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:CreateRepository"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/environment": "dev"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowTagRepository",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:TagResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/environment": "dev"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

The following policy would allow a user to pull images from all repositories unless they
were tagged as `key=environment,value=prod`.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ecr:ResourceTag/environment": "prod"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```
