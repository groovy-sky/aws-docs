# Sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private registry

Using pull through cache rules, you can sync the contents of an upstream registry with
your Amazon ECR private registry.

Amazon ECR currently supports creating pull through cache rules for the following upstream
registries:

- Amazon ECR Public, Kubernetes container image registry, and Quay (doesn't require
authentication)

- Docker Hub, Microsoft Azure Container Registry, GitHub Container Registry, GitLab Container Registry and Chainguard Registry (requires authentication with AWS Secrets Manager
secret)

- Amazon ECR (requires authentication with AWS IAM role)

For GitLab Container Registry, Amazon ECR supports pull through cache only with GitLab's Software as a Service
(SaaS) offering. For more information about using GitLab's SaaS offering, see [GitLab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/17.5/subscriptions/choosing_subscription).

For upstream registries that require authentication with secrets (such as Docker Hub),
you must store your credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret. You can use the Amazon ECR console to
create Secrets Manager secrets for each authenticated upstream registry. For more information about
creating a Secrets Manager secret using the Secrets Manager console, see [Storing your upstream repository credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache-creating-secret.html).

For Amazon ECR, you must create an IAM role if the upstream and downstream Amazon ECR registries
belong to different AWS account. For more information about creating an IAM role, see
[IAM policies required for cross-account ECR to ECR pull through cache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache-private.html#pull-through-cache-private-permissions).

After you've created a pull through cache rule for the upstream registry, pull an
image from that upstream registry using your Amazon ECR private registry URI. Amazon ECR then creates
a repository and caches that image in your private registry. For subsequent pull requests of
the cached image with a given tag, Amazon ECR checks the upstream registry for a new version of
the image with that specific tag and attempts to update the image in your private registry
at least once every 24 hours.

## Repository creation templates

Amazon ECR has added support for repository creation templates, which gives you the control
to specify initial configurations for new repositories created by Amazon ECR on your behalf
using pull through cache rules. Each template contains a repository namespace prefix
which is used to match new repositories to a specific template. Templates can specify
the configuration for all repository settings including resource-based access policies,
tag immutability, encryption, and lifecycle policies. The settings in a repository
creation template are only applied during repository creation and don't have any effect
on existing repositories or repositories created using any other method. For more
information, see [Templates to control repositories created during a pull through cache, create on push, or replication action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-creation-templates.html).

## Considerations for using pull through cache rules

Consider the following when using Amazon ECR pull through cache rules.

- Creating pull through cache rules isn't supported in the following
Regions.

- China (Beijing) ( `cn-north-1`)

- China (Ningxia) ( `cn-northwest-1`)

- AWS GovCloud (US-East) ( `us-gov-east-1`)

- AWS GovCloud (US-West) ( `us-gov-west-1`)

- AWS Lambda doesn't support pulling container images from Amazon ECR using a pull
through cache rule.

- When pulling images using pull through cache, the Amazon ECR FIPS service
endpoints aren't supported the first time an image is pulled. Using the
Amazon ECR FIPS service endpoints work on subsequent pulls though.

- For upstream repositories that require authentication, when an image is pulled through the
Amazon ECR private registry URI for the first time or to update the cache, the image pulls are initiated by the
user associated to the credentials configured in the pull through cache rule. Subsequent pulls
will return the image directly from the cache in the customer's private registry.

- For upstream repositories that do not require authentication, when an image is pulled through the Amazon ECR private registry URI, the
image pulls are initiated by AWS IP addresses.

- When a customer pulls a cached image through the Amazon ECR private registry URI,
Amazon ECR checks whether it has validated the image against the upstream
registry within the last 24 hours. If the 24-hour window has expired,
Amazon ECR sends a request upstream to check for a newer version and updates
the cache if one exists. If the window has not expired, Amazon ECR serves the
cached image without contacting the upstream.

- If Amazon ECR is unable to update the image from the upstream registry for any
reason and the image is pulled, the last cached image will still be
pulled.

- When creating the Secrets Manager secret that contains the upstream registry
credentials, the secret name must use the `ecr-pullthroughcache/`
prefix. The secret must also be in the same account and Region that the pull
through cache rule is created in.

- When a multi-architecture image is pulled using a pull through cache rule,
the manifest list and each image referenced in the manifest list are pulled
to the Amazon ECR repository. If you only want to pull a specific architecture,
you can pull the image using the image digest or tag associated with the
architecture rather than the tag associated with the manifest list.

- Amazon ECR uses a service-linked IAM role, which provides the permissions
needed for Amazon ECR to create the repository, retrieve the Secrets Manager secret value
for authentication, and push the cached image on your behalf. The
service-linked IAM role is created automatically when a pull through cache
rule is created. For more information, see [Amazon ECR service-linked role for pull through cache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/slr-pullthroughcache.html).

- By default, the IAM principal pulling the cached image has the
permissions granted to them through their IAM policy. You may use the
Amazon ECR private registry permissions policy to further scope the permissions
of an IAM entity. For more information, see [Using registry permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache-iam.html#pull-through-cache-registry-permissions).

- Amazon ECR repositories created using the pull through cache workflow are
treated like any other Amazon ECR repository. All repository features, such as
replication and image scanning are supported.

- When Amazon ECR creates a new repository on your behalf using a pull through
cache action, the following default settings are applied to the repository
unless there is a matching repository creation template. You can use a
repository creation template to define the settings applied to repositories
created by Amazon ECR on your behalf. For more information, see [Templates to control repositories created during a pull through cache, create on push, or replication action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-creation-templates.html).

- Tag immutability – Tag immutability specifies whether image
tags can be overwritten. By default, image tags are mutable (can be
overwritten). You can modify tag behavior by configuring tag exclusion
filters in either the **Mutable tag exclusion** text
box when **Mutable** is selected, or the
**Immutable tag exclusion** text box when
**Immutable** is selected.

- Encryption – The default `AES256` encryption is
used.

- Repository permissions – Omitted, no repository permissions
policy is applied.

- Lifecycle policy – Omitted, no lifecycle policy is
applied.

- Resource tags – Omitted, no resource tags are
applied.

- Turning on image tag immutability for repositories using a pull through
cache rule will prevent Amazon ECR from updating images using the same
tag.

- When an image is pulled using the pull through cache rule for the first
time a route to the internet may be required. There are certain
circumstances in which a route to the internet is required so it's best to
set up a route to avoid any failures. Thus, if you've configured Amazon ECR to
use an interface VPC endpoint using AWS PrivateLink then you need to ensure
the first pull has a route to the internet. One way to do this is to create
a public subnet in the same VPC, with an internet gateway, and then route
all outbound traffic to the internet from their private subnet to the public
subnet. Subsequent image pulls using the pull through cache rule don't
require this. For more information, see [Example routing\
options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/route-table-options.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_.
