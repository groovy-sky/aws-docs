# Creating an Amazon ECR private repository to store images

###### Important

Dual-layer server-side encryption with AWS KMS (DSSE-KMS) is only available in
the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

Create an Amazon ECR private repository, and then use the repository to store your
container images. Use the following steps to create a private repository using the
AWS Management Console.

###### To create a repository (AWS Management Console)

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository
    in.

3. Choose **Private repositories**, and then choose
    **Create repository**.

4. For **Repository name**, enter a unique name for your
    repository. The repository name can be specified on its own (for example
    `nginx-web-app`). Alternatively, it can be prepended with a
    namespace to group the repository into a category (for example
    `project-a/nginx-web-app`).

###### Note

The repository name may container a maximum of `256`
characters. The name must start with a letter and can only contain lowercase
letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, periods and forward slashes. Using a
double forward slash isn't supported.

5. For **Image tag immutability**, choose one of the following
    tag mutability settings for the repository.

- **Mutable** – Choose this option if you want
image tags to be overwritten. Recommended for repositories using pull
through cache actions to ensure Amazon ECR can update cached images.
Additionally, to disable tag updates for a few mutable tags, enter tag
names or use wildcards (\*) to match multiple similar tags in the
**Mutable tag exclusion** text box.

- **Immutable** – Choose this option if you want
to prevent image tags from being overwritten, and it applies to all tags
and exclusions in the repository when pushing an image with existing
tag. Amazon ECR returns an `ImageTagAlreadyExistsException` if you
attempt to push an image with an existing tag. Additionally, to enable
tag updates for a few immutable tags, enter tag names or use wildcards
(\*) to match multiple similar tags in the **Immutable tag**
**exclusion** text box.

###### Note

Individual tag mutability settings aren't supported.

6. For **Encryption configuration**, choose between
    **AES-256** or **AWS KMS**. For more
    information, see [Encryption at rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/encryption-at-rest.html).
1. If AWS KMS is chosen, choose between Single-layer encryption and
       Dual-layer encryption. There are additional charges for using AWS KMS or
       Dual-layer encryption. For more information, see [Amazon ECR Service Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing).

2. By default, AWS managed key with the alias `aws/ecr` is
       chosen. This key is created in your account the first time that you
       create a repository with AWS KMS encryption enabled. Select **Customer managed key (advanced)** to choose your own AWS KMS
       key. The AWS KMS key must be in the same Region as the cluster. Select
       **Create an AWS KMS key** to navigate to the AWS KMS
       console to create your own key.
7. For **Image scanning settings**, while
    you can specify the scan settings at the repository level for basic scanning,
    it is a best practice to specify the scan configuration at the private registry
    level. Configuring the scanning settings at the private registry level enables
    you to choose between enhanced scanning or basic scanning, and also allows you
    to define filters to specify which repositories should be scanned.

8. Choose **Create**.

###### To create a repository (AWS CLI)

1. You can create a repository using the AWS CLI with the
    **aws ecr create-repository** command.

```nohighlight

aws ecr create-repository \
               --repository-name hello-repository \
               --region region
```

2. If you have a repository creation template defined, you can create
    a repository by pushing your image using familiar Amazon ECR push commands with
    your desired repository name. Amazon ECR will automatically create the repository
    for you using the predefined settings of your repository creation template.
    If you do not have a repository creation template defined yet, your request
    to your nonexistent image repository will fail.

```nohighlight

docker push aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/prefix/my-new-repository:tag
```

choose **View push commands**. For more information about pushing
an image to your repository, see [Pushing an image to an Amazon ECR private repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-push.html).
