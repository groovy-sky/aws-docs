# Private repository policy examples in Amazon ECR

###### Important

The repository policy examples on this page are meant to be applied to Amazon ECR
private repositories. They will not work properly if used with an IAM principal
directly unless modified to specify the Amazon ECR repository as the resource. For more
information on setting repository policies, see [Setting a private repository policy statement in Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/set-repository-policy.html).

Amazon ECR repository policies are a subset of IAM policies that are scoped for, and
specifically used for, controlling access to individual Amazon ECR repositories. IAM
policies are generally used to apply permissions for the entire Amazon ECR service but can
also be used to control access to specific resources as well. For more information, see
[Repository policies vs IAM policies](repository-policies.md#repository-policy-vs-iam-policy).

The following repository policy examples show permission statements that you could use
to control access to your Amazon ECR private repositories.

###### Important

Amazon ECR requires that users have permission to make calls to the
`ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` API through an IAM policy before they
can authenticate to a registry and push or pull any images from any Amazon ECR
repository. Amazon ECR provides several managed IAM policies to control user access at
varying levels. For more information, see [Amazon Elastic Container Registry Identity-based policy examples](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md).

## Example: Allow one or more users

The following repository policy allows one or more users to push and pull images
to and from a repository.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPushPull",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/push-pull-user-1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/push-pull-user-2"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr:PutImage",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Allow another account

The following repository policy allows a specific account to push images.

###### Important

The account you are granting permissions to must have the Region you are
creating the repository policy in enabled, otherwise an error will occur.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCrossAccountPush",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
            },
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr:PutImage",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

The following repository policy allows some users to pull images
( `pull-user-1` and
`pull-user-2`) while providing full access to another
( `admin-user`).

###### Note

For more complicated repository policies that are not
currently supported in the AWS Management Console, you can apply the policy with the [**set-repository-policy**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/set-repository-policy.html) AWS CLI command.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPull",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/pull-user-1",
                    "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/pull-user-2"
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAll",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/admin-user"
            },
            "Action": [
                "ecr:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Deny all

The following repository policy denies all users in all accounts the ability to
pull images.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "DenyPull",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Restricting access to specific IP addresses

The following example denies permissions to any user to perform any Amazon ECR
operations when applied to a repository from a specific range of addresses.

The condition in this statement identifies the `54.240.143.*` range of
allowed Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) IP addresses.

The `Condition` block uses the `NotIpAddress` conditions and
the `aws:SourceIp` condition key, which is an AWS-wide condition key.
For more information about these condition keys, see [AWS Global\
Condition Context Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html). The `aws:sourceIp` IPv4 values use
the standard CIDR notation. For more information, see [IP Address Condition Operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_IPAddress) in the _IAM User Guide_.

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id": "ECRPolicyId1",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "IPAllow",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "ecr:*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "NotIpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "54.240.143.0/24"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Example: Allow an AWS service

The following repository policy allows AWS CodeBuild access to the Amazon ECR API actions
necessary for integration with that service. When using the following example, you
should use the `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount`
condition keys to scope which resources can assume these permissions. For more
information, see [Amazon ECR sample for\
CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-ecr.html) in the _AWS CodeBuild User Guide_.

JSON

```json

{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Sid":"CodeBuildAccess",
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Principal":{
            "Service":"codebuild.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action":[
            "ecr:BatchGetImage",
            "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer"
         ],
         "Resource": "*",
         "Condition":{
            "ArnLike":{
               "aws:SourceArn":"arn:aws:codebuild:us-east-1:123456789012:project/project-name"
            },
            "StringEquals":{
               "aws:SourceAccount":"123456789012"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}

```
