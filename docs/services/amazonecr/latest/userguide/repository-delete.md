# Deleting a private repository in Amazon ECR

If you're finished using a repository, you can delete it. When you delete a repository
in the AWS Management Console, all of the images contained in the repository are also deleted; this
cannot be undone.

###### Important

Images in the deleted repositories are also deleted. You cannot undo this
operation.

###### To delete a repository (AWS Management Console)

1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

    delete.

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Repositories**.

    **Private** tab and then select the repository to delete
