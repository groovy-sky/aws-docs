AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/application-discovery-service-availability-change.html).

# Sorting data collectors in the AWS Migration Hub console
<a name="sort-data-collectors"></a>

If you deployed many data collectors, you can sort the displayed list of deployed collector's on the **Data Collectors** page of the console. You sort the list by applying filters in the search bar. You can search and filter on most of the criteria specified in the **Data Collectors** list.

The following table shows the search criteria that you can use for **Agents**, including operators, values, and a definition of the values.

| Search Criterion | Operator | Value: Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent ID | == | Any agent ID selected from the pre-populated list from which a collection tool is installed. |
| Hostname | ==<br />\!= | For agents, any host name selected from the pre-populated list of hosts where an agent is installed. |
| Collection status | ==<br />\!= | Started: Data is being collected and sent to Application Discovery Service<br />Start scheduled: Data collection is scheduled to start. Data will be sent to Application Discovery Service on next ping, and status will change to **Started**.<br />Stopped: Data is not being collected or sent to Application Discovery Service.<br />Stop scheduled: Data collection is scheduled to stop. Data will stop being sent to Application Discovery Service on next ping, and status will change to **Stopped**. |
| Health | ==<br />\!= | Healthy: Data collection isn't turned on. The tool is functioning normally.<br />Unhealthy: The tool is in an error state. Data isn't being collected or reported.<br />Unknown: No connection established in over an hour.<br />Shutdown: The tool last communicated "shutting down" due to a system, service, or daemon shut down. If a reboot or tool upgrade occurred, status will change to another state at the first reporting cycle.<br />Running: Data collection is turned on. The tool is functioning normally. |
| IP address | ==<br />\!= | Any IP address selected from the pre-populated list where a collection tool is installed. |

The following table shows the search criteria that you can use for **Agentless collectors**, including operators, values, and a definition of the values.

| Search Criterion | Operator | Value: Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ID | == | Any agentless collector ID selected from the pre-populated list from which a collection tool is installed. |
| Hostname | ==<br />\!= | For agentless collectors, any host name selected from the pre-populated list of hosts where an agentless collectors is installed. |
| Status | ==<br />\!= | Collecting data: Data collection is turned on. The tool is functioning normally.<br />Ready to configure— Data collection isn't turned on. The tool is functioning normally.<br />Requires attention— The tool is in an error state and needs attention.<br />Unknown: No connection established in over an hour.<br />Shut down: The tool last communicated "shutting down" due to a system, service, or daemon shut down. If a reboot or tool upgrade occurred, status will change to another state at the first reporting cycle. |
| IP address | ==<br />\!= | Any IP address selected from the pre-populated list where a collection tool is installed. |
