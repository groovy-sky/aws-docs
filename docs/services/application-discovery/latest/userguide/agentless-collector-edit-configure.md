# Editing Agentless Collector settings

You configured the collector when you first set up Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector
(Agentless Collector) as described in [Configuring Agentless Collector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-gs-configure.html). The following procedure
describes how to edit Agentless Collector configuration settings.

###### To edit the collector configuration settings

- Choose the **Edit collector settings** button on the
Agentless Collector dashboard.

On the **Edit collector settings** page, perform the
following:
1. For **Collector name**, enter a name to identify the
      collector. The name can contain
      spaces but it cannot contain special characters.

2. Under **Destination AWS account for discovery**
     **data**, enter the AWS access key and secret key for the
      AWS account to specify as the destination account to receive the data
      discovered by the collector. For information about the requirements for
      the IAM user, see [Deploying Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-deploying.html#agentless-collector-gs-iam-user).
     1. For **AWS access-key**, enter the access
         key of the AWS account IAM user that you're specifying as
         the destination account.

     2. For **AWS secret-key**, enter the secret
         key of the AWS account IAM user that you're specifying as
         the destination account.
3. Under **Agentless Collector password**,
      change the password to use to authenticate access to the
      Agentless Collector.
     1. For **Agentless Collector**
        **password**, enter a password to use to authenticate
         access to the Agentless Collector.

     2. For **Re-enter Agentless Collector**
        **password**, for verification enter the password
         again.
4. Choose **Save configurations**.

Next, you'll see [The Agentless Collector dashboard](agentless-collector-dashboard.md).
