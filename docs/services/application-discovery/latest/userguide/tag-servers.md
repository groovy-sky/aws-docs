# Tagging servers in the AWS Migration Hub console
<a name="tag-servers"></a>

To assist migration planning and help stay organized, you can create multiple tags for each server. *Tags* are user-defined key-value pairs that can store any custom data or metadata about servers. You can tag an individual server or multiple servers in a single operation. AWS Application Discovery Service (Application Discovery Service) tags are similar to AWS tags, but the two types of tag cannot be used interchangeably.

You can add or remove multiple tags for one or more servers from the main **Servers** page. On a server's detail page, you can add or remove one or more tags for the selected server. You can do any type of tagging task involving multiple servers or tags in a single operation. You can also remove tags.<a name="add-tags"></a>
