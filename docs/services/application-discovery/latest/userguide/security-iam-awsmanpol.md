AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](application-discovery-service-availability-change.md).

# AWS managed policies for AWS Application Discovery Service

To add permissions to users, groups, and roles, it is easier to use AWS managed policies
than to write policies yourself. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer\
managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-create-console.md) that provide your team with only the permissions they need. To get
started quickly, you can use our AWS managed policies. These policies cover common use cases
and are available in your AWS account. For more information about AWS managed policies,
see [AWS managed policies](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies) in the _IAM User Guide_.

AWS services maintain and update AWS managed policies. You can't change the
permissions in AWS managed policies. Services occasionally add additional permissions to an
AWS managed policy to support new features. This type of update affects all identities
(users, groups, and roles) where the policy is attached. Services are most likely to update an
AWS managed policy when a new feature is launched or when new operations become available.
Services do not remove permissions from an AWS managed policy, so policy updates won't
break your existing permissions.

Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple
services. For example, the **ReadOnlyAccess** AWS managed
policy provides read-only access to all AWS services and resources. When a service launches
a new feature, AWS adds read-only permissions for new operations and resources. For a list
and descriptions of job function policies, see [AWS managed policies for\
job functions](../../../iam/latest/userguide/access-policies-job-functions.md) in the _IAM User Guide_.

## AWS managed policy: AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFullAccess

The `AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFullAccess` policy grants an IAM user
account access to the Application Discovery Service and Migration Hub APIs.

An IAM user account with this policy attached can configure Application Discovery Service, start and stop
agents, start and stop agentless discovery, and query data from the AWS Discovery Service
database. For an example of this policy, see [Granting full access to Application Discovery Service](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-ads-fullaccess).

## AWS managed policy: AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentlessCollectorAccess

The `AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentlessCollectorAccess` managed policy grants
the Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector) access to register and
communicate with the Application Discovery Service, and communicate with other AWS services.

This policy must be attached to the IAM user whose credentials are used to configure
the Agentless Collector.

**Permissions details**

This policy includes the following permissions.

- `arsenal` – Allows the collector to register with the Application Discovery Service
application. This is necessary to be able to send collected data back to
AWS.

- `ecr-public` – Allows the collector to make calls to the
Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public (Amazon ECR Public) where the latest updates are found for the
collector.

- `mgh` – Allows the collector to call AWS Migration Hub to retrieve the
home region of the account used to configure the collector. This is necessary to know
which region the collected data should be sent to.

- `sts` – Allows the collector to retrieve a service bearer token
so that the collector can make calls to Amazon ECR Public to get the latest updates.

## AWS managed policy: AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentAccess

The `AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentAccess` policy grants the Application
Discovery Agent access to register and communicate with Application Discovery Service.

You attach this policy to any user whose credentials are used by Application Discovery Agent.

This policy also grants the user access to Arsenal. Arsenal is an agent service that is
managed and hosted by AWS. Arsenal forwards data to Application Discovery Service in the cloud. For an example
of this policy, see [Granting access to discovery agents](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-ads-agentaccess).

## AWS managed policy: AWSAgentlessDiscoveryService

The `AWSAgentlessDiscoveryService` policy grants the AWS Agentless
Discovery Connector that is running in your VMware vCenter Server access to register,
communicate with, and share connector health metrics with Application Discovery Service.

You attach this policy to any user whose credentials are used by the connector.

## AWS managed policy: ApplicationDiscoveryServiceContinuousExportServiceRolePolicy

If your IAM account has the `AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFullAccess`
policy attached, `ApplicationDiscoveryServiceContinuousExportServiceRolePolicy`
is automatically attached to your account when you turn on data exploration in
Amazon Athena.

This policy allows AWS Application Discovery Service to create Amazon Data Firehose streams to transform and deliver
data that's collected by AWS Application Discovery Service agents to an Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account.

In addition, this policy creates an AWS Glue Data Catalog with a new database called
_application\_discovery\_service\_database_ and table schemas for
mapping data that's collected by the agents. For an example of this policy, see [Granting permissions for agent data collection](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-ads-export-service).

## AWS managed policy: AWSDiscoveryContinuousExportFirehosePolicy

The `AWSDiscoveryContinuousExportFirehosePolicy` policy is required to use
data exploration in Amazon Athena. It allows Amazon Data Firehose to write data that's collected from
Application Discovery Service to Amazon S3. For information about using this policy, see [Creating the AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose role](#security-iam-awsmanpol-create-firehose-role). For an example of this
policy, see [Granting permissions for data exploration](security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-ads-export-firehose).

## Creating the AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose role

An administrator attaches managed policies to your IAM user account. When using the
`AWSDiscoveryContinuousExportFirehosePolicy` policy, the administrator must
first create a role named **AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose** with
Firehose as a trusted entity and then attach the
`AWSDiscoveryContinuousExportFirehosePolicy` policy to the role, as shown in
the following procedure.

###### To create the **AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose** IAM role

1. In the IAM console, choose **Roles** on the navigation
    pane.

2. Choose **Create Role**.

3. Choose **Kinesis**.

4. Choose **Kinesis Firehose** as your use case.

5. Choose **Next: Permissions**.

6. Under **Filter Policies** search for
    **AWSDiscoveryContinuousExportFirehosePolicy**.

7. Select the box beside
    **AWSDiscoveryContinuousExportFirehosePolicy**, and then choose
    **Next: Review**.

8. Enter **AWSApplicationDiscoveryServiceFirehose** as the role
    name, and then choose **Create role**.
