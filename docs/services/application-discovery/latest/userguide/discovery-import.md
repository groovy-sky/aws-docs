# Importing data into Migration Hub

AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) import allows you to import details of your on-premises environment
directly into Migration Hub without using the Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector
(Agentless Collector) or AWS Application Discovery Agent (Discovery Agent), so you can perform migration
assessment and planning directly from your imported data. You also can group your devices as
applications and track their migration status.

This page describes the steps to complete an import request. First, you use one of the
following two options to prepare your on-premises server data.

- Use common third-party tools to generate a file that contains your on-premises
server data.

- Download our comma separated value (CSV) import template, and populate it with
your on-premises server data.

After you use one of the two previously described methods to create your on-premises data
file, you upload the file to Migration Hub by using the Migration Hub console, AWS CLI, or one of the AWS
SDKs. For more information about the two options, see [Supported import formats](#import-supported-formats).

You can submit multiple import requests. Each request is processed sequentially. You can
check the status of your import requests at any time, through the console or import
APIs.

After an import request is complete, you can view the details of individual imported
records. View utilization data, tags, and application mappings directly from within the
Migration Hub console. If errors were encountered during the import, you can review the count of
successful and failed records, and you can see the error details for each failed
record.

**Handling errors:** A link is provided to download the error
log and failed records files as CSV files in a compressed archive. Use these files to
resubmit your import request after correcting the errors.

Limits apply to the number of imported records, imported servers, and deleted records you
can keep. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service Quotas](ads-service-limits.md).

## Supported import formats

###### Migration Hub supports the following import formats.

- [RVTools](#import-rvtools)

- [Migration Hub import template](#import-template-fields)

### RVTools

Migration Hub supports importing exports of VMware vSphere via RVTools. When saving data
from RVTools, first choose the **Export all to csv** option or the
**Export all to Excel** option, then ZIP the folder, and import the ZIP
file into Migration Hub. The following files are required in the ZIP: vInfo, vNetwork, vCpu,
vMemory, vDisk, vPartition, vSource, vTools, vHost, vNic, vSC\_VMK.

### Migration Hub import template

Migration Hub import allows you to import data from any source. The data provided must be
in the supported format for a CSV file, and the data must contain only the supported
fields with the supported ranges for those fields.

An asterisk (\*) next to an import field name in the following table denotes that
it is a required field. Each record of your import file must have at least one or
more of those required fields populated to uniquely identify a server or
application. Otherwise, a record without any of the required fields will fail to be
imported.

A caret (^) next to an import filed name in the following table denotes that it is
a readonly if a serverId is provided.

###### Note

If you're using either VMware.MoRefId or VMWare.VCenterId, to identify a
record, you must have both fields in the same record.

ServerIdThe server identifier as seen in the Migration Hub server list.`d-server-01kk9i6ywwaxmp`

You can import data even if you don’t have data populated for all the fields
defined in the import template, so long as each record has at least one of the
required fields within it. Duplicates are managed across multiple import requests by
using either an external or internal matching key. If you populate your own matching
key, `External ID`, this field is used to uniquely identify and import
the records. If no matching key is specified, import uses an internally generated
matching key that is derived from some of the columns in the import template. For
more information on this matching, see [Matching logic for discovered servers and applications](view-data.md#add-match-logic).

###### Note

Migration Hub import does not support any fields outside of those defined in the
import template. Any custom fields supplied will be ignored and will not be
imported.

## Setting up import permissions

Before you can import your data, ensure that your IAM user has the necessary Amazon S3
permissions to upload ( `s3:PutObject`) your import file to Amazon S3, and to read
the object ( `s3:GetObject`). You also must establish programmatic access (for
the AWS CLI) or console access, by creating an IAM policy and attaching it to the IAM
user that performs imports in your AWS account.

Console Permissions

Use the following procedure to edit the permissions policy for the IAM
user that will make import requests in your AWS account using the
console.

###### To edit a user's attached managed policies

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**.

3. Choose the name of the user whose permissions policy you want to
    change.

4. Choose the **Permissions** tab and choose
    **Add permissions**.

5. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**, and
    then choose **Create policy**.
1. In the **Create policy** page that opens,
       choose **JSON**, and paste in the following
       policy. Remember to replace the name of your bucket with the
       actual name of the bucket that the IAM user will upload the
       import files into.

      JSON

      JSON

      ```json

      {
        "Version":"2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "s3:GetBucketLocation",
              "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
          },
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::importBucket"]
          },
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::importBucket/*"]
          }
        ]
      }

      ```

2. Choose **Review policy**.

3. Give your policy a new **Name** and
       optional description, before reviewing the summary of the
       policy.

4. Choose **Create policy**.
6. Return to the **Grant permissions** IAM console
    page for the user that will make import requests in your AWS
    account.

7. Refresh the table of policies, and search for the name of the
    policy you just created.

8. Choose **Next: Review**.

9. Choose **Add permissions**.

Now that you've added the policy to your IAM user, you're ready to start
the import process.

AWS CLI Permissions

Use the following procedure to create the managed policies necessary to
give an IAM user the permissions to make import data requests using the
AWS CLI.

###### To create and attach the managed policies

1. Use the `aws iam create-policy` AWS CLI command to create
    an IAM policy with the following permissions. Remember to replace
    the name of your bucket with the actual name of the bucket that the
    IAM user will upload the import files into.

JSON

JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::importBucket"]
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:PutObject",
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:DeleteObject"
         ],
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::importBucket/*"]
       }
     ]
}

```

For more information on using this command, see [create-policy](../../../cli/latest/reference/iam/create-policy.md)
    in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

2. Use the `aws iam create-policy` AWS CLI command to create
    an additional IAM policy with the following permissions.

JSON

JSON

```json

{
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "discovery:ListConfigurations",
                   "discovery:CreateApplication",
                   "discovery:UpdateApplication",
                   "discovery:AssociateConfigurationItemsToApplication",
                   "discovery:DisassociateConfigurationItemsFromApplication",
                   "discovery:GetDiscoverySummary",
                   "discovery:StartImportTask",
                   "discovery:DescribeImportTasks",
                   "discovery:BatchDeleteImportData"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
}

```

3. Use the `aws iam attach-user-policy` AWS CLI command to
    attach the policies you created in the previous two steps to the
    IAM user that will be performing import requests in your AWS
    account using the AWS CLI. For more information on using this command,
    see [attach-user-policy](../../../cli/latest/reference/iam/attach-user-policy.md) in the
    _AWS CLI Command Reference_.

Now that you've added the policies to your IAM user, you're ready to
start the import process.

Remember that when the IAM user uploads objects to the Amazon S3 bucket that you
specified, they must leave the default permissions for the objects set so that the user
can read the object.

## Uploading your import file to Amazon S3

Next, you must upload your CSV formatted import file into Amazon S3 so it can be imported.
Before you begin, you should have an Amazon S3 bucket that will house your import file
created and/or chosen ahead of time.

Console S3 Upload

###### To upload your import file to Amazon S3

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3).

2. In the **Bucket name** list, choose the name of
    the bucket that you want to upload your object to.

3. Choose **Upload**.

4. In the **Upload** dialog box, choose
    **Add files** to choose the file to
    upload.

5. Choose a file to upload, and then choose
    **Open.**

6. Choose **Upload**.

7. Once your file has been uploaded, choose the name of your data
    file object from your bucket dashboard.

8. From the **Overview** tab of the object details
    page, copy the **Object URL**. You'll need this
    when you create your import request.

9. Go to the **Import** page in the Migration Hub console as
    described in [Importing data](#start-data-import). Then, paste the object URL
    in the **Amazon S3 Object URL** field.

AWS CLI S3 Upload

###### To upload your import file to Amazon S3

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory that your
    import file is saved to.

2. Enter the following command:

```nohighlight

aws s3 cp ImportFile.csv s3://BucketName/ImportFile.csv
```

3. This returns the following results:

```nohighlight

upload: .\ImportFile.csv to s3://BucketName/ImportFile.csv
```

4. Copy the full Amazon S3 object path that was returned. You will need
    this when you create your import request.

## Importing data

After you download the import template from the Migration Hub console and populate it with
your existing on-premises server data, you're ready to start importing the data into
Migration Hub. The following instructions describe two ways to do this, either by using the
console or by making API calls through the AWS CLI.

Console Import

Start data import on the **Tools** page of the Migration Hub
console.

###### To start data import

1. In the navigation pane, under **Discover**,
    choose **Tools**.

2. If you don't already have an import template filled out, you can
    download the template by choosing **import**
**template** in the **Import** box. Open
    the downloaded template and populate it with your existing
    on-premises server data. You can also download the import template
    from our Amazon S3 bucket at [https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import\_template.csv](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv)

3. To open the **Import** page, choose
    **Import** in the **Import**
    box.

4. Under **Import name**, specify a name for the
    import.

5. Fill out the **Amazon S3 Object URL** field. To do
    this step, you'll need to upload your import data file to Amazon S3. For
    more information, see [Uploading your import file to Amazon S3](#migration-hub-import-s3-upload).

6. Choose **Import** in the lower-right area. This
    will open the **Imports** page where you can see
    your import and its status listed in the table.

After following the preceding procedure to start your data import, the
**Imports** page will show details of each import
request including its progress status, completion time, and the number of
successful or failed records with the ability to download those records.
From this screen, you can also navigate to the **Servers**
page under **Discover** to see the actual imported
data.

On the **Servers** page, you can see a list of all the
servers (devices) that are discovered along with the import name. When you
navigate from the **Imports** (import history) page by
selecting the name of the import listed in the **Name**
column, you are taken to the **Servers** page where a
filter is applied based on the selected import's data set. Then, you only
see data belonging to that particular import.

The archive is in a .zip format, and contains two files;
`errors-file` and
`failed-entries-file`. The errors file contains a
list of error messages associated with each failed line and associated
column name from your data file that failed the import. You can use this
file to quickly identify where problems occurred. The failed entries file
includes each line and all the provided columns that failed. You can make
the changes called out in the errors file in this file and attempt to import
the file again with the corrected information.

AWS CLI Import

To start the data import process from the AWS CLI, the AWS CLI must first be
installed in your environment. For more information, see [Installing the AWS Command\
Line Interface](../../../cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.md) in the
_AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_.

###### Note

If you don't already have an import template filled out, you can
download the import template from our Amazon S3 bucket here: [https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import\_template.csv](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv)

###### To start data import

1. Open a terminal window, and type the following command:

```nohighlight

aws discovery start-import-task --import-url s3://BucketName/ImportFile.csv --name ImportName
```

2. This will create your import task, and return the following status
    information:

```nohighlight

{
       "task": {
           "status": "IMPORT_IN_PROGRESS",
           "applicationImportSuccess": 0,
           "serverImportFailure": 0,
           "serverImportSuccess": 0,
           "name": "ImportName",
           "importRequestTime": 1547682819.801,
           "applicationImportFailure": 0,
           "clientRequestToken": "EXAMPLE1-abcd-1234-abcd-EXAMPLE1234",
           "importUrl": "s3://BucketName/ImportFile.csv",
           "importTaskId": "import-task-EXAMPLE1229949eabfEXAMPLE03862c0"
       }
}
```

## Tracking your Migration Hub import requests

You can track the status of your Migration Hub import requests using the console, AWS CLI, or
one of the AWS SDKs.

Console Tracking

From the **Imports** dashboard in the Migration Hub console,
you'll find the following elements.

- **Name** – The name of the
import request.

- **Import ID** – The unique ID
of the import request.

- **Import time** – The date and
time that the import request was created.

- **Import status** – The status
for the import request. This can be one of the following
values:

- **Importing** – This
data file is currently being imported.

- **Imported** – The
entire data file was successfully imported.

- **Imported with errors**
– One or more of the records in the data file failed
to import. To resolve your failed records, choose
**Download failed records** for your
import task and resolve the errors in the failed entries csv
file, and do the import again.

- **Import Failed** –
None of the records in the data file where imported. To
resolve your failed records, choose **Download**
**failed records** for your import task and
resolve the errors in the failed entries csv file, and do
the import again.

- **Imported records** – The
number of records in a specific data file that were successfully
imported.

- **Failed records** – The number
records in a specific data file that weren't imported.

CLI Tracking

You can track the status of your import tasks with the `aws discovery
                            describe-import-tasks` AWS CLI command.

1. Open a terminal window, and type the following command:

```

aws discovery describe-import-tasks
```

2. This will return a list of all your import tasks in JSON format,
    complete with status and other relevant information. Optionally, you
    can filter results to return a subset of your import tasks.

When tracking your import tasks, you may find that the
`serverImportFailure` value returned is greater than zero.
When this happens, your import file had one or more entries that couldn't be
imported. This can be resolved by downloading your failed records archive,
reviewing the files within, and doing another import request with the
modified failed-entries.csv file.

After creating your import task, you can perform additional actions to help manage and
track your data migration. For example, you can download an archive of failed records
for a specific request. For information on using the failed records archive to resolve
import issues, see [Troubleshooting failed import records](troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting-import-failed-records).
