# Using the database and analytics data collection module

This section describes how to set up, configure, and use a database and analytics data
collection module. You can use this data collection module to connect to your data
environment and collect metadata and performance metrics from your on-premises databases and
analytics servers. For information about the metrics that you can collect with this module,
see [Data collected by the Agentless Collector database and analytics data collection module](agentless-collector-data-collected-database-analytics.md).

###### Important

End of support notice: On May 20, 2026, AWS will end support for AWS Database Migration Service Fleet
Advisor. After May 20, 2026, you will no longer be able to access the AWS DMS Fleet
Advisor console or AWS DMS Fleet Advisor resources. For more information, see [AWS DMS Fleet Advisor\
end of support](../../../dms/latest/userguide/dms-fleet-advisor-end-of-support.md).

At a high level, when using the database and analytics data collection module, you take
the following steps.

1. Complete the prerequisite steps, configure your IAM user, and create the AWS DMS
    data collector.

2. Configure data forwarding to make sure that your data collection module can send
    the collected metadata and performance metrics to AWS.

3. Add your LDAP servers and use them to discover OS servers in your data
    environment. Alternatively, add your OS servers manually or use the [Using the VMware data\
    collection module](agentless-collector-gs-data-collection-vcenter.md).

4. Configure connection credentials to your OS servers and then use them to discover
    database servers.

5. Configure connection credentials to your database and analytics servers and then
    run the data collection. For more information, see [Database and analytics data collection](agentless-collector-dashboard.md#using-collector-data-collect-database-analytics).

6. View collected data in the AWS DMS console and use it to generate target
    recommendations for a migration to the AWS Cloud. For more information, see [Database and analytics data collection](agentless-collector-dashboard.md#using-collector-data-collect-database-analytics).
