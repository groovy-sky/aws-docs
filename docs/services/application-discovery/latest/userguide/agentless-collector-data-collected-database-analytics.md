# Data collected by the Agentless Collector database and analytics data collection module

The Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector) database and analytics
data collection module collects the following metrics from your data environment. For information
about setting up data collection, see [Using the database and analytics data collection module](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-gs-database-analytics-collection.html).

When you use the database and analytics data collection module to collect
**Metadata and database capacity**, it captures the following metrics.

- Available memory on your OS servers

- Available storage on your OS servers

- Database version and edition

- Number of CPUs on your OS servers

- Number of schemas

- Number of stored procedures

- Number of tables

- Number of triggers

- Number of views

- Schema structure

After you launch the schema analysis in the AWS DMS console, your data collection
module analyzes and displays the following metrics.

- Database support dates

- Number of lines of code

- Schema complexity

- Similarity of schemas

When you use the database and analytics data collection module to collect
**Metadata, database capacity, and resource utilization**,
it captures the following metrics.

- I/O throughput on your database servers

- Input/output operations per second (IOPS) on your database servers

- Number of CPUs that your OS servers use

- Memory usage on your OS servers

- Storage usage on your OS servers

You can use the database and analytics data collection module to collect metadata, capacity,
and utilization metrics from your Oracle and SQL Server databases. At the same time, for PostgreSQL
and MySQL databases, the data collection module can collect only metadata.
