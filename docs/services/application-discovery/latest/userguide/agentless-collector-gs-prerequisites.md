AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](application-discovery-service-availability-change.md).

# Prerequisites for Agentless Collector

The following are the prerequisites for using Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector
(Agentless Collector):

- One or more AWS accounts.

- An AWS account with the AWS Migration Hub home Region set, see [Sign in to the Migration Hub console and choose a home Region](setting-up.md#setting-up-choose-home-region). Your Migration Hub data is stored
in your home Region for purposes of discovery, planning, and migration
tracking.

- An AWS account IAM user that is set up to use the AWS managed policy
`AWSApplicationDiscoveryAgentlessCollectorAccess`. To use the
database and analytics data collection module, this IAM user must also use two
customer managed IAM policies `DMSCollectorPolicy` and
`FleetAdvisorS3Policy`. For more information, see [Deploying Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-deploying.html#agentless-collector-gs-iam-user). The IAM user must be
created in an AWS account with Migration Hub home Region set.

- VMware vCenter Server V5.5, V6, V6.5, 6.7 or 7.0.

###### Note

The Agentless Collector supports all of these versions of VMware,
but we currently test against version 6.7 and 7.0.

- For VMware vCenter Server setup, make sure that you can provide vCenter
credentials with Read and View permissions set for the System group.

- Agentless Collector requires outbound access over TCP port 443 to
several AWS domains. For a list of these domains, see [Configure firewall for outbound access to AWS domains](#agentless-collector-gs-prerequisites-firewall).

- To use the database and analytics data collection module, create an Amazon S3
bucket in the AWS Region that you set as your Migration Hub home Region. The
database and analytics data collection modules stores inventory metadata in this
Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see [Creating a\
bucket](../../../s3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.md) in the _Amazon S3 User Guide_.

- Agentless Collector version 2 requires ESXi 6.5 or a later
version.

## Configure data perimeter for access to AWS service-owned resources

The Agentless Collector automatic update feature retrieves updates in the form of Docker images from an AWS service-owned Public ECR Repository. If you are using data perimeters to control access to Amazon ECR in your environment,
you might need to explicitly allow access to the following to use the automatic update feature:

- Resource ARNs that require access: `arn:aws:ecr-public::446372222237:repository/6e5498e4-8c31-4f57-9991-13b4b992ff7b`

- Required permissions: `ecr-public:DescribeImages`

## Configure firewall for outbound access to AWS domains

If outbound connections from your network are restricted, you must update your
firewall settings to allow outbound access to the AWS domains that
Agentless Collector requires. Which AWS domains require outbound access
depend on if your Migration Hub home Region is US West (Oregon) Region, us-west-2, or some other
Region.

###### The following domains require outbound access if your AWS account home Region is us-west-2:

- `arsenal-discovery.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` – The
collector uses this domain to validate that it is configured with the
required IAM user credentials. The collector also uses it for sending and
storing collected data since the home Region is us-west-2.

- `migrationhub-config.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` – The
collector uses this domain to determine which home Region the collector
sends data to based on the provided IAM user credentials.

- `api.ecr-public.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` – The collector
uses this domain to discover available updates.

- `public.ecr.aws` – The collector uses this domain for
downloading the updates.

- `dms.your-migrationhub-home-region.amazonaws.com`
– The collector uses this domain to connect to the AWS DMS data
collector.

- `s3.amazonaws.com` – The collector uses this domain to
upload data that is collected by the database and analytics data collection
module to your Amazon S3 bucket.

- `sts.amazonaws.com` – The collector uses this domain to
understand what account the collector has been configured with.

###### The following domains require outbound access if your AWS account home Region is not `us-west-2`:

- `arsenal-discovery.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` – The
collector uses this domain to validate that it is configured with the
required IAM user credentials.

- `arsenal-discovery.your-migrationhub-home-region.amazonaws.com`
– The collector uses this domain for sending and storing collected
data.

- `migrationhub-config.us-west-2.amazonaws.com` – The
collector uses this domain to determine which home Region the collector
should send data to based on the provided IAM user credentials.

- `api.ecr-public.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` – The collector
uses this domain to discover available updates.

- `public.ecr.aws` – The collector uses this domain for
downloading the updates.

- `dms.your-migrationhub-home-region.amazonaws.com`
– The collector uses this domain to connect to the AWS DMS data
collector.

- `s3.amazonaws.com` – The collector uses this domain to
upload data that is collected by the database and analytics data collection
module to your Amazon S3 bucket.

- `sts.amazonaws.com` – The collector uses this domain to
understand what account the collector has been configured with.

When setting up Agentless Collector, you might receive errors such as
**Setup failed – Check your credentials and try again**
or **AWS cannot be reached. Please verify network settings**.
These errors can be caused by a failed attempt by the Agentless Collector
to establish an HTTPS connection to one of the AWS domains that it needs outbound
access to.

If a connection to AWS cannot be established, Agentless Collector
cannot collect data from your on-premises environment. For information about how to
fix the connection to AWS, see [Fixing Agentless Collector cannot reach AWS during setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-troubleshooting.html#agentless-collector-fix-connector-cannot-reach-aws).
