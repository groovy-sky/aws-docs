# Setting up the Agentless Collector data collection module for VMware vCenter

This section describes how to set up the Agentless Collector VMware vCenter
data collection module to collect server inventory, profile, and utilization data from
your VMware VMs.

###### Note

Before starting vCenter setup, make sure you can provide vCenter credentials with
Read and View permissions set for the System group.

###### To set up the VMware vCenter data collection module

1. On the **Agentless Collector** dashboard page, under
    **Data collection**, choose **Set up** in
    the **VMware vCenter** section.

2. On the **Set up VMware vCenter data collection** page,
    perform the following:
1. Under **vCenter credentials**:
      1. For **vCenter URL/IP**, enter the IP address
          of your VMware vCenter Server host.

      2. For **vCenter Username**, enter the name of a
          local or domain user that the collector uses to communicate with
          vCenter. For domain users, use the form
          _domain_\ _username_ or
          _username_@ _domain_.

      3. For **vCenter Password**, enter the local or
          domain user password.
2. Under **Data collection preferences**:
      1. To automatically start collecting data immediately following a
          successful setup, select **Start data collection**
         **automatically**.
3. Choose **Set up**.

Next, you'll see the **VMware data collection details** page, which
is described in the next topic.
