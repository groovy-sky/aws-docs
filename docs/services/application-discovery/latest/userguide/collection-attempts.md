AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/application-discovery-service-availability-change.html).

# Network data collection attempts
<a name="collection-attempts"></a>

When a new server is discovered, the collector attempts each configured credential for each IP address. After the collector finds a valid credential, it only uses that credential. After two consecutive failures, the collector attempts to collect networking data for a server after 30 minutes, 2 hours, 8 hours, and then 24 hours. After 6 failed attempts, the collector continues to try all configured credentials once every day. To resolve the issue, either edit the current credentials or add additional ones by choosing **Edit collector**, or make changes to the target server being monitored.
