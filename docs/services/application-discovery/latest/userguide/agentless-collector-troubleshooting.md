## Fixing `Unable to retrieve manifest or certificate file error`

If you receive this error when you try to deploy the OVA from the Amazon S3 URL in the VMware
vCenter UI, ensure that your vCenter server meets the following requirements:

- VMware vCenter Server version 8.0 update 1 or later

- VMware vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3q (ISO Build 23788036) or later

## Addressing self-signed certification problems when configuring WinRM certificates

If you enable WinRM certificate checks, you might need to import a self-signed certificate
authority into the Agentless Collector.

###### To import a self-signed certificate authority

1. Open the collector’s VM web console in VMware vCenter and sign in as
    `ec2-user` with the password `collector` as shown in the following
    example.

```

username: ec2-user
password: collector
```

2. Make sure that every self-signed CA certificate that is used to sign WinRM
    certificates is under the directory `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors`.
    For example:

```

/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/https-winrm-ca-1.pem
```

3. To install the new certificates, run the following command.

```

sudo update-ca-trust
```

4. Restart the Agentless Collector by running the following command

```

sudo shutdown -r now
```

5. (Optional) To verify that certificates have been successfully imported, you can run
    the following command.

```

sudo trust list --filter=ca-anchors | less
```

## Fixing Agentless Collector cannot reach AWS during setup

Agentless Collector requires outbound access over TCP port 443 to several AWS
domains. When configuring Agentless Collector in the console you can get the
following error message.

###### Could Not Reach AWS

AWS cannot be reached. Please verify network settings.

This error occurs because of a failed attempt by Agentless Collector to establish
an HTTPS connection to an AWS domain that the collector needs to communicate with during the
setup process. The Agentless Collector configuration fails if a connection can't be
established.

###### To fix the connection to AWS

1. Check with your IT admin to see if your company firewall is blocking outbound traffic
    on port 443 to any of the AWS domains that require outbound access. Which AWS domains
    require outbound access depend on if your home Region is US West (Oregon) Region, us-west-2, or
    some other Region.

###### The following domains require outbound access if your AWS account home Region is us-west-2:

- `arsenal-discovery.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

- `migrationhub-config.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

- `api.ecr-public.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

- `public.ecr.aws`

###### The following domains require outbound access if your AWS account home Region is not `us-west-2`:

- `arsenal-discovery.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

- `arsenal-discovery.your-home-region.amazonaws.com`

- `migrationhub-config.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`

- `api.ecr-public.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

- `public.ecr.aws`

If your firewall is blocking outbound access to the AWS domains that
Agentless Collector needs to communicate with, configure a proxy host in the
**Data synchronization** section under **Collector**
**configuration**.

2. If updating the firewall does not resolve the connection issue, use the following
    steps to ensure that the collector virtual machine has outbound network connectivity to
    the domains listed in the previous step.
1. Get the IP address of the Agentless Collector from VMware vCenter.

2. Open the collector’s VM web console and sign in as `ec2-user`
       using the password `collector` as shown in the following
       example.

      ```bash

      username: ec2-user
      password: collector
      ```

3. Test the connection to the listed domains by running telnet on ports 443 as shown
       in the following example.

      ```bash

      telnet migrationhub-config.us-west-2.amazonaws.com 443
      ```
3. If telnet cannot resolve the domain, try configuring a static DNS server using the
    [instructions for\
    Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-static-dns-ubuntu-debian).

4. If the error continues, for further support, see [Contacting AWS Support for Agentless Collector issues](#agentless-collector-support).

## Fixing self-signed certification problems when connecting to the proxy host

If communication with the optionally provided proxy is via HTTPS and the proxy has a
self-signed certificate, you might need to provide a certificate.

1. Get the IP address of the Agentless Collector from VMware vCenter.

2. Open the collector’s VM web console and sign in as `ec2-user` with the
    password `collector` as shown in the following example.

```bash

username: ec2-user
password: collector
```

3. Paste the body of the certificate that is associated with the secure proxy, including
    both `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`,
    into the following file:

```

/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/https-proxy-ca.pem
```

4. To install the new certificate, run the following commands:

```bash

sudo update-ca-trust
```

5. Restart the Agentless Collector by running the following command:

```bash

sudo shutdown -r now
```

## Finding unhealthy collectors

Status information for every collector is found on the [Data collectors](https://console.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/discover/datacollectors?type=connector) page of
the AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) console. You can identify collectors with problems by finding any
collectors with a **Status** of **Requires attention**.

The following procedure describes how to access the Agentless Collector console
to identify health issues.

###### To access the Agentless Collector console

1. Using your AWS account, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Migration Hub console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub).

2. In the Migration Hub console navigation pane under **Discover**, choose
    **Data collectors**.

3. From the **Agentless collectors** tab, make a note of the
    **IP address** for each connector that has a status of
    **Requires attention**.

4. To open the Agentless Collector console, open a web browser. Then type the
    following URL in the address bar:
    `https://` `<ip_address>` `/`,
    where _ip\_address_ is the IP address of an unhealthy
    collector.

5. Choose **Log in**, and then enter the Agentless Collector
    password, which was set up when the collector was configured in [Configuring Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-gs-configure.md).

6. On the **Agentless Collector** dashboard page, under
    **Data collection**, choose **View and edit** in the
    **VMware vCenter** section.

7. Follow the instructions in [Editing VMware vCenter credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-vcenter-edit.html) to correct the URL and
    credentials.

After correcting the health issues, the collector will re-establish connectivity with
vCenter server, and the collector's status will change to the **Collecting**
state. If the issues persist, see [Contacting AWS Support for Agentless Collector issues](#agentless-collector-support).

The most common causes for unhealthy collectors are IP address and credentials issues.
[Fixing IP address issues](#agentless-collector-vcenter-ip-issues) and [Fixing vCenter credentials issues](#agentless-collector-vcenter-credentials-issues) can help you resolve these
issues and return a collector to a healthy state.

## Fixing IP address issues

A collector can go into an unhealthy state if the vCenter endpoint provided during
collector setup is malformed, invalid, or if the vCenter server is currently down and not
reachable. In this case, you'll receive a **Connection error** message .

The following procedure can help you resolve IP address issues.

###### To fix collector IP address issues

1. Get the IP address of the Agentless Collector from VMware vCenter.

2. Open the Agentless Collector console by opening a web browser, and then type
    the following URL in the address bar:
    `https://` `<ip_address>` `/`,
    where _ip\_address_ is the IP address of the collector
    from [Deploy Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-deploying.md#agentless-collector-gs-deploy).

3. Choose **Log in**, and then enter the Agentless Collector
    password, which was set up when the collector was configured in [Configuring Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-gs-configure.md).

4. On the **Agentless Collector** dashboard page, under
    **Data collection**, choose **View and edit** in the
    **VMware vCenter** section.

5. On the **VMware data collection details** page, under
    **Discovered vCenter servers**, make a note of the IP address in the
    **vCenter** column.

6. Using a separate command line tool like `ping` or `traceroute`,
    validate that the associated vCenter server is active and the IP is reachable from the
    collector VM.

- If the IP address is incorrect and the vCenter service is active, then update the
IP address in the collector console, and choose **Next**.

- If the IP address is correct but the vCenter server is inactive, activate
it.

- If the IP address is correct and the vCenter server is active, check if it is
blocking ingress network connections due to firewall issues. If yes, update your
firewall settings to allow incoming connections from the collector VM.

## Fixing vCenter credentials issues

Collectors can go into an unhealthy state if the vCenter user credentials provided when
configuring a collector are invalid, or do not have vCenter Read and View account
privileges.

If you experience issues related to vCenter credentials, check to make sure that you have
vCenter Read and View permissions set for the System group.

For information about editing vCenter credentials, see [Editing VMware vCenter credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-vcenter-edit.html).

## Fixing data forwarding issues in the database and analytics data collection module

The home page of the database and analytics data collection module in
Agentless Collector displays the connection status for **Access to**
**DMS** and **Access to S3**. If you see **No**
**access** for **Access to DMS** and **Access to**
**S3**, then configure data forwarding. For more information, see [Configuring data forwarding](agentless-collector-gs-database-analytics-collection-prerequisites.md).

If you experience this issue after you configure data forwarding, then check to make sure
that your data collection module can access to the internet. Then, make sure that you added
the **DMSCollectorPolicy** and **FleetAdvisorS3Policy**
policies to your IAM user. For more information, see [Deploying Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-deploying.md#agentless-collector-gs-iam-user).

If your data collection module can't connect to AWS, then provide outbound access to the
following domains.

- `dms.your-home-region.amazonaws.com`

- `s3.amazonaws.com`

## Fixing connection issues in the database and analytics data collection module

The database and analytics data collection module in Agentless Collector connects
to your LDAP servers to discover OS servers in your data environment. Then, the data
collection module connects to your OS servers to discover database and analytics servers. From
these database servers, the data collection module gathers capacity and performance metrics.
If your data collection module can't connect to these servers, then verify that you can
connect to your servers.

In the following examples, replace `replaceable` values with your
values.

- To verify that you can connect to your LDAP server, install the `ldap-util`
package. To do so, run the following command.

```

sudo apt-get install ldap-util
```

Then, run the following command.

```nohighlight

ldapsearch -x -D "CN=user,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com" -w "password" -b "dc=example,dc=com" -h
```

- To verify that you can connect to a Linux OS server, use the following
commands.

```nohighlight

ssh -i C:\Users\user\private_key.pem -p 22 username@my-linux-host.domain.com
```

Run the previous example as an administrator in Windows.

```nohighlight

ssh username@my-linux-host.domain.com
```

Run the previous example in Linux.

- To verify that you can connect to a Windows OS server, use the following
commands.

```nohighlight

winrs -r:[hostname or ip] -u:username -p:password cmd
```

Run the previous example as an administrator in Windows.

```nohighlight

sudo apt install -y winrm
winrm --user=username --password=password [http or https]://[hostname or ip]:[port] "[cmd.exe or any other CLI command]"
```

Run the previous example in Linux.

- To verify that you can connect to a SQL Server database, use the following
commands.

```nohighlight

sqlcmd -S [hostname or IP] -U username -P 'password'
SELECT GETDATE() AS sysdate
```

- To verify that you can connect to a MySQL database, use the following commands.

```nohighlight

mysql -u username -p 'password' -h [hostname or IP] -P [port]
SELECT NOW() FROM DUAL
```

- To verify that you can connect to an Oracle database, use the following
commands.

```nohighlight

sqlplus username/password@[hostname or IP]:port/servicename
SELECT SYSDATE FROM DUAL
```

- To verify that you can connect to a PostgreSQL database, use the following
commands.

```nohighlight

psql -U username -h [hostname or IP] -p port -d database
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS sysdate
```

If you can't connect to your database and analytics servers, then make sure that you
provide the required permissions. For more information, see [Discovering your database servers](agentless-collector-gs-database-analytics-collection-discovery.md).

## Standalone ESX host support

The Agentless Collector does not support a standalone ESX host. The ESX host must
be part of the vCenter Server instance.
