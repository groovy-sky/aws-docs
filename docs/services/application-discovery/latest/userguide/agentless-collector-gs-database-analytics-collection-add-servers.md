# Adding your LDAP and OS servers

The database and analytics data collection module uses LDAP in Microsoft Active
Directory to gather information about the OS, database, and analytics servers in your
network. _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)_ is an open
standard application protocol. You can use this protocol to access and maintain
distributed directory information services over your IP network.

You can add an existing LDAP server into your database and analytics data collection
module to automatically discover OS servers in your network. If you don't use LDAP, you
can add OS servers manually.

###### To add an LDAP server to your database and analytics data collection module

01. Open the Agentless Collector console. For more information, see [Accessing the\
     collector console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-gs-access-console.html).

02. Choose **View Database and analytics collector**, then choose
     **LDAP servers** under **Discovery** in
     the navigation pane.

03. Choose **Add LDAP server**. The **Add LDAP**
    **server** page opens.

04. For **Hostname**, enter the hostname of your LDAP
     server.

05. For **Port**, enter the port number that is used for LDAP
     requests.

06. For **User name**, enter the user name that you use to
     connect to your LDAP server.

07. For **Password**, enter the password that you use to connect
     to your LDAP server.

08. (Optional) Choose **Verify connection** to make sure that you
     added your LDAP server credentials correctly. Alternatively, you can verify your
     LDAP server connection credentials later, from the list on the **LDAP**
    **servers** page.

09. Choose **Add LDAP server**.

10. On the **LDAP servers** page, select your LDAP server from
     the list and choose **Discover OS servers**.

###### Important

For OS discovery, the data collection module needs credentials for the domain
server to run requests using the LDAP protocol.

The database and analytics data collection module connects to your LDAP server and
discovers your OS servers. After the data collection module completes the OS servers
discovery, you can see the list of discovered OS servers by choosing **View OS**
**servers**.

Alternatively, you can add your OS servers manually or import the list of servers from
a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Also, you can use the VMware vCenter Agentless
Collector data collection module to discover your OS servers. For more information, see
[Using the VMware data\
collection module](agentless-collector-gs-data-collection-vcenter.md).

###### To add an OS server to your database and analytics data collection module

1. On the **Database and analytics collector** page, choose
    **OS servers** under **Discovery** in the
    navigation pane.

2. Choose **Add OS server**. The **Add OS**
**server** page opens.

3. Provide your OS server credentials.

1. For **OS type**, choose the operating system of your
    server.

2. For **Hostname / IP**, enter the hostname or IP
    address of your OS server.

3. For **Port**, enter the port number that is used for
    remote queries.

4. For **Authentication type**, choose the
    authentication type that your OS server uses.

5. For **User name**, enter the user name that you use
    to connect to your OS server.

6. For **Password**, enter the password that you use to
    connect to your OS server.

7. Choose **Verify** to make sure that you added your OS
    server credentials correctly.

4. (Optional) Add multiple OS servers from a CSV file.

1. Choose **Bulk import OS servers from CSV**.

2. Choose **Download template** to save a CSV file that
    includes a template that you can customize.

3. Enter the connection credentials for your OS servers into the file
    according to the template. The following example shows how you can
    provide OS server connection credentials in a CSV file.

```

OS type,Hostname/IP,Port,Authentication type,Username,Password
Linux,192.0.2.0,22,Key-based authentication,USER-EXAMPLE,ANPAJ2UCCR6DPCEXAMPLE
Windows,203.0.113.0,,NTLM,USER2-EXAMPLE,AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
```

Save your CSV file after you add credentials for all your OS
    servers.

4. Choose **Browse**, then choose your CSV file.

5. Choose **Add OS server**.

6. After you add credentials for all OS servers, select your OS servers and
    choose **Discover database servers**.
