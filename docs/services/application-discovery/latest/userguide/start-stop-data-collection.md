# Starting and stopping data collectors in the AWS Migration Hub console
<a name="start-stop-data_collection"></a>

Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector) and AWS Application Discovery Agent (Discovery Agent) are the data collection tools that AWS Application Discovery Service (Application Discovery Service) uses to help you discover your existing infrastructure. The following steps explain how to download and deploy these discovery data collection tools, [Deploy Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-deploying.md#agentless-collector-gs-deploy) and [AWS Application Discovery Agent](discovery-agent.md).

These data collection tools store their data in the Application Discovery Service's repository, providing details about each server and the processes running on them. When either of these tools is deployed, you can start, stop, and view the collected data from the AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) console.

After the AWS Application Discovery Agent (Discovery Agent) is deployed, you can start or stop the data collection process on the **Data Collectors** page of the AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) console.
