AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/application-discovery-service-availability-change.html).

<a name="agentless-collector-gs-database-analytics-collection-prerequisites"></a>

After you create the required AWS resources, configure data forwarding from the database and analytics data collection module to your AWS DMS collector.

**To configure data forwarding**

1. Open the Agentless Collector console. For more information, see [Accessing the collector console](agentless-collector-gs-access-console.md).

1. Choose **View Database and analytics collector**.

1. On the **Dashboard** page, choose **Configure data forwarding** in the **Data forwarding** section.

1. For **AWS Region**, **IAM access key ID**, and **IAM secret access key**, your Agentless Collector uses the values that you configured before. For more information, see [Sign in to Migration Hub and choose a home Region](setting-up.md#setting-up-choose-home-region) and [Deploying a collector](agentless-collector-deploying.md#agentless-collector-gs-iam-user).

1. For **Connected DMS data collector**, choose your data collector that you created in the AWS DMS console.

1. Choose **Save**.

After you configure data forwarding, check the **Data forwarding** section on the **Dashboard** page. Make sure that your database and analytics data collection module displays **![](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/images/success_icon.png) Connected** for **Access to DMS** and **Access to S3**.
