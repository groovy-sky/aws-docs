# Using AWS Migration Hub to export server data

This topic explains how to export server data by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface,
or the API.

###### To use the AWS Management Console to export server data for all servers

    the Migration Hub console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub).

2. In the left navigation pane under **Discover**, choose
    **Servers**.

3. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Export**
**discovery data**.

4. In the **Exports** section at the bottom of the screen,
    choose **Export server details**. This action generates a .zip
    file that includes the .csv files that are described in the following
    table.

File nameDescription

{account\_id}\_Application.csv

Details of each application, including the server count,
name, and description.

{account\_id}\_ApplicationResourceAssociation.csv

{account\_id}\_ImportTemplate

The summary of each server’s application and tags. This
file can be modified and re-imported to update the
application associated with the server.

{account\_id}\_NetworkInterface.csv

Details of each network interface including the associated
server, address, and switch.

    drop-down list appears. In that list, under **Properties**,
    choose **Source**, then choose the **=**
    operator, and then choose **Source = Agent**.

4. In the search results, choose the name of the server for which you want to
    export data. This action takes you to the details page for that server.

5. Enter a start time and an end time, and then choose
    **Export**. The exported .zip file includes the .csv
