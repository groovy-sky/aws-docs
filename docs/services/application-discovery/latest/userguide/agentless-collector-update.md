# Manually updating Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector

When you configure Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), you can
choose to enable automatic updates as described in [Configuring Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-gs-configure.md).
If you do not enable automatic updates, you'll need to manually update
Agentless Collector.

The following procedure describes how to manually update
Agentless Collector.

###### To manually update Agentless Collector

1. Obtain the latest Agentless Collector Open Virtualization Archive (OVA)
    file.

2. (Optional) We recommend that you delete the previous Agentless Collector OVA
    file, before you deploy the latest one.

3. Follow steps in [Deploy Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-deploying.md#agentless-collector-gs-deploy).

**The previous procedure only updates the Agentless Collector.**
**It is your responsibility to keep the OS up to date.**

###### To update your Amazon EC2 instance

1. Get the IP address of the Agentless Collector from VMware vCenter.

2. Open the collector’s VM console and sign in as `ec2-user` using the
    password `collector` as shown in the following example.

```

username: ec2-user
password: collector
```

3. Follow the instructions in [Update instance software on your\
    AL2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2/ug/install-updates.html) in the Amazon Linux 2 User Guide.
