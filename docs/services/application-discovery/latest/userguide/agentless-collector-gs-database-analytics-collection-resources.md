AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/application-discovery-service-availability-change.html).

# Creating the AWS DMS data collector
<a name="agentless-collector-gs-database-analytics-collection-resources"></a>

Your database and analytics data collection module uses an AWS DMS data collector to interact with the AWS DMS console. You can view the collected data in the AWS DMS console, or use it to determine the right-sized AWS target engine. For more information, see [Using the AWS DMS Fleet Advisor Target Recommendations feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/fa-recommendations.html).

Before you create an AWS DMS data collector, create an IAM role that your AWS DMS data collector uses to access your Amazon S3 bucket. You created this Amazon S3 bucket when you completed the prerequisites in [Prerequisites for Agentless Collector](agentless-collector-gs-prerequisites.md).

**To create an IAM role for your AWS DMS data collector to access Amazon S3**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, then choose **Create role**.

1. On the **Select trusted entity** page, for **Trusted entity type**, choose **AWS Service**. For **Use cases for other AWS services**, choose **DMS**.

1. Select the **DMS** check box and choose **Next**.

1. On the **Add permissions** page, choose **FleetAdvisorS3Policy** that you created before. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Name, review, and create** page, enter **FleetAdvisorS3Role** for **Role name**, then choose **Create role**.

1. Open the role that you created, and choose the **Trust relationships** tab. Choose **Edit trust policy**.

1. On the **Edit trust policy** page, paste the following JSON into the editor, replacing the existing code.

#### [ JSON ]

****

   ```
   {
   	"Version":"2012-10-17",
   	"Statement": [{
   		"Sid": "",
   		"Effect": "Allow",
   		"Principal": {
   			"Service": [
   				"dms.amazonaws.com",
   				"dms-fleet-advisor.amazonaws.com"
   			]
   		},
   		"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
   	}]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Update policy**.

Now, create a data collector in the AWS DMS console.

**To create an AWS DMS data collector**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS DMS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/v2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/v2/).

1. Choose the AWS Region that you set as your Migration Hub home Region. For more information, see [Sign in to Migration Hub and choose a home Region](setting-up.md#setting-up-choose-home-region).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Data collectors** under **Discover**. The **Data collectors** page opens.

1. Choose **Create data collector**. The **Create data collector** page opens.

1. For **Name** in the **General configuration** section, enter a name of your data collector.

1. In the **Connectivity** section, choose **Browse S3**. Choose the Amazon S3 bucket that you created before from the list.

1. For **IAM role**, choose `FleetAdvisorS3Role` that you created before.

1. Choose **Create data collector**.
