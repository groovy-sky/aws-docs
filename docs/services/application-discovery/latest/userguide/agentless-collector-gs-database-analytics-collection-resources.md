AWS Application Discovery Service is no longer open to new customers. Alternatively, use AWS Transform which provides similar capabilities. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service availability change](application-discovery-service-availability-change.md).

# Creating the AWS DMS data collector

Your database and analytics data collection module uses an AWS DMS data collector to
interact with the AWS DMS console. You can view the collected data in the AWS DMS console,
or use it to determine the right-sized AWS target engine. For more information, see
[Using\
the AWS DMS Fleet Advisor Target Recommendations feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/fa-recommendations.html).

Before you create an AWS DMS data collector, create an IAM role that your AWS DMS data
collector uses to access your Amazon S3 bucket. You created this Amazon S3 bucket when you
completed the prerequisites in [Prerequisites for Agentless Collector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/agentless-collector-gs-prerequisites.html).

###### To create an IAM role for your AWS DMS data collector to access Amazon S3

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, then choose
    **Create role**.

3. On the **Select trusted entity** page, for **Trusted**
**entity type**, choose **AWS Service**. For
    **Use cases for other AWS services**, choose
    **DMS**.

4. Select the **DMS** check box and choose
    **Next**.

5. On the **Add permissions** page, choose
    **FleetAdvisorS3Policy** that you created before. Choose
    **Next**.

6. On the **Name, review, and create** page, enter
    `FleetAdvisorS3Role` for **Role**
**name**, then choose **Create role**.

7. Open the role that you created, and choose the **Trust**
**relationships** tab. Choose **Edit trust**
**policy**.

8. On the **Edit trust policy** page, paste the following JSON
    into the editor, replacing the existing code.
JSON

```json

{
   	"Version":"2012-10-17",
   	"Statement": [{
   		"Sid": "",
   		"Effect": "Allow",
   		"Principal": {
   			"Service": [
   				"dms.amazonaws.com",
   				"dms-fleet-advisor.amazonaws.com"
   			]
   		},
   		"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
   	}]
}

```

9. Choose **Update policy**.

Now, create a data collector in the AWS DMS console.

###### To create an AWS DMS data collector

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS DMS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/v2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/v2).

2. Choose the AWS Region that you set as your Migration Hub home Region. For more
    information, see [Sign in to Migration Hub and\
    choose a home Region](setting-up.md#setting-up-choose-home-region).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Data collectors** under
    **Discover**. The **Data collectors** page
    opens.

4. Choose **Create data collector**. The **Create data**
**collector** page opens.

5. For **Name** in the **General**
**configuration** section, enter a name of your data
    collector.

6. In the **Connectivity** section, choose **Browse**
**S3**. Choose the Amazon S3 bucket that you created before from the
    list.

7. For **IAM role**, choose `FleetAdvisorS3Role`
    that you created before.

8. Choose **Create data collector**.
