## Envelope encryption

The security of your encrypted object depends in part on protecting the data key that
can decrypt it. One accepted best practice for protecting the data key is to encrypt it.
To do this, you need another encryption key, known as a _key-encryption key_ or [wrapping key](#wrapping-key).
The practice of using a wrapping key to encrypt data keys is known as _envelope_
_encryption_.

**Protecting data keys**

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client encrypts each object with a unique [data key](#data-key). Then it encrypts the data key under the wrapping key
you specify. It stores the encrypted data key with the encrypted object that
the `PutObject` request uploads to Amazon S3.

**Combining the strengths of multiple algorithms**

To encrypt your object, by default, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses a sophisticated
algorithm suite with AES-GCM symmetric encryption. To encrypt the data key,
you can specify a symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithm appropriate
to your wrapping key.

In general, symmetric key encryption algorithms are faster and produce
smaller ciphertexts than asymmetric or _public key_
_encryption_. But public key algorithms provide inherent
separation of roles and easier key management. To combine the strengths of
each, you can encrypt your object with symmetric key encryption, and then
encrypt the data key with public key encryption.

## Data key

A _data key_ is an encryption key that the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
uses to encrypt your object. Each data key is a byte array that conforms to the
requirements for cryptographic keys. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses a unique data key to encrypt each
object.

You don't need to specify, generate, implement, extend, protect or use data keys. The
Amazon S3 Encryption Client does that work for you.

To protect your data keys, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client encrypts them under a _key-encryption key_ known as a [wrapping\
key](#wrapping-key). When you call [`PutObject`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md), the
Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses your plaintext data key to encrypt your object, then removes it from memory
as soon as possible. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client encrypts the data key with the wrapping key you provide.
Then the Amazon S3 Encryption Client stores the encrypted data key with the encrypted object that the
`PutObject` request uploads to Amazon S3. For more information, see [How the Amazon S3 Encryption Client works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/how-it-works.html).

## Wrapping key

A _wrapping key_ is a key-encryption key that the
Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses to encrypt the [data key](#data-key) that encrypts your
object. You specify the wrapping key that is used to protect your data keys when you
instantiate your Amazon S3 Encryption Client. Version 3. _x_ of
the Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses the wrapping key you specify and one of the [fully supported wrapping algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/encryption-algorithms.html#v3-algorithms) to encrypt and
decrypt data keys.

![Wrapping key encrypts data key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/images/wrapping-key-2.png)

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports several commonly used wrapping keys, such as symmetric [AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys), Raw AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption
Standard/Galois Counter Mode) keys, and Raw RSA keys.

###### Note

Version 3. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Go does not support Raw AES-GCM or Raw RSA wrapping keys.

When you use envelope encryption, you need to protect your wrapping keys from
unauthorized access. You can do this in any of the following ways:

- Use a web service designed for this purpose, such as [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms).

- Use a [hardware security module (HSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module) such as those offered by [AWS CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm).

- Use other key management tools and services.

If you don't have a key management system, we recommend AWS KMS. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client integrates
with AWS KMS to help you protect and use your wrapping keys.

## Keyrings

To specify the wrapping keys you use for encryption and decryption, you use a keyring
You can use the keyrings that the Amazon S3 Encryption Client provides or design your own implementations. The
Amazon S3 Encryption Client provides keyrings that are compatible with each other subject to
language constraints.

A _keyring_ generates, encrypts, and decrypts data
keys. When you define a keyring, you can specify the [wrapping\
keys](#wrapping-key) that encrypt your data keys. Most keyrings specify at least one wrapping
key or a service that provides and protects wrapping keys. You can also define a keyring
with no wrapping keys or a more complex keyring with additional configuration options.

For details about specifying wrapping keys, see the examples topic of your
[programming language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/programming-languages.html).

## Supported encryption algorithms

An _algorithm suite_ is a collection of cryptographic
algorithms and related values. Cryptographic systems use the algorithm implementation to
generate the ciphertext message.

To encrypt each Amazon S3 object, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses a unique 256-bit symmetric data
encryption key and an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
algorithm suite. This algorithm suite uses AES-GCM for authenticated encryption with a
12-byte initialization vector, and a 16-byte AES-GCM authentication tag. It does not
support a key derivation function.

For information on legacy encryption algorithms, see [Supported encryption algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/encryption-algorithms.html).

## Cryptographic materials manager

The cryptographic materials manager (CMM) assembles the cryptographic materials that are used to
encrypt and decrypt data. The _cryptographic materials_
include plaintext and encrypted data keys, and an optional message signing key. You
never interact with the CMM directly. The encryption and decryption methods
handle it for you.

You can use the default CMM that the Amazon S3 Encryption Client provides or write a custom CMM.
You can specify a CMM, but it's not required. When you specify a keyring,
the Amazon S3 Encryption Client creates a default CMM for you. The default CMM
gets the encryption or decryption materials from the keyring that you specify.
This might involve a call to a cryptographic service, such as [AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide)(AWS KMS).

Because the CMM acts as a liaison between the Amazon S3 Encryption Client and a keyring, it is an
ideal point for customization and extension, such as support for policy enforcement
and caching.

## Encryption context

If you use a symmetric AWS KMS key as your wrapping key, you can include an encryption
context in all requests to encrypt data. Using an encryption context is
optional, but it is a cryptographic best practice that we recommend.

An _encryption context_ is a set of name-value pairs
that contain arbitrary, non-secret additional authenticated data. The encryption context
can contain any data you choose, but it typically consists of data that is useful in
logging and tracking, such as data about the file type, purpose, or ownership. When you
encrypt data, the encryption context is cryptographically bound to the encrypted data so
that the same encryption context is required to decrypt the data. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client
stores the encryption context in plaintext in the metadata of the encrypted object that
it uploads to Amazon S3. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client also uses the encryption context to provide
additional authenticated data (AAD) in your AWS KMS calls.

###### Note

We strongly recommend using only US-ASCII characters in your encryption contexts.
Including non-US-ASCII characters can result in availability and compatibility errors.

The following example demonstrates how to specify an encryption context in your
cryptographic operations.

1. Specify a KMS key as your wrapping key by instantiating your client with
    the `kmsKeyId` builder parameter.

```java

// v4

class v4KMSKeyExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                   .kmsKeyId(kmsKeyId)
                   .build();
       }
}
```

2. Use the `overrideConfiguration` builder parameter to specify the
    encryption context within your `PutObject` request.

```java

// v4

class v4EncryptExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           s3Client.putObject(PutObjectRequest.builder()
                           .bucket(bucket)
                           .key(objectKey)
                           .overrideConfiguration(withAdditionalConfiguration(encryptionContext))
                           .build(), RequestBody.fromString(objectContent));
       }
}
```

3. Include the same encryption context in your `GetObject` request.

```java

// v4

class v4DecryptExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ResponseBytes<GetObjectResponse> objectResponse = s3Client.getObjectAsBytes(builder -> builder
                   .bucket(bucket)
                   .key(objectKey)
                   .overrideConfiguration(withAdditionalConfiguration(encryptionContext)));
           String output = objectResponse.asUtf8String();
       }
}
```

## Instruction files

An _instruction file_ is a separate Amazon S3 object that stores
encryption metadata for an encrypted object. When you encrypt an object using the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, the
client needs to store metadata about the encryption operation, including the encrypted [data key](#data-key), the encryption algorithm used, and other cryptographic
information required to decrypt the object.

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports two methods for storing this encryption metadata:

**Object metadata storage (default)**

Encryption metadata is stored in the object's metadata headers. This is the most
common and convenient method as all encryption information is stored with the object
itself. When you retrieve the encrypted object, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client reads the encryption
metadata from the object's headers and uses it to decrypt the object.

**Instruction file storage**

Encryption metadata is stored in a separate Amazon S3 object called an instruction file.
The instruction file has the same key as the encrypted object with the suffix
`.instruction` appended. For example, if your encrypted object has the key
`mydata.txt`, the instruction file will have the key
`mydata.txt.instruction`.

**When to use each storage method:**

- **Use object metadata storage** for most scenarios. It
simplifies object management since encryption metadata travels with the object. This is
the default storage method and is recommended unless you have specific requirements that
necessitate instruction files.

- **Use instruction file storage** when object metadata size
is a concern or when you need to separate encryption metadata from the encrypted object.
Note that using instruction files requires managing two Amazon S3 objects (the encrypted object
and its instruction file) instead of one. When you delete an encrypted object that uses
instruction file storage, you must also delete the instruction file separately.

## Key commitment

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports _key commitment_ (sometimes
known as _robustness_), a security property that
guarantees that each ciphertext can be decrypted only to a single plaintext. To do this,
key commitment guarantees that only the data key that encrypted your object will be used
to decrypt it.

Most modern symmetric ciphers (including AES) encrypt a plaintext under a single secret
key, such as the [unique data key](#data-key) that the Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses to
encrypt each plaintext object. Decrypting this data with the same data key returns a
plaintext that is identical to the original. Decrypting with a different key will usually
fail. However, it's possible to decrypt a ciphertext under two different keys. In rare
cases, it is feasible to find a key that can decrypt a few bytes of ciphertext into a
different, but still intelligible, plaintext.

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client always encrypts each plaintext object under one unique data key. It might
encrypt that data key under multiple [wrapping keys](#wrapping-key)
but the wrapping keys always encrypt the same data key.

Typically, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client only supports one data key per object. However, this data key can
be changed over time. Some Amazon S3 Encryption Client implementations support the use of multiple data keys
for a single object when using instruction files with custom suffixes. For example, if one
user decrypts the encrypted object with the default instruction file, it returns 0x0 (false)
while another user decrypting with a custom instruction file for the same encrypted object
gets 0x1 (true).

For objects encrypted using the default Object Metadata storage (not instruction files),
it is not possible to change the encrypted data key associated with the object without
changing the object. Object Metadata in S3 is immutable, so changing the metadata is
equivalent to changing the object itself.

To prevent this scenario, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports key commitment when encrypting and
decrypting. When the Amazon S3 Encryption Client encrypts an object with key commitment, it cryptographically
binds the unique data key that produced the ciphertext to the _key_
_commitment string_, a non-secret data key identifier. Then it stores the key
commitment string in the metadata of the encrypted object. When it decrypts a message with
key commitment, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client verifies that the data key is the one and only key for that
encrypted message. If data key verification fails, the decrypt operation fails.

Support for key commitment is introduced in the latest minor versions of 3. _x_ for Java,
Go, .NET, 2. _x_ for Ruby, PHP, and C++. These languages can decrypt objects with key
commitment, but won't encrypt with key commitment. You can use this version to fully
deploy the ability to decrypt ciphertext with key commitment.

Supported languages include full support for key commitment. By default, it encrypts and
decrypts only with key commitment. This is an ideal configuration for applications that
don't need to decrypt ciphertext encrypted by earlier versions of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client.

Although encrypting and decrypting with key commitment is a best practice, we let you
decide when it's used, and let you adjust the pace at which you adopt it. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client
supports a commitment policy that sets the default algorithm suite and limits the
algorithm suites that may be used. This policy determines whether your data is encrypted
and decrypted with key commitment.

Key commitment results in a slightly larger (+ 56 bytes) encrypted message and takes
more time to process. If your application is very sensitive to size or performance, you
might choose to opt out of key commitment. But do so only if you must.

For more information about migrating to the latest version, including their key
commitment features, see the migration guide for your [programming language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/programming-languages.html).

## Commitment policy

A _commitment policy_ is a configuration setting that
determines whether your application encrypts and decrypts with [key commitment](#key-commitment).

Commitment policy has three values:

ValueEncrypts with key commitmentEncrypts without key commitmentDecrypts with key commitmentDecrypts without key commitment`ForbidEncryptAllowDecrypt`neveralwaysyesyes`RequireEncryptAllowDecrypt`alwaysneveryesyes`RequireEncryptRequireDecrypt`alwaysneveryesnever

The commitment policy setting is introduced in minor versions of supported languages.
It's valid in all supported [programming languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/programming-languages.html).

**`ForbidEncryptAllowDecrypt`**

This policy decrypts with or without key commitment, but it won't encrypt with
key commitment. This value is designed to prepare all hosts running your application
to decrypt with key commitment before they ever encounter a ciphertext encrypted with
key commitment.

**`RequireEncryptAllowDecrypt`**

This policy always encrypts with key commitment. It can decrypt with or without
key commitment. This value lets you start encrypting with key commitment, but still
decrypt ciphertexts without key commitment.

**`RequireEncryptRequireDecrypt`**

This policy encrypts and decrypts only with key commitment. Use this value when
you are certain that all of your ciphertexts are encrypted with key commitment.

The commitment policy setting determines which algorithm suites you can use. If you specify
an algorithm suite that conflicts with your commitment policy, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client returns an error.

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports encryption using key commitment in major version 4.x for Java, Go, and
.NET, and major version 3.x for Ruby, PHP, and C++.
