# Supported encryption algorithms

###### Note

This documentation describes the Amazon S3 Encryption Client version 3. _x_ and newer, which is an independent library.
For information about previous versions of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, see the AWS SDK Developer Guide for your programming language.

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports industry-standard algorithms for encrypting objects and data keys. As
our knowledge evolves, we adjust our support for encryption algorithms to ensure that your
sensitive data is protected. The following topic provides context on which encryption
algorithms are fully supported and the different decryption modes supported in version 3. _x_
of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client.

## Encryption algorithms (Version 3. _x_ and later)

In versions 3. _x_ and later, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client will use fully supported algorithms to encrypt
and decrypt objects and data keys. You can enable the Amazon S3 Encryption Client to decrypt objects and data
keys with a legacy encryption algorithm, but it will not encrypt with a legacy
encryption algorithm. It encrypts only with a fully supported encryption
algorithm.

The following tables list the object encryption algorithms and wrapping algorithms
that are supported in version 3. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client. Use these tables to determine if any
of your objects or data keys were encrypted with an algorithm that is no longer
supported. If you need to decrypt objects or data keys that were encrypted with a legacy
algorithm, see [Enable Legacy Decryption Modes](java-v3-migration.md#enable-legacy-v2-v3).

**Encrypting objects** — The following table lists
the fully supported (Full) and previously supported (Legacy) encryption algorithms that
are used to encrypt objects.

AES-GCM with key commitment is an enhanced version of the standard AES-GCM algorithm
that provides additional security through [Key commitment](concepts.md#key-commitment). This algorithm ensures that each encrypted object
can only be decrypted to a single plaintext, protecting against attacks where an
adversary attempts to decrypt data under multiple keys. The key commitment algorithm
adds a cryptographic commitment to the data key in the object's encryption metadata,
which is verified during decryption. This provides robustness guarantees that prevent
key substitution attacks when reading instruction files. Note that encryption using
AES-GCM with key commitment is only available in version V4 and later of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client,
and objects encrypted with this algorithm can only be decrypted by V4 and the latest
3. _x_ clients.

**Encrypting data keys** — The following table
lists the fully supported (Full) and previously supported (Legacy) wrapping algorithms
that are used to encrypt the data keys that encrypt your objects. Version 3. _x_ of the
Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses one of the fully supported wrapping algorithms and the wrapping key you
specify to encrypt and decrypt the data keys.

## Decryption modes (version 3. _x_ and later)

Version 3. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client defines four modes of support for decryption that you can
use to enable the client to decrypt objects and data keys with either fully supported or
legacy algorithms.

### Fully supported

By default, version 3. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client encrypts and decrypts your objects using
the AES-GCM algorithm suite. AES-GCM is an authenticated scheme. This means that an
authentication tag is appended to the encrypted object. The default behavior for
versions 1. _x_ and 2. _x_ allowed streaming decryption of AES-GCM encrypted objects.
Because authentication happens at the end of the decryption process, the entire
object must be read before the cipher can validate the integrity of it. This allows
plaintext objects to be released and used before the authentication tag is
validated.

Version 3. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports streaming decryption of AES-GCM encrypted
objects, but we recommend using the default decryption mode to prevent the release
of unauthenticated plaintext objects.

**Buffered (default)**

By default, version 3. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client automatically buffers the
stream contents into memory as the decrypted object is read to prevent
the release of unauthenticated objects. If the client reaches the end of
the stream, and the authentication fails, your [`GetObject`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md) request will throw an exception
and the unauthenticated object will not be returned.

When you use the buffered decryption mode with the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java, the
default maximum object size that can be decrypted is 64 MB. However, you
can use the optional `setBufferSize` parameter to customize
the maximum object size that the mode will buffer. You can use the
`setBufferSize` parameter to specify any integer between
16 bytes and 64 GB as the maxiumum object size.

The following Java example instantiates the client with
a raw AES wrapping key and a maximum object size of 32 MiB.

```java

S3Client s3Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
        .aesKey(aesKey)
        .setBufferSize(32 * 1024 * 1024) // OPTIONAL
        .build();
```

When you use the buffered decryption mode with the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Go, the
default maximum object size that can be decrypted is 63 GiB. You cannot
set a custom buffer size with the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Go. As a result, the buffered
decryption mode does not require any additional configuration when you
instatiate your client with the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Go.

We recommend that you use the buffered decryption mode whenever
possible. Since this is the default mode, you do not need to specify the
buffered decryption mode when you instantiate your client.

**Delayed authentication**

###### Note

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Go does not support the delayed authentication mode. To
decrypt objects under the delayed authentication mode, you must use
the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java.

The delayed authentication mode also supports streaming decryption of
AES-GCM encrypted objects, but it does not buffer or interrupt the
stream to prevent unauthenticated objects from being returned. We
recommend using the Buffered (default) decryption mode whenever
possible. However, you might want to use the delayed authentication mode
if you established your own method of buffering the stream while using
versions 1. _x_ and 2. _x_ of the client.

If you use the delayed authentication mode and are processing the
plaintext data from the stream before reading to the end, you must
account for the _delayed_ authentication. Read the
entire object to the end before you start using the decrypted object.
When using this decryption mode, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client will not authenticate any
object until it reaches the end of the stream. You will need to manually
roll back any data from the stream if an exception is thrown at the end
of the stream.

To enable the delayed authentication mode, specify the
`enableDelayedAuthenticationMode` parameter when you
instantiate the client.

The following example specifies a raw AES key as the wrapping key.
This client only encrypts with fully supported algorithms and decrypts
using the delayed authentication mode.

```java

S3Client s3Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
        .aesKey(aesKey)
        .commitmentPolicy(CommitmentPolicy.REQUIRE_ENCRYPT_ALLOW_DECRYPT)
        .enableDelayedAuthenticationMode(true)
        .build();
```

### Legacy

**Legacy wrapping algorithms**

By default, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses the wrapping key you specify and one of
the fully supported wrapping algorithms to encrypt and decrypt the data
keys that encrypt your objects. If you need to decrypt data keys that
were encrypted with a legacy wrapping algorithm, you must specify the
`enableLegacyWrappingAlgorithms` parameter when you
instantiate your client.

Java

The following example specifies a raw AES key as the
wrapping key. This client only encrypts with fully supported
wrapping algorithms. However, it can decrypt data keys
encrypted with fully supported or legacy wrapping
algorithms.

```java

S3Client s3Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
        .aesKey(aesKey)
        .commitmentPolicy(CommitmentPolicy.REQUIRE_ENCRYPT_ALLOW_DECRYPT)
        .enableLegacyWrappingAlgorithms(true)
        .build();
```

Go

The following example creates a keyring that uses a KMS key as the wrapping key and only
encrypts with fully supported wrapping algorithms. However,
it can decrypt data keys encrypted with fully supported or
legacy wrapping algorithms.

```go

cmm, err := materials.NewCryptographicMaterialsManager(materials.NewKmsKeyring(kmsClient, kmsKeyArn, func(options *materials.KeyringOptions) {
    options.EnableLegacyWrappingAlgorithms = true
})
```

**Unauthenticated legacy object encryption algorithms**

If you need to decrypt objects that were encrypted with a legacy
algorithm, or you need to partially decrypt an AES-GCM encrypted object
by performing a [ranged request](java-examples.md#ranged-gets), you
need to use the unauthenticated legacy mode. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client will decrypt
objects with a legacy encryption algorithm, but will use the fully
supported AES-GCM algorithm to encrypt any objects that you upload to
Amazon S3. The decryption of AES-CBC encrypted objects and ranged requests
are considered _unauthenticated_ because the
algorithms do not provide any form of authentication to ensure the
integrity of the object.

To enable the unauthenticated legacy mode, specify the
`enableLegacyUnauthenticatedModes` parameter when you
instantiate the client.

Java

The following example specifies an AES key as the wrapping
key. This client only encrypts with fully supported
algorithms. However, it can decrypt objects encrypted with
fully supported or legacy algorithms.

```java

S3Client s3Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
        .aesKey(aesKey)
        .commitmentPolicy(CommitmentPolicy.REQUIRE_ENCRYPT_ALLOW_DECRYPT)
        .enableLegacyUnauthenticatedModes(true)
        .build();
```

Go

The following example creates a cryptographic materials manager that only
encrypts with fully supported wrapping algorithms. However,
it can decrypt objects encrypted with fully supported or
legacy algorithms.

```go

client, err := NewS3EncryptionClientV3(s3Client, cmm, func(clientOptions *client.EncryptionClientOptions) {
		clientOptions.EnableLegacyUnauthenticatedModes = true
	})
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
```

The `enableLegacyModes` parameter is designed to be a
temporary fix. After you've re-encrypted all of your objects with fully
supported algorithms, you can remove it from your code.

### Commitment policy decryption support

The following tables show which algorithm suites support decryption operations
based on commitment policy settings and the `enableLegacyUnauthenticatedModes`
parameter. The commitment policy determines whether decryption operations require key
commitment.
