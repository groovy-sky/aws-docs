## Instantiating the Amazon S3 Encryption Client

After [installing the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java](java.md#java-installation), you are
ready to instantiate your client and begin encrypting and decrypting your Amazon S3 objects.
If you have encrypted objects under a previous version of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, you may need to
enable legacy decryption modes when you instantiate the updated client. For more
information, see [Migrating to version 3.x of the\
Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/java-v3-migration.html).

With version 3. _x_ or later of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java, you can instantiate your client specifying the
builder parameter that identifies your [wrapping key](concepts.md#wrapping-key).
The Amazon S3 Encryption Client supports the following wrapping keys: symmetric [AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys), Raw AES-GCM keys, and Raw RSA keys. Then, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client
automatically configures a keyring based on the wrapping key type with default settings
and a default cryptographic materials manager (CMM). If you want to customize your client, you can
also [manually configure your\
keyring](#java-instantiate-client-manually).

###### Note

If you use Raw RSA or Raw AES-GCM wrapping keys, you are responsible for generating, storing, and
protecting the key material, preferably in a hardware security module (HSM) or key management system.

The following examples instantiate the Amazon S3 Encryption Client with the default decryption mode. This
means that all objects will be decrypted using the fully supported buffered decryption
mode. For more information, see [Decryption modes\
(Version 3.x and later)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/encryption-algorithms.html#decryption-modes).

### AWS KMS wrapping key

To specify a KMS key as your wrapping key, instantiate your client with the
`kmsKeyId` builder parameter.

To use a KMS key as your wrapping key, you need [kms:GenerateDataKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateDataKey.html) and
[kms:Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) permissions on
the KMS key. The value of the `kmsKeyId` parameter can be any valid
KMS key identifier. For details, see [Key identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

```java

// v4

class v4KMSKeyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                .kmsKeyId(kmsKeyId)
                .build();
    }
}
```

### Raw AES wrapping key

To specify a Raw AES key ( `javax.crypto.SecretKey`) as your wrapping
key, instantiate your client with the `aesKey` builder parameter.

```java

// v4

class v4AESKeyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                .aesKey(aesKey)
                .build();
    }
}
```

### Raw RSA wrapping key

To specify a Raw RSA key ( `java.security.KeyPair`) as your wrapping
key, instantiate your client with the `rsaKeyPair` builder parameter. You
can specify an entire RSA key pair or a partial RSA key pair. The value of the
`rsaKeyPair` parameter must include both the public and private keys
in the key pair to perform both encrypt and decrypt operations. You can specify the
public key to enable the Amazon S3 Encryption Client to perform encrypt operations, or the private key to
enable decrypt operations as needed. By specifying a partial key pair you can limit
the exposure of your keys. For examples using a partial key pair, see the [amazon-s3-encryption-client-java](https://github.com/aws/amazon-s3-encryption-client-java/tree/main/src/examples/java/software/amazon/encryption/s3/examples/PartialKeyPairExample.java) GitHub repository.

RSA key pair

To instantiate version 3. _x_ of the client to perform both encrypt and
decrypt operations, specify both the public and private keys of your key
pair.

```java

// v4

class v4RSAKeyPairExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                .rsaKeyPair(rsaKeyPair)
                .build();
    }
}
```

Public key

To instantiate the client to encrypt only, specify the **public key**. If you specify the public key
alone, all `GetObject` calls will fail because the private
key is required to decrypt.

```java

// v4

class v4RSAKeyPairExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                .rsaKeyPair(new PartialRsaKeyPair(null, rsaKeyPair.getPublic()))
                .build();
    }
}
```

Private key

To instantiate the client to decrypt only, specify the **private key**. If you specify the private key
alone, all `PutObject` calls will fail because the public key
is required to encrypt.

```java

// v4

class v4RSAKeyPairExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                .rsaKeyPair(new PartialRsaKeyPair(rsaKeyPair.getPrivate(), null))
                .build();
    }
}
```

### Manually instantiate the client

If you want to customize your client, you can manually configure your own keyring
and cryptographic materials manager (CMM). The following example manually configures an AWS KMS
keyring using a symmetric encryption AWS KMS wrapping key and passes the custom AWS KMS
client to the Amazon S3 Encryption Client.

```java

// v4
class v4CustomKeyringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KmsKeyring keyring = KmsKeyring.builder()
            .wrappingKeyId(KMS_KEY_ID)
            .kmsClient(customKmsClient)
            .build();

        CryptographicMaterialsManager cmm = DefaultCryptoMaterialsManager.builder()
            .keyring(keyring)
            .build();

        S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
            .cryptoMaterialsManager(cmm)
            .build();
    }
}
```

## Encrypting and decrypting Amazon S3 objects

The following example shows you how to use the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java to encrypt and decrypt Amazon S3
objects.

This example uses a Raw RSA wrapping key and instantiates the Amazon S3 Encryption Client with the default
decryption mode.

1. Specify your wrapping key by passing it to the Amazon S3 Encryption Client when you [instantiate your client](#java-instantiate-client). The
    Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java automatically configures a [keyring](concepts.md#keyring)
    based on the wrapping key you specify.

```java

// v4

class v4RSAKeyPairExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                   .rsaKeyPair(rsaKeyPair)
                   .build();
       }
}
```

2. Encrypt your plaintext object by calling [`PutObject`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md).

1. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client provides the encryption materials: one plaintext data key
       and one copy of that data key encrypted by your wrapping key.

2. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses the plaintext data key to encrypt your object, and
       then discards the plaintext data key.

3. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uploads the encrypted data key and the encrypted object to
       Amazon S3 as part of the `PutObject` call.

```java

// v4

class v4EncryptExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        s3Client.putObject(PutObjectRequest.builder()
                        .bucket(bucket)
                        .key(objectKey)
                        .build(), RequestBody.fromString(objectContent));
    }
}
```

3. Decrypt your encrypted object by calling [`GetObject`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md).

1. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses your wrapping key to decrypt the encrypted data
       key.

2. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses the plaintext data key to decrypt the object, discards
       the plaintext data key, and returns the plaintext object as part of the
       `GetObject` call.

```java

// v4

class v4DecryptExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ResponseBytes<GetObjectResponse> objectResponse = s3Client.getObjectAsBytes(builder -> builder
                .bucket(bucket)
                .key(objectKey));
        String output = objectResponse.asUtf8String();
    }
}
```

###### Note

The default decryption mode cannot decrypt objects larger than 64 MB. This decryption mode automatically buffers stream contents into
memory to prevent the release of unauthenticated objects. If you attempt to decrypt an object larger than 64 MB, you will receive an exception directing you to enable the delayed authentication
decryption mode. For more information, see [Decryption modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/encryption-algorithms.html#decryption-modes).

4. Optional: verify that the decrypted object matches the original plaintext
    object that you uploaded.

```java

assert output.equals(objectContent);
```

5. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client implements the `AutoClosable` interface, which
    automatically calls `close()` when you exit a
    `try-with-resources` block for which the object has been declared
    in the resource specification header. As a best practice, you should either use
    `try-with-resources` or explicitly call the `close()`
    method.

```java

s3Client.close();
```

## Ranged GET requests

With Amazon S3, you can download a specific part of an object by performing a ranged GET
request. In version 3. _x_ and later of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, you must explicitly enable the [unauthenticated legacy decryption mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/latest/developerguide/encryption-algorithms.html#legacy-decryption-mode) to
perform ranged requests.

By default, version 4. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client encrypts and decrypts your objects using the
AES-GCM with key commitment algorithm suite. However, you can enable it to use the legacy AES-CTR algorithm
to partially decrypt your object during a ranged GET request. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client cannot use
AES-GCM for ranged gets because it is an authenticated scheme that appends an
authentication tag to the encrypted object. When you request a partial object, the
client cannot read the entire object stream to reach the authenticated tag. This means
that the partial object is not authenticated.

### Specifying a range

You can include the `Range` parameter in your `GetObject`
request to download and decrypt a specific byte-range from an object. The start and
end indices of the byte range are included in the partial object. The byte-range you
specify should reflect to the following format:

```java

range("bytes=startIndex–endIndex")
```

The following list details how the Amazon S3 Encryption Client responds to ranged requests that specify
an invalid byte-range. For more detailed examples, see the [amazon-s3-encryption-client-java](https://github.com/aws/amazon-s3-encryption-client-java/tree/main/src/examples/java/software/amazon/encryption/s3/examples) GitHub repository.

- When the start index is within object range but the end index is greater
than the object's total length, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client returns the object from the start
index to the end of the original plaintext object.

- When the start index is greater than the end index, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client returns the
entire object.

- When the range is specified with an invalid format, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client returns the
entire object.

For example, if the range was specified as `range("10-20")`,
instead of `range("bytes=10-20")`, then the Amazon S3 Encryption Client will return
the entire object.

- When both the start and end indicies are greater than the original
plaintext object's total length, but still within the same cipher block, the
Amazon S3 Encryption Client returns an empty object.

- When both the start and end indicies are greater than the original
plaintext object's total length, and are outside of the object's cipher
block, the `GetObject` request fails.

#### Performing a ranged request

The following walkthrough explains how to perform a ranged request when using
version 4. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client.

1. Enable ranged gets by specifying the
    `enableLegacyUnauthenticatedModes` parameter when you
    instantiate your client.

The following example specifies a raw AES key as the wrapping
    key.

```java

// v4

class v4EnableRangedGetsExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                   .aesKey(aesKey)
                   .enableLegacyUnauthenticatedModes(true)
                   .build();
       }
}
```

2. Partially decrypt your encrypted object by specifying the byte-range
    in your [GetObject](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md)
    request.

The following example specifies a start index at byte 10 and end index
    at byte 20.

```java

// v4

class v4RangedGetExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ResponseBytes<GetObjectResponse> objectResponse = v4Client.getObjectAsBytes(builder -> builder
                   .bucket(bucket)
                   .range("bytes=10-20")
                   .key(objectKey));
           String output = objectResponse.asUtf8String();
       }
}
```

3. Optional: verify that the decrypted partial object matches the
    original plaintext object that you uploaded at the same range.

```java

assert output.equals(objectContent);
```

4. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client implements the `AutoClosable` interface, which
    automatically calls `close()` when you exit a
    `try-with-resources` block for which the object has been
    declared in the resource specification header. As a best practice, you
    should either use `try-with-resources` or explicitly call the
    `close()` method.

```java

s3Client.close();
```

## Multipart upload

Amazon S3 allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts using [multipart\
uploads](../../../s3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.md). Amazon S3 recommends that when your object size reaches 100 MB, you
should consider using multipart uploads. In version 3. _x_ or later of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, you can perform
multipart uploads with the low-level API or the high-level API. Use the low-level API
when you need to vary part sizes during the upload or require more control over the
multipart upload process. Use the high-level API to simplify the multipart upload
process by enabling the Amazon S3 Encryption Client to automatically perform multipart uploads.

### Multipart Upload (high-level API)

When you use the high-level API, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client automatically performs multipart
uploads for all objects larger than 5 MB. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client encrypts the object locally and
then calls the [AWS\
CRT-based Amazon S3 client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/crt-based-s3-client.html) to perform the multipart upload to Amazon S3.

###### Note

If your permissions to access required Amazon S3 resources or KMS keys are
revoked during a multipart upload using the high-level API, the in-progress
request may upload successfully. Subsequent multipart upload requests will
fail.

To enable automatic multipart uploads with the high-level API, you must add
dependencies for the AWS CRT-based Amazon S3 client to your Maven project file and
specify the `enableMultipartPutObject` parameter when you instantiate
your client.

Add dependencies

To use the AWS CRT-based Amazon S3 client with the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, add the
following two dependencies. For more information on creating
dependencies and installing the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, see [Installing the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java](java.md#java-installation).

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>s3</artifactId>
  <version>2.19.3
<dependency>
  <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk.crt</groupId>
  <artifactId>aws-crt</artifactId>
  <version>0.21.5</version>
</dependency>
```

Enable multipart upload

To enable the Amazon S3 Encryption Client to automatically perform multipart uploads,
specify the `enableMultipartPutObject` parameter when you
instantiate your client.

The following example specifies a raw AES key as the wrapping
key.

```java

// v4

class v4EnableMultipartUploadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        S3Client v4Client = S3EncryptionClient.builderV4()
                .aesKey(aesKey)
                .enableMultipartPutObject(true)
                .build();
    }
}
```

### Multipart Upload (low-level API)

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client does not require any additional configuration to use the low-level API.
Use the following API calls to generate a multipart upload request with version 4. _x_
of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client.

1. Start the multipart upload process by calling [`CreateMultipartUpload`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-createmultipartupload.md).

2. Call [`UploadPart`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-uploadpart.md) to upload each part of your object.
    When you upload the final part, you must specify `isLastPart` for
    the Amazon S3 Encryption Client to be able to call `cipher.doFinal()`

```java

// v4

class v4UploadFinalPartExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
            UploadPartRequest uploadPartRequest = UploadPartRequest.builder()
                       .bucket(bucket)
                       .key(objectKey)
                       .uploadId(initiateResult.uploadId())
                       .partNumber(partsSent)
                       .overrideConfiguration(isLastPart(true))
                       .build();
       }
}
```

3. Call [`CompleteMultipartUpload`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-completemultipartupload.md) to finish the
    process.
