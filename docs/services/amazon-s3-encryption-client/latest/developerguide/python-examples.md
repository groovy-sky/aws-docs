# Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python examples

The following examples show you how to use the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python to encrypt and decrypt Amazon S3
objects. These examples show how to use version 4. _x_ of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python.

###### Note

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python does not support [asynchronous\
programming](using-s3ec-async.md) or [ranged GET requests](java-examples.md#ranged-gets). To use these features of the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, you
must use the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java or another Amazon S3 Encryption Client implementation that supports the feature or
features in question.

###### Note

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python supports streaming decryption with [delayed authentication](encryption-algorithms.md#decryption-modes). For more information, see
[Streaming decryption](#python-streaming-example).

## Instantiating the Amazon S3 Encryption Client

After [installing the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python](python.md#python-installation), you are
ready to instantiate your client and begin encrypting and decrypting your Amazon S3 objects.

The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python supports [keyrings](concepts.md#keyring) that use symmetric
encryption KMS keys as the wrapping key. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python does not support keyrings that
use Raw AES-GCM or Raw RSA wrapping keys. To use Raw AES-GCM or Raw RSA wrapping keys,
you must use the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java or another Amazon S3 Encryption Client implementation that supports these
wrapping key types. For more information, see [Instantiating the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Java](java-examples.md#java-instantiate-client).

To use a KMS key as your wrapping key, you need [kms:GenerateDataKey](../../../../reference/kms/latest/apireference/api-generatedatakey.md) and [kms:Decrypt](../../../../reference/kms/latest/apireference/api-decrypt.md) permissions on the
KMS key. To specify a KMS key, use any valid KMS key identifier. For details, see
[Key identifiers](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.md#key-id) in the
_AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

The following example instantiates the Amazon S3 Encryption Client with the default configuration. By
default, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python encrypts using the AES-GCM with key commitment algorithm
suite and the `REQUIRE_ENCRYPT_REQUIRE_DECRYPT` commitment policy.

```python

import boto3
from s3_encryption import S3EncryptionClient, S3EncryptionClientConfig
from s3_encryption.materials.kms_keyring import KmsKeyring

# Create the boto3 clients
s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
kms_client = boto3.client("kms")

# Create the KMS keyring
keyring = KmsKeyring(kms_client, kms_key_id)

# Create the S3 Encryption Client configuration and client
config = S3EncryptionClientConfig(keyring)
s3ec = S3EncryptionClient(s3_client, config)
```

## Encrypting and decrypting Amazon S3 objects

The following example shows you how to use the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python to encrypt and decrypt Amazon S3
objects.

1. Create a [keyring](concepts.md#keyring) with a KMS key as your
    wrapping key when you [instantiate your\
    client](#python-instantiate-client).

```python

import boto3
from s3_encryption import S3EncryptionClient, S3EncryptionClientConfig
from s3_encryption.materials.kms_keyring import KmsKeyring

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
kms_client = boto3.client("kms")

keyring = KmsKeyring(kms_client, kms_key_id)
config = S3EncryptionClientConfig(keyring)
s3ec = S3EncryptionClient(s3_client, config)
```

2. Encrypt your plaintext object by calling [`PutObject`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-putobject.md).
    To include an optional [encryption \
    context](../../../kms/latest/developerguide/encrypt-context.md), add an `EncryptionContext`
    parameter to the `put_object` call.

1. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client provides the encryption materials: one plaintext data key
       and one copy of that data key encrypted by your wrapping key.

2. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses the plaintext data key to encrypt your object, and
       then discards the plaintext data key.

3. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uploads the encrypted data key and the encrypted object to
       Amazon S3 as part of the `PutObject` call.

```python

plaintext = "Hello, S3 Encryption Client!"

s3ec.put_object(
    Bucket=bucket,
    Key=object_key,
    Body=plaintext,
    EncryptionContext={"ec-key": "ec-value"}  # optional
)
```

3. Decrypt your encrypted object by calling [`GetObject`](../../../s3/latest/api/api-getobject.md). If you specified an encryption context during
    encryption, you must provide the same encryption context during decryption.

1. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses your wrapping key to decrypt the encrypted data
       key.

2. The Amazon S3 Encryption Client uses the plaintext data key to decrypt the object, discards
       the plaintext data key, and returns the plaintext object as part of the
       `GetObject` call.

```python

response = s3ec.get_object(
    Bucket=bucket,
    Key=object_key,
    EncryptionContext={"ec-key": "ec-value"}  # must match encryption context
)

decrypted_plaintext = response["Body"].read().decode("utf-8")
```

4. Optional: verify that the decrypted object matches the original plaintext
    object that you uploaded.

```python

assert decrypted_plaintext == plaintext
```

## Multipart upload

Amazon S3 recommends that when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using
[multipart uploads](../../../s3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.md). The Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python provides two high-level methods that
automatically handle encrypted multipart uploads: `upload_file` and
`upload_fileobj`.

Both methods automatically split large objects into parts, encrypt each part, and
upload them to Amazon S3. If the file is smaller than the multipart threshold (default 8 MB),
`upload_file` uses `put_object` instead.

### Uploading a file from disk

Use `upload_file` to encrypt and upload a file from the local file
system. You can optionally specify a `multipart_threshold` to control
when multipart upload is used, and a `multipart_chunksize` to control
the size of each part.

```python

import boto3
from s3_encryption import S3EncryptionClient, S3EncryptionClientConfig
from s3_encryption.materials.kms_keyring import KmsKeyring

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
kms_client = boto3.client("kms")

keyring = KmsKeyring(kms_client=kms_client, kms_key_id=kms_key_id)
config = S3EncryptionClientConfig(keyring=keyring)
s3ec = S3EncryptionClient(wrapped_s3_client=s3_client, config=config)

# Upload a file (automatically uses multipart for large files)
s3ec.upload_file(
    filename,
    bucket,
    object_key,
    multipart_threshold=8 * 1024 * 1024,   # optional, default 8 MB
    multipart_chunksize=8 * 1024 * 1024,   # optional, default 8 MB
)
```

### Uploading a file-like object

Use `upload_fileobj` to encrypt and upload a file-like object (any
object with a `read()` method) to Amazon S3 via multipart upload. The caller
retains ownership of the file object — it will not be closed by this method.

```python

import io
import boto3
from s3_encryption import S3EncryptionClient, S3EncryptionClientConfig
from s3_encryption.materials.kms_keyring import KmsKeyring

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
kms_client = boto3.client("kms")

keyring = KmsKeyring(kms_client=kms_client, kms_key_id=kms_key_id)
config = S3EncryptionClientConfig(keyring=keyring)
s3ec = S3EncryptionClient(wrapped_s3_client=s3_client, config=config)

# Upload a file-like object via multipart upload
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    s3ec.upload_fileobj(
        f,
        bucket,
        object_key,
        multipart_chunksize=8 * 1024 * 1024,  # optional, default 8 MB
    )
```

## Streaming decryption

By default, the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python buffers the entire ciphertext and verifies the
authentication tag before releasing any plaintext. This is the safest mode, but requires
holding the entire object in memory.

With delayed authentication enabled, plaintext is released incrementally as it is
decrypted, before the authentication tag has been verified. This allows processing large
files without buffering the entire object in memory.

###### Important

With delayed authentication, plaintext is released before it has been
authenticated. An attacker could modify the ciphertext and the client would release
tampered plaintext before detecting the modification. Only use this mode when you
need to process files too large to buffer in memory and you understand the security
implications.

Your application should read the stream to completion. If an error is thrown
during the final read due to an invalid authentication tag, your application must
discard and invalidate any data that was already processed.

The following walkthrough explains how to use streaming decryption with delayed
authentication in the Amazon S3 Encryption Client for Python.

1. Enable delayed authentication by specifying the
    `enable_delayed_authentication` parameter when you configure your
    client.

```python

import boto3
from s3_encryption import S3EncryptionClient, S3EncryptionClientConfig
from s3_encryption.materials.kms_keyring import KmsKeyring

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")
kms_client = boto3.client("kms")

keyring = KmsKeyring(kms_client=kms_client, kms_key_id=kms_key_id)

config = S3EncryptionClientConfig(
       keyring=keyring,
       enable_delayed_authentication=True,
)
s3ec = S3EncryptionClient(wrapped_s3_client=s3_client, config=config)
```

2. Encrypt and upload your object by calling `upload_file`. This
    method automatically performs a multipart upload for large files.

```python

s3ec.upload_file(filename, bucket, object_key)
```

3. Stream the decrypted object back in chunks. With delayed authentication,
    plaintext is released incrementally without buffering the entire object in
    memory.

```python

from s3_encryption.exceptions import S3EncryptionClientSecurityError

response = s3ec.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=object_key)
body = response["Body"]

chunks = []
try:
       while True:
           chunk = body.read(1024 * 1024)  # Read 1 MB at a time
           if not chunk:
               break
           chunks.append(chunk)

       plaintext = b"".join(chunks)

except S3EncryptionClientSecurityError:
       # Authentication tag verification failed.
       # Discard any plaintext released before the error.
       raise
```

4. Optional: verify that the decrypted content matches the original data.

```python

assert plaintext == large_data
```
