# Understanding AI-derived facts in incident reports

AI-derived facts form the foundation of CloudWatch investigations incident reports, representing
information that the AI system considers objectively true or highly probable based on
comprehensive analysis of your AWS environment. These facts emerge through a
sophisticated process that combines machine learning pattern recognition with systematic
verification methods, creating a robust framework for incident analysis that maintains
the operational rigor required for production environments.

Understanding how AI-derived facts are developed helps you evaluate their reliability
and make informed decisions during incident response. The process represents a hybrid
approach where artificial intelligence augments human expertise rather than replacing
it, ensuring that the insights generated are both comprehensive and trustworthy.

## The development process of AI-derived facts

The journey from raw telemetry data to actionable AI-derived facts begins with
pattern observation, where the CloudWatch investigations AI analyzes vast amounts of AWS telemetry
using sophisticated machine learning algorithms. The AI examines your CloudWatch
metrics, logs, and traces across multiple dimensions simultaneously, identifying
recurring patterns and relationships that might not be immediately apparent to human
operators. The analysis encompasses temporal patterns that reveal when incidents
typically occur and their duration characteristics, service correlations that show
how different AWS services interact during failure scenarios, metric anomalies
that precede or accompany incidents, and log event sequences that indicate specific
failure modes.

Consider, for example, how the AI might observe that in your environment, Amazon EC2
instance CPU utilization consistently spikes to above 90% approximately 15 minutes
before application response times exceed acceptable thresholds. This temporal
relationship, when observed across multiple incidents, becomes a significant pattern
worthy of further investigation. The AI doesn't simply note the correlation; it
measures the statistical significance of the relationship and considers various
confounding factors that might influence the pattern.

From these observed patterns, the AI moves into hypothesis generation, formulating
potential explanations for the relationships it has discovered. This process
involves creating multiple competing hypotheses and ranking them by probability
based on the strength of supporting evidence. When the AI observes that CPU spikes
precede response time degradation, it might generate several hypotheses: resource
exhaustion due to insufficient compute capacity, memory leaks causing increased CPU
overhead, or inefficient algorithms triggered by specific input patterns. Each
hypothesis receives a preliminary confidence level based on how well it explains the
observed data and aligns with known AWS service behaviors.

The human verification and validation of these hypotheses ensures that these
AI-generated insights meet operational standards before becoming facts in your
incident reports. This process involves correlating AI-derived patterns with
established AWS service behavior models, checking consistency with industry best
practices for incident response, and validating against historical incident data
from similar environments. The AI must demonstrate that its findings are
reproducible across different analysis methods and time periods, meet statistical
significance requirements for operational decision-making, align with empirical
observations of AWS service behavior, and provide actionable insights for incident
resolution or prevention.

Throughout this process, the AI faces several inherent challenges that you should
understand when interpreting AI-derived facts. The distinction between correlation
and causation remains a fundamental challenge; while the AI might identify strong
correlations between network traffic spikes and incident occurrence, establishing
direct causation requires additional investigation and domain expertise. Hidden
variables that exist outside the scope of AWS telemetry, such as third-party
service dependencies or external network provider issues, may influence incidents
without being captured in the AI analysis. The quality of AI-derived facts depends
entirely on the completeness and accuracy of the underlying CloudWatch data, making
comprehensive monitoring coverage essential for reliable insights.

Novel incident patterns present another challenge, as those are not present in AI
training data, and AIs often struggle to interpret unfamiliar failure modes. This
limitation underscores the importance of human expertise in interpreting AI-derived
facts and supplementing them with domain knowledge and contextual
understanding.

## Applying AI-derived facts in incident response

AI excels at identifying patterns across large datasets that would be impractical
for humans to analyze manually, providing insights that can significantly accelerate
incident diagnosis and resolution. AI works best when combined with human expertise
that can provide context, validate conclusions, and identify factors that may not be
captured in telemetry data.

The most effective approach involves treating AI-derived facts as highly informed
starting points for investigation rather than definitive conclusions. When the AI
identifies a fact such as "Database connection pool exhaustion preceded the incident
by 8 minutes," this provides a valuable lead that can be quickly verified through
targeted analysis of database metrics and application logs. The fact gives you a
specific timeframe and potential root cause to investigate, dramatically reducing
the time needed to identify the issue compared to manually searching through all
available telemetry.

Data quality plays a crucial role in the reliability of AI-derived facts.
Comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring coverage provides the AI access to complete and
accurate information for analysis. Gaps in monitoring can lead to incomplete or
misleading facts, as the AI can only work with the data available to it.
Organizations that use thorough observability practices that include detailed
metrics collection, comprehensive logging, and distributed tracing are more likely
to have accurate and actionable AI-derived facts in their incident reports.
