# Using CloudWatch anomaly detection

When you enable _anomaly detection_ for a metric, CloudWatch applies
statistical and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms continuously analyze metrics of
systems and applications, determine normal baselines, and surface anomalies with minimal user
intervention.

The algorithms generate an anomaly detection model. The model generates a range of expected values that represent normal metric behavior.

You can enable anomaly detection using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, CloudFormation, or the AWS
SDK. You can enable anomaly detection on metrics vended by AWS and also on custom
metrics. In an account set up as a monitoring account for CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can
create anomaly detectors on metrics in source accounts in addition to metrics in the monitoring account.

You can use the model of expected values in two ways:

- Create anomaly detection alarms based on a metric's expected value. These types of alarms
don't have a static threshold for determining alarm state. Instead, they compare the
metric's value to the expected value based on the anomaly detection model.

You can choose whether the alarm is triggered when the metric value is above the band of
expected values, below the band, or both.

For more information, see [Create a CloudWatch alarm based on anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Anomaly_Detection_Alarm.html).

- When viewing a graph of metric data, overlay the expected values onto the graph as a band.
This makes it visually clear which values in the graph are out of the normal range. For more
information, see [Creating a graph](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph_a_metric.html#create-metric-graph).

You
can also retrieve the upper and lower values of the model's band by using the
`GetMetricData` API request with the `ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND` metric
math function. For more information, see [GetMetricData](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-getmetricdata.md).

In a graph with anomaly detection, the expected range of values is shown as a gray band. If the metric's actual
value goes beyond this band, it is shown as red during that time.

Anomaly detection algorithms account for the seasonality and trend changes of metrics. The
seasonality changes could be hourly, daily, or weekly, as shown in the following
examples.

The longer-range trends could be downward or upward.

Anomaly detection also works well with metrics with flat patterns.

## How CloudWatch anomaly detection works

When you enable anomaly detection for a metric, CloudWatch applies machine learning algorithms
to the metric's past data to create a model of the metric's expected values. The model
assesses both trends and hourly, daily, and weekly patterns of the metric. The algorithm
trains on up to two weeks of metric data, but you can enable anomaly detection on a metric
even if the metric does not have a full two weeks of data.

You specify a value for the anomaly detection threshold that CloudWatch uses along with the model to determine
the "normal" range of values for the metric. A higher value for the anomaly detection threshold produces a thicker
band of "normal" values.

The machine learning model is specific to a metric and a statistic. For example, if you
enable anomaly detection for a metric using the `AVG` statistic, the model is
specific to the `AVG` statistic.

When CloudWatch creates a model for many common metrics from AWS services, it ensures that the band doesn’t
extend outside of logical values. For example, the band for `MemoryUtilization` of an EC2 instance will stay between 0 and 100, and the bands
tracking CloudFront `Requests`, which can't be negative, will never extend below zero.

After you create a model, CloudWatch anomaly detection continually evaluates the model and makes adjustments to it to
ensure that it is as accurate as possible. This includes re-training the model to adjust if the metric values evolve over time or have sudden
changes, and also includes predictors to improve the models of metrics that are seasonal, spiky, or sparse.

After you enable anomaly detection on a metric, you can choose to exclude specified time
periods of the metric from being used to train the model. This way, you can exclude
deployments or other unusual events from being used for model training, ensuring the most
accurate model is created.

Using anomaly detection models for alarms incurs charges on your AWS account. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

## Anomaly detection on metric math

Anomaly detection on metric math is a feature that
you can use to create anomaly detection alarms on the output metric math expressions. You can use these expressions to create graphs that visualize
anomaly detection bands. The feature supports basic arithmetic functions, comparison and
logical operators, and most other functions. For information
about functions that are not supported, see [Using metric math](using-metric-math.md#using-anomaly-detection-on-metric-math) in the _Amazon CloudWatch User Guide_.

You can create anomaly detection models
based on metric math expressions similar to how
you already create anomaly detection models.
From the CloudWatch console,
you can apply anomaly detection
to metric math expressions
and select anomaly detection as a threshold type
for these expressions.

###### Note

Anomaly detection on metric math
only can be enabled and edited
in the latest version
of the metrics user interface.
When you create anomaly detectors
based on metric math expressions
in the new version of the interface,
you can view them in the old version, but not edit them.

alarms and models for anomaly detection and metric math, see the following sections:

## Anomaly detection using PromQL

You can build anomaly detection bands for any Prometheus-compatible metric by using
standard PromQL functions such as `quantile_over_time`,
`stddev_over_time`, and `avg_over_time`. This approach computes a
baseline and adds or subtracts a scaled standard deviation to define upper and lower bounds
that adapt to your metric's natural patterns.

This works for any metric that returns a float value, such as CPU usage, request latency,
or error counts. For information about ingesting metrics using OpenTelemetry, see [OpenTelemetry](cloudwatch-opentelemetry-sections.md).

### Defining upper and lower bounds

To define an expected range for a metric, compute a baseline using the median or average
over a time window, then add and subtract a multiple of the standard deviation. The
multiplier controls sensitivity—higher values produce wider bands with fewer false
positives, while lower values catch smaller deviations.

The following example creates an upper bound for an ad request metric using a 60-minute
window and a multiplier of 3:

```nohighlight

quantile_over_time(0.5, {"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m)
  + 3 * stddev_over_time({"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m)
```

The following example creates the corresponding lower bound. The `clamp_min`
function prevents the lower bound from going negative for metrics that can't have negative
values:

```nohighlight

clamp_min(
    quantile_over_time(0.5, {"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m)
    - 3 * stddev_over_time({"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m),
0)
```

You can graph both bounds together in CloudWatch Query Studio to visualize the expected range
for your metric. For more information, see [Running PromQL queries in Query Studio (Preview)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-PromQL-QueryStudio.html).

### Detecting breaches

To detect when a metric is outside its expected range, combine both bounds into a single
query. The following expression returns only the data points where the metric value exceeds
the upper bound or falls below the lower bound:

```nohighlight

1 * {"app.ads.ad_requests"} > quantile_over_time(0.5, {"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m)
    + 3 * stddev_over_time({"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m)
or
1 * {"app.ads.ad_requests"} < clamp_min(
    quantile_over_time(0.5, {"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m)
    - 3 * stddev_over_time({"app.ads.ad_requests"}[60m] offset 1m),
0)
```

This query works across multiple label values, so you can detect anomalies across your
entire fleet in a single query. You can use this expression to create a PromQL alarm that
triggers when any time series breaches the expected range. For more information, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm using PromQL for anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-PromQL-Alarms.html#promql_alarm_anomaly_detection).
