# Collect NVIDIA GPU metrics

You can use the CloudWatch agent to collect NVIDIA GPU metrics from Linux servers. To set
this up, add a `nvidia_gpu` section inside the `metrics_collected`
section of the CloudWatch agent configuration file. For more information, see [Linux section](cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-details.md#CloudWatch-Agent-Linux-section).

Additionally, the instance must have an NVIDIA driver installed. NVIDIA drivers on
pre-installed on some Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Otherwise, you can manually install
the driver. For more information, see [Install NVIDIA drivers on\
Linux instances](../../../ec2/latest/userguide/install-nvidia-driver.md).

The following metrics can be collected. All of these metrics are collected with no
CloudWatch `Unit`, but you can specify a unit for each metric by adding a parameter
to the CloudWatch agent configuration file. For more information, see [Linux section](cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-details.md#CloudWatch-Agent-Linux-section).

MetricMetric name in CloudWatchDescription

`utilization_gpu`

`nvidia_smi_utilization_gpu`

All of these metrics are collected with the following dimensions:

DimensionDescription

`index`

A unique identifier for the GPU on this server. Represents the NVIDIA
Management Library (NVML) index of the device.

`name`

The type of GPU. For example, `NVIDIA Tesla A100`

`arch`

The server architecture.
