## Database load chart

_Database load (DB Load)_ measures the level of session activity in
your database. DB Load is the key metric in Database Insights, and Database Insights collects DB Load every
second.

![Database Instance Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_did.png)

For more information about DB Load, see [Database load](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Overview.ActiveSessions.html) in the _Amazon RDS User Guide_ or [Database load](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Overview.ActiveSessions.html) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

## Analyze statistics for a query

You might want to analyze statistics for a query with a high DB Load. To analyze
statistics for a query, use the following procedure.

###### To analyze statistics for queries

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. Choose **Insights**.

3. Choose **Database Insights**.

4. Choose the **Database Instance** view.

5. Choose a DB instance.

6. Choose the **Top SQL** tab.

7. To view statistics for a query, choose a query.

![The table displayed in the Top SQL tab.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/DBInsights_LoadTopSQL.png)

## Database telemetry tab

Use the **Database telemetry** tab to view metrics, logs, events, and
slow queries for the selected instance.

### Metrics section for database telemetry

The **Metrics** section displays a default metrics dashboard
customized for each engine type.

You can customize this dashboard by adding OS metrics, database counter metrics,
and CloudWatch metrics to it. You can also remove metrics from the dashboard. You can
customize one dashboard for each engine type in a Region in your account. This means
that all instances for a specific engine type in that Region in the same account
will have the same metrics dashboard.

Users who have edit permissions for your dashboards in your account can edit any
dashboard for any engine.

Changes you make to a dashboard are saved automatically, and apply to every
instance of the database engine in that Region and account.

![Dashboard showing examples of the different types of database metrics.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_dbmetrics.png)

###### To customize the dashboard in the Database telemetry tab for an engine type

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. Choose **Insights**, **Database Insights**.

3. For **Database Views**, choose **Database**
**Instance**.

4. In the **Filters** section, find and choose the database
    instance that you want to view metrics for.

5. Choose the **Database Telemetry** tab, then choose the
    **Metrics** tab.

The default database instance dashboard appears.

6. To add a widget to the dashboard, do the following:
1. Choose **Add Create widget**.

2. In the **Create widget** popup, find the metric
       or metrics that you want to add, and select the checkbox for each
       one. If you select multiple metrics in this step, they will all
       appear in the same new widget on the dashboard. Then choose
       **Create widget**.

      Remember that any changes you make to this dashboard will apply to
       all Database Insights dashboards for this engine type in this Region in the
       account.
7. To delete a graph from the dashboard, choose the vertical ellipsis in the
    widget, then choose **Delete**.

8. To add more metrics to an existing widget in the dashboard, or change its
    title, choose the vertical ellipsis in the widget, and choose
    **Edit**. Then in the **Update**
**widget** popup, find the metric or metrics that you want to
    add, select their checkboxes, and choose **Update Widget**.
    You can also change the widget title.

9. After customizing a dashboard, you can reset it to its original default
    state by choosing **Reset Dashboard**.

### Logs section for database telemetry

The **Logs** section provides a view of database logs exported to
CloudWatch Logs for the selected DB instance.

![Database telemetry in the Database Instance Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_did-telemetry-logs.png)

For information about publishing logs to CloudWatch Logs for Amazon RDS, see [Publishing database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch.html) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_. For information about publishing logs to
CloudWatch Logs for Amazon Aurora, see [Publishing database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch.html) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

For Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Databases, logs are automatically published to CloudWatch Logs
and are discoverable in the Database Insights console.

### OS processes data for database telemetry

You can use the **OS Processes** tab within the
**Database telemetry** tab to view metrics for the operating
system (OS) that your DB instance runs on. The metrics provide a snapshot of OS
processes running on your databases for a given timestamp, as well as key metrics
such as memory and CPU utilization for each running process. Database Insights correlates
these metrics with the metrics in your database load chart, so if you choose a data
point in the database load chart, the OS processes data is updated to display
telemetry from the same time stamp.

When you choose a data point, Database Insights automatically select the period to display,
depending on the time range you have chosen for the overall page. The farthest back
that you can go depends on the retention time that you have configured for the
`RDSOSMetrics` log group.

If you haven't chosen a time stamp, by default the table is populated with
telemetry for the latest timestamp.

###### Note

OS process information is available only if you have [Amazon RDS\
Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights_Counters.html) enabled. Enhanced Monitoring incurs additional
charges. For more information, see [Cost of Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.cost). Enhanced Monitoring is automatically
enabled for Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Databases.

![Events table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbinsights-osprocesses.png)

In the **OS processes** view, the following data is displayed for
each process:

- **Process ID** –The ID of this process.

- **Virtual memory** –The amount of virtual memory
allocated to the process, in Kibibytes.

- **Residual address** – The actual physical memory
being used by the process.

- **CPU %** – The percentage of the total CPU
bandwidth being used by the process.

- **Memory %** – The percentage of the total memory
being used by the process.

- **VM limit** – The maximum amount of virtual
memory that can be allocated to the process.

If the value in this column is 0, then VM limits are not applicable to
that process.

The monitoring data that is displayed is retrieved from Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You can also
retrieve these metrics directly from the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. For more information,
see [Viewing\
OS metrics using CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.CloudWatchLogs.html).

OS processes metrics are not returned during the following:

- A failover of the database instance.

- Changing the instance class of the database instance (scale
compute).

OS processes metrics are returned during a reboot of a database instance because
only the database engine is rebooted. Metrics for the operating system are still
reported.

### Slow SQL Queries section for database telemetry

To view slow SQL queries and query patterns, you must enable log exports to CloudWatch Logs
and configure DB parameters for your database.

For information about publishing Amazon RDS logs to CloudWatch Logs, see [Publishing database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch.html) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

For information about publishing Aurora logs to CloudWatch Logs, see [Publishing database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Procedural.UploadtoCloudWatch.html) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

For information about configuring DB parameters for your database in Amazon RDS, see
[Configuring\
your database to monitor slow SQL queries with Database Insights for Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DatabaseInsights.SlowSQL.html) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

For information about configuring DB parameters for your database in
Amazon Aurora, see [Configuring your database to monitor slow SQL queries with Database Insights for\
Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_DatabaseInsights.SlowSQL.html) in the _Amazon Aurora User Guide_.

The **Slow SQL Queries** section provides a list of slow query
patterns sorted by frequency. By selecting a pattern, you can view a list of slow
queries that match the selected pattern. You can use the slow query list to identify
slow queries affecting your DB instance.

Database Insights displays statistics for slow queries. The statistics represent only
queries that exceed the configured slow query duration threshold.

![Displays details about an example of a slow SQL query](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_slowsql.png)

###### Important

Slow queries may contain sensitive data. Mask your sensitive data with CloudWatch Logs.
For more information about masking log data, see [Help protect\
sensitive log data with masking](../logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.md) in the
_Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

### Events table

Use the **Events** table to view RDS events for your DB instance. For a
list of events for Amazon Aurora, see [Amazon RDS event\
categories and event messages for Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Events.Messages.html) in the
_Amazon Aurora User Guide_. For a list of events for Amazon Relational Database Service, see
[Amazon RDS event\
categories and event messages for Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Events.Messages.html) in the
_Amazon RDS User Guide_.

![Events table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_did-events.png)

## Calling services tab

Database Insights shows the services and operations that are calling your instance. Database Insights
integrates with CloudWatch Application Signals to provide metrics for each service and operation, including
availability, latency, errors, and volume.

When the endpoint called by the application is an Aurora cluster, Database Insights
will show either the writer or the reader endpoint for the Aurora cluster in the
**Calling services** table, not the individual database instance.
However, when the endpoint called by the application is an Amazon RDS cluster, Database
Insights shows the specific database instance the application is calling within the
Amazon RDS cluster."

![Calling services tab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/dbi_did-calling.png)

## Analyze database performance on demand with CloudWatch Database Insights

Analyze database performance with on-demand analyses for your Amazon RDS databases with
CloudWatch Database Insights.

You can run on-demand performance analysis by selecting **Analyze**
**Performance** on the top right corner of the **Database**
**load** chart. The report will run for the selected time period. Use the
**Performance analysis** tab to view performance analysis reports for
databases in your fleet.
