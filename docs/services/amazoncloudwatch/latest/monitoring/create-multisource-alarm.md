# Create an alarm based on a connected data source

You can create alarms that watch metrics from data sources that aren't in CloudWatch. For more
information about creating connections to these other data sources, see [Query metrics from other data sources](multidatasourcequerying.md).

###### To create an alarm on metrics from a data source that you have connected to

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**, **All**
    **metrics**.

03. Choose the **Multi source query** tab.

04. For **Data source**, select the data source that you want to
     use.

05. The query builder prompts you for the information necessary for the query to
     retrieve the metrics to use for the alarm. The workflow is different for each data
     source, and is tailored to the data source. For example, for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and Prometheus data
     sources, a PromQL query editor box with a query helper appears.

06. When you have finished constructing the query, choose **Graph**
    **query**.

07. If the sample graph looks the way that you expect, choose **Create**
    **alarm**.

08. The **Specify metric and conditions** page appears. If the query
     you are using produces more than one time series, you see a warning banner at the top of
     the page. If you do, select a function to use to aggregate the time series in
     **Aggregation function**.

09. (Optional) Add a **Label** for the alarm.

10. For **Whenever `your-metric-name` is . .**
    **.**, choose **Greater**, **Greater/Equal**,
     **Lower/Equal**, or **Lower**. Then for
     **than . . .**, specify a number for your threshold value.

11. Choose **Additional configuration**. For **Datapoints to**
    **alarm**, specify how many evaluation periods (data points) must be in the
     `ALARM` state to trigger the alarm. If the two values here match, you
     create an alarm that goes to `ALARM` state if that many consecutive periods
     are breaching.

    To create an M out of N alarm, specify a number for the first value that is lower
     than the number for the second value. For more information, see [Alarm evaluation](alarm-evaluation.md).

12. For **Missing data treatment**, choose how the alarm behaves when
     some data points are missing. For more information, see [Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing data](alarms-and-missing-data.md).

13. Choose **Next**.

14. For **Notification**, specify an Amazon SNS topic to notify when your
     alarm transitions to the `ALARM`, `OK`, or
     `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.
    1. (Optional) To send multiple notifications for the same alarm state or for
        different alarm states, choose **Add**
       **notification**.

       ###### Note

       We recommend that you set the alarm to take actions when it goes into
       **Insufficient data** state in addition to when it goes into
       **Alarm** state. This is because many issues with the Lambda
       function that connects to the data source can cause the alarm to transition to
       **Insufficient data**.

    2. (Optional) To not send Amazon SNS notifications, choose **Remove**.
15. To have the alarm perform Auto Scaling, Lambda, or Systems Manager actions, choose the
     appropriate button and choose the alarm state and action to perform. If you choose a
     Lambda function as an alarm action, you specify the function name or ARN, and you can
     optionally choose a specific version of the function.

    Alarms can perform Systems Manager actions only when they go into ALARM state. For more
     information about Systems Manager actions, see see [Configuring CloudWatch to create OpsItems from alarms](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/opscenter-create-opsitems-from-cloudwatch-alarms.md) and [Incident creation](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.md).

    ###### Note

    To create an alarm that performs an SSM Incident Manager action, you must have
    certain permissions. For more information, see [Identity-based policy examples for AWS Systems Manager Incident\
    Manager](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md).

16. Choose **Next**.

17. Under **Name and description**, enter a name and description for
     your alarm, and choose **Next**. The name must contain only UTF-8
     characters, and can't contain ASCII control characters. The description can include
     markdown formatting, which is displayed only in the alarm **Details**
     tab in the CloudWatch console. The markdown can be useful to add links to runbooks or other
     internal resources.

    ###### Tip

    The alarm name must contain only UTF-8 characters. It can't contain ASCII control
    characters.

18. Under **Preview and create**, confirm that your alarm's
     information and conditions are correct, and choose **Create alarm**.
