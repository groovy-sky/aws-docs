# Metrics collected by Application Signals

Application Signals collects both [standard application metrics](#AppSignals-StandardMetrics)
and [runtime metrics](#AppSignals-StandardMetrics) from the applications that you enable it for.

Standard application metrics relate to the most critical parts of service performance, latency and availability.

Runtime metrics track application metrics over time, including memory usage, CPU usage, and garbage collection. Application Signals
displays the runtime metrics in the context of the services that you have enabled for Application Signals. When you
have an operational issue, observing the runtime metrics can be useful to help you find the root cause of the issue. For example, you can
see if spikes in latency in your service relate to spikes in a runtime metric.

## Standard application metrics collected

Application Signals collects _standard application metrics_ from the
services that it discovers. These metrics relate to the most critical aspects of a service's
performance: latency, faults, and errors. They can help you identify issues, monitor performance
trends, and optimize resources to improve the overall user experience.

The following table lists the metrics collected by Application Signals. These metrics are
sent to CloudWatch in the `ApplicationSignals` namespace.

MetricDescription

`Latency`

The delay before data transfer begins after the request is made.

Units: Milliseconds

`Fault`

A count of both HTTP 5XX server-side faults and OpenTelemetry span status errors.

Units: None

`Error`

A count of HTTP 4XX client-side errors. These are considered to be request errors
that are not caused by service problems. Therefore, the `Availability`
metric displayed on Application Signals dashboards does not regard these errors as
service faults.

Units: None

The `Availability` metric displayed on Application Signals dashboards
is computed as **(1 - `Faults`/Total)\*100**. Total responses includes all responses and is derived from `SampleCount(Latency)`.
Successful responses are
all responses without a `5XX` error.
`4XX` responses are treated as successful when Application Signals calculates `Availability`.

### Dimensions collected and dimension combinations

The following dimensions are defined for each of the standard application metrics. For
more information about dimensions, see [Dimensions](cloudwatch-concepts.md#Dimension).

Different dimensions are collected for _service metrics_ and
_dependency metrics_. Within the services discovered by Application
Signals, when microservice A calls microservice B, microservice B is serving the request. In
this case, microservice A emits dependency metrics and microservice B emits service metrics.
When a client calls microservice A, microservice A is serving the request and emits service
metrics.

**Dimensions for service metrics**

The following dimensions are collected for service metrics.

DimensionDescription

`Service`

The name of the service.

The maximum value is 255 characters.

`Operation`

The name of the API operation or other activity.

The maxiumum value is 1024 characters. You can set service level objectives on
operations only if the operation name is 194 characters or fewer.

`Environment`

The name of the environment where services are running. If services are not
running on Amazon EKS, you can specify an optional custom value for
`deployment.environment` in the
`OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_RESOURCES` parameter.

The maximum value is 259 characters.

When you view these metrics in the CloudWatch console, you can view them using the following
dimension combinations:

- `[Environment, Service, Operation, [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

**Dimensions for dependency metrics**

The following dimensions are collected for dependency metrics:

DimensionDescription

`Service`

The name of the service.

The maximum value is 255 characters.

`Operation`

The name of the API operation or other operation.

The maximum value is 1024 characters.

`RemoteService`

The name of the remote service being invoked.

The maximum value is 255 characters.

`RemoteOperation`

The name of the API operation being invoked.

The maximum value is 1024 characters.

`Environment`

The name of the environment where services are running. If services are not
running on Amazon EKS, you can specify an optional custom value for
`deployment.environment` in the
`OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_RESOURCES` parameter.

The maxiumum value is 259 characters.

`RemoteEnvironment`

The name of the environment where dependency services are running. The
`RemoteEnvironment` parameter is automatically generated when a service
calls a dependency and they are both running in the same cluster. Otherwise,
`RemoteEnvironment` is neither generated nor reported in the service
dependency's metrics. Currently only available on Amazon EKS and K8S
platforms.

The maximum value is 259 characters.

`RemoteResourceIdentifier`

The name of the resource invoked by a remote call. The
`RemoteResourceIdentifier` parameter is automatically generated if
service calls a remote AWS service. Otherwise,
`RemoteResourceIdentifier` is neither generated nor reported in the
service dependency's metrics.

The maximum value is 1024 characters.

`RemoteResourceType`

The type of the resource that is invoked by a remote call. Required only if
`RemoteResourceIdentifier` is defined.

The maximum value is 1024 characters.

When you view these metrics in the CloudWatch console, you can view them using the following
dimension combinations:

**Running on Amazon EKS clusters**

- `[Environment, Service, Operation, RemoteService, RemoteOperation,
              RemoteEnvironment, RemoteResourceIdentifier, RemoteResourceType, [Latency, Error,
              Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, Operation, RemoteService, RemoteOperation,
              RemoteEnvironment, [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, Operation, RemoteService, RemoteOperation,
              RemoteResourceIdentifier, RemoteResourceType, [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, Operation, RemoteService, RemoteOperation, [Latency,
              Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, RemoteService, RemoteEnvironment, [Latency, Error,
              Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, RemoteService, [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, RemoteService, RemoteOperation, RemoteEnvironment,
              RemoteResourceIdentifier, RemoteResourceType, [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, RemoteService, RemoteOperation, RemoteEnvironment,
              [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, RemoteService, RemoteOperation, RemoteResourceIdentifier,
              RemoteResourceType, [Latency, Error, Fault]]`

- `[Environment, Service, RemoteService, RemoteOperation, [Latency, Error,
              Fault]]`

- `[RemoteService [Latency, Error,
            Fault]]`

- `[RemoteService, RemoteResourceIdentifier, RemoteResourceType [Latency, Error,
            Fault]]`

## Runtime metrics

Application Signals uses the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry SDK to automatically collect OpenTelemetry-compatible metrics from your Java and Python applications.
To have runtime metrics collected, you must meet the following pre-requisites:

- Your CloudWatch agent must be version `1.300049.1` or later.

- If you use the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on, it must be version `2.30-eksbuild.1` or later. If you update the add-on, you must restart
your applications.

- For Java applications, you must be running `1.32.5` or later of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry SDK for Java.

- For Python applications, you must be running `0.7.0` or later of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry SDK for Python.

- For .Net applications, you must be running `1.6.0` or later of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry SDK for .Net.

Runtime metrics are not collected for Node.js applications.

Runtime metric are charged as part of Application Signals costs. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see
[Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing).

###### Note

**Known issues**

The runtime metrics collection in the Java SDK release v1.32.5 is known to not work with applications using JBoss Wildfly. This issue extends to the
Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on, affecting versions `2.3.0-eksbuild.1` through `2.6.0-eksbuild.1`. The issue is fixed in Java SDK release `v1.32.6` and the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on version `v3.0.0-eksbuild.1`.

If you are impacted, either upgrade the Java SDK version or disable your runtime metrics collection by adding the
environment variable `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_RUNTIME_ENABLED=false` to your application.
