# Internet Monitor cross-account observability

With Internet Monitor cross-account observability, you can monitor your applications that span multiple AWS accounts within a single AWS Region.

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to set up one or more of your AWS accounts as a monitoring account. You’ll provide
the monitoring account with the ability to view data in your source account by creating a _sink_ in your monitoring account.
A sink is a resource that represents an attachment point in a monitoring account. For Internet Monitor, the resource attachment point is a monitor.
You use the sink to create a link from your source account to your monitoring account. For more information, see
[CloudWatch cross-account observability](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md).
