# Application Insights cross-account observability

With CloudWatch Application Insights cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot your applications that span multiple AWS accounts within a single Region.

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to set up one or more of your AWS accounts as a monitoring account. You’ll provide the monitoring account with the ability to view data
in your source account by creating a sink in your monitoring account. You use the sink to create a link from your source account to your monitoring account. For more information, see
[CloudWatch cross-account observability](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md).
