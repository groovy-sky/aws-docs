# Metrics Insights quotas

CloudWatch Metrics Insights currently has the following quotas:

- Query up to two weeks of data for visualization in your metrics, widgets, and alarm graphs. You can query the most recent three hours of data for alarm condition evaluations.

- A single query can process no more than 10,000 metrics. This means that if the
**SELECT**, **FROM**, and **WHERE**
clauses match more than 10,000 metrics, the query only processes the first 10,000 of
these metrics that it finds.

- A single query can return no more than 500 time series. This means that if the query
would return more than 500 metrics, not all metrics will be returned in the query
results. If you use an **ORDER BY** clause, then all the metrics being
processed are sorted, and the 500 that have the highest or lowest values according to
your **ORDER BY** clause are returned.

If you do not include an **ORDER BY** clause, you can't control
which 500 matching metrics are returned.

- You can have as many as 200 Metrics Insights alarms per Region.

- Metrics Insights does not support high-resolution data, which is metric data
reported with a granularity of less than one minute. If you request high-resolution
data, the request does not fail, but the output is aggregated at one-minute
granularity.

- Each [GetMetricData](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-getmetricdata.md) operation
can have only one query, but you can have multiple widgets in a dashboard that each
include a query.

- If a query using tag(s) with a **GROUP BY** or **WHERE**
matches a metric that has more than 10 tag updates, only the most recent 10 tagged versions
of the metric will be included in the query results.
