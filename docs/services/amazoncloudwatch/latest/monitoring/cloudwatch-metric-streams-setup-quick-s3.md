# Use Quick Amazon S3 setup

The **Quick S3 Setup** method works well
if you want to quickly set up a stream to Amazon S3 and you don't need any formatting transformation beyond
the supported JSON, OpenTelemetry 1.0.0, and OpenTelemetry 0.7.0 formats.
CloudWatch will create all necessary resources including the Firehose delivery stream and the
necessary IAM roles. The default format for this option is JSON, but you can
change the format while you set up the stream.

Alternatively, if you want the final format to be Parquet format or Optimized Row Columnar (ORC),
you should instead follow the steps in
[Custom setup with Firehose](cloudwatch-metric-streams-setup-datalake.md).

## CloudWatch console

This section describes how to use the CloudWatch console to set up a
metric stream Amazon S3 using Quick S3 setup.

###### To set up a metric stream using Quick S3 setup

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**,
     **Streams**. Then choose **Create metric stream**.

03. (Optional) If you are signed in to an account that is set up as a monitoring account
     in CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can choose whether to include metrics from linked source
     accounts in this metric stream. To include metrics from source accounts, choose
     **Include source account metrics**.

04. Choose **Quick S3 setup**.
     CloudWatch will create all necessary resources including the Firehose delivery stream and the
     necessary IAM roles. The default format for this option is JSON, but you can
     change the format later in this procedure.

05. (Optional) Choose
     **Select existing resources** to use an existing S3
     bucket or existing IAM roles instead of having CloudWatch create new ones
     for you.

06. (Optional) To change the output format from the default format for your scenario, choose
     **Change output format**. The supported formats are
     JSON, OpenTelemetry 1.0.0, and OpenTelemetry 0.7.0.

07. For **Metrics to be streamed**, choose either
     **All metrics** or **Select metrics**.

    If you choose **All metrics**, all metrics from this account
     will be included in the stream.

    Consider carefully whether to stream all metrics, because the more metrics that you stream the
     higher your metric stream charges will be.

    If you choose **Select metrics**, do one of the following:

    - To stream most metric namespaces, choose **Exclude**
       and select the namespaces or metrics to
       exclude. When you specify a namespace in **Exclude**,
       you can optionally select some specific metrics from that namespace to exclude. If you choose
       to exclude a namespace but don't then select metrics in that namespace, all metrics from that namespace
       are excluded.

    - To include only a few metric namespaces or metrics in the metric stream,
       choose **Include** and
       then select the namespaces or metrics to include. If you choose
       to include a namespace but don't then select metrics in that namespace, all metrics from that namespace
       are included.
08. (Optional) To stream additional statistics for some of these metrics beyond Minimum, Maximum,
     SampleCount, and Sum, choose **Add additional statistics**. Either
     choose **Add recommended metrics** to add some commonly used statistics, or
     manually select the
     namespace and metric name to stream additional statistics for. Next, select
     the additional statistics to stream.

    To then choose another group of metrics to stream a different set of additional statistics for, choose
     **Add additional statistics**. Each metric can include as many
     as 20 additional statistics, and as many as 100 metrics within a metric stream can include
     additional statistics.

    Streaming additional statistics incurs more charges. For more information,
     see [Statistics that can be streamed](cloudwatch-metric-streams-statistics.md).

    For definitions of the additional statistics, see
     [CloudWatch statistics definitions](statistics-definitions.md).

09. (Optional) Customize the name of the new metric stream under
     **Metric stream name**.

10. Choose **Create metric stream**.
