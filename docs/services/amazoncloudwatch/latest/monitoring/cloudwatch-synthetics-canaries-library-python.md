## Python and Selenium library classes and functions that apply to all canaries

The following CloudWatch Synthetics Selenium library functions for Python are useful
for all canaries.

###### Topics

- [SyntheticsConfiguration class](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsConfiguration_Python)

- [SyntheticsLogger class](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsLogger_Python)

### SyntheticsConfiguration class

You can use the SyntheticsConfiguration class to configure the behavior of
Synthetics library functions. For example, you can use this class to configure the `
              executeStep()` function to not capture screenshots.

You can set CloudWatch Synthetics configurations at the global level.

Function definitions:

#### set\_config(options)

```python

from aws_synthetics.common import synthetics_configuration
```

`
                  options
                ` is an object, which is a
set of configurable options for your canary. The following sections explain the
possible fields in `
                  options
                `.

- `screenshot_on_step_start` (boolean)— Whether to take a
screenshot before starting a step.

- `screenshot_on_step_success` (boolean)— Whether to take a
screenshot after completing a successful step.

- `screenshot_on_step_failure` (boolean)— Whether to take a
screenshot after a step fails.

**with\_screenshot\_on\_step\_start(screenshot\_on\_step\_start)**

Accepts a Boolean argument, which indicates whether to take a screenshot
before starting a step.

**with\_screenshot\_on\_step\_success(screenshot\_on\_step\_success)**

Accepts a Boolean argument, which indicates whether to take a screenshot
after completing a step successfully.

**with\_screenshot\_on\_step\_failure(screenshot\_on\_step\_failure)**

Accepts a Boolean argument, which indicates whether to take a screenshot
after a step fails.

**get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_start()**

Returns whether to take a screenshot before starting a step.

**get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_success()**

Returns whether to take a screenshot after completing a step successfully.

**get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_failure()**

Returns whether to take a screenshot after a step fails.

**disable\_step\_screenshots()**

Disables all screenshot options (get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_start,
get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_success,
and get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_failure).

**enable\_step\_screenshots()**

Enables all screenshot options (get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_start,
get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_success, and get\_screenshot\_on\_step\_failure). By default, all
these methods are enabled.

**setConfig(options) regarding CloudWatch metrics**

For canaries using `syn-python-selenium-1.1` or later, the **(options)** for **setConfig** can include the following
Boolean parameters that determine which metrics are published by the canary. The
default for each of these options is `true`. The options that start with `
                aggregated` determine whether the metric is emitted without the `
                CanaryName` dimension. You can use these metrics to see the aggregated results
for all of your canaries. The other options determine whether the metric is emitted
with the `CanaryName` dimension. You can use these metrics to see results
for each individual canary.

For a list of CloudWatch metrics emitted by canaries, see [CloudWatch metrics published by canaries](cloudwatch-synthetics-canaries-metrics.md).

- `failed_canary_metric` (boolean)— Whether to emit the `
                      Failed` metric (with the `CanaryName` dimension) for this
canary. The default is `true`.

Disables the canary from emitting all request metrics that are emitted with no `
                  CanaryName` dimension.

**disable\_request\_metrics()**

Disables all request metrics, including both per-canary metrics and
metrics aggregated across all canaries.

**disable\_step\_metrics()**

Disables all step metrics, including both step success metrics
and step duration metrics.

**enable\_aggregated\_request\_metrics()**

Enables the canary to emit all request metrics that are emitted with no `
                  CanaryName` dimension.

**enable\_request\_metrics()**

Enables all request metrics, including both per-canary metrics and
metrics aggregated across all canaries.

**enable\_step\_metrics()**

Enables all step metrics, including both step success metrics
and step duration metrics.

**Usage in UI canaries**

First, import the synthetics dependency and fetch the configuration.
Then, set the configuration for each option by calling the setConfig method using
one
of the following options.

```python

from aws_synthetics.common import synthetics_configuration

synthetics_configuration.set_config(
     {
        "screenshot_on_step_start": False,
        "screenshot_on_step_success": False,
        "screenshot_on_step_failure": True
     }
)

or

```

Or

```python

synthetics_configuration.with_screenshot_on_step_start(False).with_screenshot_on_step_success(False).with_screenshot_on_step_failure(True)
```

To disable all screenshots, use the disableStepScreenshots() function as in this
example.

```

synthetics_configuration.disable_step_screenshots()
```

You can enable and disable screenshots at any point in the code. For
example, to disable screenshots only for one step, disable them before running that
step
and then enable them after the step.

##### set\_config(options) for UI canaries

Starting with `syn-python-selenium-1.1`, for UI canaries, `
                  set_config` can include the following Boolean parameters:

- `continue_on_step_failure` (boolean)— Whether to
continue with running the canary script after a step fails (this refers to the **executeStep** function). If any steps fail, the canary run will still
be marked as failed. The default is `false`.

### SyntheticsLogger class

`synthetics_logger` writes logs out to both the console and to a local
log file at the same log level. This log file is written to both locations only if the
log level is at or below the desired logging level of the log function that was
called.

The logging statements in the local log file are prepended with "DEBUG: ", "INFO:
", and so on
to match the log level of the function that was called.

Using `synthetics_logger` is not required to create a log file that is
uploaded to your Amazon S3 results location. You could instead create a different log file
in the `/tmp` folder. Any files created under the `/tmp`
folder are uploaded to the results location in the S3 bucket as artifacts.

To use `synthetics_logger`:

```python

from aws_synthetics.common import synthetics_logger
```

Useful function definitions:

Get log level:

```python

log_level = synthetics_logger.get_level()
```

Set log level:

```python

synthetics_logger.set_level()
```

Log a message with a specified level. The level can be `DEBUG`, `
              INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`, as in the following syntax
examples:

```python

synthetics_logger.debug(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

```python

synthetics_logger.info(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

```python

synthetics_logger.log(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

```python

synthetics_logger.warning(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

```python

synthetics_logger.error(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

For information about debug parameters, see the standard Python documentation at [logging.debug](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)

In these logging functions, the `message` is the message format string.
The `args` are the arguments that are merged into `msg` using
the string formatting operator.

There are three keyword arguments in `kwargs`:

- `exc_info`– If not evaluated as false, adds exception
information to the logging message.

- `stack_info`– defaults to false. If true, adds stack
information to the logging message, including the actual logging call.

- `extra`– The third optional keyword argument, which you can
use to pass in a dictionary that is used to populate the `__dict__` of
the `LogRecord` created for the logging event with user-defined
attributes.

Examples:

Log a message with the level `DEBUG`:

```python

synthetics_logger.debug('Starting step - login.')
```

Log a message with the level `INFO`. `logger.log` is a
synonym for `logger.info`:

```python

synthetics_logger.info('Successfully completed step - login.')
```

or

```python

synthetics_logger.log('Successfully completed step - login.')
```

Log a message with the level `WARN`:

```python

synthetics_logger.warning('Warning encountered trying to publish %s', 'CloudWatch Metric')
```

Log a message with the level `ERROR`:

```python

synthetics_logger.error('Error encountered trying to publish %s', 'CloudWatch Metric')
```

Log an exception:

```python

synthetics_logger.exception(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

Logs a message with level `ERROR`. Exception information is added to
the logging message. You should call this function only from an exception handler.

For information about exception parameters, see the standard Python documentation
at [logging.exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)

The `message` is the message format string. The `args` are
the arguments, which are merged into `msg` using the string formatting
operator.

There are three keyword arguments in `kwargs`:

- `exc_info`– If not evaluated as false, adds exception
information to the logging message.

- `stack_info`– defaults to false. If true, adds stack
information to the logging message, including the actual logging call.

- `extra`– The third optional keyword argument, which you can
use to pass in a dictionary that is used to populate the `__dict__` of
the `LogRecord` created for the logging event with user-defined
attributes.

Example:

```python

synthetics_logger.exception('Error encountered trying to publish %s', 'CloudWatch Metric')
```

## Python and Selenium library classes and functions that apply to UI canaries only

The following CloudWatch Synthetics Selenium library functions for Python are useful only
for UI
canaries.

###### Topics

- [SyntheticsBrowser class](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_SyntheticsBrowser)

- [SyntheticsWebDriver class](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_SyntheticsWebDriver)

### SyntheticsBrowser class

###### Note

`SyntheticsBrowser` is supported only on the Chrome browser.

When you create a browser instance by calling `synthetics_webdriver.Chrome()`,
the returned browser instance is of the type `SyntheticsBrowser`. The `
              SyntheticsBrowser` class inherits the WebDriver class and provides access to all
the methods exposed by the [WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver). It
controls the ChromeDriver, and enables the canary script to drive the browser,
allowing the Selenium WebDriver to work with Synthetics.

###### Note

Synthetics overrides the WebDriver [quit](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/selenium_webdriver_firefox/selenium.webdriver.firefox.webdriver.html) method to take no action. You don't need to worry about quitting the
browser, as Synthetics handles that for you.

In addition to the standard Selenium methods, it also provides the following
methods.

###### Topics

- [set\_viewport\_size(width, height)](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_set_viewport_size)

- [save\_screenshot(filename, suffix)](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_save_screenshot)

#### set\_viewport\_size(width, height)

Sets the viewport of the browser. Example:

```python

browser.set_viewport_size(1920, 1080)
```

#### save\_screenshot(filename, suffix)

Saves screenshots to the `/tmp` directory. The screenshots are
uploaded from there to the canary artifacts folder in the S3 bucket.

_filename_ is the file name for the screenshot, and _suffix_ is an optional string to be used for naming the screenshot.

Example:

```python

browser.save_screenshot('loaded.png', 'page1')
```

### SyntheticsWebDriver class

To use this class, use the following in your script:

```python

from aws_synthetics.selenium import synthetics_webdriver
```

###### Topics

- [add\_execution\_error(errorMessage, ex);](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_addExecutionError)

- [add\_user\_agent(user\_agent\_str)](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_add_user_agent)

- [execute\_step(step\_name, function\_to\_execute)](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_execute_step)

- [get\_http\_response(url)](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_get_http_response)

- [Chrome()](#CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_Python_Chrome)

#### add\_execution\_error(errorMessage, ex);

`errorMessage` describes the error and `ex` is the
exception that is encountered

You can use `add_execution_error` to set execution errors for your
canary. It fails the canary without interrupting the script execution. It also
doesn't impact your `successPercent` metrics.

You should track errors as execution errors only if they are not important to
indicate
the success or failure of your canary script.

An example of the use of `add_execution_error` is the following. You
are monitoring the availability of your endpoint and taking screenshots after the
page has loaded. Because the failure of taking a screenshot doesn't determine
availability of the endpoint, you can catch any errors encountered while taking
screenshots and add them as execution errors. Your availability metrics will still
indicate that the endpoint is up and running, but your canary status will be marked
as failed. The following sample code block catches such an error and adds it as an
execution error.

```python

try:
    browser.save_screenshot("loaded.png")
except Exception as ex:
   self.add_execution_error("Unable to take screenshot", ex)

```

#### add\_user\_agent(user\_agent\_str)

Appends the value of `user_agent_str` to the browser's user agent
header. You must assign `user_agent_str` before creating the browser
instance.

Example:

```python

await synthetics_webdriver.add_user_agent('MyApp-1.0')
```

`add_user_agent` should be used inside an `async`
function.

#### execute\_step(step\_name, function\_to\_execute)

Processes one function. It also does the following:

- Logs that the step started.

- Takes a screenshot named `<stepName>-starting`.

- Starts a timer.

- Executes the provided function.

- If the function returns normally, it counts as passing. If the function
throws, it counts as failing.

- Ends the timer.

- Logs whether the step passed or failed

- Takes a screenshot named `<stepName>-succeeded` or `
                      <stepName>-failed`.

- Emits the `stepName` `SuccessPercent` metric, 100 for
pass or 0 for failure.

- Emits the `stepName` `Duration` metric, with a value
based on the step start and end times.

- Finally, returns what the `functionToExecute` returned or
re-throws what `functionToExecute` threw.

Example:

```python

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

def custom_actions():
        #verify contains
        browser.find_element(By.XPATH, "//*[@id=\"id_1\"][contains(text(),'login')]")
        #click a button
        browser.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="submit"]/a').click()

    await synthetics_webdriver.execute_step("verify_click", custom_actions)

```

#### get\_http\_response(url)

Makes an HTTP request to the provided URL and returns the response code of the
HTTP request. If an exception occurred during the HTTP request, a string with value
"error" is returned instead.

Example:

```python

response_code = syn_webdriver.get_http_response(url)
if not response_code or response_code == "error" or response_code < 200 or response_code > 299:
    raise Exception("Failed to load page!")
```

#### Chrome()

Launches an instance of the Chromium browser and returns the created
instance of the browser.

Example:

```python

browser = synthetics_webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get("https://example.com/)
```

To launch a browser in incognito mode, use the following:

```python

add_argument('——incognito')
```

To add proxy settings, use the following:

```python

add_argument('--proxy-server=%s' % PROXY)
```

Example:

```python

from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
chrome_options = Options()
chrome_options.add_argument("——incognito")
browser = syn_webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=chrome_options)
```
