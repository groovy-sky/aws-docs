# Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console

###### Note

We recommend that you
use CloudWatch cross-account observability to get the richest cross-account observability and discovery experience for your metrics, logs, and traces within a Region.
For more information, see
[CloudWatch cross-account observability](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md).

The cross-account, cross-Region CloudWatch console allows you to easily switch between different accounts and Region by using
selectors in the console to view the dashboards, alarms, and metrics in other accounts and Regions. This feature also
allows you to create cross-account, cross-Region dashboards which summarize your CloudWatch metrics from multiple AWS accounts and multiple Regions
into a single dashboard, making them accessible without having to switch accounts or Regions.

Many organizations have their AWS resources deployed in multiple accounts, to provide billing and security boundaries. In this case, we
recommend that you designate one or more of your accounts as your _monitoring accounts_, and build your cross-account cross-Region dashboards
in these accounts. Cross-account cross-Region console functionality is integrated with AWS Organizations, to help you efficiently build your cross-account cross-Region dashboards.

The cross-account, cross-region CloudWatch console experience does not provide cross-account cross-Region visibility for logs. Additionally, it does not support the creation of
alarms on metrics in other accounts or Regions from within a monitoring account.

## Enabling cross-account cross-Region functionality in CloudWatch

To set up cross-account cross-Region functionality in your CloudWatch console, use the
CloudWatch console to set up your sharing accounts and monitoring accounts.

**Set up a sharing account**

You must enable sharing in each account that will make data available to the monitoring account.

This will grant the read-only permissions that you choose in step 5 to all users
that view a cross account dashboard in the account that you share with, if the
user has corresponding permissions in the account that you share with.

###### To enable your account to share CloudWatch data with other accounts

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**.

3. For **Share your CloudWatch data**, choose **Configure**.

4. For **Sharing**, choose **Specific accounts** and enter the IDs of the accounts
    that you want to share data with.

Any accounts that you specify here can view your account's CloudWatch data.
    Specify the IDs only of accounts that you know and trust.

5. For **Permissions**, specify how to share your data
    with one of the following options:

- **Provide read-only access to your CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, and**
**alarms**. This option enables the monitoring accounts to
create cross-account dashboards that include widgets that
contain CloudWatch data from your account.

- **Include CloudWatch automatic dashboards**. If you select this option, users in
the monitoring account can also view the information in this account's
automatic dashboards. For more information, see [Getting started with CloudWatch automatic dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/GettingStarted.html).

- **Include X-Ray read-only access for the X-Ray Trace Map**.
If you select this option, users in
the monitoring account can also view the X-Ray trace map
and X-Ray trace information in this account. For more information, see
[Using the\
X-Ray Trace Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-servicemap.html).

- **Include read-only access for Database Insights**.
If you select this option, users in
the monitoring account can also view Database Insights telemetry in this account. For more information, see
[Set up cross-account cross-region monitoring for CloudWatch Database Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Database-Insights-Cross-Account-Cross-Region.html).

- **Full read-only access to everything in your account**. This option enables
the accounts that you use for sharing to create cross-account
dashboards that include widgets that contain CloudWatch data from
your account. It also enables those accounts to look deeper into your
account and view your account's data in the consoles of other AWS
services.

6. Choose **Launch CloudFormation template**.

In the confirmation screen, type `Confirm`, and
    choose **Launch template**.

7. Select the **I acknowledge...** check box, and choose **Create stack**.

**Sharing with an entire organization**

Completing the preceding procedure creates an IAM role which enables your account to share data with one account. You can create or edit an IAM role that
shares your data with all accounts in an organization. Do this only if you know and trust all accounts in the organization.

This will grant the read-only permissions listed in the policies shown in step 5 of the
previous procedure to all users that view a cross-account dashboard in the account that you share with,
if the user has corresponding permissions in the account that you share with.

###### To share your CloudWatch account data with all accounts in an organization

1. If you haven't already, complete the preceding procedure to share your data with one AWS account.

2. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

4. In the list of roles, choose **CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole**.

5. Choose **Trust relationships**, **Edit trust relationship**.

You see a policy like this:
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
}

```

6. Change the policy to the following, replacing `org-id` with the ID of your organization.
JSON

```json

{
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "*"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
           "StringEquals": {
             "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "org-id"
           }
         }

       }
     ]
}

```

7. Choose **Update Trust Policy**.

**Set up a monitoring account**

Enable each monitoring account if you want to view cross-account CloudWatch data.

When you complete the following procedure, CloudWatch creates a service-linked role that CloudWatch uses in the monitoring account to access data
shared from your other accounts. This service-linked role is called **AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount**. For more information,
see [Using service-linked roles for CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-service-linked-roles.html).

###### To enable your account to view cross-account CloudWatch data

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane,
    choose **Settings**,
    and then,
    in the **Cross-account cross-region** section,
    choose **Configure**.

3. Under the **View cross-account cross-region** section,
    choose **Enable**,
    and then select the **Show selector in the console** checkbox
    to enable an account selector to appear
    in the CloudWatch console
    when you're graphing a metric or creating an alarm.

4. Under **View cross-account cross-region**, choose one
    of the following options:

- **Account Id Input**. This option prompts you to manually input an account ID
each time that you want to switch accounts when you view cross-account
data.

- **AWS Organization account selector**. This option causes the accounts that
you specified when you completed your cross-account
integration with Organizations to appear. When you next use the console, CloudWatch
displays a dropdown list of these accounts for you to select from when
you are viewing cross-account data.

To do this, you must have first used your organization
management account to allow CloudWatch to see a list of accounts in your organization.
For more information, see [(Optional) Integrate with AWS Organizations](#cross-account-and-AWS-organizations).

- **Custom account selector**. This option prompts you to enter a list of
account IDs. When you next use the console, CloudWatch displays a dropdown
list of these accounts for you to select from when you are viewing
cross-account data.

You can also enter a label for each of these accounts to help you identify them when choosing accounts to view.

The account selector settings that a user makes here are retained only for that user, not for all other
users in the monitoring account.

5. Choose **Enable**.

After you complete this setup, you can create cross-account dashboards.
For more information, see [Creating a customized CloudWatch dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create_dashboard.html).

**Cross-Region functionality**

Cross-Region functionality is built in to this feature automatically. You do not need to take any extra
steps to be able to display metrics from different Regions in a single account on the same
graph or the same dashboard. Cross-Region functionality is not supported for alarms, so you can't create an
alarm in one Region that watches a metric in a different Region.

## (Optional) Integrate with AWS Organizations

If you want to integrate cross-account functionality with AWS Organizations, you must make a list of all accounts
in the organization available to the monitoring accounts.

###### To enable cross-account CloudWatch functionality to access a list of all accounts in your organization

1. Sign in to your organization's management account.

2. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

3. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**, then choose **Configure**.

4. For **Grant permission to view the list of accounts in the organization**,
    choose **Specific accounts** to be prompted to enter a
    list of account IDs. The list of accounts in your organization are
    shared with only the accounts that you specify here.

5. Choose **Share organization account list**.

6. Choose **Launch CloudFormation template**.

In the confirmation screen, type `Confirm`, and
    choose **Launch template**.

## Troubleshooting your CloudWatch cross-account setup

This section contains troubleshooting tips for cross-account, console deployment in CloudWatch.

**I am getting access denied errors displaying cross-account data**

Check the following:

- Your monitoring account should have a role named **AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount**. If it does not,
you need to create this role. For more information, see [Set Up a Monitoring Account](#setup_monitoring_account).

- Each sharing account should have a role named **CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole**. If it does not,
you need to create this role. For more information, see [Set Up A Sharing Account](#setup_sharing_account).

- The sharing role must trust the monitoring account.

###### To confirm that your roles are set up properly for the CloudWatch cross-account console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**.

3. In the list of roles, make sure the needed role exists. In a sharing account, look for **CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole**.
    In a monitoring account, look for **AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount**.

4. If you are in a sharing account and **CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole** already exists, choose **CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole**.

5. Choose **Trust relationships**, **Edit trust relationship**.

6. Confirm that the policy lists either the account ID of the monitoring account, or the organization ID of an organization that contains the monitoring
    account.

**I don't see an account dropdown in the console**

First, check that you have created the correct IAM roles, as discussed in the preceding troubleshooting section. If those are set up
correctly, make sure that you have enabled
this account to view cross-account data, as described in [Enable Your Account to View Cross-Account Data](#view_cross_account).

## Monitoring account permissions for cross-account access

To access an action in source accounts successfully, the user in the monitoring account must have the equivalent permission for all resources (\*) for that action in the monitoring account. This is a local permission requirement in the monitoring account and is unrelated to permissions in the cross-account sharing role in source accounts.

### Example

To start a Logs query in a source account, you must have wildcard (\*) access to StartQuery in the monitoring account. The source account's cross-account role can still restrict access to specific log groups.

**Supported - wildcard resource:**

```json

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "logs:StartQuery",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

**Not supported - specific ARN:**

```json

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "logs:StartQuery",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:/aws/lambda/my-function:*"
}
```

## Disabling and cleaning up after using cross-account

To disable cross-account functionality for CloudWatch, follow these steps.

**Step 1: Remove the cross-account stacks or roles**

The best method is to remove the CloudFormation stacks that were used to enable cross-account
functionality.

- In each of the sharing accounts, remove the
**CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole** stack.

- If you used AWS Organizations to enable cross-account functionality with all accounts in an
organization, remove the
**CloudWatch-CrossAccountListAccountsRole** stack in
the organization's management account.

If you didn't use the CloudFormation stacks to enable cross-account functionality, do the following:

- In each of the sharing accounts, delete the
**CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole** IAM role.

- If you used AWS Organizations to enable cross-account functionality with all accounts in an
organization, delete the
**CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharing-ListAccountsRole** IAM role in
the organization's management account.

**Step 2: Remove the service-linked role**

In the monitoring account, delete the **AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount**
service-linked IAM role.
