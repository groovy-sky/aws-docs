# Deleting the CloudWatch agent and Fluent Bit for Container Insights

If you installed Container Insights by using installing the CloudWatch Observability
add-on for Amazon EKS, you can delete Container Insights and the CloudWatch agent by entering the
following command:

###### Note

The Amazon EKS add-on now supports Container Insights on Windows worker nodes. If you
delete the Amazon EKS add-on, Container Insights for Windows is also deleted.

```nohighlight

aws eks delete-addon —cluster-name my-cluster —addon-name amazon-cloudwatch-observability
```

Otherwise, to delete all resources related to the CloudWatch agent and Fluent Bit, enter
the following command. In this command, `My_Cluster_Name` is
the name of your Amazon EKS or Kubernetes cluster, and `My_Region`
is the name of the Region where the logs are published.

```nohighlight

ClusterName=My_Cluster_Name
RegionName=My-Region
