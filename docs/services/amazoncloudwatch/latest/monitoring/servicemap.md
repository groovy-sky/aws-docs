# View your application topology and monitor operational health with the CloudWatch application map

###### Note

The CloudWatch application map replaces the Service Map. To see a map of your application based
on AWS X-Ray traces, open the [X-Ray Trace Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-servicemap.html). Choose
**Trace Map** under the **X-Ray** section in the left
navigation pane of the CloudWatch console.

After enabling your application for Application Signals, the application map displays nodes representing your groups. You then drill down in these groups to view your services and their dependencies.
Use the application map to view the topology of your application clients, synthetics canaries,
services and dependencies, and monitor operational health. To view the application map, open the
[CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) and choose **Application**
**Map** under the **Application Signals** section in the left
navigation pane.

After you [enable your application for\
Application Signals](cloudwatch-application-signals-enable.md), use the application map to make it easier to monitor your
application's operational health:

- View connections between client, canary, service, and dependency nodes to help you
understand your application topology and execution flow. This is especially helpful if your
service operators are not your development team.

- See which services are meeting or not meeting your [service level objectives (SLOs)](cloudwatch-servicelevelobjectives.md). When a
service is not meeting your SLOs, you can quickly identify whether a downstream service or
dependency might be contributing to the issue or impacting multiple upstream services.

- Select an individual client, synthetics canary, service, or dependency node to see
related metrics. The [Service details](servicedetail.md) page shows more
detailed information about operations, dependencies, synthetics canaries, and client pages.

- Filter and zoom the application map to make it easier to focus on a part of your application
topology, or see the entire map. Create a filter by choosing one or more properties from the
filter text box. As you choose each property, you are guided through filter criteria. You
will see the complete filter below the filter text box. Choose **Clear**
**filters** at any time to remove the filter.

- Monitor services across multiple AWS accounts in a single unified application map. Services from different accounts are clearly identified with account information, enabling unified observability for distributed applications.

- Identify services not yet instrumented in your application. Application Signals automatically detects and displays services that haven't been instrumented yet, helping you achieve complete observability coverage. Un-instrumented services are visually distinguished on the map to help you prioritize instrumentation efforts.

- Group and filter services to create customized views that match your workflows. This organization helps you quickly find and access the services you use most frequently

- Save your filtered and grouped views to quickly return to frequently used configurations

## Explore the application map

When you visit the application map, by default it shows services grouped by **Related services**. Related services group services based on their dependencies. For example, if Service A calls Service B, which calls Service C, they're grouped under Service A. You can view SLI health, metrics and service count for all services in each group.

![CloudWatch default application map grouped by related services.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-overview.png)

Choose a tab for information about exploring each kind of node and the edges (connections)
between them.

### Dynamic grouping and filtering

You can click the **Group by** dropdown to use different grouping options. By default, Application Map provides 2 groupings:

- **Related services** \- Groups services based on their dependencies

- **Environment** \- Groups services by their environment

If you want to define your own custom grouping, click **Manage groups** to define custom groups and then tag your services or add OTEL Resource Attributes with the group key.

###### Note

To enable grouping via OTEL resource attributes, the CloudWatch agent version must be v1.300056.0 or later.

![Create custom grouping panel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-create-custom-grouping.png)

Default grouping in Application Signals automatically organizes services based on their downstream dependencies. The system analyzes the service dependency graph and creates groups where the root node (a service with no upstream dependencies) becomes the group name. All services that depend on this root service, either directly or indirectly, are automatically included in the group. For example, if Service A calls Service B, which in turn calls Service C, all three services will be grouped together with Service A as the group name since it's the root of the dependency chain. This automatic grouping mechanism provides a natural way to visualize and manage related services based on their actual runtime interactions and dependencies.

### Group actions and insights

For each group, you can perform the following actions:

- Click **View more** to view metrics charts, the last two change events, and last deployment time for the group

![View more drawer for group in application map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-view-more.png)

- Click **View dashboard** to view metrics dashboard, change events table, and service list for the group

![View application dashboard for group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-team-overview.png)

![View application dashboard for group with metrics graphs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-team-overview-2.png)

You can use **Group and filter** on the left bar to filter groups which have services with deployment time, SLI health status or compute platform type.

![Grouping and filter services on the application dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-grouping-filter.png)

You can also filter by account to view services from specific AWS accounts in your cross-account observability setup.

![Filter services by account on the application dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-account-filter.png)

Use the **Search and filter** bar to search groups by name or search groups which contain specific service environment or dependency. Filter by account ID to focus on services from specific accounts.

![Search and filter services in application map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-search-and-filter.png)

### Configuring custom groups

Custom grouping allows you to organize your services logically based on your business requirements and operational priorities. This feature enables you to view and save defined views prioritized by your specific needs,
create groups based on team ownership, and assemble groups of services needed for critical business transactions.

Create the custom group names (the group names you will see in the UI) and the corresponding group key names. Complete this step either from the Application Signals UI or
using the [PutGroupingConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/applicationsignals/latest/APIReference/API_PutGroupingConfiguration.html) API.

Group key names can be either, AWS tag key or OTEL resource attribute for your service. When deciding between tags and OTEL resource attributes, consider your compute platform:

- For single-service platforms (for example, Lambda or Auto Scaling Group) – Use AWS tags

- For multi-service platforms (for example, Amazon EKS cluster) – Use OTEL resource attributes for more granular grouping

**Adding AWS tags**

Add an AWS tag with the custom group key as a key and a value to an Amazon EKS cluster. When there are multiple services running in one Amazon EKS cluster all of them are
tagged with the same custom group key. For example, when Amazon EKS Cluster A has Service 1, Service 2 and Service 3 running, adding an AWS tag with key _Team X_
to the cluster will add all three services to _Team X_. To add only specific services to _Team X_, add OTEL resource attributes for the services as shown below.

**Adding OTEL resource attributes**

To add an OTEL resource attribute, see the configuration below:

**General configuration**

Configure the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable in your application using the custom group key-value pairs. The keys are listed under
`aws.application_signals.metric_resource_keys` separated by `&`.

For example, to create custom groups using `Application=PetClinic` and `Owner=Test`, use the following:

```

OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=Application=PetClinic,Owner=Test,aws.application_signals.metric_resource_keys=Application&Owner
```

**Platform-specific configuration**

The following are the deployment specifications.

**Amazon EKS and native kubernetes**

```

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  replicas: 1
  ...
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: your-app
        image: your-app-image
        env:
          ...
          - name: OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
            value: Application=PetClinic,Owner=Test,aws.application_signals.metric_resource_keys=Application&Owner
```

**Amazon EC2**

Add `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to your application start script. For the complete example, see [Adding `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`](cloudwatch-application-signals-enable-ec2main.md#CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Monitor-EC2).

```

...
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=$YOUR_SVC_NAME,Application=PetClinic,Owner=Test,aws.application_signals.metric_resource_keys=Application&Owner" \
java -jar $MY_JAVA_APP.jar
```

**Amazon ECS**

Add `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to the TaskDefinition. For the complete example, see [Enable on Amazon ECS](cloudwatch-application-signals-enable-ecsmain.md).

```

{
  "name": "my-app",
   ...
  "environment": [
    {
      "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
      "value": "service.name=$YOUR_SVC_NAME,Application=PetClinic,Owner=Test,aws.application_signals.metric_resource_keys=Applicationmanagement portalOwner"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Lambda**

Add `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to the Lambda environment variable.

```

OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="Application=PetClinic,Owner=Test,aws.application_signals.metric_resource_keys=Application&Owner"
```

### Viewing services within groups

To view services and their dependencies in a group, click on the Group name. It will show a map of services inside the group. Each service node will show SLI health, metrics and platform details. Services with SLI breach are highlighted to be easily recognizable.

![CloudWatch application map services within group.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/View-services-groups.png)

Un-instrumented services are displayed with a distinctive visual indicator (such as a dashed border or different color) to differentiate them from instrumented services. Hover over an un-instrumented service node to see instrumentation guidance and links to setup documentation.

![Filter by uninstrumented services on application map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-uninstrumented-filter.png)

All Canaries, RUM Clients and AWS Service nodes will be collapsed by default. If services in this group call services which are not part of this group, they will also be collapsed by default.

![Canary nodes are collapsed into a group in application map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-canary-collapse.png)

If your map is still too large to investigate effectively, you can apply nested grouping to narrow down your investigation. For example, after grouping services by **Business Unit**, if you still have too many services in a group, use the Group by dropdown to select **Team**, creating a nested grouping structure.

![Nested grouping in application map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-nested-grouping.png)

### Service insights and details

While on this page you can also click **Save view** next to search bar to save your view so next time you don't have to apply the same grouping and filtering again.

![Save grouping configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-save-view.png)

Click on **View more** in service node to view Service Audit, Change events, SLI health and Metrics graphs.

![CloudWatch application map service insights.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-service-view-more.png)

If you want to view service operation and other service detail, click on **View dashboard** to go to service overview page.

![CloudWatch application map service overview.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-service-overview.png)

Alternatively you can click on Edge to view metrics of a specific dependency call of a service.

![CloudWatch application map node edge drawer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-edge.png)

### Change Events

Track change events across your application with Application Signals' automatic processing of CloudTrail events. Monitor configuration and deployment events for services and their dependencies, providing immediate context for operational analysis and troubleshooting. Change event detection is enabled alongside service discovery enablement through the CloudWatch Console or StartDiscovery API. For EKS services, deployment detection requires that the EKS services are instrumented with the Application Signals instrumentation SDK. Application Signals automatically correlates deployment times with performance changes, helping you quickly identify if recent deployments contributed to service issues. View change event history and impact across your services without additional configuration or setup requirements.

### Audit findings

Discover critical insights through Application Signals' audit findings. The service analyzes your applications to report significant observations and potential problems, simplifying root cause analysis. These automated findings consolidate relevant traces, eliminating the need to navigate through multiple clicks. The audit system helps teams quickly identify issues and their underlying causes, enabling faster problem resolution.

For services running on Amazon Bedrock, Application Signals automatically monitors GenAI token usage patterns. The audit system detects anomalies in input and output token consumption, comparing current usage against historical baselines. When token usage exceeds normal patterns, audit findings provide detailed analysis including token consumption trends, cost implications, and recommendations for optimization. This helps teams identify inefficient prompts, unexpected token spikes, and opportunities to reduce GenAI operational costs.

### Cross-Account Observability on Application Map

Application Signals supports cross-account observability, allowing you to monitor and visualize services distributed across multiple AWS accounts in a single unified application map. This capability is essential for organizations with multi-account architectures following AWS best practices.

**Key Capabilities:**

- _Unified View_: View services from multiple AWS accounts in a single application map, providing a complete picture of your distributed application architecture.

- _Account Identification_: Each service node clearly displays its account ID and region, making it easy to identify service ownership and location.

- _Centralized Monitoring_: Monitor the health, performance, and SLO status of services across all connected accounts from a single monitoring account.

- _Cross-Account Filtering_: Filter and group services by account ID to focus on specific accounts or view cross-account interactions.

**How It Works:**

Application Signals uses AWS Organizations and cross-account sharing to enable observability across multiple accounts. To setup cross account observability please refer to [CloudWatch cross-account observability](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account.md).

View your application services

**Service (Instrumented)**

You can view your application services and the status of their SLOs and service
level indicators (SLIs) in the **Application Map**. If you didn't create
SLOs for a service, choose the **Create SLO** button below the service
node.

The **Application Map** displays all of your services. It also shows
the customers and canaries that consume the service and the dependencies that your
services calls, as shown in the following image:

![A CloudWatch application map displaying healthy and unhealthy service.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-map-service-healthy-unhealthy.png)

When you select a service node, a pane opens displaying detailed service
information:

- Total error and fault rate.

- The number of SLIs and SLOs that are `healthy` or
`unhealthy`.

- The option to view more information about an SLO.

- The `Cluster`, `Namespace`, and `Workload` for services hosted in Amazon EKS, or Environment for services hosted in Amazon ECS or Amazon EC2. For Amazon EKS-hosted services, choose any link to open CloudWatch Container Insights.

- AccountId and region.

- The **Change** section showing recent change events and the last deployment time.

- The **Operational Audit** tab providing automated audit findings and recommendations.

- Service Metrics chart of Availability, latency, fault and errors.

Select an edge or connection between a service node and a downstream service or
dependency node. This opens a pane containing top paths by fault rate, latency, and
error rate, as shown in the following example image. Choose any link in the pane to open
the [Service details](servicedetail.md) page and see detailed
information for the chosen service or dependency.

![A CloudWatch application map service edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/App-signals-service-edge.png)

When you select a edge node, a pane opens displaying detailed service information:

- Total request count, latency, error rate and fault rate

- Top path by fault rate

- Top path by latency

- Top path by error rate

**Service (Un-instrumented)**

Un-instrumented services appear on the Application Map even when they haven't been configured with Application Signals. These services are automatically discovered by leveraging Resource Explorer using application names and tags. The system can automatically detect up to 3,000 resources in your AWS account.

When you select an un-instrumented service node, a pane opens displaying:

- Service name and identification information

- AccountId and region where the service is detected

- Instrumentation status and guidance

- Call to action button "Enable Application Signals" that provides setup instructions

- Compute platform type (if detectable)

Un-instrumented services help you:

- Identify gaps in your observability coverage

- Prioritize which services to instrument next based on their position in your architecture

- Understand the complete application topology even before full instrumentation

- Plan instrumentation rollout across your organization

###### Note

Un-instrumented services display limited telemetry data since they don't actively send metrics or traces.

![CloudWatch application map instrumentation filter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/explore-application-map-instrumentation-filter.png)

View dependencies

Your application dependencies are displayed on the application map, connected to the
services that call them.

Choose a dependency node to open a pane containing error rate and fault rate, metrics chart for request, availability, latency, fault rate, and error rate.

If the dependency node is a service or resource, then the pane will display change events for the requested time range.
