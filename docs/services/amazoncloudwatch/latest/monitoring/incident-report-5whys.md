# Using 5 Whys analysis in incident reports

When generating incident reports, CloudWatch investigations can perform a 5 Whys root cause analysis to
systematically identify the underlying causes of operational issues. This structured
approach enhances your incident reports with deeper insights and actionable remediation
steps.

This feature uses Amazon Q to provide a conversational chat. The user signed into the
AWS Management Console must have the following permissions:

```

{
    "Sid" : "AmazonQAccess",
    "Effect" : "Allow",
    "Action" : [
       "q:StartConversation",
       "q:SendMessage",
       "q:GetConversation",
       "q:ListConversations",
       "q:UpdateConversation",
       "q:DeleteConversation",
       "q:PassRequest"
     ],
    "Resource" : "*"
 }
```

You can add these permissions directly, or by attaching either the [AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/aiopsconsoleadminpolicy.md) or [AIOpsOperatorAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/aiopsoperatoraccess.md) managed policy to the user or role.

## What is 5 Whys analysis?

The 5 Whys is a root cause analysis technique that asks "why" repeatedly to drill
down from incident symptoms to fundamental causes. Each answer becomes the basis for
the next question, creating a logical chain that reveals the true root cause rather
than just surface-level symptoms.

During incident report generation, CloudWatch investigations uses this method to analyze investigation
findings and provide structured root cause analysis that goes beyond immediate
technical failures to identify process, configuration, or systemic issues.

## Benefits for incident reporting

Including 5 Whys analysis in incident reports provides several advantages:

- **Comprehensive root cause identification** -
Moves beyond immediate technical causes to identify underlying process or
system issues

- **Actionable remediation plans** \- Provides
specific, targeted actions to prevent recurrence rather than temporary
fixes

- **Organizational learning** \- Documents the
complete causal chain for future reference and team knowledge sharing

- **Structured analysis** \- Ensures systematic
investigation rather than ad-hoc problem solving

## Example scenarios in incident reports

### Database connection failure incident

**Initial incident:** E-commerce application
experiencing widespread 500 errors

1. **Why 1:** Why are users getting 500
    errors? The application cannot connect to the primary database.

2. **Why 2:** Why can't the application
    connect to the database? The database instance ran out of available
    connections.

3. **Why 3:** Why did the database run out
    of connections? A batch processing job opened many connections without
    properly closing them.

4. **Why 4:** Why didn't the batch job close
    connections properly? The job's error handling doesn't include
    connection cleanup in failure scenarios.

5. **Why 5:** Why wasn't proper error
    handling implemented? Code review process doesn't include specific
    checks for resource management patterns.

**Root cause:** Inadequate code review standards
for resource management

**Recommended actions:** Update code review
checklist, implement connection pooling monitoring, add automated resource leak
detection

### Performance degradation incident

**Initial incident:** API response times
increased from 200ms to 5000ms during traffic spike

1. **Why 1:** Why did response times
    increase? CPU utilization reached 100% on all application
    instances.

2. **Why 2:** Why didn't auto scaling add
    more instances? Auto scaling was triggered but new instances failed
    health checks.

3. **Why 3:** Why did new instances fail
    health checks? The application startup process takes 8 minutes, longer
    than the health check timeout.

4. **Why 4:** Why does startup take so long?
    The application downloads large configuration files from S3 on every
    startup.

5. **Why 5:** Why wasn't this startup delay
    considered in auto scaling configuration? Performance testing was done
    with pre-warmed instances, not cold starts.

**Root cause:** Performance testing methodology
doesn't reflect production auto scaling scenarios

**Recommended actions:** Include cold start
testing, optimize application startup, adjust health check timeouts, implement
configuration caching

### Complex incident with branch analysis

**Initial incident:** OpenSearch Serverless
customers experienced 48.3% availability degradation for 11 hours

**Main analysis chain:**

1. **Why 1:** Why did customers experience
    service degradation? Service availability dropped to 48.3% due to
    incorrect ingester scaling.

2. **Why 2:** Why was ingester scaling
    incorrect? CortexOperator reduced ingesters from 223 to 174 due to AZ
    balance miscalculation.

3. **Why 3:** Why did CortexOperator
    miscalculate AZ balance? The code couldn't process new Kubernetes label
    formats after version 1.17 upgrade.

4. **Why 4 (Branch A - Technical):** Why
    didn't the code handle new label formats? The code expected
    'failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone' labels but Kubernetes 1.17
    changed to 'topology.kubernetes.io/zone'.

5. **Why 5 (Branch A):** Why wasn't backward
    compatibility implemented? The label format change wasn't documented in
    the upgrade notes reviewed during deployment planning.

**Branch B - Process Analysis:**

1. **Why 4 (Branch B - Process):** Why
    wasn't this caught in testing? Integration tests used pre-configured
    clusters with old label formats.

2. **Why 5 (Branch B):** Why didn't testing
    include label format validation? Test environment setup didn't mirror
    production Kubernetes version upgrade sequence.

**Root causes identified:**

- Technical: Missing backward compatibility for Kubernetes label format
changes

- Process: Testing methodology doesn't validate version upgrade
impacts

**Integrated remediation plan:** Implement label
format detection logic, enhance upgrade testing procedures, add automated
compatibility validation, and establish version change impact assessment
process.

## Using the guided 5 Whys workflow

CloudWatch investigations provides a guided 5 Whys analysis workflow to help you address missing facts
and strengthen your incident reports. This feature appears as a suggested workflow
when the system identifies opportunities to enhance root cause analysis.

### Interactive analysis experience

The 5 Whys analysis in CloudWatch investigations uses an interactive, chat-based approach that
guides you through the investigation process. This conversational method helps
ensure comprehensive analysis while maintaining logical flow between
questions.

**Key features of the interactive**
**experience:**

- **Fact-based initialization** \- The
system presents relevant facts from your investigation upfront, using
them to pre-populate obvious answers and clearly indicating fact-based
versus inference-based suggestions

- **Guided probing** \- For each "why"
question, the system suggests answers based on available facts, requests
specific additional context, and guides you to consider important
aspects before proceeding

- **Branch management** \- When multiple
contributing factors are identified, the system clearly presents branch
options, explains relationships between branches, and helps prioritize
parallel investigations

- **Progressive validation** \- For each
response, the system reformulates answers for clarity, seeks
confirmation, highlights key insights, and connects findings to broader
context

This approach ensures that you capture all relevant information while
maintaining focus on the most critical causal relationships.

**Accessing the guided workflow:**

1. During incident report generation, review the **Facts need**
**attention** section in the right panel.

2. Look for the **Guided 5-Whys analysis** suggestion under
    **Suggested workflow**.

3. Choose **Guide me** to start the interactive 5 Whys
    process.

4. Follow the guided prompts to systematically work through each "why"
    question, building a complete causal chain from symptoms to root
    cause.

The guided workflow helps ensure you capture comprehensive root cause information
by walking you through each step of the 5 Whys methodology. The analysis results are
automatically incorporated into your incident report, providing structured
documentation for post-incident reviews and organizational learning.

You can also request a 5 Whys analysis through the chat interface by asking
questions such as "Perform a 5 Whys analysis for this incident" or "What is the root
cause using 5 Whys methodology?"

## Handling complex incidents with multiple causes

Some incidents involve multiple contributing factors that require parallel
analysis paths. CloudWatch investigations supports branch analysis to ensure all significant causes are
identified and addressed.

**When branch analysis is needed:**

- Multiple independent failures occurred simultaneously

- Different system components contributed to the same customer impact

- Both technical and process failures played significant roles

- Cascading failures created multiple causal chains

**Branch analysis process:**

1. **Branch identification** \- The system
    identifies points where multiple causes converge or diverge

2. **Parallel investigation** \- Each branch is
    analyzed using the complete 5 Whys methodology

3. **Connection mapping** \- Relationships
    between branches are documented to show how they interact

4. **Integrated resolution** \- Remediation plans
    address all identified root causes and their interactions

This comprehensive approach ensures that complex incidents receive thorough
analysis and that all contributing factors are addressed in the final remediation
plan.

## Best practices for effective 5 Whys analysis

To maximize the effectiveness of 5 Whys analysis in your incident reports, follow
these best practices derived from operational experience:

### Question formulation guidelines

- **Start with customer impact** \- Begin
each analysis with the customer-facing problem to maintain focus on
business impact

- **Increase technical depth**
**progressively** \- Move from business impact to technical
details as you progress through the questions

- **Maintain logical continuity** \- Ensure
each answer naturally leads to the next question without logical
gaps

- **Include supporting evidence** -
Reference specific metrics, logs, or timeline events to validate each
answer

### Analysis validation

Validate your 5 Whys analysis using these criteria:

- **Logical flow** \- Clear progression from
symptoms to root cause with no missing steps

- **Technical accuracy** \- Correct
terminology, accurate system behavior descriptions, and valid component
interactions

- **Completeness** \- The analysis explains
all observed symptoms and reaches a fundamental cause that, if
addressed, would prevent recurrence

- **Actionability** \- The root cause
identified leads to specific, implementable remediation actions

### Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Stopping at symptoms** \- Don't conclude
the analysis at the first technical failure; continue until you reach
systemic or process causes

- **Blame-focused analysis** \- Focus on
system and process failures rather than individual actions

- **Single-path thinking** \- Consider
multiple contributing factors and use branch analysis when
appropriate

- **Insufficient evidence** \- Ensure each
answer is supported by concrete data from your investigation

### Integration with incident report sections

The 5 Whys analysis integrates with other sections of your incident report to
provide comprehensive documentation:

- **Timeline correlation** \- Each "why"
question can reference specific timeline events, providing temporal context
for causal relationships

- **Metrics validation** \- Answers are
supported by metrics and graphs that demonstrate the technical behaviors
described

- **Impact assessment alignment** \- The first
"why" directly connects to customer impact metrics documented in the impact
assessment section

- **Lessons learned foundation** \- Root causes
identified through 5 Whys analysis directly inform the lessons learned and
corrective actions sections

This integration ensures consistency across your incident report and provides
stakeholders with a complete, coherent narrative from initial symptoms through root
cause to remediation plans.
