# Create a CloudWatch alarm based on anomaly detection

You can create an alarm based on CloudWatch anomaly detection, which analyzes past metric data
and creates a model of expected values. The expected values take into account the typical
hourly, daily, and weekly patterns in the metric.

You set a value for the anomaly detection threshold, and CloudWatch uses this threshold with the
model to determine the "normal" range of values for the metric. A higher value for the
threshold produces a thicker band of "normal" values.

You can choose whether the alarm is triggered when the metric value is above the band of
expected values, below the band, or either above or below the band.

You also can create anomaly detection alarms on single metrics and the outputs of metric
math expressions. You can use these expressions to create graphs that visualize anomaly
detection bands.

In an account set up as a monitoring account for CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can
create anomaly detectors on metrics in source accounts in addition to metrics in the
monitoring account.

For more information, see [Using CloudWatch anomaly detection](cloudwatch-anomaly-detection.md).

###### Note

If you're already using anomaly detection for visualization purposes on a metric in the
Metrics console and you create an anomaly detection alarm on that same metric, then the
threshold that you set for the alarm doesn't change the threshold that you already set for
visualization. For more information, see [Creating a graph](graph-a-metric.md#create-metric-graph).

###### To create an alarm that's based on anomaly detection

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **All**
    **alarms**.

03. Choose **Create alarm**.

04. Choose **Select Metric**.

05. Do one of the following:
    - Choose the service namespace that contains your metric, and then continue
       choosing options as they appear to narrow down your options. When a list of metrics
       appears, select the check box that's next to your metric.

    - In the search box, enter the name of a metric, dimension, or resource ID. Select
       one of the results, and then continue choosing options as they appear until a list of
       metrics appears. Select the check box that's next to your metric.
06. Choose **Graphed metric**.
    1. (Optional) For _Statistic_, choose the dropdown, and then
        select one of the predefined statistics or percentiles. You can use the search box in
        the dropdown to specify a custom percentile, such as `p95.45`.

    2. (Optional) For _Period_, choose the dropdown, and then select
        one of the predefined evaluation periods.

       ###### Note

       When CloudWatch evaluates your alarm, it aggragates the period into a single
       datapoint. For an anomaly detection alarm, the evaluation period must be one minute
       or longer.
07. Choose **Next**.

08. Under **_Conditions_**, specify the following:
    1. Choose **Anomaly detection**.

        If the model for this metric and statistic already exists, CloudWatch displays a
        preview of the anomaly detection band in the graph at the top of the screen. After you
        create your alarm, it can take up to 15 minutes for the actual anomaly detection band
        to appear in the graph. Before that, the band that you see is an approximation of the
        anomaly detection band.

       ###### Tip

       To see the graph at the top of the screen in a longer time frame, choose
       **Edit** at the top-right of the screen.

        If the model for this metric and statistic doesn't already exist, CloudWatch generates
        the anomaly detection band after you finish creating your alarm. For new models, it
        can take up to 3 hours for the actual anomaly detection band to appear in your graph.
        It can take up to two weeks for the new model to train, so the anomaly detection band
        shows more accurate expected values.

    2. For **Whenever `metric` is**, specify
        when to trigger the alarm. For example, when the metric is greater than, lower than,
        or outside the band (in either direction).

    3. For **Anomaly detection threshold**, choose the number to use for
        the anomaly detection threshold. A higher number creates a thicker band of "normal"
        values that is more tolerant of metric changes. A lower number creates a thinner band
        that will go to `ALARM` state with smaller metric deviations. The number
        does not have to be a whole number.

    4. Choose **Additional configuration**. For **Datapoints to**
       **alarm**, specify how many evaluation periods (data points) must be in the
        `ALARM` state to trigger the alarm. If the two values here match, you
        create an alarm that goes to `ALARM` state if that many consecutive periods
        are breaching.

       To create an M out of N alarm, specify a number for the first value that is lower
        than the number for the second value. For more information, see [Alarm evaluation](alarm-evaluation.md).

    5. For **Missing data treatment**, choose how the alarm behaves when
        some data points are missing. For more information, see [Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing data](alarms-and-missing-data.md).

    6. If the alarm uses a percentile as the monitored statistic, a **Percentiles**
       **with low samples** box appears. Use it to choose whether to evaluate or
        ignore cases with low sample rates. If you choose **Ignore (maintain alarm**
       **state)**, the current alarm state is always maintained when the sample size
        is too low. For more information, see [Percentile-based alarms and low data samples](percentiles-with-low-samples.md).
09. Choose **Next**.

10. Under **Notification**, select an SNS topic to notify when the alarm
     is in `ALARM` state, `OK` state, or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
     state.

    To send multiple notifications for the same alarm state or for different alarm states,
     choose **Add notification**.

    Choose **Remove** if you don't want the alarm to send
     notifications.

11. You can set up the alarm to perform EC2 actions or invoke a Lambda function when it
     changes state, or to create a Systems Manager OpsItem or incident when it goes into ALARM state. To
     do this, choose the appropriate button and then choose the alarm state and action to
     perform.

    If you choose a Lambda function as an alarm action, you specify the function name or
     ARN, and you can optionally choose a specific version of the function.

    For more information about Systems Manager actions, see [Configuring CloudWatch to create OpsItems from alarms](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/opscenter-create-opsitems-from-cloudwatch-alarms.md) and [Incident creation](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.md).

    ###### Note

    To create an alarm that performs an AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager action, you must have
    certain permissions. For more information, see [Identity-based policy examples for AWS Systems Manager Incident\
    Manager](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md).

12. Choose **Next**.

13. Under **_Name and description_**, enter a name
     and description for your alarm, and choose **Next**. The name must
     contain only UTF-8 characters, and can't contain ASCII control characters. The description
     can include markdown formatting, which is displayed only in the alarm
     **Details** tab in the CloudWatch console. The markdown can be useful to add
     links to runbooks or other internal resources.

    ###### Tip

    The alarm name must contain only UTF-8 characters, and can't contain ASCII control
    characters

14. Under **_Preview and create_**, confirm that your
     alarm's information and conditions are correct, and choose **Create**
    **alarm**.

## Editing an anomaly detection model

After you create an alarm, you can adjust the anomaly detection model. You can exclude
certain time periods from being used in the model creation. It is critical that you exclude
unusual events such as system outages, deployments, and holidays from the training data. You
can also specify whether to adjust the model for Daylight Savings Time changes.

###### To edit the anomaly detection model for an alarm

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **All**
**alarms**.

3. Choose the name of the alarm. If necessary, use the search box to find the
    alarm.

4. Choose **View**, **In metrics**.

5. In the **Details** column, choose the
    **ANOMALY\_DETECTION\_BAND** keyword, and then choose **Edit**
**anomaly detection model** in the popup.

![The Graphed Metrics tab with the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND popup menu displayed.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/Anomaly_Detection_Edit.PNG)

6. To exclude a time period from being used to produce the model, choose the calendar
    icon by **End date**. Then, select or enter the days and times to
    exclude from training and choose **Apply**.

7. If the metric is sensitive to Daylight Savings Time changes, select the appropriate
    time zone in the **Metric timezone** box.

8. Choose **Update**.

## Deleting an anomaly detection model

Using anomaly detection for an alarm accrues charges. As a best practice, if your alarm
no longer needs an anomaly detection model, delete the alarm first and the model second.
When anomaly detection alarms are evaluated, any missing anomaly detectors are created on
your behalf. If you delete the model without deleting the alarm, the alarm automatically
recreates the model.

###### To delete an alarm

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **All**
**Alarms**.

3. Choose the name of the alarm.

4. Choose **Actions**, **Delete**.

5. In the confirmation box, choose **Delete**.

###### To delete an anomaly detection model that was used for an alarm

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**, and then choose
    **All metrics**.

3. Choose **Browse**, and then select the metric that includes the
    anomaly detection model. You can search for your metric in the search box or select your
    metric by choosing through the options.
   - (Optional) If you're using the original interface, choose **All**
     **metrics**, and then choose the metric that includes the anomaly detection
      model. You can search for your metric in the search box or select your metric by
      choosing through the options.
4. Choose **Graphed metrics**.

5. In the **Graphed metrics** tab, in the **Details**
    column, choose the **ANOMALY\_DETECTION\_BAND** keyword, and then choose
    **Delete anomaly detection model** in the popup.

![The Graphed Metrics tab with the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND popup menu displayed.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/Anomaly_Detection_Edit.PNG)
   - (Optional) If you're using the original interface, choose **Edit**
     **model**. You're directed to a new screen. On the new screen, choose
      **Delete model**, and then choose **Delete**.
