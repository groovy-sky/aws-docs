# Adding a gauge widget to a CloudWatch dashboard

###### Note

Only the new interface in the CloudWatch console supports creation
of the gauge widget.
You must set a gauge range
when you create this widget.

###### To add a gauge widget to a dashboard

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Dashboards**, and
    then
    choose
    a dashboard.

3. From the dashboard screen, choose the **+** symbol, and
    then
    select **Gauge**.

4. Choose **Browse**, and
    then
    select the metric that you want to graph.

5. Choose **Options**.
    Under **_Gauge range_**,
    set values
    for **Min** and **Max**.
    For percentages,
    such as CPU utilization,
    we recommend that you set the values
    for `Min`
    to `0`
    and `Max`
    to `100`.

6. (Optional) To change the color of the gauge widget, choose
    **Graphed**
**metrics**
    and select the color box next to the metric label. A menu appears where you
    can choose a different color or enter a six-digit hex color code to specify
    a color.

7. Choose **Create widget**,
    and choose **Save dashboard**.
