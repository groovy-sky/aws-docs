# Viewing the cross-service CloudWatch dashboard

You can switch
to the Cross-service dashboard screen
and interact
with dashboards
for all
of the AWS services
that you're using.
The CloudWatch Console displays your dashboards
in alphabetical order
and displays one or two key metrics
from each service.

###### Note

If you're using five or more AWS services,
the CloudWatch Console won't display the Cross-service dashboard
on the Overview screen.

###### To view the Cross-service dashboard

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

    You're directed
    to the Overview screen.

2. From the Overview screen,
    select the dropdown
    that reads **Overview**,
    and then choose **Cross service dashboard**.

    You're directed
    to the Cross service dashboard screen.

3. (Optional)
    If you're using the original interface,
    scroll
    to the section **Cross-service dashboard**,
    and then choose **View Cross-service dashboard**.

    You're directed
    to the Cross-service dashboard screen.

4. You can focus on a particular service in two ways:
1. To see more key metrics for a service, choose its name from the list
       at the top of the screen, where **Cross service**
      **dashboard** is currently shown. Or, you can choose
       **View _Service_ dashboard**
       next to the service name.

      An automatic dashboard for that service is displayed, showing more
       metrics for that service. Additionally, for some services, the bottom of
       the service dashboard displays resources related to that service. You
       can choose one of those resources to that service console and focus
       further on that resource.

2. To see all the alarms related to a service, choose the button on the
       right of the screen next to that service name. The text on this button
       indicates how many alarms you have created in this service, and whether
       any are in the ALARM state.

      When the alarms are displayed, multiple alarms that have similar
       settings (such as dimensions, threshold, or period) may be shown in a
       single graph.

      You can then view details about an alarm and see the alarm history. To
       do so, hover on the alarm graph, and choose the actions icon,
       **View in alarms**.

      The alarms view appears in a new browser tab, displaying a list of
       your alarms, along with details about the chosen alarm. To see the
       history for this alarm, choose the **History**
       tab.
5. You can focus on resources in a particular resource group. To do so, choose
    the resource group from the list at the top of the page where **All**
**resources** is displayed.

For more information, see [Viewing a CloudWatch dashboard for a resource group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Automatic_Dashboards_Resource_Group.html).

6. To change the time range shown in all graphs and alarms currently displayed,
    select the range you want next to **Time range** at the top of
    the screen. Choose **custom** to select from more time range
    options than those displayed by default.

7. Alarms are always refreshed once a minute. To refresh the view, choose the
    refresh icon (two curved arrows) at the top right of the screen. To change the
    automatic refresh rate for items on the screen other than alarms, choose the
    down arrow next to the refresh icon and choose the refresh rate you want. You
    can also choose to turn off automatic refresh.
