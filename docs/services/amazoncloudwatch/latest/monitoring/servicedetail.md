# View detailed service activity and operational health with the service detail page

When you instrument your application, [Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals](cloudwatch-application-monitoring-sections.md) maps
all of the services that your application discovers. Use the service detail page to see an
overview of your services, operations, dependencies, canaries, and client requests for a single
service. To view the service detail page, do the following:

- Open the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

- Choose **Services** under the **Application Signals**
section in the left navigation pane.

- Choose the name of any service from the **Services**, **Top**
**services**, or dependency tables.

Under **schedule-visits**, you will see the account label and ID under the service name.

The service detail page is organized into the following tabs:

- [Overview](#ServiceDetail-overview) — Use this tab to see an
overview of a single service, including the number of operations, dependencies, synthetics,
and client pages. The tab shows key metrics for your entire service, top operations and
dependencies. These metrics include time series data on latency, faults, and errors across
all service operations for that service.

- [Service operations](#ServiceDetail-operations) — Use this tab to
see a list of the operations that your service calls and interactive graphs with key metrics
that measure the health of each operation. You can select a data point in a graph to obtain
information about traces, logs, or metrics associated with that data point.

- [Dependencies](#ServiceDetail-dependencies) — Use this tab to see
a list of dependencies that your service calls, and a list of metrics for those
dependencies.

- [Synthetics canaries](#ServiceDetail-canaries) — Use this tab to
see a list of synthetics canaries that simulate user calls to your service, and key
performance metrics for how those canaries.

- [Client pages](#ServiceDetail-clientpages) — Use this tab to see a
list of client pages that call your service, and metrics that measure the quality of client
interactions with your application.

- [Related metrics](#ServiceDetail-relatedmetrics) — Use this tab to correlate related metrics, such as standard metrics, runtime metrics, and custom metrics for a service, it's operations or dependencies.

## View your service overview

Use the service overview page to view a high-level summary of metrics for all service
operations in a single location. Check the performance of all the operations, dependencies,
client pages and synthetics canaries that interact with your application. Use this information
to help you determine where to focus efforts to identify issues, troubleshoot errors, and find
opportunities for optimization.

Choose any link in **Service Details** to view information that is
related to a specific service. For example, for services hosted in Amazon EKS, the service details
page shows **Cluster**, **Namespace**, and
**Workload** information. For services hosted in Amazon ECS or Amazon EC2, the
service details page shows the **Environment** value.

Under **Services**, the **Overview** tab displays a
summary of the following:

- Operations – Use this tab to see the health of your service operations. The
health status is determined by service level indicators (SLI) that are defined as a part
of a [service level objective](cloudwatch-servicelevelobjectives.md)
(SLO).

- Dependencies – Use this tab to see the top dependencies of the services called by
your application, listed by fault rate and to see the health of your service dependencies. The health status is determined by service level indicators (SLI) that are defined as a part of a service level objective (SLO).

- Synthetics canaries – Use this tab to see the result of simulated calls to
endpoints or APIs associated with your service, and the number of failed canaries.

- Client pages – Use this tab to see top pages called by clients that have
asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) errors.

The following illustration shows an overview of your services:

![Service overview widgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-detail-widgets.png)

The **Overview** tab also displays a graph of dependencies with the
highest latency across all services. Use the **p99**,
**p90** and **p50** latency metrics to quickly assess
which dependencies are contributing to your total service latency, as follows:

![Service operations latency graph](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-detail-latency.png)

For example, the previous graph shows that 99% of the requests made to the
**customer-service** dependency were completed in approximately 4,950
milliseconds. The other dependencies took less time.

Graphs displaying the top four service operations by latency show the volume of requests,
availability, fault rate, and error rate for those services, as shown in the following
image:

![Service operations volume, availability, fault rate, and error rate graphs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-detail-operations-graphs.png)

The **Service details** section displays the details of the service including the **Account ID** and **Account label**.

## View your service operations

When you instrument your application, [Application Signals](cloudwatch-application-monitoring-sections.md) discovers
all of the service operations that your application calls. Use the **Service**
**operations** tab to see a table that contains the service operations and a set of
metrics that measure the performance of a selected operation. These metrics include SLI
status, number of dependencies, latency, volume, faults, errors, and availability, as shown in
the following image:

![Service operations table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-operations-table.png)

Filter the table to make it easier to find a service operation by choosing one or more
properties from the filter text box. As you choose each property, you are guided through
filter criteria and will see the complete filter below the filter text box. Choose
**Clear filters** at any time to remove the table filter.

Choose the SLI status for an operation to display a popup containing a link to any
unhealthy SLI, and a link to see all SLOs for the operation, as shown in the following
table:

![Service operation SLI status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-operation-unhealthy-slo.png)

The service operations table lists the SLI status, the number of healthy or unhealthy
SLIs, and the total number of SLOs for each operation.

Use SLIs to monitor latency, availability, and other operational metrics that measure the
operational health of a service. Use an SLO to check the performance and health status of your
services and operations.

To create an SLO, do the following:

- If an operation does not have an SLO, choose the **Create SLO**
button within the **SLI Status** column.

- If an operation already has an SLO, do the following:

- Select the radio button next to the operation name.

- Choose **Create SLO** from the **Actions** down
arrow at the top right of the table.

For more information, see [service level\
objectives (SLOs)](cloudwatch-servicelevelobjectives.md).

The **Dependencies** column shows the number of dependencies this
operation calls. Choose this number to open the **Dependencies** tab filtered
to the selected operation.

### View service operations metrics, correlated traces, and application logs

Application Signals correlates service operation metrics with AWS X-Ray traces, CloudWatch
[Container Insights](containerinsights.md), and application logs. Use
these metrics to troubleshoot operational health issues. To view metrics as graphical
information, do the following:

1. Select a service operation in the **Service operations** table to
    see a set of graphs for the selected operation above the table with metrics for
    **Volume and Availability**, **Latency**, and
    **Faults and Errors**.

2. Hover over a point in a graph to view more information.

3. Select a point to open a diagnostic pane that shows correlated traces, metrics, and
    application logs for the selected point in the graph.

The following image shows the tooltip that appears after hovering over a point in the
graph, and the diagnostic pane which appears after clicking on a point. The tooltip contains
information about the associated data point in the **Faults and Errors**
graph. The pane contains **Correlated traces**, **Top**
**contributors**, and **Application logs** associated with the
selected point.

![Correlated traces for faults and errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-detail-correlated-traces.png)

#### Correlated traces

Look at related traces to understand an underlying issue with a trace. You can check
to see if correlated traces or any service nodes associated with them behave similarly. To
examine correlated traces, choose a **Trace ID** from the
**Correlated traces** table to open the [X-Ray trace details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-traces.html) page
for the chosen trace. The trace details page contains a map of service nodes that are
associated with the selected trace and a timeline of trace segments.

#### Top contributors

View the top contributors to find main input sources to a metric. Group contributors
by different components to look for similarities within the group and understand how trace
behavior differs between them.

The **Top contributors** tab gives metrics for **Call**
**volume**, **Availability**, **Avg latency**,
**Errors**, and **Faults** for each group. The
following example image shows top contributors to a suite of metrics for an application
deployed on an Amazon EKS platform:

![Service operation top contributors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-operations-top-contributors.png)

The top contributors contains the following metrics:

- **Call volume** \- Use the call volume to understand the number of
requests per time interval for a group.

- **Availability** \- Use availability to see what percentage of
time that no faults were detected for a group.

- **Avg latency** \- Use latency to check the average time that
requests ran for a group over a time interval that depends on how long ago the
requests that you are investigating were made. Requests that were made less than 15
days prior are evaluated over 1 minute intervals. Requests that were made between 15
and 30 days prior, inclusive, are evaluated over 5 minute intervals. For example, if
you are investigating requests that caused a fault 15 days ago, the call volume metric
is equal to the number of requests per 5 minute interval.

- **Errors** \- The number of errors per group measured over a time
interval.

- **Faults** \- The number of faults per group over a time
interval.

**Top contributors using Amazon EKS or**
**Kubernetes**

Use information about the top contributors for applications deployed on Amazon EKS or
Kubernetesto see operational health metrics grouped by
**Node**, **Pod** and
**PodTemplateHash**. The following definitions apply:

- A **pod** is a group of one or more
Docker containers that share storage and resources. A pod is the
smallest unit that can be deployed on a Kubernetes platform. Group by
pods to check if errors are related to pod-specific limitations.

- A **node** is a server that runs pods. Group by nodes
to check if errors are related to node-specific limitations.

- A **pod template hash** is used to find a particular
version of a deployment. Group by pod template hash to check if errors are related to
a particular deployment.

**Top contributors using Amazon EC2**

Use information about the top contributors for applications deployed on Amazon EKS to see
operational health metrics grouped by instance ID, and auto scaling group. The following
definitions apply:

- An **Instance ID** is a unique identifier for the Amazon EC2 instance
that your service runs. Group by instance ID to check if errors are related to a
specific Amazon EC2 instance.

- An [auto scaling group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html)
is a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that allow you to scale up or down the resources
you need to serve your application requests. Group by auto scaling group if you want
to check if errors are limited in scope to the instances inside the group.

**Top contributors using a custom platform**

Use information about the top contributors for applications deployed using custom instrumentation to
see operational health metrics grouped by **Host name**. The following
definitions apply:

- A host name identifies a device such as an endpoint or Amazon EC2 instance that is
connected to a network. Group by host name to check if your errors are related to a
specific physical or virtual device.

**View top contributors in Log Insights and**
**Container Insights**

View and modify the automatic query that generated metrics for your top contributors
in [Log Insights](../logs/analyzinglogdata.md). View infrastructure performance metrics by specific groups such
as pods or nodes in [Container Insights](containerinsights.md). You can
sort clusters, nodes or workloads by resource consumption and quickly identify anomalies
or and mitigate risks pro-actively before end user experience is impacted. An image
showing how to select these options follows:

![Top contributors table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-operations-top-contributors-insights.png)

In **Container Insights**, you can view metrics for your Amazon EKS or
Amazon ECS container that are specific to the grouping of your top contributors. For example,
if you grouped by pod for an EKS container to generate top contributors, container
insights will show metrics and statistics filtered for your pod.

In **Log Insights**, you can modify the query that generated the
metrics under **Top contributors** using the following steps:

1. Select **View in Log Insights**. The **Logs**
**Insights** page that opens contains an query that is automatically
    generated and contains the following information:

- The log cluster group name.

- The operation that you were investigating with CloudWatch.

- The aggregate of the operational health metric interacted with on the
graph.

The log results are automatically filtered to show data from the last five minutes
before you selected the data point on the service graph.

2. To edit the query, replace the generated text with your changes. You can also use
    the **Query generator** to help you generate a new query, or update
    the existing query.

#### Application logs

Use the query in the **Application logs** tab to generate logged
information for your current log group, service and insert a timestamp. A log group is a
group of log streams that you can define when you configure your application.

Use a log group to organize logs with similar characteristics including the
following:

- Capture logs from a specific organization, source or function.

- Capture logs that are accessed by a particular user.

- Capture logs for a specific time period.

Use these log streams to track specific groups or time frames. You can also set up
monitoring rules, alarms and notifications for these log groups. For more information
about log groups, see [Working with\
log groups and log streams](../logs/working-with-log-groups-and-streams.md).

The application logs query returns the logs, recurring text patterns and graphical
visualizations for your log groups.

To run the query, select **Run query in Logs Insights** to either run
the automatically generated query or modify the query. To edit the query, replace the
automatically generated text with your changes. You can also use the **Query**
**generator** to help you generate a new query or update the existing
query.

The following image shows the sample query that is automatically generated based on
the selected point in the service operations graph:

![Application logs table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-operations-application-logs.png)

In the preceding image, CloudWatch has automatically detected the log group that is
associated with your selected point, and included it in a generated query.

## View your service dependencies

Choose the **Dependencies** tab to display the
**Dependencies** table and a set of metrics for the dependencies of all
service operations or a single operation. The table contains a list of dependencies discovered
by Application Signals, including metrics for SLI status, latency, call volume, fault rate, error rate,
and availability.

At the top of the page, choose an operation from the down arrow list to view its
dependencies, or choose **All** to see dependencies for all operations.

Filter the table to make it easier to find what you're looking for, by choosing one or
more properties from the filter text box. As you choose each property, you are guided through
filter criteria and will see the complete filter below the filter text box. Choose
**Clear filters** at any time to remove the table filter. Select
**Group by Dependency** at the top right of the table to group dependencies
by service and operation name. When grouping is turned on, expand or collapse a group of
dependencies with the **+** icon next to the dependency name.

![Dependencies table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-dependencies-table.png)

The **Dependency** column displays the dependency service name, while the
**Remote Operation** column displays the service operation name. The **SLI status** column displays the number of healthy or unhealthy SLIs along with the total number of SLIs for each dependency. When
calling AWS services, the **Target** column displays the AWS resource,
such as DynamoDB table or Amazon SNS queue.

To select a dependency, select the option next to a dependency in the
**Dependencies** table. This shows a set of graphs that display detailed
metrics for call volume, availability, faults, and errors. Hover over a point in a graph to
see a popup containing more information. Select a point in a graph to open a diagnostic pane
that shows correlated traces for the selected point in the graph. Choose a trace ID from the
**Correlated traces** table to open the [X-Ray Trace details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-traces.html) page for
the selected trace.

## View your client pages

Choose the **Client pages** tab to display a list of client web pages
that call your service. Use the set of metrics for the selected client page to measure the
quality of your client's experience when interacting with a service or application. These
metrics include page loads, web vitals, and errors.

To display your client pages in the table, you must [configure your CloudWatch RUM web client\
for X-Ray tracing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-get-started-create-app-monitor.html) and turn on Application Signals metrics for your client pages.
Choose **Manage pages** to select which pages are enabled for Application

point in the graph. Choose an event ID from the list of navigation events to open the [CloudWatch RUM Page view](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-view-data.html) for the chosen event.

![CloudWatch RUM client page requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/service-client-page-graphs-events.jpg)

###### Note

To see AJAX errors within your client pages, use the [CloudWatch RUM web client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-configure-client.html) version 1.15 or
newer.

Up to 100 operations, canaries, and client pages, and up to 250
dependencies, can be shown per service.

## View Related metrics

Use the Related metrics tab to visualize multiple metrics, identify correlation patterns, and determine root causes of issues.

The metrics table shows three types of metrics:

- Standard metrics – Application Signals collects standard application metrics from the services that it discovers. For more information, see
[Standard application metrics collected](appsignals-metricscollected.md#AppSignals-StandardMetrics)

- Runtime metrics – Application Signals uses the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry SDK to automatically collect OpenTelemetry-compatible metrics from your Java and Python applications. For more information, see
[Rumtime metrics](appsignals-metricscollected.md#AppSignals-RuntimeMetrics)

- Custom metrics – Application Signals enables you to generate custom metrics from your application. For more information, see [Custom metrics with Application Signals](appsignals-custommetrics.md)

You can access the Related metrics tab from Service Overview, Service Operations, Dependencies, Synthetics canaries, or RUM tabs.

![View related metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/Custom_metrics.png)

- The left navigation panel starts with all operations and dependencies unselected

- The graph initially shows the Fault metric from the operation with the highest fault rate

Before you begin correlation analysis, make sure you have data points visible in Service Operations or Dependencies. To analyze correlations:

1. Open the Service Operations or Dependencies page.

2. Select a data point on any graph.

3. In the right-panel, choose **Correlate with Other Metrics**.

4. On the **Related metrics** tab that opens, you'll see:

- Your selected operation or dependency in the left navigation

- Your selected metric graphed in the _Browse metrics_ table

- Correlated spans when you select a data point

To graph multiple metrics, select one or more metrics from the **Browse** view in the **Related metrics** tab. Choose **Graphed Metrics** to view all graphed metrics.

To filter metrics, use the left panel filters to focus on specific operations or dependencies and use the table header filter bar to search by name, type, or other attributes. These filtering options help you detect patterns and troubleshoot issues more efficiently.

To analyze related metrics in detail, select a data point in the **Related metrics** tab. You can then view:

- Top Contributors – Analyzes metrics by running CloudWatch Logs Insights queries. These queries process Enhanced Metrics Format (EMF) records that contain key attributes for detailed analysis for the following:

- Latency measurements

- Fault occurrences

- Service availability metrics

The following metrics do not support Top Contributors:

- OTEL Metrics

- Server-side Span Metrics

You can view Top Contributors for RED Metrics and Client-side Span Metrics.

- Correlated Spans – The Correlated Spans section works consistently with the Service Operations tab. To help you identify related traces and metrics, the correlation mechanism works by:

- Comparing metric names with span attributes

- Identifying matching patterns during the selected time period

- Displaying relevant trace information

To effectively analyze your metrics and spans together, you need to understand how different metric types correlate. Here are the key limitations:

- OTEL Metrics don't correlate with spans because they use independent naming systems

- To correlate Server or Client-side Span Metrics with spans:

- Include a Service dimension field in your configuration

- Without this Service dimension, you cannot correlate these metrics with spans

- Log Applications – For information on log application, see [Application logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceDetail.html#ServiceDetail-operations)
