# AWS API usage metrics

Most APIs that support AWS CloudTrail logging also report usage metrics to CloudWatch. API usage
metrics in CloudWatch allow you to proactively manage API usage by visualizing
metrics in the CloudWatch console, creating custom dashboards, detecting changes in activity with
CloudWatch anomaly detection, and configuring alarms that alert when usage approaches a threshold.

You can use the he following table to learn about services that report API usage metrics to CloudWatch.
The table lists the values to use for the `Service` dimension, so you can see the usage metrics from that service.
You can use the procedure in this section to view the list of a service's APIs that report usage metrics to CloudWatch.

Some services report usage metrics for additional APIs as well. To see whether an API
reports usage metrics to CloudWatch, use the CloudWatch console to see the metrics reported by that
service in the `AWS/Usage` namespace.

###### To see the list of a service's APIs that report usage metrics to CloudWatch

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**.

3. On the **All metrics** tab, choose **Usage**, and
    then choose **By AWS Resource**.

4. In the search box near the list of metrics, enter the name of the service. The metrics are
    filtered by the service you entered.
