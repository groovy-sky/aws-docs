# Create a composite alarm

The steps in this section explain how to use the CloudWatch console to create a composite
alarm. You can also use the API or AWS CLI to create a composite alarm. For more information,
see [PutCompositeAlarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutCompositeAlarm.html) or [put-composite-alarm](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-composite-alarm.html)

###### To create a composite alarm

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, and then choose
     **All alarms**.

03. From the list of alarms, select the check box next to each of the existing alarms
     that you want to reference in your rule expression, and then choose **Create**
    **composite alarm**.

04. Under **Specify composite alarm conditions**, specify the rule
     expression for your new composite alarm.

    ###### Note

    Automatically, the alarms that you selected from the list of alarms are listed in
    the **Conditions** box. By default, the `ALARM` function
    has been designated to each of your alarms, and each of your alarms is joined by the
    logical operator `OR`.

    You can use the following substeps to modify your rule expression:

    1. You can change the required state for each of your alarms from
        `ALARM` to `OK` or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`.

    2. You can change the logical operator in your rule expression from `OR`
        to `AND` or `NOT`, and you can add parentheses to group your
        functions.

    3. You can include other alarms in your rule expression or delete alarms from your
        rule expression.

**Example: Rule expression with conditions**

```

(ALARM("CPUUtilizationTooHigh") OR
ALARM("DiskReadOpsTooHigh")) AND
OK("NetworkOutTooHigh")
```

In the example rule expression where the composite alarm goes into
`ALARM` when ALARM ("CPUUtilizationTooHigh" or ALARM("DiskReadOpsTooHigh")
is in `ALARM` at the same time as OK("NetworkOutTooHigh") is in
`OK`.

05. When finished, choose **Next**.

06. Under **Configure actions**, you can choose from the
     following:

    For **_Notification_**

- **Select an exisiting SNS topic**, **Create a new SNS**
**topic**, or **Use a topic ARN** to define the SNS topic
that will receive the notification.

- **Add notification**, so your alarm can send multiple
notifications for the same alarm state or different alarm states.

- **Remove** to stop your alarm from sending notifications or
taking actions.

(Optional) To have the alarm invoke a Lambda function when it changes state, choose
**Add Lambda action**. Then specify the function name or ARN, and
optionally choose a specific version of the function.

For **_Systems Manager action_**

- **Add Systems Manager action**, so your alarm can perform an
SSM action when it goes into ALARM.

To learn more about Systems Manager actions, see [Configuring CloudWatch to create OpsItems from alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-create-OpsItems-from-CloudWatch-Alarms.html) in the _AWS Systems Manager_
_User Guide_ and [Incident\
creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.html) in the _Incident Manager User Guide_. To create an
alarm that performs an SSM Incident Manager action, you must have the correct
permissions. For more information, see [Identity-based policy examples for AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/incident-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html) in
the _Incident Manager User Guide_.

To have the alarm start an investigation, choose **Add investigation**
**action** and then select your investigation group. For more information about
, see [CloudWatch investigations](investigations.md).

07. When finished, choose **Next**.

08. Under **Add name and description**, enter an alarm name and
     _optional_ description for your new composite alarm. The name must
     contain only UTF-8 characters, and can't contain ASCII control characters. The
     description can include markdown formatting, which is displayed only in the alarm
     **Details** tab in the CloudWatch console. The markdown can be useful to
     add links to runbooks or other internal resources.

09. When finished, choose **Next**.

10. Under **Preview and create**, confirm your information, and then
     choose **Create composite alarm**.

    ###### Note

    You can create a cycle of composite alarms, where one composite alarm and another
    composite alarm depend on each other. If you find yourself in this scenario, your
    composite alarms stop being evaluated, and you can't delete your composite alarms
    because they're dependent on each other. The easiest way to break the cycle of
    dependecy between your composite alarms is to change the function
    `AlarmRule` in one of your composite alarms to `False`.
