# Enable your applications on Amazon EC2

Enable CloudWatch Application Signals on Amazon EC2 by using the custom setup steps described in this section.

For applications running on Amazon EC2, you install and configure the CloudWatch agent and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry yourself. On these architectures enabled with a custom Application Signals setup, Application Signals
doesn't autodiscover the names of your services or the hosts or clusters they run on. You must specify these names during the custom setup, and the names that you specify are what is displayed on Application Signals dashboards.

The instructions in this section are for Java, Python, and .NET applications. The steps
have been tested on Amazon EC2 instances, but are also expected to work on other architectures
that support AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.

**Requirements**

- To get support for Application Signals, you must use the most recent version of both the CloudWatch
agent and the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry agent.

- You must have the AWS CLI installed on the instance. We recommend AWS CLI version 2, but version 1
should also work. For more information about installing the AWS CLI, see
[Install or update the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

###### Important

If you are already using OpenTelemetry with an application that you intend to enable for
Application Signals, see [Supported systems](cloudwatch-application-signals-supportmatrix.md)
before you enable Application Signals.

## Step 1: Enable Application Signals in your account

You must first enable Application Signals in your account. If you haven't, see [Enable Application Signals in your account](cloudwatch-application-signals-enable.md).

## Step 2: Download and start the CloudWatch agent

###### To install the CloudWatch agent as part of enabling Application Signals on an Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises host

1. Download the latest version of the CloudWatch agent to the instance. If the instance already has the CloudWatch agent
    installed, you might need to update it. Only versions of the agent released on November 30, 2023 or later support
    CloudWatch Application Signals.

2. Before you start the CloudWatch agent, configure it to enable Application Signals. The following
    example is a CloudWatch agent configuration that enables Application Signals for both metrics
    and traces on an EC2 host.

We recommend that you place this file at `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json`
    on Linux systems.

```json

{
     "traces": {
       "traces_collected": {
         "application_signals": {}
       }
     },
     "logs": {
       "metrics_collected": {
         "application_signals": {}
       }
     }
}
```

3. Attach the **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy**
    IAM policy to the IAM role of
    your Amazon EC2 instance. For permissions for on-premises hosts, see [Permissions for on-premises servers](#Enable-OnPremise-Permissions).

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Choose **Roles** and find the role used by your Amazon EC2 instance. Then choose the
       name of that role.

3. In the **Permissions** tab, choose **Add permissions**,
       **Attach policies**.

4. Find **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy**. Use the search box if needed. Then select the check
       box for that policy and choose **Add permissions**.
4. Start the CloudWatch agent by entering the following commands. Replace `agent-config-file-path`
    with the path to the CloudWatch agent configuration file, such as `./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json`. You must
    include the `file:` prefix as shown.

```nohighlight

export CONFIG_FILE_PATH=./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json
```

```nohighlight

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
   -a fetch-config \
   -m ec2 -s -c file:agent-config-file-path
```

### Permissions for on-premises servers

For an on-premises host, you will need to provide AWS authorization to your device.

###### To set up permissions for an on-premises host

1. Create the IAM user to be used to provide permissions to your on-premises host:

1. Open the IAM console at
       [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).

2. Choose **Users**, **Create User**.

3. In **User details**, for **User name**, enter a name for the new IAM user. This is the sign-in name for AWS that will be used to authenticate your host. Then
       choose **Next**

4. On the **Set permissions** page, under **Permissions options**, select **Attach policies directly**.

5. From the **Permissions policies** list, select the **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy** policy to add to your user. Then choose **Next**.

6. On the **Review and create** page, ensure that you are satisfied with the user name and that the **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy** policy is in the **Permissions summary**.

7. Choose **Create user**
2. Create and retrieve your AWS access key and secret key:

1. In the navigation pane in the IAM console, choose **Users** and then select the user name of the user that you created in the previous step.

2. On the user's page, choose the **Security credentials** tab. Then, in the **Access keys** section, choose **Create access key**.

3. For **Create access key Step 1**, choose **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.

4. For **Create access key Step 2**, optionally enter a tag and then choose **Next**.

5. For **Create access key Step 3**, select **Download .csv file** to save a .csv file with your IAM user's access key and secret access key. You need this information for the next steps.

6. Choose **Done**.
3. Configure your AWS credentials in your on-premises host by entering the following command. Replace `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_ID`
    with your newly generated access key and secret access key from the .csv file that you downloaded in the previous step.

```nohighlight

$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: SECRET_ACCESS_ID
Default region name [None]: MY_REGION
Default output format [None]: json
```

## Step 3: Instrument your application and start it

The next step is to instrument your application for CloudWatch Application Signals.

Java

###### To instrument your Java applications as part of enabling Application Signals on an Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises host

1. Download the latest version of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
    Java auto-instrumentation agent. You can download the latest version by using
    [this link](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar). You can view information about all released versions at
    [aws-otel-java-instrumentation Releases](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-java-instrumentation/releases).

2. To optimize your Application Signals benefits, use environment variables to
    provide additional information before you start your application. This information will be displayed
    in Application Signals dashboards.

1. For the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` variable, specify the following information as
       key-value pairs:

- (Optional) `service.name` sets the name of the service. This will be displayed as the service
name for your application in Application Signals dashboards. If you don't provide a value for this key, the
default of `UnknownService` is used.

- (Optional) `deployment.environment` sets the environment that the application runs in.
This will be diplayed as the **Hosted In** environment of your
application in Application Signals dashboards. If you don't specify this, one of the following defaults is used:

- If this is an instance that is part of an Auto Scaling group, it is set to `ec2:name-of-Auto-Scaling-group`

- If this is an Amazon EC2 instance that is not part of an Auto Scaling group, it is set to `ec2:default`

- If this is an on-premises host, it is set to `generic:default`

This environment variable is used only by Application Signals, and is converted into X-Ray trace annotations
and CloudWatch metric dimensions.

- For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` variable, specify the base endpoint URL where

traces are to be exported to. The CloudWatch agent exposes 4316 as its OTLP port. On Amazon EC2, because applications
communicate with the local CloudWatch agent, you should set this value to
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/traces`

- For the `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT` variable, specify the base endpoint URL where

metrics are to be exported to. The CloudWatch agent exposes 4316 as its OTLP port. On Amazon EC2, because applications
communicate with the local CloudWatch agent, you should set this value to
`OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/metrics`

- For the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` variable, specify the path where the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
Java auto-instrumentation agent is stored.

```nohighlight

export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=" -javaagent:$AWS_ADOT_JAVA_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH"
```

For example:

```nohighlight

export AWS_ADOT_JAVA_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH=./aws-opentelemetry-agent.jar
```

- For the `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` variable, we recommend that you set the value to
`none`. This disables other metrics exporters so that only the
Application Signals exporter is used.

- Set `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED` to `true`. This generates
Application Signals metrics from traces.
3. Start your application with the environment variables listed in the previous step. The following
    is an example of a starting script.

###### Note

The following configuration supports only versions 1.32.2 and later of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation agent for Java.

```nohighlight

JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=" -javaagent:$AWS_ADOT_JAVA_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH" \
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none \
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none \
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=true \
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/metrics \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/traces \
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=$YOUR_SVC_NAME" \
java -jar $MY_JAVA_APP.jar
```

4. (Optional) To enable log correlation, in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, set an additional environment variable `aws.log.group.names` for the log groups of your application.
    By doing so, the traces and metrics from your application can be correlated with the relevant log entries from these log groups. For this variable, replace `$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP`
    with the log group names for your application. If you have multiple log groups, you can use an ampersand ( `&`) to separate them as in this example: `aws.log.group.names=log-group-1&log-group-2`.
    To enable metric to log correlation, setting this current environmental variable is enough. For more information, see
    [Enable metric to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-MetricLogCorrelation.html). To enable trace to log correlation, you'll also need to change the
    logging
    configuration in your application. For more information, see [Enable trace to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-TraceLogCorrelation.html).

The following is an example of a starting script that helps enable log correlation.

```nohighlight

JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=" -javaagent:$AWS_ADOT_JAVA_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH" \
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none \
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORT=none \
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=true \
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/metrics \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/traces \
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="aws.log.group.names=$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP,service.name=$YOUR_SVC_NAME" \
java -jar $MY_JAVA_APP.jar
```

Python

###### Note

If you're using a WSGI server for your Python application, in addition to the following steps in this section,
see [No Application Signals data for Python application that uses a WSGI server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Enable-Troubleshoot.html#Application-Signals-troubleshoot-Python-WSGI) for information to make Application Signals work.

###### To instrument your Python applications as part of enabling Application Signals on an Amazon EC2 instance

1. Download the latest version of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
    Python auto-instrumentation agent. Install it by running the following command.

```cmd

pip install aws-opentelemetry-distro
```

You can view information about all released versions at
    [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Python instrumentation](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-python-instrumentation/releases).

2. To optimize your Application Signals benefits, use environment variables to
    provide additional information before you start your application. This information will be displayed
    in Application Signals dashboards.

1. For the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` variable, specify the following information as
       key-value pairs:

- `service.name` sets the name of the service. This will be diplayed as the service
name for your application in Application Signals dashboards. If you don't provide a value for this key, the
default of `UnknownService` is used.

- `deployment.environment` sets the environment that the application runs in.
This will be diplayed as the **Hosted In** environment of your
application in Application Signals dashboards. If you don't specify this, one of the following defaults is used:

- If this is an instance that is part of an Auto Scaling group, it is set to `ec2:name-of-Auto-Scaling-group`.

- If this is an Amazon EC2 instance that is not part of an Auto Scaling group, it is set to `ec2:default`

- If this is an on-premises host, it is set to `generic:default`

This
attribute key is used only by Application Signals, and is converted into X-Ray trace annotations and
CloudWatch metric dimensions.

2. For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` variable, specify `http/protobuf` to export telemetry
       data over HTTP to the CloudWatch agent endpoints listed in the following steps.

3. For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` variable, specify the base endpoint URL where

       traces are to be exported to. The CloudWatch agent exposes 4316 as its OTLP port over HTTP. On Amazon EC2, because applications
       communicate with the local CloudWatch agent, you should set this value to
       `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/traces`

4. For the `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT` variable, specify the base endpoint URL where

       metrics are to be exported to. The CloudWatch agent exposes 4316 as its OTLP port over HTTP. On Amazon EC2, because applications
       communicate with the local CloudWatch agent, you should set this value to
       `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/metrics`

5. For the `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` variable, we recommend that you set the value to
       `none`. This disables other metrics exporters so that only the
       Application Signals exporter is used.

6. Set the `OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED` variable to `true` to have your container start sending X-Ray traces and CloudWatch metrics
       to Application Signals.
3. Start your application with the environment variables discussed in the previous step. The following
    is an example of a starting script.

- Replace `$SVC_NAME` with your application name. This will
be displayed as the name of the application, in Application Signals dashboards.

- Replace `$PYTHON_APP` with the location and name of your application.

```nohighlight

OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none \
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none \
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED=true \
OTEL_PYTHON_DISTRO=aws_distro \
OTEL_PYTHON_CONFIGURATOR=aws_configurator \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf \
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=xray \
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG="endpoint=http://localhost:2000" \
OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/metrics \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/traces \
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.name=$SVC_NAME" \
opentelemetry-instrument python $MY_PYTHON_APP.py
```

Before you enable Application Signals for your Python applications, be aware of the following considerations.

- In some containerized applications, a missing `PYTHONPATH` environment variable can sometimes
cause the application to fail to start. To resolve this, ensure that you set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
to the location of your application’s working directory. This is due to a known issue with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation.
For more information about this issue, see
[Python autoinstrumentation setting of PYTHONPATH is not compliant](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/issues/2302).

- For Django applications, there are additional required configurations, which are outlined
in the [OpenTelemetry Python documentation](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/django/README.html).

- Use the `--noreload` flag to prevent automatic reloading.

- Set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to the location of your Django
application’s `settings.py` file. This ensures that OpenTelemetry can correctly access and integrate with your Django settings.

4. (Optional) To enable log correlation, in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, set an additional environment variable `aws.log.group.names` for the log groups of your application.
    By doing so, the traces and metrics from your application can be correlated with the relevant log entries from these log groups. For this variable, replace `$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP`
    with the log group names for your application. If you have multiple log groups, you can use an ampersand ( `&`) to separate them as in this example: `aws.log.group.names=log-group-1&log-group-2`.
    To enable metric to log correlation, setting this current environmental variable is enough. For more information, see
    [Enable metric to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-MetricLogCorrelation.html). To enable trace to log correlation, you'll also need to change the
    logging
    configuration in your application. For more information, see [Enable trace to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-TraceLogCorrelation.html).

java -jar $MY_PYTHON_APP.jar
```

.NET

###### To instrument your .NET applications as part of enabling Application Signals on an Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises host

1. Download the latest version of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
    .NET auto-instrumentation package. You can download the latest version at
    [aws-otel-dotnet-instrumentation Releases](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-dotnet-instrumentation/releases).

2. To enable Application Signals, set the following environment variables to provide additional information before you start your application. These variables are necessary to set up the startup hook for .NET instrumentation, before you start your
    .NET application. Replace `dotnet-service-name` in the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable with the service name of your choice.

- The following is an example for Linux.

```nohighlight

export INSTALL_DIR=OpenTelemetryDistribution
export CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1
export CORECLR_PROFILER={918728DD-259F-4A6A-AC2B-B85E1B658318}

Node.js

###### Note

If you are enabling Application Signals for a Node.js application with ESM, see

[Setting up a Node.js application with the ESM module format](#EC2-NodeJs-ESM) before you start these steps.

###### To instrument your Node.js applications as part of enabling Application Signals on an Amazon EC2 instance

1. Download the latest version of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
    JavaScript auto-instrumentation agent for Node.js. Install it by running the following command.

```cmd

npm install @aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation
```

You can view information about all released versions at
    [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry JavaScript instrumentation](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-js-instrumentation/releases).

2. To optimize your Application Signals benefits, use environment variables to
    provide additional information before you start your application. This information will be displayed
    in Application Signals dashboards.

1. For the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` variable, specify the following information as
       key-value pairs:

- If this is an Amazon EC2 instance that is not part of an Auto Scaling group, it is set to `ec2:default`

- If this is an on-premises host, it is set to `generic:default`

This
attribute key is used only by Application Signals, and is converted into X-Ray trace annotations and
CloudWatch metric dimensions.

2. For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` variable, specify `http/protobuf` to export telemetry
       data over HTTP to the CloudWatch agent endpoints listed in the following steps.

3. For the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` variable, specify the base endpoint URL where

```

4. (Optional) To enable log correlation, in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, set an additional environment variable `aws.log.group.names` for the log groups of your application.
    By doing so, the traces and metrics from your application can be correlated with the relevant log entries from these log groups. For this variable, replace `$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP`
    with the log group names for your application. If you have multiple log groups, you can use an ampersand ( `&`) to separate them as in this example: `aws.log.group.names=log-group-1&log-group-2`.
    To enable metric to log correlation, setting this current environmental variable is enough. For more information, see
    [Enable metric to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-MetricLogCorrelation.html). To enable trace to log correlation, you'll also need to change the
    logging
    configuration in your application. For more information, see [Enable trace to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-TraceLogCorrelation.html).

The following is an example of a starting script that helps enable log correlation.

```nohighlight

export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4316/v1/traces \

node --require '@aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation/register' your-application.js
```

**Setting up a Node.js application with the ESM module format**

We provide limited support for Node.js applications with the ESM module format.
For details, see [Known limitations about Node.js with ESM](cloudwatch-application-signals-supportmatrix.md#ESM-limitations).

To enable Application Signals for a Node.js application with ESM, you need to modify the steps in the previous

procedure.

First, install `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` for your Node.js application:

```nohighlight

npm install @opentelemetry/instrumentation@0.54.0
```

Then, in steps 3 and 4 in the previous procedure, change the node options from:

```nohighlight

--require '@aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation/register'

```

to the following:

```nohighlight

--import @aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation/register --experimental-loader=@opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs
```

## Enable Application Signals on Amazon EC2 using Model Context Protocol (MCP)

You can use the CloudWatch Application Signals Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to enable Application Signals on your Amazon EC2 instances through conversational AI interactions. This provides a natural language interface for setting up Application Signals monitoring.

The MCP server automates the enablement process by understanding your requirements and generating the appropriate configuration. Instead of manually following setup steps, you can simply describe what you want to enable.

### Prerequisites

Before using the MCP server to enable Application Signals, ensure you have:

- A Development Environment that supports MCP (such as Kiro, Claude Desktop, VSCode with MCP extensions, or other MCP-compatible tools)

- The CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server configured in your IDE. For detailed setup instructions, see [CloudWatch Application Signals MCP Server documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/cloudwatch-applicationsignals-mcp-server).

### Using the MCP server

Once you have configured the CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server in your IDE, you can request enablement guidance using natural language prompts. While the coding assistant can infer context from your project structure, providing specific details in your prompts helps ensure more accurate and relevant guidance. Include information such as your application language, instance details, and absolute paths to your infrastructure and application code.

**Best practice prompts (specific and complete):**

```

"Enable Application Signals for my Python service running on EC2.
My app code is in /home/ec2-user/flask-api and IaC is in /home/ec2-user/flask-api/terraform"

"I want to add observability to my Java application on EC2.
The application code is at /opt/apps/checkout-service and
the infrastructure code is at /opt/apps/checkout-service/cloudformation"

"Help me instrument my Node.js application on EC2 with Application Signals.
Application directory: /home/ubuntu/payment-api
Terraform code: /home/ubuntu/payment-api/terraform"
```

**Less effective prompts:**

```

"Enable monitoring for my app"
→ Missing: platform, language, paths

"Enable Application Signals. My code is in ./src and IaC is in ./infrastructure"
→ Problem: Relative paths instead of absolute paths

"Enable Application Signals for my EC2 service at /home/user/myapp"
→ Missing: programming language
```

**Quick template:**

```

"Enable Application Signals for my [LANGUAGE] service on EC2.
App code: [ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_APP]
IaC code: [ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_IAC]"
```

### Benefits of using the MCP server

Using the CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server offers several advantages:

- **Natural language interface:** Describe what you want to enable without memorizing commands or configuration syntax

- **Context-aware guidance:** The MCP server understands your specific environment and provides tailored recommendations

- **Reduced errors:** Automated configuration generation minimizes manual typing errors

- **Faster setup:** Get from intention to implementation more quickly

- **Learning tool:** See the generated configurations and understand how Application Signals works

### Additional resources

For more information about configuring and using the CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server, see the [MCP server documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/cloudwatch-applicationsignals-mcp-server).

## (Optional) Monitor your application health

Once you have enabled your applications on Amazon EC2, you can monitor your application health. For more information, see [Monitor the operational health of your applications with Application Signals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Services.html).
