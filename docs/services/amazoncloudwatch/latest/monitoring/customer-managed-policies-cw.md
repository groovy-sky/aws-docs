# Customer managed policy examples

In this section, you can find example user policies that grant permissions for various
CloudWatch actions. These policies work when you are using the CloudWatch API, AWS SDKs, or the
AWS CLI.

###### Examples

- [Example 1: Allow user full access to CloudWatch](#full-access-example-cw)

- [Example 2: Allow read-only access to CloudWatch](#read-only-access-example-cw)

- [Example 3: Stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance](#stop-terminate-example-cw)

## Example 1: Allow user full access to CloudWatch

To grant a user full access to CloudWatch, you can use grant them the
**CloudWatchFullAccess** managed policy instead of creating a
customer-managed policy. The contents of the
**CloudWatchFullAccess** are listed in [CloudWatchFullAccess](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-cloudwatch-CloudWatchFullAccess).

## Example 2: Allow read-only access to CloudWatch

The following policy allows a user read-only access to CloudWatch and view Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
actions, CloudWatch metrics, CloudWatch Logs data, and alarm-related Amazon SNS data.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "autoscaling:Describe*",
        "cloudwatch:Describe*",
        "cloudwatch:Get*",
        "cloudwatch:List*",
        "logs:Get*",
        "logs:Describe*",
        "logs:StartQuery",
        "logs:StopQuery",
        "logs:TestMetricFilter",
        "logs:FilterLogEvents",
        "logs:StartLiveTail",
        "logs:StopLiveTail",
        "sns:Get*",
        "sns:List*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Example 3: Stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance

The following policy allows an CloudWatch alarm action to stop or terminate an EC2
instance. In the sample below, the GetMetricData, ListMetrics, and DescribeAlarms
actions are optional. It is recommended that you include these actions to ensure
that you have correctly stopped or terminated the instance.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
        "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances",
        "ec2:TerminateInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}

```
