# Monitoring details in Internet Monitor (Configure page)

On the **Configure** page, you can see details about your monitor, including a list of resources that
you monitor traffic for and the thresholds for when health events are triggered. You can also explore and compare values
for the traffic percentage for your monitor, and its impact on how many city-networks are included for (monitored by)
your monitor. Finally, you can view information about measurements that are published to an Amazon S3 bucket.

You can configure a monitor to change most options, such as the percentage of traffic to monitor. For more
information, see [Configure your monitor](#IMUpdateMonitorConfig).

## Monitor details

The **Monitor details** section includes basic information about your monitor,
including the name, the percentage of traffic currently being monitored for your application, a
city-networks maximum limit (if you've set one), and status information about the monitor.

The following explains the values that you might see for **Status** and
**Status info** (data processing status).

StatusDescription

Active

Monitor is created and active.

Pending

Monitor is currently being created and is not yet active.

Inactive

Monitor is created but has been set to inactive.

Error

Monitor is in an error state.

Status details (Data processing status)Description

OK

Monitor is actively processing data.

Inactive

Monitor is inactive and is not processing data.

Collecting data

Monitor is actively collecting data.

Insufficient data

Monitor is actively processing data, but there aren't enough datapoints to produce insights.

Fault access CloudWatch

Monitor has encountered a problem delivering CloudWatch metrics data and log events.

## Health event thresholds

In this section, you can see the current thresholds for health
events that are configured for this monitor. If you haven't configured any custom thresholds, the values
shown here are the default values.

By default, health events are not triggered based on local thresholds. If local health event
thresholds would be useful for your Internet Monitor scenario, you can enable the option and specify the thresholds
to use.

You can learn more about how health event thresholds work, and review the potential impact of
adding local thresholds or changing existing thresholds. For more information, see
[Change health event thresholds](cloudwatch-im-get-started-change-threshold.md#IMUpdateThresholdFromOverview).

## Traffic coverage

In this section, you can explore options for the
traffic coverage for your monitor. When you change the traffic percentage for a monitor, Internet Monitor
monitors different amounts of application traffic. If you set a traffic percentage to less than
100% (100% is the default value), some portion of the city-networks that your clients use to access
your application might not be monitored. By exploring the impact of different traffic percentage
values, you can see how different values that you might set would impact your city-networks coverage.

The **Total monitored city-networks** graph shows you how many city-networks are
currently monitored, and how many would be monitored if you set the traffic percentage to 100%.
To view different traffic percentage values on the graph, select percentages in the drop-down menu.

After you explore the options, you can change the traffic percentage to monitor by choosing
**Update monitoring coverage**.

If you want to set a maximum city-networks limit, at the top of the page, choose **Edit**
**monitor**. Then, under **Advanced options**, set a maximum city-networks value.

## Configure your monitor

As on every page in the Internet Monitor dashboard, you can choose **Edit monitor**
to change options for your monitor, including adding or removing resources. For details
about how to update the following configuration options, see the provided links.

**View health event thresholds**

In this section, you can see the current thresholds for health events that are configured for this monitor.

To update health thresholds, see [Change health event thresholds](cloudwatch-im-get-started-change-threshold.md#IMUpdateThresholdFromOverview).

**View and evaluate traffic coverage**

In this section, you can compare the effect of changing the percentage of traffic that you monitor
for your application on the number of city-networks that are included (for monitoring) when you choose different
percentage values.

You can also change the percentage of traffic that you monitor, or change the limit for the number of city-networks your
monitor includes. To change the percentage of traffic, choose **Update monitoring coverage**.

For detailed steps and information, see [Explore changing your \
application traffic percentage](imtrafficpercentage.md#IMExploreTrafficPercentage).

**Configuration details for publishing internet measurements to Amazon S3**

If you have configured Internet Monitor to publish internet measurements for your monitor to an
Amazon S3 bucket, the information about your configuration is shown here.

To configure this option, see [Publishing internet measurements to S3](cloudwatch-im-get-started-publish-to-s3.md#IMPublishToS3).
