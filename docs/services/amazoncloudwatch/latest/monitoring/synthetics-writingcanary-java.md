## Java project structure for a canary

To create a canary in Java, you need to write your code, compile it, and deploy the
compiled artifacts to Synthetics. You can initialize a Java Lambda project in various
ways. For instance, you can use a standard
Java project setup in your preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code.
Alternatively, you can create the required file structure manually.

A Synthetics Java project contains the following general structure:

```nohighlight

/project-root
    └ src
        └ main
            └ java
                └ canarypackage // name of package
                |    └ ExampleCanary.java // Canary code file
                |    └ other_supporting_classes
                - resources
                     └ synthetics.json // Synthetics configuration file
     └ build.gradle OR pom.xml
```

You can use either Maven or Gradle to build your project and manage dependencies.

In the above structure, the `ExampleCanary` class is the entry point or
handler for the canary.

**Java canary class example**

This example is for a canary to make a get request to a URL stored in the _TESTING\_URL_ Lambda environment variable. The canary does not use any of the
methods provided by Synthetics runtime.

```nohighlight

package canarypackage;

import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

// Handler value: canary.ExampleCanary::canaryCode
public class ExampleCanary {
  public void canaryCode() throws Exception{
      URL url = new URL(System.getenv("TESTING_URL"));
      HttpURLConnection con=(HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();
      con.setRequestMethod("GET");
      con.setConnectTimeout(5000);
      con.setReadTimeout(5000);
      int status=con.getResponseCode();
      if(status!=200){
        throw new Exception("Failed to load " + url + ", status code: " + status);
      }
  }
}
```

It is highly recommended to modularize your canaries using the Synthetics provided
library function `executeStep`. The canary makes `get` calls to
two separate URLs procured from URL1 and URL2 environment variables.

###### Note

To use the `executeStep` functionality, the handler method for the
canary should take in a parameter of type Synthetics as shown below.

```

package canarypackage;

import com.amazonaws.synthetics.Synthetics;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

// Handler value: canary.ExampleCanary::canaryCode
public class ExampleCanary {
  public void canaryCode(Synthetics synthetics) throws Exception {
    createStep("Step1", synthetics, System.getenv("URL1"));
    createStep("Step2", synthetics, System.getenv("URL2"));
    return;
  }

  private void createStep(String stepName, Synthetics synthetics, String url) throws Exception{
    synthetics.executeStep(stepName,()->{
      URL obj=new URL(url);
      HttpURLConnection con=(HttpURLConnection)obj.openConnection();
      con.setRequestMethod("GET");
      con.setConnectTimeout(5000);
      con.setReadTimeout(5000);
      int status=con.getResponseCode();
      if(status!=200){
        throw new Exception("Failed to load" + url + "status code:" + status);
      }
      return null;
    }).get();
  }
}
```

## Packaging the project for a canary

Synthetics accepts code for a java canary in the _zip_ format.
The zip consists of the class files for the canary code, the jars for any third party
dependencies and the Synthetics configuration file.

A Synthetics Java zip contains the following general structure.

```

example-canary
    └ lib
    |  └ //third party dependency jars
       └ java-canary.jar
    └ synthetics.json
```

To build this zip from the above project structure, you can use gradle
(build.gradle) or maven (pom.xml). Here is an example.

For information on compile time dependencies or interfaces for the Synthetics
library, see the README under [aws-cloudwatch-synthetics-sdk-java](https://github.com/aws/aws-cloudwatch-synthetics-sdk-java/tree/main).

```

plugins {
    id 'java'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // Third party dependencies
    // example: implementation 'software.amazon.awssdk:s3:2.31.9'

    // Declares dependency on Synthetics interfaces for compiling only
    // Refer https://github.com/aws/aws-cloudwatch-synthetics-sdk-java for building from source.
    compileOnly 'software.amazon.synthetics:aws-cloudwatch-synthetics-sdk-java:1.0.0'}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}

// Build the zip to be used as Canary code.
task buildZip(type: Zip) {

    archiveFileName.set("example-canary.zip")
    destinationDirectory.set(file("$buildDir"))

    from processResources
    into('lib') {
        from configurations.runtimeClasspath
        from(tasks.named("jar"))
    }
    from "src/main/java/resources/synthetics.json"

    doLast {
        println "Artifact written to: ${archiveFile.get().asFile.absolutePath}"
    }
}

java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)
    }
}

tasks.named("build") {
    dependsOn "buildZip"
}
```

## Handler name

The handler name is the entry point for the canary. For Java runtime, the handler is
in the following format.

```

<<full qualified name for canary class>>::<<name of the method to start the execution from>>
// for above code: canarypackage.ExampleCanary::canaryCode
```

## CloudWatch Synthetics configurations

You can configure the behavior of the Synthetics Java runtime by providing an
optional JSON configuration file named `synthetics.json`. This file should be
packaged in the root directory of the package zip. Though a configuration file is
optional, if you don't provide a configuration file, or a configuration key is missing,
CloudWatch uses the defaults.

The following are supported configuration values, and their defaults.

```

{
    "step": {
        "stepSuccessMetric": true,
        "stepDurationMetric": true,
        "continueOnStepFailure": false,
        "stepsReport": true
    },
    "logging": {
        "logRequest": false,
        "logResponse": false
    },
    "httpMetrics": {
        "metric_2xx": true,
        "metric_4xx": true,
        "metric_5xx": true,
        "aggregated2xxMetric": true,
        "aggregated4xxMetric": true,
        "aggregated5xxMetric": true
    },
    "canaryMetrics": {
        "failedCanaryMetric": true,
        "aggregatedFailedCanaryMetric": true
    }
}
```

**Step configurations**

- _continueOnStepFailure_ – Determines if a script
should continue even after a step has failed. The default is false.

- _stepSuccessMetric_ – Determines if a step's `
                  SuccessPercent` metric is emitted. The `SuccessPercent` metric for
a step is _100_ for the canary run if the step succeeds, and _0_ if the step fails. The default is _true_.

- _stepDurationMetric_ – Determines if a step's _Duration_ metric is emitted. The _Duration_ metric is
emitted as a duration, in milliseconds, of the step's run. The default is _true_.

**Logging configurations**

Applies to logs generated by CloudWatch Synthetics. Controls the verbosity of request and
response logs.

- _logRequest_ – Specifies whether to log every request
in canary logs. The default is false.

- _logResponse_ – Specifies whether to log every
response in canary logs. The default is false.

**HTTP metric configurations**

Configurations for metrics related to the count of network requests with different
HTTP status codes, emitted by CloudWatch Synthetics for this canary.

- _metric\_2xx_ – Specifies whether to emit the _2xx_ metric (with the CanaryName dimension) for this canary. The default
is _true_.

- _metric\_4xx_ – Specifies whether to emit the _4xx_ metric (with the CanaryName dimension) for this canary. The default
is _true_.

- _metric\_5xx_ – Specifies whether to emit the _5xx_ metric (with the CanaryName dimension) for this canary. The default
is _true_.

- _aggregated2xxMetric_ – Specifies whether to emit the _2xx_ metric (without the CanaryName dimension) for this canary. The
default is _true_.

- _aggregated4xxMetric_ – Specifies whether to emit the _4xx_ metric (without the CanaryName dimension) for this canary. The
default is _true_.

- _aggregated5xxMetric_ – Specifies whether to emit the _5xx_ metric (without the CanaryName dimension) for this canary. The
default is _true_.

**Canary metric configurations**

Configurations for other metrics emitted by CloudWatch Synthetics.

- _failedCanaryMetric_ Network Access Analyzer Specifies whether to emit the _Failed_ metric (with the CanaryName dimension) for this canary. The
default is _true_.

- _aggregatedFailedCanaryMetric_ – Specifies whether to
emit the _Failed_ metric (without the CanaryName dimension) for
this canary. The default is _true_.

## CloudWatch Synthetics environment variables

You can configure the logging level and format by using environment variables.

**Log format**

The CloudWatch Synthetics Java runtime creates CloudWatch logs for every canary run. Logs are
written in JSON format for convenient querying. Optionally, you can change the log
format to _TEXT_.

- _Environment variable name_ – CW\_SYNTHETICS\_LOG\_FORMAT

- _Supported values_ – JSON, TEXT

- _Default_ –JSON

**Log levels**

- _Environment variable name_ – CW\_SYNTHETICS\_LOG\_LEVEL

- _Supported values_ – TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR,
FATAL

- _Default_ – INFO

Apart from the above environment variables, there is a default environment variable
added for Java runtime, `AWS_LAMBDA-EXEC_WRAPPER` environment variable to
your function, and set its value to `/opt/synthetics-otel-instrument`. This
environment variable modifies your function's startup behavior for telemetry. If this
environment variable already exists, make sure that it's set to the required value.
