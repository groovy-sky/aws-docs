## CloudWatch investigations cannot assume the necessary IAM roles or permissions. Please verify required roles and permissions are correctly configured

CloudWatch investigations use an IAM role to be able to access information in your topology. This
IAM role must be configured with adequate permissions. For more information about
the necessary permissions, see [How to control what data CloudWatch investigations has access to during investigations](investigations-security.md#Investigations-Security-Data).

## Unable to identify event source. Verify that the resource exists in your application topology and the resource type is supported.

There are several AWS services and features that we recommend you to enable to
provide additional valuable information to CloudWatch investigations. These services and features can
help CloudWatch investigations identify event sources. For more information, see [(Recommended) Best practices to enhance investigations](investigations-recommendedservices.md).

## Analysis complete. Submit additional findings to receive updated suggestions

When you see this message, CloudWatch investigations has finished analyzing your topology and telemetry
based on the findings that it has found so far. If you think that the root cause
hasn't been found, you can manually add more telemetry to the investigation, and
this might cause CloudWatch investigations to scan your system again based on the new information.

To add new telemetry, navigate to that service's console and add the telemetry to
the investigation. For example, to add a Lambda metric to the investigation, you can
do the following:

1. Open the Lambda console.

2. In the **Monitor** section, find the metric.

3. Open the vertical ellipsis context menu ![An example of a CloudWatch overview home page, showing alarms and their current state, and examples of other metrics graph widgets that might appear on the overview home page.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/vmore.png) for the metric, choose
    **Investigate**, **Add to investigation**
    Then, in the **Investigate** pane, select the name of the
    investigation.

## Source account status shows "Pending link to monitoring account"

Check that both your monitoring account and source account are set up
correctly.

1. Check that the source account ID and the source account role name are
    correct.

2. The monitoring account role needs to have `sts:AssumeRole`
    permission to assume the source account role.

3. The source account role needs to have a trust policy for the monitoring
    account role to assume.

4. The trust policy in the source account role must be properly scoped to
    have the Investigation Group arn in the `sts:ExternalId` context
    key:

```json

               "Condition": {
                   "StringEquals": {
                       "sts:ExternalId": "investigation-group-arn"
                   }
               }

```

## Incident report generation issues

This section describes common issues you might encounter when generating incident
reports and how to resolve them.

### Report generation fails or produces incomplete content

If incident report generation fails, verify the
following:

- The investigation has at least one accepted hypothesis in the
**Feed**

- Your user and your investigation group have the necessary permissions, see [User permissions for your CloudWatch investigations group](investigations-security.md#Investigations-Security-IAM).
