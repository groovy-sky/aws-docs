# Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS

On November 6, 2023, a new version of Container Insights was released. This version
supports enhanced observability for Amazon EKS clusters running on Amazon EC2 and can collect more
detailed metrics from these clusters. After installation, it automatically collects detailed
infrastructure telemetry and container logs for your Amazon EKS clusters. You can then use curated,
immediately usable dashboards to drill down into application and infrastructure telemetry.

Container Insights with enhanced observability for Amazon EKS collects granular health,
performance, and status metrics up to the container level, and also control plane metrics. For
more information about the additional metrics and dimensions collected, see [Amazon EKS and Kubernetes Container Insights with enhanced observability metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-metrics-enhanced-EKS.html).
