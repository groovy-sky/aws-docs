# Create a CloudWatch alarm based on a metric math expression

Metric alarms are designed to evaluate time series that you define from either a single
metric, or a metric math expression that combines or transforms one or more metrics into a
time series that deliver insights more closely aligned to your unique needs. To create an
alarm based on a metric math expression, choose one or more CloudWatch metrics to use in the
expression. Then, specify the expression, threshold, and evaluation periods.

You can't create an alarm based on the **SEARCH** expression. Only alarms
based on Metrics Insights SQL queries can operate on multiple time series.

###### To create an alarm that's based on a metric math expression

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, and then choose
     **All alarms**.

03. Choose **Create alarm**.

04. Choose **Select Metric**, and then perform one of the following
     actions:
    - Select a namespace from the **AWS namespaces** dropdown or
       **Custom namespaces** dropdown. After you select a namespace, you
       continue choosing options until a list of metrics appears, where you select the
       checkbox next to the correct metric.

    - Use the search box to find a metric, account ID, dimension, or resource ID. After
       you enter the metric, dimension, or resource ID, you continue choosing options until a
       list of metrics appears, where you select the check box next to the correct
       metric.
05. (Optional) If you want to add another metric to a metric math expression, you can use
     the search box to find a specific metric. You can add as many as 10 metrics to a metric
     math expression.

06. Select the **Graphed metrics** tab. For each of the metrics that you
     previously added, perform the following actions:

    1. Under the **Statistic** column, select the dropdown menu. In the
        dropdown menu, choose one of the predefined statistics or percentiles. Use the search
        box in the dropdown menu to specify a custom
        percentile.

    2. Under the **Period** column, select the dropdown menu. In the
        dropdown menu, choose one of the predefined evaluation periods.

       While you're creating your alarm, you can specify whether the Y-axis legend
        appears on the left or right side of your graph.

###### Note

When CloudWatch evaluates alarms, periods are aggregated into single data points.

07. Choose the **Add math** dropdown, and then select **Start**
    **with an empty expression** from the list of predefined metric math
     expressions.

    After you choose **Start with an empty expression**, a math
     expression box appears where you apply or edit math expressions.

08. In the math expression box, enter your math expression, and then choose
     **Apply**.

    After you choose **Apply**, an **ID** column appears
     next to the **Label** column.

    To use a metric or the result of another metric math expression as part of your
     current math expression's formula, you use the value that's shown under the
     **ID** column. To change the value of **ID**, you
     select the pen-and-paper icon next to the current value. The new value must begin with a
     lowercase letter and can include numbers, letters, and the underscore symbol. Changing the
     value of **ID** to a more significant name can make your alarm graph
     easier to understand.

    For information about the functions that are available for metric math, see [Metric math syntax and functions](using-metric-math.md#metric-math-syntax).

09. (Optional) Add more math expressions, using both metrics and the results of other math
     expressions in the formulas of the new math expressions.

10. When you have the expression to use for the alarm, clear the check boxes to the left
     of every other expression and every metric on the page. Only the check box next to the
     expression to use for the alarm should be selected. The expression that you choose for the
     alarm must produce a single time series and show only one line on the graph. Then choose
     **Select metric**.

    The **Specify metric and conditions** page appears, showing a graph
     and other information about the math expression that you have selected.

11. For **Whenever `expression` is**, specify
     whether the expression must be greater than, less than, or equal to the threshold. Under
     **than...**, specify the threshold value.

12. Choose **Additional configuration**. For **Datapoints to**
    **alarm**, specify how many evaluation periods (data points) must be in the
     `ALARM` state to trigger the alarm. If the two values here match, you create
     an alarm that goes to `ALARM` state if that many consecutive periods are
     breaching.

    To create an M out of N alarm, specify a lower number for the first value than you
     specify for the second value. For more information, see [Alarm evaluation](alarm-evaluation.md).

13. For **Missing data treatment**, choose how to have the alarm behave
     when some data points are missing. For more information, see [Configuring how CloudWatch alarms treat missing data](alarms-and-missing-data.md).

14. Choose **Next**.

15. Under **Notification**, select an SNS topic to notify when the alarm
     is in `ALARM` state, `OK` state, or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
     state.

    To have the alarm send multiple notifications for the same alarm state or for
     different alarm states, choose **Add notification**.

    To have the alarm not send notifications, choose **Remove**.

16. To have the alarm perform Auto Scaling, Amazon EC2, Lambda, or Systems Manager actions, choose the
     appropriate button and choose the alarm state and action to perform. If you choose a Lambda
     function as an alarm action, you specify the function name or ARN, and you can optionally
     choose a specific version of the function.

    Alarms can perform Systems Manager actions only when they go into ALARM state. For more
     information about Systems Manager actions, see see [Configuring CloudWatch to create OpsItems from alarms](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/opscenter-create-opsitems-from-cloudwatch-alarms.md) and [Incident creation](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.md).

    ###### Note

    To create an alarm that performs an SSM Incident Manager action, you must have
    certain permissions. For more information, see [Identity-based policy examples for AWS Systems Manager Incident\
    Manager](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md).

17. When finished, choose **Next**.

18. Enter a name and description for the alarm. Then choose
     **Next**.

    The name must contain only UTF-8 characters, and can't contain ASCII control
     characters. The description can include markdown formatting, which is displayed only in
     the alarm **Details** tab in the CloudWatch console. The markdown can be useful
     to add links to runbooks or other internal resources.

19. Under **Preview and create**, confirm that the information and
     conditions are what you want, then choose **Create alarm**.

You can also add alarms to a dashboard. For more information, see [Adding an alarm to a CloudWatch dashboard](add-alarm-dashboard.md).
