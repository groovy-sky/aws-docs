# Getting started with CloudWatch automatic dashboards

The CloudWatch home page automatically displays metrics about every AWS service you use.
You can additionally create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom
applications, and display custom collections of metrics that you choose.

Open the CloudWatch console at
[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

The CloudWatch overview home page appears.

The overview displays the following items, refreshed automatically.

- **Alarms by AWS service** displays a list of AWS services you use in your account, along with
the state of alarms in those services. Next to that, two or four alarms in
your account are displayed. The number depends on how many AWS services you use. The alarms shown are
those in the ALARM state or those that most recently changed state.

These upper areas help you quickly assess the health of your AWS services, by
seeing the alarm states in every service and the alarms that most recently changed
state. This helps you monitor and quickly diagnose issues.

- Below these areas is the _default dashboard_, if one exists. The default
dashboard is a custom dashboard that you have created and named
**CloudWatch-Default**. This is a convenient way for
you to add metrics about your own custom services or applications to the overview
page, or to bring forward additional key metrics from AWS services that you most
want to monitor.

###### Note

The automatic dashboards on the CloudWatch home page display only information from the current
account, even if the account is a monitoring account set up for CloudWatch cross-account observability.
For information about creating custom cross-account dashboards, see
[Creating a CloudWatch cross-account cross-Region dashboard with the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create_xaxr_dashboard.html).

From this overview, you can see a cross-service dashboard of metrics from multiple AWS service, or focus your view to a
specific resource group or a specific AWS
service. This enables you to narrow your view to a subset of resources in which you are
interested.
