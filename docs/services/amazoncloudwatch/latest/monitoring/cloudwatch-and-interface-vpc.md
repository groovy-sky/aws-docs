# Using CloudWatch, CloudWatch Synthetics, and CloudWatch Network Monitoring with interface VPC endpoints

If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a private
connection between your VPC, CloudWatch, CloudWatch Synthetics, and CloudWatch Network Monitoring features.
You can use these connections to enable these services to communicate with resources in
your VPC without going through the public internet.

Amazon VPC is an AWS service that you can use to launch AWS resources in a virtual network
that you define. With a VPC, you have control over your network settings, such the IP
address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways. To connect your VPC to CloudWatch
services, you define an _interface VPC endpoint_ for your
VPC. The endpoint provides reliable, scalable connectivity to CloudWatch and supported CloudWatch
services without requiring an internet gateway, network address translation (NAT)
instance, or VPN connection. For more information, see [What is\
Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables
private communication between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private
IP addresses. For more information, see the following blog post: [New – AWS PrivateLink for AWS Services](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-privatelink-endpoints-kinesis-ec2-systems-manager-and-elb-apis-in-your-vpc)

The following steps are for users of Amazon VPC. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/GetStarted.html) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

## CloudWatch VPC endpoints

CloudWatch currently supports VPC endpoints, including IPv6-only and dual stack enabled endpoints, in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. For information on endpoints URL, see [CloudWatch endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cw_region.html).

### Creating a VPC endpoint for CloudWatch

To start using CloudWatch with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch. The
service name to choose is
`com.amazonaws.region.monitoring`. For
more information, see [Creating\
an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint.html) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

You do not need to change the settings for CloudWatch. CloudWatch calls
other AWS services using either public endpoints or private interface VPC endpoints, whichever are in use.
For example, if you create an interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch, and you already have metrics flowing
to CloudWatch from resources located on your VPC, these metrics begin flowing through the interface VPC endpoint by default.

### Controlling access to your CloudWatch VPC endpoint

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when you create or modify
the endpoint. If you don't attach a policy when you create an endpoint, Amazon VPC
attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service. An endpoint policy doesn't
override or replace user policies or service-specific policies. It's a separate policy for
controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service.

Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format.

For more information, see [Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

The following is an example of an endpoint policy for CloudWatch. This policy allows users
connecting to CloudWatch through the VPC to send metric data to CloudWatch and prevents them
from performing other CloudWatch actions.

```

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PutOnly",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

###### To edit the VPC endpoint policy for CloudWatch

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**.

3. If you have not already created the endpoint for CloudWatch, choose **Create**
**endpoint**. Select
    **com.amazonaws. `region`.monitoring**,
    and then choose **Create endpoint**.

4. Select the **com.amazonaws. `region`.monitoring**
    endpoint, and then choose the **Policy** tab.

5. Choose **Edit policy**, and then make your changes.

## CloudWatch Synthetics VPC endpoint

CloudWatch Synthetics currently supports VPC endpoints in the following AWS Regions:

- US East (Ohio)

- US East (N. Virginia)

- US West (N. California)

- US West (Oregon)

- Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)

- Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

- Asia Pacific (Seoul)

- Asia Pacific (Singapore)

- Asia Pacific (Sydney)

- Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

- Canada (Central)

- Europe (Frankfurt)

- Europe (Ireland)

- Europe (London)

- Europe (Paris)

- South America (São Paulo)

### Creating a VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Synthetics

To start using CloudWatch Synthetics with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for
CloudWatch Synthetics. The service name to choose is
`com.amazonaws.region.synthetics`.
For more information, see [Creating\
an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint.html) in the
_Amazon VPC User Guide_.

You do not need to change the settings for CloudWatch Synthetics. CloudWatch Synthetics
communicates with other AWS services using either public endpoints or private
interface VPC endpoints, whichever are in use. For example, if you create an
interface VPC endpoint for CloudWatch Synthetics, and you already have an interface
endpoint for Amazon S3, CloudWatch Synthetics begins communicating with Amazon S3 through the
interface VPC endpoint by default.

### Controlling access to your CloudWatch Synthetics VPC endpoint

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when
you create or modify the endpoint. If you don't attach a policy when you create an
endpoint, we attach a default policy for you that allows full access to the service. An
endpoint policy doesn't override or replace user policies or service-specific
policies. It's a separate policy for controlling access from the endpoint to the
specified service.

Endpoint policies affect canaries that are managed privately by VPC. They are not needed for
canaries that run on private subnets.

Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format.

For more information, see [Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

The following is an example of an endpoint policy for CloudWatch Synthetics.
This policy enables users
connecting to CloudWatch Synthetics through the VPC to view information about canaries and
their runs, but not to create, modify, or delete canaries.

```

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "synthetics:DescribeCanaries",
                "synthetics:GetCanaryRuns"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Principal": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### To edit the VPC endpoint policy for CloudWatch Synthetics

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**.

3. If you have not already created the endpoint for CloudWatch Synthetics, choose **Create**
**endpoint**. Select
    **com.amazonaws. `region`.synthetics**
    and then choose **Create endpoint**.

4. Select the **com.amazonaws. `region`.synthetics**
    endpoint, and then choose the **Policy** tab.

5. Choose **Edit policy**, and then make your changes.

## CloudWatch Network Monitoring feature VPC endpoints

CloudWatch Network Monitoring includes the following features: Network Flow Monitor, Internet Monitor, and Network Synthetic Monitor. These features each support VPC endpoints in
the AWS Regions where the Network Monitoring feature is supported.

To see a list of supported Regions for each Network Monitoring feature, see the following topics:

- **Network Flow Monitor:** [Supported AWS Regions for Network Flow Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-NetworkFlowMonitor-Regions.html)

- **Internet Monitor:** [Supported AWS Regions for Internet Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.Regions.html)

- **Network Synthetic Monitor:** [Supported AWS Regions for Network Synthetic Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/nw-monitor-regions.html)

### Creating a VPC endpoint for a CloudWatch Network Monitoring feature

To start using CloudWatch Network Monitoring features with your VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint for
the feature that you want to use. For Network Monitoring, the following service names are available:

- `com.amazonaws.region.networkflowmonitor`

- `com.amazonaws.region.networkflowmonitorreports`

- `com.amazonaws.region.internetmonitor`

- `com.amazonaws.region.internetmonitor-fips`

- `com.amazonaws.region.networkmonitor`

For more information, see [Creating\
an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint.html) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

You don't need to change the settings for Network Monitoring services. Network Monitoring services
communicate with other AWS services using either public endpoints or private
interface VPC endpoints, whichever are being used. For example, if you create an
interface VPC endpoint for a Network Monitoring service, and you already have metrics flowing to the
service from resources located on your VPC, the metrics begin flowing through the interface VPC endpoint by default.

### Controlling access to your CloudWatch Network Monitoring feature VPC endpoints

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint when you create or modify
the endpoint. An endpoint policy doesn't
override or replace user policies or service-specific policies. It's a separate policy for
controlling access from the endpoint to the specified service.

If you don't attach a policy when you create an endpoint, Amazon VPC attaches a default policy for you that allows full access and does not restrict access
to a specific service. For additional security, you can attach a policy to the endpoint to specifically limit access to the feature. For example, for
Internet Monitor, you could allow full access to just Internet Monitor by attaching the AWS managed policy that enables full access to the feature, [CloudWatchInternetMonitorFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/CloudWatchInternetMonitorFullAccess.html).
Or, you can further limit permissions to just specific actions for the endpoint.

For more information, see [Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html)
in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_.

The following is an example of an endpoint policy that you could create for Network Flow Monitor to limit actions for the endpoint. This policy allows requests to
Network Flow Monitor through the VPC to use only the `Publish` action, which enables requests to publish metrics to Network Flow Monitor backend ingestion.

```

{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "networkflowmonitor:Publish",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you want to use a specific VPC endpoint policy with an interface VPC endpoint for
a Network Monitoring feature, use steps similar to the following example for adding a policy for Network Flow Monitor.

###### To edit a VPC endpoint policy for Network Flow Monitor

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**.

3. If you have not already created the endpoint for Internet Monitor, choose **Create endpoint**.

4. Select **com.amazonaws. `region`.networkflowmonitor**,
    and then choose **Create endpoint**.

5. Select the **com.amazonaws. `region`.networkflowmonitor**
    endpoint, and then choose the **Policy** tab.

6. Choose **Edit policy**, and then make your changes.
