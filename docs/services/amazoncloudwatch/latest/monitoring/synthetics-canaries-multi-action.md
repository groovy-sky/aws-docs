# Start, stop, delete, or update runtime for multiple canaries

You can stop, start, delete, or update the runtime of as many as five canaries with one
action. If you update the runtime
of a canary, it is updated to the latest runtime available for the language and framework that
the canary uses.

If you select multiple canaries and only some of them are in a state that is valid for the
action that
you select, the action is performed only on the canaries where that action is valid. For
example,
if you select some canaries that are currently running and some that are not, and you select
to start the canaries,
the canaries that weren't already running will start, and the canaries that were already
running are not affected.

If none of the canaries that you select are valid for an action, that action will not be
available in the menu.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at

3. Select the check boxes next to the canaries that you want to stop, start, or delete.

4. Choose **Actions** and then choose either **Start**, **Stop**, **Delete**, **Start Dry Run**, or **Update**
**Runtime**.

In addition, when choosing **Update Runtime**, you can choose to dry
    run the runtime update first before committing the change.
