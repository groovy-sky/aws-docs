# Translations with OpenTelemetry 1.0.0 format in CloudWatch

CloudWatch performs some transformations to put CloudWatch data into
OpenTelemetry format.

**Translating namespace, metric name, and dimensions**

These attributes are key-value pairs encoded in the mapping.

- One attribute has the key `Namespace` and its value is the
namespace of the metric

- One attribute has the key `MetricName` and its value
is the name of the metric

- One pair has the key `Dimensions` and its value is a nested
list of key-value pairs. Each pair in this list maps to a CloudWatch metric dimension,
where the pair's key is the name of the dimension and its value is the value
of the dimension.

**Translating Average, Sum, SampleCount, Min and Max**

The Summary datapoint enables CloudWatch to export all of these statistics using
one datapoint.

- `startTimeUnixNano` contains the CloudWatch `startTime`

- `timeUnixNano` contains the CloudWatch `endTime`

- `sum` contains the Sum statistic.

- `count` contains the SampleCount statistic.

- `quantile_values` contains two `valueAtQuantile.value`
objects:

- `valueAtQuantile.quantile = 0.0` with
`valueAtQuantile.value = Min value`

- `valueAtQuantile.quantile = 0.99` with
`valueAtQuantile.value = p99 value`

- `valueAtQuantile.quantile = 0.999` with
`valueAtQuantile.value = p99.9 value`

- `valueAtQuantile.quantile = 1.0` with
`valueAtQuantile.value = Max value`

Resources that consume the metric stream can calculate the Average statistic as
**Sum/SampleCount**.

**Translating units**

CloudWatch units are mapped to the case-sensitive variant of the Unified code for
Units of Measure, as shown in the following table.
For more information,
see [The Unified Code For Units of Measure](https://ucum.org/ucum.html).

Units that are combined with a slash are mapped by applying the
OpenTelemetry conversion of both the units. For example,
Bytes/Second is mapped to By/s.
