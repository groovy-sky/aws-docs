# Adding a graph widget to a CloudWatch dashboard

The procedures
in this section
describe
how
to add and remove graphs
from your dashboard.
For information
about
how
to edit a graph
on your dashboard,
see [Edit a graph \
on a CloudWatch dashboard](edit-graph-dashboard.md).

###### To add a graph to a dashboard

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. In the navigation pane,
     choose **Dashboards**,
     and then choose a dashboard.

03. Choose the **+** symbol,
     and then choose the type of graph
     that you want
     to add
     to your dashboard, then choose **Next**.

    1. If you select **_Line_**, **_Stacked area_**, **_Bar_**, or **_Pie_**,
        choose **Metrics**.
04. In the **Browse** tab,
     search or browse for the metrics to graph, and select the ones that you want.

05. (Optional) To change your graph's time range, select one of the predefined
     time ranges in the upper part of the screen. The time ranges span
     from 1 hour to 1 week ( **_1h_**,
     **_3h_**,
     **_12h_**,
     **_1d_**,
     **_3d_**, or
     **_1w_**).

     To set your own time range,
     choose **Custom**.

    1. (Optional) To have this widget keep using this time range that you select, even
        if the time range for the rest of the dashboard is later changed, choose **Persist time range**.
06. (Optional) To change your graph's widget type,
     use the dropdown
     that's next
     to the predefined time ranges.

07. (Optional) In **Graphed metrics**, you can add a dynamic
     label to your metric and change your metric's label, label color, statistic,
     and period. You also can determine the position of labels on the
     Y-axis
     from left to right.
    1. To add a dynamic label,
        choose **Graphed metrics**,
        and then choose **Add dynamic labels**.
        Dynamic labels display a statistic
        about your metric
        in the graph legend.
        Dynamic labels update automatically
        when your dashboard or graph refreshes.
        By default,
        the dynamic values
        that you add
        to labels
        appear
        at the beginning
        of your labels.
        For more information,
        see [Use dynamic labels](graph-dynamic-labels.md).

    2. To change the color of a metric,
        choose the color square
        that's next
        to the metric.

    3. To change the statistic,
        select the dropdown
        under **_Statistic_**,
        and then choose a new value.
        For more information, see [Statistics](cloudwatch-concepts.md#Statistic).

    4. To change the period,
        select the dropdown
        under the **_Period_** column,
        and then choose a new value.
08. If you are creating a gauge widget, you must choose the **Options** tab
     and specify the **Min** and **Max** values to use for the two
     ends of the gauge.

09. (Optional) To customize the Y-axis, choose **Options**. You
     can add a custom label under **_Left_**
    **_Y-axis_** in the label field. If your graph displays
     values on the right side of the Y-axis, you can customize that label, too.
     You also can set minimum and maximum limits on your Y-axis values, so
     that your graph only displays the value ranges that you
     specify.

10. (Optional) To add or edit horizontal annotations to line or stacked area graphs, or to
     add thresholds to gauge widgets,
     choose **Options**:

    1. To add a horizontal annotation or threshold,
        choose **Add horizontal annotation** or **Add threshold**.

    2. For **_Label_**, enter a label
        for the annotation then choose the check mark icon.

    3. For **_Value_**, choose the pen
        and paper icon that's next to the current value,
        and enter your new value. After you enter your value,
        choose the check mark icon.

    4. For **_Fill_**, select the
        dropdown
        and specify how your annotation will use shading. You can choose
        **_None_**,
        **_Above_**,
        **_Between_**, or
        **_Below_**. To change
        the fill color, choose the color square that's next to the
        annotation.

    5. For **_Axis_**,
        specify whether your annotation appears
        on the left or right side
        of the Y-axis.

    6. To hide an annotation,
        clear
        the
        check
        box that's next to the annotation you want to
        hide.

    7. To delete an annotation,
        choose **X**
        under **_Actions_**.

###### Note

You can repeat these steps
to add multiple horizontal annotations or thresholds
to the same graph or gauge.

11. (Optional) To add or edit vertical annotations,
     choose **Options**:

    1. To add a vertical annotation,
        choose **Add vertical annotation**.

    2. For **_Label_**, choose the pen
        and paper icon that's next to the current annotation, and enter your
        new annotation.
        If you want to show only the date and time, leave the label field
        blank.

    3. For **_Date_**,
        choose the current date and time,
        and enter the new date and time.

    4. For **_Fill_**, select the
        dropdown,
        and specify how your annotation will use shading. You can choose
        **_None_**,
        **_Above_**,
        **_Between_**,
        or **_Below_**. To change the
        fill color, select the color square that's next to the annotation.

    5. To hide an annotation,
        clear
        the
        check
        box
        next
        to the annotation
        that
        you want to hide.

    6. To delete an annotation,
        choose **X**
        under **_Actions_**.

###### Note

You can repeat these steps
to add multiple vertical annotations
to the same graph.

12. Choose **Create widget**.

13. Choose **Save dashboard**.
