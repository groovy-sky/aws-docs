# AWS managed policies for Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed
to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because
they're available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining
[customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS
managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is
most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for
existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the
_IAM User Guide_.

## AWS managed policy: CloudWatchApplicationInsightsFullAccess

You can attach the `CloudWatchApplicationInsightsFullAccess` policy to your
IAM identities.

This policy grants administrative permissions that allow full access to Application Insights
functionality.

**Permissions details**

This policy includes the following permissions.

- `applicationinsights` – Allows full access to Application Insights
functionality.

- `iam` – Allows Application Insights to create the service-linked role,
AWSServiceRoleForApplicationInsights. This is required so that Application Insights can
perform operations such as analyze the resource groups of a customer, create
CloudFormation stacks to create alarms on metrics, and configure the CloudWatch
Agent on EC2 instances. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for CloudWatch Application Insights](chap-using-service-linked-roles-appinsights.md).
