# Enable telemetry configuration for your organization

To turn on telemetry configuration for your organization, you must use a AWS
Organization management account or a delegated administrator account. CloudWatch uses this account
to discover your organization's AWS resources and configure their telemetry.

Before you can configure telemetry for your organization, you need to enable trusted
access between AWS Organizations and CloudWatch. For more information, see [Prerequisites and permissions](telemetry-config-turn-on.md#telemetry-config-prerequisites).

###### To turn on telemetry auditing for your organization

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**.

3. Choose the **Organizations** tab.

4. On the **CloudWatch** settings page, in the **Organizational**
**settings management** pane, choose **Turn on trusted access**.
    The **Turn on trusted access** page appears.

To review the role policy, choose **View permission details** and
    the role policy appears in a window. Confirm that you want to provide these permissions to
    the management account by choosing **Turn on trusted access**.

5. Under **Manage Settings**, in the **Organizations**
**tab** in the **CloudWatch Telemetry Config** block choose
    **Turn on**.

6. After Telemetry config is turned on for the organization, a notification appears. On
    the notification, choose Go to Telemetry config. The Telemetry Configuration experience
    can be accessed in the **Ingestion** page and CloudWatch begins discovering
    AWS resources in the organization. As CloudWatch discovers resources, it updates information
    on the **Telemetry config** page.

###### Note

The time delay before resources appear on the **Telemetry config**
page depends on the number of member accounts and resources in your organization or
account.

## Configuring telemetry for your organization

Configure telemetry for AWS Organizations to monitor the telemetry for the AWS resources
across all your member accounts. This also configures the telemetry for individual accounts.
You can also configure telemetry for only your account. For more information, see [Enable telemetry configuration for your account](telemetry-config-turn-on.md#telemetry-config-turn-on-account).

You can disable trusted access across all your member accounts. For more information,
see [Turning off trusted access for AWS Organizations](telemetry-config-turn-on.md#telemetry-config-turn-off-trusted-access).

###### To configure telemetry auditing for your organization

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Ingestion**.

3. Choose **Data sources**, and then choose the
    **Enable Resources Discovery Button**. CloudWatch begins discovering AWS
    resources in your organization. As CloudWatch discovers resources, it updates information in
    the **Overview** page.

###### Note

The delay before resources appear on the **Overview** page depends
on the number of member accounts and resources in your organization.

## Enabling across Regions

You can extend telemetry configuration to multiple AWS Regions from a single Region
for your entire organization. When you enable multi-Region support, the current Region
becomes your _home Region_. Telemetry configuration is replicated to the
Regions you select for all member accounts.

###### To enable telemetry configuration across Regions for your organization (initial setup)

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**, and then choose
    the **Organizations** tab.

3. In the **CloudWatch telemetry config** section on the
    **Global** tab, the status shows **Off**.
    When multi-Region is enabled, a **Target regions** selector
    appears inline below the status.

4. Use the **All regions** toggle to include all Regions, or use
    the multiselect dropdown to choose individual Regions. The current Region is always
    included automatically and is not shown in the selector.

5. Choose **Turn on**.

6. After telemetry configuration is turned on, a **Region status**
    table appears showing the per-Region evaluation status.

###### To reconfigure Regions for your organization (telemetry already running)

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**, and then choose
    the **Organizations** tab.

3. In the **CloudWatch telemetry config** section, choose
    **Configure regions**. The **Target regions**
    selector appears inline, pre-populated with the currently configured Regions.

4. Modify the Region selection as needed, and then choose
    **Save**.

If you select **All regions**, new Regions are automatically included
when you opt in to them. The system periodically reconciles configuration across Regions to
correct any drift.
