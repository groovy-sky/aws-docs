# Amazon ECS Container Insights with enhanced observability metrics

Container Insights with enhanced observability provides deeper visibility into containerized workloads by offering:

- Higher metrics granularity at both task and container levels

- Improved monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities

- Integration with CloudWatch Logs for:

- Correlating metrics anomalies with log entries

- Performing faster root cause analysis

- Reducing resolution time for complex container issues

**Use cases**

Container Insights with enhanced observability extends the capabilities of standard Container Insights. It enables the following use cases:

- **Task-level troubleshooting** – Identify performance bottlenecks at the task level. Analyze task-level metrics and compare them with reserved resources to determine if tasks have sufficient processing capacity

- **Container-level resource optimization** – Track utilization against reservation levels to identify containers that are either resource-constrained or over-provisioned

- **Container health assessment** – Monitor restart counts and state transitions to detect unstable containers requiring intervention

- **Application performance monitoring** – Track how applications communicate with each other, monitor resource usage patterns, and optimize data storage performance

- **Operational monitoring** – Monitor deployments, track task sets for blue or green deployments, and maintain platform health through service metrics

For more information on Amazon ECS metrics, see [Amazon ECS service utilization metrics use cases](../../../amazonecs/latest/developerguide/service-utilization-metrics-explanation.md) and for information on container insights with enhanced observability
[Amazon ECS Container Insights with enhanced observability metrics](container-insights-enhanced-observability-metrics-ecs.md).

Container Insights also shows cluster, service, and daemon-wide statistics by
averaging data across all tasks. This provides a higher-level view of your service and
daemon health, assisting in both environment monitoring and capacity planning.

###### Note

Amazon ECS Managed Daemon metrics use the same `ECS/ContainerInsights` namespace and
the same `ServiceName` dimension as service metrics. For daemon metrics, the
`ServiceName` dimension value uses the format
`daemon:daemon-name`. For example, a daemon named
`my-daemon` has a `ServiceName` dimension value of
`daemon:my-daemon`. All metrics in the table below that include the
`ServiceName` dimension also apply to Managed Daemons.

The following table lists the metrics and dimensions that Container Insights with
enhanced observability collects for Amazon ECS. These metrics are in the
`ECS/ContainerInsights` namespace. For more information, see [Metrics](cloudwatch-concepts.md#Metric).

If you do not see any Container Insights metrics in your console, be sure that you have
completed the setup of Container Insights with enhanced observability. Metrics do not appear
before Container Insights with enhanced observability has been set up completely. For more
information, see [Set up Container Insights with enhanced observability](deploy-container-insights-ecs-cluster.md#set-container-insights-ECS-cluster-enhanced).

The following metrics are available for all launch types.

###### Note

The
`EphemeralStorageReserved` and `EphemeralStorageUtilized` metrics
are only available for tasks that run on Fargate Linux platform version 1.4.0 or
later.

Fargate reserves space on disk. It is only used by Fargate. You aren't billed for it.
It isn't shown in these metrics. However, you can see this additional storage in other
tools such as `df`.
