# Analyzing, optimizing, and reducing CloudWatch costs

This section describes how Amazon CloudWatch features generate costs. It also provides methods that
can help you analyze, optimize, and reduce CloudWatch costs. Throughout this section, we sometimes
refer to pricing when describing CloudWatch features. For information about pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls).

## Analyze CloudWatch cost and usage data with Cost Explorer

With AWS Cost Explorer, you can visualize and analyze cost and usage data for AWS services
over time, including CloudWatch. For more information, see [Getting started with AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/getting-started).

The following procedure describes how to use Cost Explorer to visualize and analyze CloudWatch cost
and usage data.

### To visualize and analyze CloudWatch cost and usage data

1. Sign in to the Cost Explorer console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home#/custom](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/home).

2. Under **FILTERS**, for **Service**,
    select **CloudWatch**.

3. For **Group by**, choose **Usage Type**.
    You can also group your results by other categories, such as the following:

- **API Operation** – See which API
operations generated the most costs.

- **Region** – See which Regions generated
the most costs.

The following image shows an example of the costs that CloudWatch features generated
over six months.

![A screenshot of the AWS Cost Explorer interface, showing Usage Type costs in a bar graph format.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/ce.png)

To see which CloudWatch features generated the most costs, look at the values for
`UsageType`. For example, `EU-CW:GMD-Metrics` represents
the costs that CloudWatch bulk API requests generated.

###### Note

The strings for `UsageType` match specific features and Regions.
For example, the first part of `EU-CW:GMD-Metrics` ( `EU`)
matches the Europe (Ireland) Region, and the second part of
`EU-CW:GMD-Metrics` ( `GMD-Metrics`) matches CloudWatch bulk
API requests.

The entire string for `UsageType` can be formatted as follows:
`<Region>-CW:<Feature>` or
`<Region>-<Feature>`.

Some CloudWatch features such as logs and alarms also uses the `Global`
Region to identify the Free Tier usage. For example,
`Global-DataScanned-Bytes` represents free CloudWatch Logs data ingestion
usage.

To enhance readability, the strings for `UsageType` in the tables
throughout this document have been shortened to their string suffixes. For
example, `EU-CW:GMD-Metrics` is shortened to
`GMD-Metrics`.

The following table includes the names of each CloudWatch feature, lists the names of
each sub-feature, and lists the strings for `UsageType`.

## Analyze CloudWatch cost and usage data with AWS Cost and Usage Reports and Athena

Another way to analyze CloudWatch cost and usage data is by using AWS Cost and Usage Reports with Amazon Athena.
AWS Cost and Usage Reports contain a comprehensive set of cost and usage data. You can create reports
that track your costs and usage, and you can publish these reports to an S3 bucket of
your choice. You also can download and delete your reports from your S3 bucket. For more
information, see [What are AWS Cost and Usage Reports?](../../../cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.md) in the _AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide_.

###### Note

There is no charge for using AWS Cost and Usage Reports. You only pay for storage when you publish
your reports to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). For more information, see [Quotas\
and restrictions](../../../cur/latest/userguide/billing-cur-limits.md) in the _AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide_.

Athena is a query service that you can use with AWS Cost and Usage Reports to analyze cost and usage
data. You can query your reports in your S3 bucket without needing to download them
first. For more information, see [What is Amazon Athena?](../../../athena/latest/ug/what-is.md) in the
_Amazon Athena User Guide_. For more information, see [What is Amazon Athena?](../../../athena/latest/ug/what-is.md)
in the _Amazon Athena User Guide_. For information about pricing, see
[Amazon Athena pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing).

The following procedure describes the process for enabling AWS Cost and Usage Reports and integrating
the service with Athena. The procedure contains two example queries that you can use to
analyze CloudWatch cost and usage data.

###### Note

You can use any of the example queries in this document. All of the example
queries in this document correspond to a database named
**_costandusagereport_**, and show
results for the month of April and the year 2025. You can change this information.
However, before you run a query, make sure that the name of your database matches
the name of the database in the query.

### To analyze cost and usage data with AWS Cost and Usage Reports and Athena

1. Enable AWS Cost and Usage Reports. For more information, see [Creating cost and usage\
    reports](../../../cur/latest/userguide/cur-create.md) in the _AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide_.

###### Tip

When you create your reports, make sure to select **Include**
**resource IDs**. Otherwise, your reports won't include the
column `line_item_resource_id`. This line helps you further
identify costs when analyzing cost and usage data.

2. Integrate AWS Cost and Usage Reports with Athena. For more information, see [Setting up Athena using CloudFormation templates](../../../cur/latest/userguide/use-athena-cf.md) in the
    _AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide_.

3. Query your cost and usage reports.

###### Example of Athena query to show CloudWatch costs per month

You can use the following query to show which CloudWatch features generated the most
costs for a given month.

```

UsageType;

```

###### Example of Athena query to show how CloudWatch features generated costs

You can use the following query to show the results for `UsageType`
and `Operation`. This shows you how CloudWatch features generated costs.
The results also show the values for `UsageQuantity` and
`TotalSpend`, so that you can see your total usage costs.

###### Tip

For more information about `UsageType`, add the following line
to this query:

`line_item_line_item_description`

This line creates a column called
**_Description_**.

```nohighlight

SELECT
bill_payer_account_id as Payer,
line_item_usage_account_id as LinkedAccount,
line_item_usage_type AS UsageType,
line_item_operation AS Operation,
line_item_resource_id AS ResourceID,
SUM(CAST(line_item_usage_amount AS double)) AS UsageQuantity,
SUM(CAST(line_item_unblended_cost AS decimal(16,8))) AS TotalSpend
FROM
costandusagereport
WHERE
product_product_name = 'AmazonCloudWatch'
AND year='2025'
AND month='4'
AND line_item_line_item_type NOT IN ('Tax','Credit','Refund','EdpDiscount','Fee','RIFee')
GROUP BY
bill_payer_account_id,
line_item_usage_account_id,
line_item_usage_type,
line_item_resource_id,
line_item_operation
```

## Optimizing and reducing costs of CloudWatch metrics

Many AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) , Amazon S3, and Amazon Data Firehose, automatically
send metrics to CloudWatch at no charge. However, metrics that are grouped in the following
categories can incur additional costs:

- _**Custom metrics, detailed monitoring, and embedded**_
_**metrics**_

- _**API requests**_

- _**Metric streams**_

For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch\
metrics](working-with-metrics.md).

### Custom metrics

You can create custom metrics to organize data points in any order and at any
rate.

All custom metrics are prorated by the hour. They're metered only when they're
sent to CloudWatch. For information about how metrics are priced, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls).

The following table lists the names of relevant sub-features for CloudWatch metrics. The
table includes the strings for `UsageType` and `Operation`,
which can help you analyze and identify metric-related costs.

###### Note

To get more details about the metrics that are listed in the following table
while you're querying cost and usage data with Athena, match the strings for
`Operation` with the results that are shown for
`line_item_operation`.

_Log filters_

`MetricMonitorUsage`

`MetricStorage:AWS/CloudWatchLogs`

Log group metric filters

### Detailed monitoring

CloudWatch has two types of monitoring:

- _**Basic monitoring**_

Basic monitoring is free and automatically enabled for all AWS services
that support the feature.

- _**Detailed monitoring**_

Detailed monitoring incurs costs and adds different enhancements depending
on the AWS service. For each AWS service that supports detailed
monitoring, you can choose whether to enable it for that service. For more
information, see [Basic and detailed monitoring](cloudwatch-metrics-basic-detailed.md).

###### Note

Other AWS services support detailed monitoring and might refer to this
feature using a different name. For example, detailed monitoring for Amazon S3 is
referred to as **_request metrics_**.

Similar to custom metrics, detailed monitoring is prorated by the hour and metered
only when data is sent to CloudWatch. Detailed monitoring generates costs by the number of
metrics that are sent to CloudWatch. To reduce costs, only enable detailed monitoring when
necessary. For information about how detailed monitoring is priced, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls).

**_Example: Athena query_**

You can use the following query to show which EC2 instances have detailed
monitoring enabled.

```nohighlight

SELECT
bill_payer_account_id as Payer,
line_item_usage_account_id as LinkedAccount,
line_item_usage_type AS UsageType,
line_item_operation AS Operation,
line_item_resource_id AS ResourceID,
SUM(CAST(line_item_usage_amount AS double)) AS UsageQuantity,
SUM(CAST(line_item_unblended_cost AS decimal(16,8))) AS TotalSpend
FROM
costandusagereport
WHERE
product_product_name = 'AmazonCloudWatch'
AND year='2025'
AND month='4'
AND line_item_operation='MetricStorage:AWS/EC2'
AND line_item_line_item_type NOT IN ('Tax','Credit','Refund','EdpDiscount','Fee','RIFee')
GROUP BY
bill_payer_account_id,
line_item_usage_account_id,
line_item_usage_type,
line_item_resource_id,
line_item_operation,
line_item_line_item_description
ORDER BY line_item_operation
```

### Embedded metrics

With the CloudWatch embedded metric format, you can ingest application data as log data,
so that you can generate actionable metrics. For more information, see [Ingesting high-cardinality logs and generating metrics with the CloudWatch embedded\
metric format](cloudwatch-embedded-metric-format.md).

Embedded metrics generate costs by the number of logs ingested, number of logs
archived, and number of custom metrics generated.

The following table lists the names of relevant sub-features for the CloudWatch embedded
metric format. The table includes the strings for `UsageType` and
`Operation`, which can help you analyze and identify costs.

_CloudWatch subfeature_

`UsageType`

`Operation`

Purpose

_Custom metrics_

`MetricMonitorUsage`

`MetricStorage:AWS/Logs-EMF`

Logs embedded metrics

_Logs ingestion_

`DataProcessing-Bytes`

`PutLogEvents`

Uploads a batch of log events to the specified log group or log
stream

_Logs archival_

`TimedStorage-ByteHrs`

`HourlyStorageMetering`

Stores logs per hour and logs per byte in CloudWatch Logs

To analyze costs, use AWS Cost and Usage Reports with Athena so that you can identify which metrics
are generating costs and determine how the costs are generated.

To make the most of costs generated by the CloudWatch embedded metric format, avoid
creating metrics based on high-cardinality dimensions. This way, CloudWatch doesn't create
a custom metric for each unique dimension combination. For more information, see
[Dimensions](cloudwatch-concepts.md#Dimension).

### API requests

CloudWatch has the following types of API requests:

- **_API requests_**

- **_Bulk (Get)_**

- **_Contributor Insights_**

- **_Bitmap image snapshot_**

API requests generate costs by the request type and number of metrics requested.

The following table lists the types of API requests and includes the strings for
`UsageType` and `Operation`, which can help you analyze
and identify API-related costs.

_API request type_

`GMWI-Metrics`

`GetMetricWidgetImage`

Retrieves a snapshot of one or more CloudWatch metrics as a bitmap
image

To analyze costs, use Cost Explorer, and group your results by **_API_**
**_Operation_**.

The billing console shows generic API requests under UsageType _Requests_. These appear as _X.XX USD per 1,000 requests - \[region\]_. This rate applies to all requests with the UsageType Requests, aggregated together, beyond your free tier allowance.

Costs for API requests vary, and you incur costs when you exceed the number of API
calls provided to you under the AWS Free Tier limit.

###### Note

Only API requests with UsageType _Requests_ are included in the AWS Free Tier limit. API requests with any other UsageType incur charges from the first call. For more information, see [Using the\
AWS Free Tier](../../../awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-free-tier.md) in the _AWS Billing User_
_Guide_.

The API requests that typically drive cost are `Put` and
`Get` requests.

To monitor API request origins and identify users within your account, enable data events in CloudTrail and analyze recorded events using either:

- Amazon CloudWatch Logs with Log Insights

- Amazon S3 with Amazon Athena

###### Note

Data events are not logged automatically by trails and event data stores. Logging data events incurs additional costs. For more information, see [AWS CloudTrail Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing).

For more information, see [Logging data events](../../../awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.md) and [Identifying resources driving CloudWatch GetMetricData charges using AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/identifying-resources-driving-amazon-cloudwatch-getmetricdata-charges-using-aws-cloudtrail).

**_`API calls not incurring charges`_**

When you log CloudWatch data events in CloudTrail, you might see more calls than you initiated. This happens because logging CloudWatch data events in CloudTrail captures API actions from internal components. Internal component calls don’t incur
CloudWatch charges. However, these events count toward your CloudTrail event logging total and may affect CloudTrail charges.

For example, CloudTrail will record GetMetricData calls initiated by a monitoring account to retrieve data from a source account, as well
as GetMetricData calls initiated by CloudWatch dashboards to refresh widget data. These API calls do not incur CloudWatch charges.

**_`PutMetricData`_**

Each CloudWatch `PutMetricData` API call incurs charges. Frequent calls can significantly increase your costs, especially in high-volume monitoring scenarios. To reduce costs,
consider batching multiple metrics in each API call or adjusting your monitoring frequency. For more information, see [PutMetricData](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-putmetricdata.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch API Reference_.

To make the most of costs that are generated by `PutMetricData`, batch
more data into your API calls. Depending on your use case, consider using CloudWatch Logs or
the CloudWatch embedded metric format to inject metric data. For more information, see the
following resources:

- [What is\
Amazon CloudWatch Logs?](../logs/whatiscloudwatchlogs.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User_
_Guide_

- [Ingesting high-cardinality logs and generating metrics with CloudWatch\
embedded metric format](cloudwatch-embedded-metric-format.md)

- [Lowering costs and focusing on our customers with Amazon CloudWatch embedded\
custom metrics](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/lowering-costs-and-focusing-on-our-customers-with-amazon-cloudwatch-embedded-custom-metrics)

**_`GetMetricData`_**

The CloudWatch `GetMetricData` API operation can also significantly increase your costs. Third-party monitoring tools often increase costs when they frequently pull
data to generate insights. To learn more about pricing and best practices for using `GetMetricData`, see [GetMetricData](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-getmetricdata.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch API Reference_.

To reduce costs generated by `GetMetricData`, consider only pulling
data that's monitored and used, or consider pulling data less often. Depending on
your use case, you might consider using metric streams instead of
`GetMetricData`, so that you can push data in near real time to third
parties at a lower cost. For more information, see the following resources:

- [Using metric streams](cloudwatch-metric-streams.md)

- [CloudWatch Metric Streams - Send AWS Metrics to Partners and to Your Apps\
in Real Time](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-metric-streams-send-aws-metrics-to-partners-and-to-your-apps-in-real-time)

**_`GetMetricStatistics`_**

Depending on your use case, you might consider using
`GetMetricStatistics` instead of `GetMetricData`. With
`GetMetricData`, you can retrieve data quickly and at scale. However,
`GetMetricStatistics` is included under the AWS Free Tier limit for
up to one million API requests, which can help you reduce costs if you don't need to
retrieve as many metrics and data points per call. For more information, see the
following resources:

- [GetMetricStatistics](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-getmetricstatistics.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch API_
_Reference_

- [Should I use GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-getmetricdata-api)

###### Note

External callers make API calls. For APIs that are supported by CloudTrail data
events (such as **GetMetricData** and
**GetMetricWidgetImage**), you can use CloudTrail to identify the
top CloudWatch API callers and potentially mitigate or identify unexpected calls. For
more information, see [How to use CloudTrail to analyse your CloudWatch API Usage](https://community.aws/content/2iyFpJMy6oRlAXFgAL1dbJLUXbh/how-to-use-cloudwatch-api-with-cloudtrail). For other CloudWatch
APIs not supported by CloudTrail, you can open a technical support request to the CloudWatch
team and ask for information about them. For information about creating a
technical support request, see [How do I get technical support from AWS?](https://aws.amazon.com/de/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/get-aws-technical-support).

### CloudWatch metric streams

With CloudWatch metric streams, you can send metrics continuously to AWS destinations
and third-party service provider destinations.

Metric streams generate costs by the number of metric updates. Metric updates
always include values for the following statistics:

- `Minimum`

- `Maximum`

- `Sample Count`

- `Sum`

For more information, see [Statistics that can be streamed](cloudwatch-metric-streams-statistics.md).

To analyze costs that are generated by CloudWatch metric streams, use AWS Cost and Usage Reports with
Athena. This way, you can identify which metric streams are generating costs and
determine how the costs are generated.

**_Example: Athena query_**

You can use the following query to track which metric streams generate costs by
Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

```nohighlight

SELECT
SPLIT_PART(line_item_resource_id,'/',2) AS "Stream Name",
line_item_resource_id as ARN,
SUM(CAST(line_item_unblended_cost AS decimal(16,2))) AS TotalSpend
FROM
costandusagereport
WHERE
product_product_name = 'AmazonCloudWatch'
AND year='2025'
AND month='4'
AND line_item_line_item_type NOT IN ('Tax','Credit','Refund','EdpDiscount','Fee','RIFee')
-- AND line_item_usage_account_id = '123456789012' – If you want to filter on a specific account, you can
remove this comment at the beginning of the line and specify an AWS account.
AND line_item_usage_type LIKE '%%MetricStreamUsage%%'
GROUP BY line_item_resource_id
ORDER BY TotalSpend DESC
```

To reduce costs generated by CloudWatch metric streams, stream only the metrics that
bring your business value. You also can stop or pause any metric stream that you're
not using.

## Optimizing and reducing costs of CloudWatch alarms

With CloudWatch alarms, you can create alarms based on a single metric, alarms based on a
Metrics Insights query, and composite alarms which watch other alarms.

###### Note

Costs for metric and composite alarms are prorated by the hour. You incur costs
for your alarms only while your alarms exist. To optimize cost, be sure not to leave
behind misconfigured or low-value alarms. To help with this, you can automate the
cleanup of CloudWatch alarms that you no longer need. For more information, see [Automating Amazon CloudWatch Alarm Cleanup at Scale](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/automating-amazon-cloudwatch-alarm-cleanup-at-scale)

### Metric alarms

Metric alarms have the following resolution settings:

- **Standard** (evaluated every 60 seconds)

- **High resolution** (evaluated every 10 seconds)

When you create a metric alarm, your costs are based on your alarm’s resolution
setting and the number of metrics that your alarm references. For example, a metric
alarm that references one metric incurs one alarm-metric cost per hour. For more
information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch\
alarms](cloudwatch-alarms.md).

If you create a metric alarm that contains a metric math expression, which
references multiple metrics, you incur a cost for each alarm-metric that’s
referenced in the metric math expression. For information about how to create a
metric alarm that contains a metric math expression, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a metric math expression](create-alarm-on-metric-math-expression.md).

If you create an anomaly detection alarm, where your alarm analyzes past metric
data to create a model of expected values, you incur a cost for each alarm-metric
that's referenced in your alarm plus two additional metrics, one for the upper and
lower band metrics that the anomaly detection model creates. For information about
how to create an anomaly detection alarm, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on anomaly detection](create-anomaly-detection-alarm.md).

### Metrics Insights query alarms

Metric Insights query alarms are a specific type of metric alarm, only available
with standard resolution (evaluated every 60 seconds).

When you create a Metric Insights query alarm, your costs are based on the number
of metrics analyzed by the query that your alarm references. For example, a Metric
Insights query alarm that references a query whose filter matches ten metrics incurs
ten metrics analyzed cost per hour. For more information, see the pricing example on
[Amazon CloudWatch\
Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls).

If you create an alarm that contains both a Metrics Insights query and a metric
math expression, it is reported as a Metrics Insights query alarm. If your alarm
contains a metric math expression which references other metrics in addition to the
metrics analyzed by the Metrics Insights query, you incur an additional cost for
each alarm-metric that’s referenced in the metric math expression. For information
about how to create a metric alarm that contains a metric math expression, see
[Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a metric math expression](create-alarm-on-metric-math-expression.md).

### Composite alarms

Composite alarms contain rule expressions that specify how they should evaluate
the states of other alarms to determine their own states. Composite alarms incur a
standard cost per hour, regardless of how many other alarms they evaluate. Alarms
that composite alarms reference in rule expressions incur separate costs. For more
information, see [Creating a\
composite alarm](create-composite-alarm.md).

**Alarm usage types**

The following table lists the names of relevant sub-features for CloudWatch alarms. The
table includes the strings for `UsageType`, which can help you analyze
and identify alarm-related costs.

#### Reducing alarm costs

To optimize costs generated by metric math alarms that aggregate four or more
metrics, you can aggregate data before the data is sent to CloudWatch. This way, you
can create an alarm for a single metric instead of an alarm that aggregates data
for multiple metrics. For more information, see [Publishing custom metrics](publishingmetrics.md#publishingDataPoints1).

To optimize costs generated by Metrics Insights query alarms, you can ensure
that the filter used for the query matches only the metrics that you want to
monitor.

The best way to reduce costs is to remove all unnecessary or unused alarms.
For example, you can delete alarms that evaluate metrics emitted by AWS
resources that no longer exist.

###### Example of using DescribeAlarms to check for alarms in INSUFFICIENT\_DATA state

If you delete a resource, but not the metric alarms that the resource
emits, the alarms still exist and typically will go into the
`INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state. To check for alarms that are in
the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state, use the following AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI) command.

```bash,zsh,sh

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms –state-value INSUFFICIENT_DATA
```

For more information, see [Automating Amazon CloudWatch Alarm Cleanup at Scale](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/automating-amazon-cloudwatch-alarm-cleanup-at-scale).

Other ways to reduce costs include the following:

- Make sure to create alarms for the correct metrics.

- Make sure that you don't have any alarms enabled in Regions where
you're not working.

- Remember that, although composite alarms reduce noise, they also
generate additional costs.

- When deciding whether to create a standard alarm or high-resolution
alarm, consider your use case and the value that each type of alarm
brings.

## Optimizing and reducing costs of CloudWatch Container Insights

CloudWatch Container Insights offers both standard and enhanced observability features for
monitoring containerized applications in Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. CloudWatch Container Insights
leverages the embedded metric format to ingest telemetry from your container
environments.

**Container Insights with standard**
**observability:**

Standard Container Insights collects and visualizes metrics aggregated at the cluster
and node levels. You can get started with standard mode of Container Insights using
either the CloudWatch agent or the AWS Distro for Open Telemetry (ADOT). Using ADOT enables
you to customize which metrics and dimensions are sent to CloudWatch.

Metrics in Container Insights are treated as "embedded metrics". Costs associated with
these metrics are reflected in the usage types `MetricStorage:AWS/Logs-EMF`
and `DataProcessing-Bytes`. For detailed pricing information, see the
Embedded Metrics section at [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls).

**Container Insights with enhanced**
**observability:**

Detailed visibility comes with Container Insights with enhanced observability, which
delivers granular telemetry up to the pod and container levels in your applications.
Similar to standard Container Insights, enhanced observability also comes with a
standard set of critical metrics where you can get started by using the CloudWatch
Observability add-on running on the CloudWatch agent. Container Insights offers enhanced
observability with a new observation-based pricing in order to ensure cost effective
bills justifying the benefit. See [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls)
for more information.

Here are the following UsageType and Operation associated with this Container Inisghts
with enhanced observability:

## Optimizing and reducing costs of CloudWatch Database Insights

CloudWatch Database Insights offers both standard and enhanced observability features for
monitoring Amazon Aurora databases at both the instance and fleet level;. CloudWatch Database
Insights consolidates logs and metrics from your applications, your databases, and the
operating systems on which they run into a unified view in the console.

**Database Insights Standard mode:** Standard Database
Insights is part of the AWS Free Tier and provides a rolling 7 days of performance data
history for the database load metric.

**Database Insights Advanced mode:** Advanced Database
Insights consolidates database metrics, SQL query analytics, and logs for Amazon Aurora
and RDS databases into a unified experience in CloudWatch. Pricing is based on the
amount of compute resources used by the monitored databases.

For details about how Database Insights is priced and pricing examples, see [Amazon CloudWatch\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing?nc1=h_ls).

## Optimizing and reducing costs of CloudWatch Logs

Amazon CloudWatch Logs has the following log types:

- _**Custom logs** (logs that you create for your_
_applications)_

- _**Vended logs** (logs that other AWS services, such_
_as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and Amazon Route 53, create on your behalf)_

For more information about vended logs, see [Enabling\
logging from certain AWS services](../logs/aws-logs-and-resource-policy.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User_
_Guide_.

Custom and vended logs generate costs based on the number of logs that are
_collected_, _stored_, and
_analyzed_. Separately, vended logs generate costs for delivery
to Amazon S3 and Firehose.

The following table lists the names of the CloudWatch Logs features and names of relevant
sub-features. The table includes the strings for `UsageType` and
`Operation`, which can help you analyze and identify log-related costs.

To analyze costs, use AWS Cost Explorer Service or AWS Cost and Usage Reports with Athena. With
either method, you can identify which logs are generating costs and determine how the
costs are generated.

**Using AWS Cost Explorer Service**

Select **CloudWatch** for the **Service** filter and
select **Resource** for the **Dimension**. When you
select **Resource** as the dimension in Cost Explorer Service you
can see only the past 14 days of usage.

![A screenshot of the AWS Cost Explorer Service interface, with CloudWatch selected for the Service field and Resource selected for the Dimension field.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/celogs.png)

**Using Amazon Athena query to track logs that generate**
**costs**

You can use the following query to track which logs generate costs by resource ID.

```nohighlight

SELECT
line_item_resource_id AS ResourceID,
line_item_usage_type AS Operation,
SUM(CAST(line_item_unblended_cost AS decimal(16,8))) AS TotalSpend
FROM
costandusagereport
WHERE
product_product_name = 'AmazonCloudWatch'
AND year='2025'
AND month='4'
AND line_item_operation IN ('PutLogEvents','HourlyStorageMetering','StartQuery','LogDelivery','StartLiveTail','ParquetConversion')
AND line_item_line_item_type NOT IN ('Tax','Credit','Refund','EdpDiscount','Fee','RIFee')
GROUP BY
line_item_resource_id,
line_item_usage_type
ORDER BY
TotalSpend DESC
```

To make the most of costs that are generated by CloudWatch Logs, consider the following:

- Identify top log groups by spend per operation by using the previous
query.

- Log only the events that bring your business value and choose an efficient log
syntax. A verbose log syntax drives volume and thus cost. This helps you
generate lower costs for ingestion.

- Change your log retention settings, so that you generate lower costs for
storage. For more information, see [Change log data retention in CloudWatch Logs](../logs/working-with-log-groups-and-streams.md#SettingLogRetention) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User_
_Guide_.

- Consider using the Infrequent Access log class where appropriate. Infrequent
Access logs offers fewer features than Standard class. Determine whether you
need the additional features of Standard log class and understand the difference
between both classes. For more information, see the blog article [New CloudWatch Logs log class for infrequent access logs at a reduced price](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-cloudwatch-log-class-for-infrequent-access-logs-at-a-reduced-price).
While the Infrequent Access class supports fewer features, it is suitable for a
majority of use cases.

- Run queries that CloudWatch Logs Insights automatically saves in your history. This way,
you generate fewer costs for analysis. For more information, see [View running queries or query history](../logs/cloudwatchlogs-insights-query-history.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs_
_User Guide_.

- Use the CloudWatch agent to collect system and application logs and send them to
CloudWatch. This way, you can collect only the log events that meet your criteria. For
more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Agent adds Support for Log Filter Expressions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-log-filter-expressions).

To reduce costs for vended logs, consider your use case, and then determine whether
your logs should be sent to CloudWatch or Amazon S3. For more information, see [Logs sent to Amazon S3](../logs/aws-logs-and-resource-policy.md#AWS-logs-infrastructure-S3) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

###### Tip

If you want to use metric filters, subscription filters, CloudWatch Logs Insights, and
Contributor Insights, send vended logs to CloudWatch.

Alternatively, if you're working with VPC Flow Logs and using them for auditing
and compliance purposes, send vended logs to Amazon S3.

For information about how to track charges that are generated by publishing VPC
Flow Logs to S3 buckets, see [Using AWS Cost and Usage Reports and cost allocation tags to understand VPC FLow Logs data\
ingestion in Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/using-aws-cost-usage-reports-cost-allocation-tags-to-understand-vpc-flow-logs-data-ingestion-costs-in-amazon-s3).

For additional information about how to make the most of costs that are generated by
CloudWatch Logs, see [Which log group is causing a sudden increase in my CloudWatch Logs bill?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-logs-bill-increase).
