# Permissions required for Application Signals

This section explains the permissions necessary for you to enable, manage, and operate
Application Signals.

## Permissions to enable and manage Application Signals

To manage Application Signals, you must be signed on with the required permissions. To view the contents of the **CloudWatchApplicationSignalsFullAccess** policy, see [CloudWatchApplicationSignalsFullAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/cloudwatchapplicationsignalsfullaccess.md).

To enable Application Signals on Amazon EC2, or custom
architectures, see [Enable Application Signals on Amazon EC2](cloudwatch-application-signals-enable-ec2main.md). To enable and manage
Application Signals on Amazon EKS using the [Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS\
add-on](install-cloudwatch-observability-eks-addon.md), you need the following permissions.

###### Important

These permissions include `iam:PassRole` with `Resource "*”`
and `eks:CreateAddon` with `Resource “*”`. These are powerful
permissions and you should use caution in granting them.

The Application Signals dashboard shows the AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry
applications that your SLOs are associated with. To see these applications in the SLO
pages, you must have the following permissions:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CloudWatchApplicationSignalsTaggingReadPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "tag:GetResources",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Operating Application Signals

Service operators who are using Application Signals to monitor services and SLOs must
be signed on to an account with read only permissions. To view the contents of the **CloudWatchApplicationSignalsReadOnlyAccess** policy,
see [CloudWatchApplicationSignalsReadOnlyAccess](../../../aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/cloudwatchapplicationsignalsreadonlyaccess.md).

To see which AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry Applications that your SLOs are
associated within the Application Signals dashboard, you must have the following
permissions:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CloudWatchApplicationSignalsTaggingReadPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "tag:GetResources",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```

To check if Application Signals on Amazon EKS using the [Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS\
add-on](install-cloudwatch-observability-eks-addon.md) is enabled, you need to have the following permissions:

            "Sid": "CloudWatchApplicationSignalsResourceExplorerReadPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "resource-explorer-2:ListIndexes",
                "resource-explorer-2:Search"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "CloudWatchApplicationSignalsResourceExplorerSLRPermissions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/resource-explorer-2.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForResourceExplorer",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:AWSServiceName": [
                        "resource-explorer-2.amazonaws.com"
                    ]
                }
            }

        {

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "resource-explorer-2:CreateIndex"
