# Collect Amazon EBS NVMe driver metrics

For CloudWatch agent to collect AWS NVMe driver metrics for Amazon EBS volumes attached to an Amazon EC2
instance, add the `diskio` section inside the `metrics_collected`
section of the CloudWatch agent configuration file.

Additionally, the CloudWatch agent binary requires `ioctl` permissions for NVMe driver
devices to collect metrics from attached Amazon EBS volumes.

The following metrics can be collected.

MetricMetric name in CloudWatchDescription

`ebs_total_read_ops`

`diskio_ebs_total_read_ops`

The total number of completed read operations.

`ebs_total_write_ops`

`diskio_ebs_total_write_ops`

The total number of completed write operations.

`ebs_total_read_bytes`

`diskio_ebs_total_read_bytes`

The total number of read bytes transferred.

`ebs_total_write_bytes`

provisioned IOPS performance.

`ebs_volume_performance_exceeded_tp`

`diskio_ebs_volume_performance_exceeded_tp`

volume's provisioned throughput performance.

`ebs_ec2_instance_performance_exceeded_iops`

`diskio_ebs_ec2_instance_performance_exceeded_iops`

The total time, in microseconds, that the EBS volume exceeded the
attached Amazon EC2 instance's maximum IOPS performance.

`ebs_ec2_instance_performance_exceeded_tp`

`diskio_ebs_ec2_instance_performance_exceeded_tp`

The total time, in microseconds, that the EBS volume exceeded the
attached Amazon EC2 instance's maximum throughput performance.

`ebs_volume_queue_length`

`diskio_ebs_volume_queue_length`

The number of read and write operations waiting to be
completed.
