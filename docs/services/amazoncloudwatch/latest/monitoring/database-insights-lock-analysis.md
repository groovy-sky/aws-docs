# Analyzing lock trees for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with CloudWatch Database Insights

To troubleshoot performance issues caused by locks, you can analyze lock trees for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL databases with CloudWatch Database Insights using the following.

- **Sliced by** dropdown – Choose the **Blocking object**, **Blocking session**, or **Blocking SQL** dimensions in the **Database load** chart
to view how distinct top blockers contribute to DB Load over time. With the DB load chart, you can analyze if top blockers are constant or change often. Then, you can troubleshoot the blockers.

![The Top SQL table with Blocking Session selected in the Sliced by dropdown](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/DBInsights_TopSQLBlocking.png)

- **Lock analysis** tab – Choose **DB Load Analysis**, then choose the **Lock analysis** tab to view information about lock contention in your database.

###### Note

CloudWatch Database Insights supports lock analysis for all Aurora PostgreSQL versions. To analyze lock trees, you must have
Database Insights Advance Mode enabled. For information on how to turn on Advanced mode, see
[Turning on the Advanced mode of Database Insights for Amazon Aurora](../../../amazonrds/latest/aurorauserguide/user-databaseinsights-turningonadvanced.md)
and [Turning on the Advanced mode of Database Insights for Amazon Relational Database Service](../../../amazonrds/latest/userguide/user-databaseinsights-turningonadvanced.md)

The lock analysis tab provides information about lock contention for your database.
The lock tree visualization shows the relationships and dependencies between lock requests from different sessions.

Database Insights captures snapshots every 15 seconds. Snapshots show the lock data for your database at a point in time.

###### Note

When CloudWatch detects high locking, CloudWatch displays the **High locking detected** banner for the **Lock analysis** tab.
CloudWatch detects high locking if CloudWatch takes a lock snapshot for each 15 second interval for 15 consecutive minutes.

Each node in the tree represents a specific session. The parent node is a session that is blocking its child nodes.

To analyze lock trees, use the following procedure.

###### To analyze lock trees

01. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. Choose **Insights**.

03. Choose **Database Insights**.

04. Choose the **Database Instance** view.

05. Choose a DB instance.

06. Choose the **DB load analysis** tab.

07. Choose the **Lock analysis** tab.

    To view lock data for a DB instance, choose a period of 1 day or less.

08. Choose a snapshot window. By default, Database Insights chooses the snapshot window with the most blocked sessions.

09. To view lock data for a snapshot, choose the time Database Insights took the snapshot.

10. To expand a lock tree, choose the arrow next to the session ID.

## Lock snapshot data

Database Insights provides the following information for each lock request. To view columns that aren't enabled by default, choose the **Settings** icon for the **Lock trees** table and enable other columns.

Column nameDefinition Default columnNotes

`session_id`

The unique session identifier.

Yes

The `session_id` is derived from `HEX(pg_stat_activity.backend_start).HEX(pg_locks.pid)`.

`pid`

The PID of this backend.

Yes

`pg_locks.pid`

`blocked_sessions_count`

The number of sessions blocked by this lock.

Yes

The `blocked_sessions_count` is derived from the number of session IDs blocked by
this lock.

`last_query_executed`

The last query executed by this session. For blockers, it may not be the
query that holds the blocking lock.

Yes

`pg_stat_activity.query`

`wait_event`

The wait event name if the backend is currently waiting, otherwise the value is NULL.

Yes

`pg_stat_activity.wait_event`

`blocking_time_(In Seconds)`

The time (in seconds) since the start of this lock.

Yes

The `blocking_time_(In Seconds)` is derived from the start time of the waiting transaction ( `pg_locks.waitstart`) for the first waiter.

`blocking_mode`

The lock mode held by the blocking session.

No

`pg_locks.mode`

`waiting_mode`

The lock mode requested by the waiting session.

No

`pg_locks.mode`

`application`

The name of the application that is connected to this backend.

No

`pg_stat_activity.application_name`

`blocking_txn_start_time`

The start time of the blocking transaction or null if no transaction is
active.

No

`pg_stat_activity.xact_start`

`waiting_start_time`

The time when a waiting user session started waiting for this lock, or null if the lock is
held.

No

`pg_locks.waitstart`

`session_start_time`

The time when a user session was started.

No

`pg_stat_activity.backend_start`

`state`

The state of a backend.

No

`pg_stat_activity.state`

`wait_event_type`

The type of wait event for which this session is waiting.

No

`pg_stat_activity.wait_event_type`

The time when the last query was started.

No

`pg_stat_activity.query_start`

`user`

The name of the user logged into this backend.

No

`pg_stat_activity.client_hostname`

`port`

The TCP port number that the client is using for communication with this backend, or `-1` if a
Unix socket is used. If this field is null, it indicates that this
is an internal server process.

No

`pg_stat_activity.client_port`
