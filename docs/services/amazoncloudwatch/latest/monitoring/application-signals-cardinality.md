# Manage high-cardinality operations

Application Signals includes settings in the CloudWatch agent that you can use to manage the cardinality of your
operations and manage the metric exportation to optimize costs. By default, the metric limiting function becomes active
when the number of distinct operations for a service over time exceeds the default threshold of 500.
You can tune the behavior by adjusting the configuration settings.

## Determine if metric limiting is activated

You can use the following methods to find if the default metric limiting is happening. If it is,
you should consider optimizing the cardinality control by following the steps in the next section.

- In the CloudWatch console, choose **Application Signals**, **Services**. If you see
an **Operation** named **AllOtherOperations** or
a **RemoteOperation** named **AllOtherRemoteOperations**, then metric limiting is happening.

- If any metrics collected by Application Signals have the value `AllOtherOperations` for their `Operation`
dimension, then metric limiting is happening.

- If any metrics collected by Application Signals have the value `AllOtherRemoteOperations` for their `RemoteOperation`
dimension, then metric limiting is happening.

### Optimize cardinality control

To optimize your cardinality control, you can do the following:

- Create custom rules to aggregate operations.

- Configure your metric limiting policy.

#### Create custom rules to aggregate operations

High-cardinality operations can sometimes be caused by inappropriate unique values extracted from the context.
For example, sending out HTTP/S requests that include user IDs or session IDs in the path can lead to hundreds of disparate
operations. To resolve such issues, we recommend that you configure the CloudWatch agent with customization rules to
rewrite these operations.

In cases where there is a surge in generating numerous different metrics through individual `RemoteOperation` calls,
such as `PUT /api/customer/owners/123`, `PUT /api/customer/owners/456`, and similar requests, we
recommend that you consolidate these operations into a single `RemoteOperation`. One approach is
to standardize all `RemoteOperation` calls that start with `PUT /api/customer/owners/` to a uniform format,
specifically `PUT /api/customer/owners/{ownerId}`. The following example illustrates this. For information about other customization rules,
see [Enable CloudWatch Application Signals](cloudwatch-agent-application-signals.md).

```json

{
   "logs":{
      "metrics_collected":{
         "application_signals":{
            "rules":[
               {
                  "selectors":[
                     {
                        "dimension":"RemoteOperation",
                        "match":"PUT /api/customer/owners/*"
                     }
                  ],
                  "replacements":[
                     {
                        "target_dimension":"RemoteOperation",
                        "value":"PUT /api/customer/owners/{ownerId}"
                     }
                  ],
                  "action":"replace"
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   }
}
```

In other cases, high-cardinality metrics might have been aggregated to `AllOtherRemoteOperations`, and
it might be unclear what specific metrics are included. The CloudWatch agent is able to log the dropped operations.
To identify dropped operations, use the configuration in the following example to activate logging until the problem resurfaces.
Then inspect the CloudWatch agent logs (accessible by container `stdout` or EC2 log files) and search for the keyword `drop metric data`.

```json

{
  "agent": {
    "config": {
      "agent": {
        "debug": true
      },
      "traces": {
        "traces_collected": {
          "application_signals": {
          }
        }
      },
      "logs": {
        "metrics_collected": {
          "application_signals": {
            "limiter": {
              "log_dropped_metrics": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create your metric limiting policy

If the default metric limiting configuration doesn’t address the cardinality for your service, you can
customize the metric limiter configuration. To do this, add a `limiter` section under
the `logs/metrics_collected/application_signals` section in the CloudWatch Agent configuration file.

The following example lowers the threshold of metric limiting from 500 distinct metrics to 100.

```json

{
  "logs": {
    "metrics_collected": {
      "application_signals": {
        "limiter": {
          "drop_threshold": 100
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
