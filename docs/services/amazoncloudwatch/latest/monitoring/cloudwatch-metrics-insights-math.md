# Use Metrics Insights queries with metric math

You can use a Metrics Insights query as an input to a metric math function. For more
information about metric math, see [Using math expressions with CloudWatch metrics](using-metric-math.md).

A Metrics Insights query that does not include a **GROUP BY** clause
returns a single time series. Therefore, its returned results can be used with any metric
math function that takes a single time series as input.

A Metrics Insights query that includes a **GROUP BY** clause returns
multiple time series. Therefore, its returned results can be used with any metric math
function that takes an array of time series as input.

For example, the following query returns the total number of bytes downloaded for each
bucket in the Region, as an array of time series:

```sql

SELECT SUM(BytesDownloaded)
FROM SCHEMA("AWS/S3", BucketName, FilterId)
WHERE FilterId = 'EntireBucket'
GROUP BY BucketName
```

On a graph in the console or in a [GetMetricData](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-getmetricdata.md) operation, the results of this query are `q1`. This
query returns the result in bytes, so if you want to see the result as MB instead, you can
use the following math function:

```

q1/1024/1024
```
