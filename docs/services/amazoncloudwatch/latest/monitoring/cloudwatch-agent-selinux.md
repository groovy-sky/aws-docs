# Set up the CloudWatch agent with security-enhanced Linux (SELinux)

If your system has security-enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, you must apply the
appropriate security policies to ensure that the CloudWatch agent runs in a confined domain.

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure SELinux for the agent, check the following
**prerequisites**:

###### To complete the prerequisites for using the CloudWatch agent with SELinux

1. If you haven't done so, install the following SELinux policy development
    packages:

```nohighlight

sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y selinux-policy-devel policycoreutils-devel rpm-build git
```

2. Run the following command to check your system's SELinux status:

```nohighlight

sestatus
```

Example output:

```nohighlight

SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   permissive
Mode from config file:          permissive
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
Max kernel policy version:      33
```

If you find that SELinux is currently disabled, do the following:
1. Open the SELinux file by entering the following command:

      ```nohighlight

      sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
      ```

2. Set the `SELINUX` parameter to either `permissive` or
       `enforcing`. For example:

      ```nohighlight

      SELINUX=enforcing
      ```

3. Save the file and reboot the system to apply the changes.

      ```nohighlight

      sudo reboot
      ```
3. Ensure that the CloudWatch agent is running as a `systemd` service. This is
    required to use it within a confined SELinux domain.

```nohighlight

sudo systemctl status amazon-cloudwatch-agent
```

If the agent is correctly configured, the output should indicate that it is
    `active (running)` and `enabled` at startup.

## Configure SELinux for the agent

After you complete the prerequisites, you can configure SELinux.

###### To configure SELinux for the CloudWatch agent

1. Clone the SELinux policy for the CloudWatch agent by entering the following
    command:

```nohighlight

git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-selinux.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository and then update the script permissions by entering
    the following commands:

```nohighlight

cd amazon-cloudwatch-agent-selinux
chmod +x amazon_cloudwatch_agent.sh
```

3. Use `sudo` to run the SELinux policy installation script by entering the
    following command. During execution, the script prompts you to enter `y` or
    `n` to allow automatic restart. This restart ensures that the agent
    transitions into the correct SELinux domain.

```nohighlight

sudo ./amazon_cloudwatch_agent.sh
```

4. If the CloudWatch agent hasn't been restarted yet, restart it to ensure that it
    transitions to the correct SELinux domain:

```nohighlight

sudo systemctl restart amazon-cloudwatch-agent
```

5. Verify that CloudWatch Agent is running in the confined domain by entering the following
    command:

```nohighlight

ps -efZ | grep amazon-cloudwatch-agent
```

If the agent is correctly confined, the output should indicate a SELinux-confined
    domain instead of `unconfined_service_t`.

The following is an example of output when the agent is correctly confined.

```nohighlight

system_u:system_r:confined_t:s0 root 1234 1 0 12:00 ? 00:00:10 /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent
```

After SELinux is configured, you can proceed to configure the agent to collect metrics,
logs, and traces. For more information, see [Manually create or edit the CloudWatch agent configuration file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-Configuration-File-Details.html).
