# Alarming on logs

The steps in the following sections explain how to create CloudWatch alarms on logs.

## Create a CloudWatch alarm based on a log group-metric filter

The procedure in this section describes how to create an alarm based on a log
group-metric filter. With metric filters, you can look for terms and patterns in log data as
the data is sent to CloudWatch. For more information, see [Create metrics from log events\
using filters](../logs/monitoringlogdata.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_. Before you create
an alarm based on a log group-metric filter, you must complete the following actions:

- Create a log group. For more information, see [Working with log groups and log streams](../logs/working-with-log-groups-and-streams.md#Create-Log-Group) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User_
_Guide_.

- Create a metric filter. For more information, see [Create a metric\
filter for a log group](../logs/createmetricfilterprocedure.md) in the _Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide_.

###### To create an alarm based on a log group-metric filter

01. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

02. From the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, and then choose
     **Log groups**.

03. Choose the log group that includes your metric filter.

04. Choose **Metric filters**.

05. In the metric filters tab, select the box for the metric filter that you want to
     base your alarm on.

06. Choose **Create alarm**.

07. (Optional) Under **Metric**, edit **Metric**
    **name**, **Statistic**, and **Period**.

08. Under **Conditions**, specify the following:
    1. For **Threshold type**, choose **Static** or
        **Anomaly detection**.

    2. For **Whenever `your-metric-name` is . .**
       **.**, choose **Greater**,
        **Greater/Equal**, **Lower/Equal** , or
        **Lower**.

    3. For **than . . .**, specify a number for your threshold value.
09. Choose **Additional configuration**.
    1. For **Data points to alarm**, specify how many data points
        trigger your alarm to go into the `ALARM` state. If you specify matching
        values, your alarm goes into the `ALARM` state if that many consecutive
        periods are breaching. To create an M-out-of-N alarm, specify a number for the first
        value that's lower than the number you specify for the second value. For more
        information, see [Alarm evaluation](alarm-evaluation.md).

    2. For **Missing data treatment**, select an option to specify
        how to treat missing data when your alarm is evaluated.
10. Choose **Next**.

11. For **Notification**, specify an Amazon SNS topic to notify when your
     alarm is in the `ALARM`, `OK`, or `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
     state.
    1. (Optional) To send multiple notifications for the same alarm state or for
        different alarm states, choose **Add notification**.

    2. (Optional) To not send notifications, choose **Remove**.
12. To have the alarm perform Auto Scaling, EC2, Lambda, or Systems Manager actions, choose the
     appropriate button and choose the alarm state and action to perform. If you choose a
     Lambda function as an alarm action, you specify the function name or ARN, and you can
     optionally choose a specific version of the function.

    Alarms can perform Systems Manager actions only when they go into ALARM state. For more
     information about Systems Manager actions, see see [Configuring CloudWatch to create OpsItems from alarms](../../../systems-manager/latest/userguide/opscenter-create-opsitems-from-cloudwatch-alarms.md) and [Incident creation](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/incident-creation.md).

    ###### Note

    To create an alarm that performs an SSM Incident Manager action, you must have
    certain permissions. For more information, see [Identity-based policy examples for AWS Systems Manager Incident\
    Manager](../../../incident-manager/latest/userguide/security-iam-id-based-policy-examples.md).

13. Choose **Next**.

14. For **Name and description**, enter a name and description for
     your alarm. The name must contain only UTF-8 characters, and can't contain ASCII control
     characters. The description can include markdown formatting, which is displayed only in
     the alarm **Details** tab in the CloudWatch console. The markdown can be
     useful to add links to runbooks or other internal resources.

15. For **Preview and create**, check that your configuration is
     correct, and choose **Create alarm**.
