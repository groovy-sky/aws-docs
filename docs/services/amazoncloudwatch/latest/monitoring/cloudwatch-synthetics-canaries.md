# Synthetic monitoring (canaries)

You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create _canaries_,
configurable scripts that run on a schedule, to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Canaries follow
the same routes and perform the same actions as a customer, which makes it possible for you to
continually verify your customer experience even when you don't have any customer traffic on
your applications. By using canaries, you can discover issues before your customers do.

Canaries are scripts written in Node.js, Python, or Java. They create Lambda functions in
your account that
use Node.js, Python, or Java as the runtime. Canaries work over both
HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Canaries use Lambda layers that contain the CloudWatch Synthetics library.
The library includes CloudWatch Synthetics implementations for NodeJS, Python, and Java.

Canaries in Node.js and Python runtimes offer programmatic access to headless browsers
through Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium Webdriver. Multiple browsers are supported, including
a headless Google Chrome browser, and Mozilla Firefox. For more information about Playwright,
see [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). For more information about
Puppeteer, see [Puppeteer](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/puppeteer). For
more information about Selenium, see [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/).
Canaries on Selenium only support Chrome browser. Canaries in Java are designed for flexibility
in monitoring any type of service or application and do not contain browser support or
frameworks.

Canaries check the availability and latency of your endpoints and can store load time data
and screenshots of the UI. They monitor your REST APIs, URLs, and website content, and they can
check for unauthorized changes from phishing, code injection and cross-site scripting.

CloudWatch Synthetics is integrated with [Application Signals](cloudwatch-application-monitoring-sections.md), which can
discover and monitor your application services, clients, Synthetics canaries, and service
dependencies. Use Application Signals to see a list or visual map of your services, view health
metrics based on your service level objectives (SLOs), and drill down to see correlated X-Ray
traces for more detailed troubleshooting. To see your canaries in Application Signals, [turn on X-Ray active tracing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_tracing.html). Your
canaries are displayed on the [Application Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceMap.html) connected to
your services, and in the [Service detail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceDetail.html) page of the
services they call.

You can run a canary once or on a regular schedule. Canaries can run as often as once per
minute.
You can use both cron and rate expressions to schedule canaries.

For information about security issues to consider before you create and run canaries, see [Security considerations for Synthetics canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html).

By default, canaries create several CloudWatch metrics in the `CloudWatchSynthetics`
namespace. These metrics have `CanaryName` as a dimension. Canaries that use
the `executeStep()` or `executeHttpStep()` function from the function
library also have `StepName` as a dimension. For more information about the
canary function library, see [Library functions available for canary scripts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Function_Library.html).

CloudWatch Synthetics integrates well with the X-Ray Trace Map, which uses CloudWatch with AWS X-Ray
to provide an end-to-end view of your services to help you more efficiently pinpoint performance
bottlenecks and identify impacted users. Canaries that you create with CloudWatch Synthetics appear on
the trace map. For more information, see [X-Ray Trace Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-servicemap.html).

CloudWatch Synthetics is currently available in all commercial AWS Regions and the GovCloud
Regions.
