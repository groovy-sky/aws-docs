## Link more source accounts to an existing monitoring account

Follow the steps in this section to add links from additional source accounts to
an existing monitoring account.

Each source account can be linked to as many as five monitoring accounts. Each
monitoring account can be linked to as many as 100,000 source accounts.

To manage a source account, you must have certain permissions. For more
information, see [Necessary permissions](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account-setup.md#CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-permissions).

###### To add more source accounts to a monitoring account

01. Sign in to the monitoring account.

02. Open the CloudWatch console at
     [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

03. In the left navigation pane, choose **Settings**.

04. By **Monitoring account configuration**, choose
     **Manage source accounts**.

05. Choose the **Configuration policy** tab.

06. In the **Configuration policy** box, add the new source account ID in
     the **Principal** line.

    For example, suppose the **Principal** line is currently
     the following:

    ```

    "Principal": {"AWS": ["111111111111", "222222222222"]}
    ```

    To add `999999999999` as a third source account, edit the line
     to the following:

    ```

    "Principal": {"AWS": ["111111111111", "222222222222", "999999999999"]}
    ```

07. Choose **Update**.

08. Choose the **Configuration details** tab.

09. Choose the copy icon that is next to the monitoring account's sink ARN.

10. Sign in to the account that you want to use as a new source
     account.

11. Paste the monitoring account's sink ARN that you copied in Step 9.

    You see the CloudWatch settings page, with some information filled in.

12. For **Select data**, choose whether this source account will send
     **Logs**, **Metrics**, **Traces**,
     and **Application Insights - Applications**, **Internet Monitor - Monitors**, and **Application Signals -Services, Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** data
     to the monitoring accounts it is linked to.

13. Do not change the ARN in **Enter monitoring account configuration**
    **ARN**.

14. The **Define a label to identify your source account**
     section is pre-filled with the label choice from the monitoring account, if there is one.
     Optionally, choose **Edit** to change it.

    ###### Note

    In the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, the only supported option is to use custom labels, and the `$AccountName`, `$AcccountEmail`,
    and `$AcccountEmailNoDomain` variables
    all resolve as `account-id` instead of the specified variable.

15. Choose **Link**.

16. Enter `Confirm` in the box and choose
     **Confirm**.

## Remove the link between a monitoring account and source account

Follow the steps in this section to stop sending data from one source account to a
monitoring account.

###### Note

After the source account stops sharing the metrics with the _Monitoring_ account, the _Source_ account metrics data is not accessible to the monitoring account. Source metric names can be visible to the monitoring account for upto 14 days.

You must have the permissions required to manage a source account to complete this
task. For more information, see [Necessary permissions](cloudwatch-unified-cross-account-setup.md#CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-permissions).
