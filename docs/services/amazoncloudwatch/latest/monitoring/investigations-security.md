## Default CloudWatch investigations permissions, retention, and encryption

When you run investigations using default settings without additional configuration in
your account the investigation uses the permissions available to your current console
session and only accesses telemetry data using Read-only permissions. No investigation
group IAM role configuration or permission policy is needed. However, that means the
investigation's access to data is limited by the signed in user's permissions.

This investigation is only available to the same user that started the investigation.
The investigation is available to view only for a 24 hour period, after which the
investigation is deleted with no recovery option available.

The investigation data is encrypted at rest with an AWS owned key. You can't view or
manage AWS owned keys, and you can't use them for other purposes or audit their use.
However, you don't have to take any action or change any settings to use these keys. For
more information, see [AWS KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html).

## User permissions for your CloudWatch investigations group

AWS has created three managed IAM policies that you can use for your users who
will be working with your CloudWatch investigations group.

- [AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/managed-policies-cloudwatch.html#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy)– grants an administrator the ability
to set up CloudWatch investigations in the account, access to CloudWatch investigations actions, the management of trusted
identity propagation, and the management of integration with IAM Identity Center and
organizational access.

- [AIOpsOperatorAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/managed-policies-cloudwatch.html#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsOperatorAccess)– grants a user access to investigation
actions including starting an investigation. It also grants additional
permissions that are necessary for accessing investigation events.

- [AIOpsReadOnlyAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/managed-policies-cloudwatch.html#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsReadOnlyAccess)– grants read-only permissions for CloudWatch investigations
and other related services.

We recommend that you use three IAM principals, granting one of them the **AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy** IAM policy, granting another the
**AIOpsOperatorAccess** policy, and granting the third
the **AIOpsReadOnlyAccess** policy. These principals could
be either IAM roles (recommended) or IAM users. Then your users who work with CloudWatch investigations
would sign on using one of these principals.

### Permissions for incident report generation

Incident report generation requires additional permissions to allow the AI to
collect events, facts, and then create reports.

Users with **AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy** can generate,
edit, and copy incident reports. By default, your investigation group is assigned
the **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** to give it access to
resource. However, it does not have the permissions required to generate an
investigation report. To give permissions to your investigation group to collate the
investigation data into an incident report you must add a policy similar to the
following example that includes additional permissions or add the additional actions
as an inline policy to the group:

JSON

```json

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "IncidentReportOperations",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "aiops:GetInvestigation",
                "aiops:ListInvestigationEvents",
                "aiops:GetInvestigationEvent",

                "aiops:CreateReport",
                "aiops:UpdateReport",
                "aiops:GetReport",

                "aiops:PutFact",
                "aiops:ListFacts",
                "aiops:GetFact",
                "aiops:GetFactVersions"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:aiops:*:*:investigation-group/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

The new managed policy `AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy` provides
the required permissions and is automatically added to investigation groups created
after October 10, 2025. For more information, see [AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/managed-policies-cloudwatch.html#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy).

## Additional permissions for Database Insights

To use Database Insights capabilities during investigations, you must attach the
`AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess` managed policy to the IAM role
or user that you use to perform investigations. CloudWatch investigations requires these permissions to
create and access performance analysis reports for your Amazon RDS database instances.

To attach this policy, use the IAM console to add the
`AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess` managed policy to your
investigation principal. For more information about this managed policy and its
permissions, see [AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AmazonRDSPerformanceInsightsFullAccess.html).

## How to control what data CloudWatch investigations has access to during investigations

When you configure an investigation group in your account, you specify what
permissions that CloudWatch investigations has to access your resources during investigations. You do this by
assigning an IAM role to the investigation group.

To enable CloudWatch investigations to access resources and be able to make suggestions and hypotheses, the
recommended method is to attach the **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** to the investigation group role. This grants the
investigation group permissions to analyze your AWS resources during your
investigations. For information about the complete contents of this policy, see [AIOpsAssistantPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/managed-policies-cloudwatch.html#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistant).

You can also choose to attach the general AWS [**ReadOnlyAccess**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/ReadOnlyAccess.html) to the investigation group role, in addition
to attaching **AIOpsAssistantPolicy**. The reason to do
this is that AWS updates **ReadOnlyAccess** more
frequently with permissions for new AWS services and actions that are released. The
**AIOpsAssistantPolicy** will also be updated for new
actions, but not as frequently.

If you want to scope down the permissions granted to CloudWatch investigations, you can attach a custom
IAM policy to the investigation group IAM role instead of attaching the **AIOpsAssistantPolicy** policy. To do this, start your custom
policy with the contents of [AIOpsAssistantPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/managed-policies-cloudwatch.html#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistant) and then remove permissions that you don't want to
grant to CloudWatch investigations. This will prevent CloudWatch investigations from making suggestions based on the AWS
services or actions that you don't grant access to.

###### Note

Anything that CloudWatch investigations can access can be added to the investigation and seen by your
investigation operators. We recommend that you align CloudWatch investigations permissions with the
permissions that your investigation group operators have.

### Allowing CloudWatch investigations to decrypt encrypted data during investigations

If you encrypt your data in any of the following services with a customer managed
key in AWS KMS, and you want CloudWatch investigations to be able to decrypt the data from these services
and include them in investigations, you'll need to attach one or more additional
IAM policies to the investigation group IAM role.

- AWS Step Functions

The policy statement should include a context key for encryption context to help
scope down the permissions. For example, the following policy would enable CloudWatch investigations to
decrypt data for a Step Functions state machine.

JSON

```json

{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AIOPSKMSAccessForStepFunctions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "aiops.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action":
            [
                "kms:Decrypt"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition":
            {
                "StringEquals":
                {
                     "kms:ViaService": "states.*.amazonaws.com",
                     "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:states:stateMachineArn": "arn:aws:states:region:accountId:stateMachine:*"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

For more information about these types of policies and using these context keys,
see [kms:ViaService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-via-service) and [kms:EncryptionContext: _context-key_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-encryption-context) in the
AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide, and [aws:SourceArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-sourcearn) in the IAM User Guide.

## Encryption of investigation data

For the encryption of your investigation data, AWS offers two options:

- **AWS owned keys**– By default, CloudWatch investigations
encrypts investigation data at rest with an AWS owned key. You can't view or
manage AWS owned keys, and you can't use them for other purposes or audit
their use. However, you don't have to take any action or change any settings to
use these keys. For more information about AWS owned keys, see [AWS owned\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk).

- **Customer managed keys**– These are keys
that you create and manage yourself. You can choose to use a customer managed
key instead of an AWS owned key for your investigation data. For more
information about customer managed keys, see [Customer managed\
keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk).

Incident reports generated from investigations use the same encryption settings as the
parent investigation. This maintains a consistent security posture across your
investigation data and documentation

###### Note

CloudWatch investigations automatically enables encryption at rest using AWS owned keys at no charge.
If you use a customer managed key, AWS KMS charges apply. For more information about
pricing, see [AWS Key Management Service\
pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing).

For more information about AWS KMS, see [AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html).

### Using a customer managed key for your investigation group

You can associate an investigation group with a customer managed key, and then all
investigations created in that group will use the customer managed key to encrypt
your investigation data at rest.

CloudWatch investigations customer managed key usage has the following conditions:

- CloudWatch investigations supports only symmetric encryption AWS KMS keys with the default key
spec, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, and that have usage defined as
`ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`.

- For a user to create or update an investigation group with a customer
managed key, that user must have the `kms:DescribeKey`,
`kms:GenerateDataKey`, and `kms:Decrypt`
permissions.

- For a user to create or update an investigation in an investigation group
that uses a customer managed key, that user must have the
`kms:GenerateDataKey` and `kms:Decrypt`
permissions.

- For a user to view investigation data in an investigation group that uses
a customer managed key, that user must have the `kms:Decrypt`
permission.

### Setting up investigations to use a AWS KMS customer managed key

First, if you don't already have a symmetric key that you want to use, create a
new key with the following command.

```nohighlight

aws kms create-key
```

The command output includes the key ID and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
key. You will need those in later steps in this section. The following is an example
of this output.

```json

{
"KeyMetadata": {
"Origin": "AWS_KMS",
        "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
        "Description": "",
        "KeyManager": "CUSTOMER",
        "Enabled": true,
        "CustomerMasterKeySpec": "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT",
        "KeyUsage": "ENCRYPT_DECRYPT",
        "KeyState": "Enabled",
        "CreationDate": 1478910250.94,
        "Arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/6f815f63-e628-448c-8251-e4EXAMPLE",
        "AWSAccountId": "111122223333",
        "EncryptionAlgorithms": [
            "SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT"
        ]
    }
}
```

**Set permissions on the key**

Next, set permissions on the key. By default, all AWS KMS keys are private. Only the
resource owner can use it to encrypt and decrypt data. However, the resource owner
can grant permissions to access the key to other users and resources. With this
step, you give the AI Operations service principal permission to use the key. This
service principal must be in the same AWS Region where the KMS key is
stored.

As a best practice, we recommend that you restrict the use of the KMS key to only
those AWS accounts or resources that you specify.

The first step to set the permissions is to save the default policy for your key
as `policy.json`. Use the following command to do so. Replace
`key-id` with the ID of your key.

```nohighlight

aws kms get-key-policy --key-id key-id --policy-name default --output text > ./policy.json
```

Open the `policy.json` file in a text editor and add the
following policy sections into that policy. Separate the existing statement from the
new sections with a comma. These new sections use `Condition` sections to
enhance the security of the AWS KMS key. For more information, see [AWS KMS keys and encryption context](../logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.md#encrypt-log-data-kms-policy).

This policy provides permissions for service principals for the following
reasons:

- The `aiops` service needs `GenerateDataKey`
permissions to get the data key and use that data key to encrypt your data
while it is stored in rest. The `Decrypt` permission is needed to
decrypt your data while reading from the data store. The decryption happens
when you read the data using `aiops` APIs or when you update the
investigation or investigation event. The update operation fetches the
existing data after decrypting it, updates the data, and stores the updated
data in the data store after encrypting

- The CloudWatch alarms service can create investigations or investigation events.
These create operations verify that the caller has access to the AWS KMS key
defined for the investigation group. The policy statement gives the
`GenerateDataKey` and `Decrypt` permissions to the
CloudWatch alarms service to create investigations on behalf of you.

###### Note

The following policy assumes that you follow the recommendation of using three
IAM principals, and granting one of them the **AIOpsConsoleAdminPolicy** IAM policy, granting another the
**AIOpsOperatorAccess** policy, and granting
the third the **AIOpsReadOnlyAccess** policy. These
principals could be either IAM roles (recommended) or IAM users. Then your
users who work with CloudWatch investigations would sign on with one of these principals.

For the following policy, you'll need the ARNs of those three
principals.

```json

  }
```

After you've updated the policy, assign it to the key by entering the following
command.

```nohighlight

aws kms put-key-policy --key-id key-id --policy-name default --policy file://policy.json
```

**Associate the key with the investigation**
**group**

When you use the CloudWatch console to create an investigation group, you can choose to
associate the AWS KMS key with the investigation group. For more information, see
[Set up an investigation group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Investigations-GetStarted-Group.html).

You can also associate a customer managed key with an existing investigation
group.

### Changing your encryption configuration

You can update an investigation group to change between using a customer managed
key or a service owned key. You can also change from using one customer managed key
to using another. When you make such a change, the change applies to new
investigations created after the change. Previous investigations are still
associated with the old encryption configuration. Current ongoing investigations
also continue using the original key for new data.

As long as a previously-used key is active and Amazon Q has access to it for
investigations, you can retrieve the older investigations encrypted with that
method, as well as data in current investigations that was encrypted with the
previous key. If you delete a previously-used key or revoke access to it, the
investigation data encrypted with that key can't be retrieved.

## Cross-Region inference

CloudWatch investigations uses _cross-Region inference_ to distribute traffic across
different AWS Region. Although the data remains stored only in the primary Region,
when using cross-Region inference, your investigation data might move outside of your
primary Region. All data will be transmitted encrypted across Amazon’s secure network.

For details about where cross-Region inference distribution occurs for each Region,
see the following table.
