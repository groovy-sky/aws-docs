# Changing the time range or time zone format of a CloudWatch dashboard

You can
change the time range to display dashboard data over minutes, hours, days, or weeks. You
also can change the time zone format to display dashboard data in
UTC
or local time. Local time is the time zone that's specified in your computer's operating
system.

###### Note

If
you create a dashboard with graphs that contain 100 or more high-resolution metrics,
we recommend that you don't set the time range to longer than 1 hour. For more
information,
see [High-resolution metrics](publishingmetrics.md#high-resolution-metrics).

###### Note

If the time range of a dashboard is shorter than the period used for a widget on the dashboard, the following happens:

- The widget is modified to display the amount of data corresponding one complete period for
that widget, even though this is longer than the dashboard time range. This ensures that there is at
least one data point on the graph.

- The start time of the period for this data point is adjusted backwards to ensure that at
least one data point can be displayed.

New console

###### To change the dashboard time range

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Dashboards**,
    and then
    choose
    a dashboard.

3. From the dashboard screen,
    do one
    of the following:

   - In the
      upper area of the dashboard, select one of the predefined time ranges. These span
      from 1 hour to 1 week ( **1h**,
      **3h**, **12h**,
      **1d**, or
      **1w**).

   - Alternatively, you can choose one of the following custom time range options:

- Choose
**Custom**, and then choose the
**Relative** tab.
Choose
a time range from 1 minute to 15
months.

to specify your time range.

###### Tip

If
the
aggregation period is set to **Auto** when

CloudWatch might change the period. To set the period manually, choose the
**Actions** dropdown, and then choose
**Period override**.
