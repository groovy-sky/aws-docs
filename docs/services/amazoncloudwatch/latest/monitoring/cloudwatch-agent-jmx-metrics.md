# Collect Java Management Extensions (JMX) metrics

You can use the CloudWatch agent to collect Java Management Extensions (JMX) metrics from
your Java applications.

The CloudWatch agent supports collecting these metrics from the following versions:

- JVM 8 and later

- Kafka 0.8.2.x and later

- Tomcat 9, 10.1, and 11 (beta)

Amazon EC2

###### To enable JMX in your JVM instance

For the CloudWatch agent to be able to collect JMX metrics, your application’s JVM
must bind to a port using the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port`
system property.

```nohighlight

java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=port-number -jar example.jar
```

For more information and other configurations, see the [JMX documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/management/monitoring-and-management-using-jmx-technology.html).

Amazon EKS

###### To enable JMX on your Java application pods

When using the CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on, you can manage how JMX metrics
are enabled with annotations. For more information, see [Install the CloudWatch agent with the Amazon CloudWatch Observability EKS add-on or the Helm chart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Observability-EKS-addon.html). To enable JMX
metrics collection from a workload, add the following annotations to the workload
manifest file under the `PodTemplate` section:

- `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"`

- One or more of the following:

- For JVM metrics: `cloudwatch.aws.amazon.com/inject-jmx-jvm:
                            "true"`

- For Kafka broker metrics:
`cloudwatch.aws.amazon.com/inject-jmx-kafka: "true"`

- For Kafka consumer metrics:
`cloudwatch.aws.amazon.com/inject-jmx-kafka-consumer:
                          "true"`

- For Kafka producer metrics:
`cloudwatch.aws.amazon.com/inject-jmx-kafka-producer:
                          "true"`

- For Tomcat metrics: `cloudwatch.aws.amazon.com/inject-jmx-tomcat:
                            "true"`

To start collecting JMX metrics, add a `jmx` section inside the
`metrics_collected` section of the CloudWatch agent configuration file. The
`jmx` section can contain the following fields.

- `jvm` – Optional. Specifies that you want to retrieve Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) metrics from the instance. For more information, see [Collect JVM metrics](#CloudWatch-Agent-JVM-metrics).

This section can include the following fields:

Within the entry for each individual metric, you can optionally specify one or
both of the following:

- `rename` – Specifies a different name for this
metric.

- `unit` – Specifies the unit to use for this metric,
overriding the default unit for the metric. The unit that you specify must be
a valid CloudWatch metric unit, as listed in the `Unit` description in
[MetricDatum](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-metricdatum.md).

- `kafka` – Optional. Specifies that you want to retrieve Apache
Kafka broker metrics from the instance. For more information, see [Collect Kafka metrics](#CloudWatch-Agent-Kafka-metrics).

- `kafka-consumer` – Optional. Specifies that you want to retrieve
Apache Kafka consumer metrics from the instance. For more information, see [Collect Kafka metrics](#CloudWatch-Agent-Kafka-metrics).

This section can include the following fields:

- `measurement` – Specifies the array of Kafka broker metrics
to be collected. For a list of the possible values to use here, see the
**Metric** column in the second metrics table in [Collect Kafka metrics](#CloudWatch-Agent-Kafka-metrics).

Within the entry for each individual metric, you can optionally specify one or
both of the following:

- `rename` – Specifies a different name for this
metric.

- `unit` – Specifies the unit to use for this metric,
overriding the default unit for the metric. The unit that you specify must be
a valid CloudWatch metric unit, as listed in the `Unit` description in
[MetricDatum](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-metricdatum.md).

- `kafka-producer` – Optional. Specifies that you want to retrieve
Apache Kafka producer metrics from the instance. For more information, see [Collect Kafka metrics](#CloudWatch-Agent-Kafka-metrics).

This section can include the following fields:

- `measurement` – Specifies the array of Kafka broker metrics
to be collected. For a list of the possible values to use here, see the
**Metric** column in the third metrics table in [Collect Kafka metrics](#CloudWatch-Agent-Kafka-metrics).

Within the entry for each individual metric, you can optionally specify one or
both of the following:

- `rename` – Specifies a different name for this
metric.

- `unit` – Specifies the unit to use for this metric,
overriding the default unit for the metric. The unit that you specify must be
a valid CloudWatch metric unit, as listed in the `Unit` description in
[MetricDatum](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-metricdatum.md).

[MetricDatum](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatch/latest/apireference/api-metricdatum.md).

The `jmx` section can also include the optional
`append_dimensions` field:

- `append_dimensions` – Optional. Additional dimensions to use for
only the process metrics. If you specify this field, it's used in addition to
dimensions specified in the `append_dimensions` field that is used for all
types of metrics collected by the agent.

###### The following fields are for Amazon EC2 only.

- `endpoint` – The address for the JMX client to connect to. The
format is `ip:port`. If the endpoint is not the localhost, and password
authentication and SSL must be enabled.

- `metrics_collection_interval` – Optional. Specifies how often to
collect the processes metrics, overriding the global
`metrics_collection_interval` specified in the `agent` section
of the configuration file.

This value is specified in seconds. For example, specifying 10 causes metrics to
be collected every 10 seconds, and setting it to 300 specifies metrics to be collected
every 5 minutes.

If you set this value below 60 seconds, each metric is collected as a
high-resolution metric. For more information, see [High-resolution metrics](publishingmetrics.md#high-resolution-metrics).

If JMX was enabled with password authentication or SSL for remote access, you can use
the following fields.

- `password_file` – Optional. Specifies a Java properties file of
keys to passwords. The file must be read-only and restricted to the user running the
CloudWatch agent. If password authentication is enabled, this requires the same username and
password pair as the entry in the JMX password file provided in the
`com.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file` property. If SSL is enabled,
it requires entries for `keystore` and `truststore` and
corresponds to the `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword` and
`javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` respectively.

- `username` – If password authentication is enabled, specify the
username that matches the username in the provided password file.

- `keystore_path` – If SSL is enabled, specify the full path to
the Java keystore, which consists of a private key and a certificate to the public
key. Corresponds to the `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` property.

- `keystore_type` – If SSL is enabled, specify the type of
keystore being used. Corresponds to the `javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType`
property.

- `truststore_path` – If SSL is enabled, specify the full path to
the Java truststore, which must contain the remote JMX server's public certificate.
Corresponds to the `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` property.

- `truststore_type` – If SSL is enabled, specify the type of
truststore being used. Corresponds to the `javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType`
property.

- `remote_profile` – Optional. Supported JMX remote profiles are
TLS in combination with SASL profiles: `SASL/PLAIN`,
`SASL/DIGEST-MD5`, and `SASL/CRAM-MD5`. Should be one
of: `SASL/PLAIN`, `SASL/DIGEST-MD5`,
`SASL/CRAM-MD5`, `TLS SASL/PLAIN`, `TLS
                  SASL/DIGEST-MD5`, or `TLS SASL/CRAM-MD5`

- `realm` – Optional. The realm as required by the remote profile
`SASL/DIGEST-MD5`.

- `registry_ssl_enabled` – If RMI registry authentication is
enabled. Set to true if the JVM was configured with
`com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl=true`.

- `insecure` Set to `true` to opt out of the validation
required if the agent is configured for a non-localhost endpoint.

The following is an example of the `jmx` section of the CloudWatch agent
configuration file.

be filtered down using the `aggregation_dimensions` field.
