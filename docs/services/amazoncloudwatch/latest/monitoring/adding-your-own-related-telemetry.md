# How to add related information to custom telemetry sent to CloudWatch

When you publish your own metrics and logs to CloudWatch, the entity information needed
for related telemetry is not there by default. When you send metrics to CloudWatch or
logs to CloudWatch Logs (with the [PutMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricData.html) or [PutLogEvents](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatchlogs/latest/apireference/api-putlogevents.md) operations), you can add entity information to those logs or
metrics. The entity information is associated with the telemetry, and used in the
**Explore related** feature to find related telemetry that is
associated with the same entity.

The entity sent with telemetry represents a resource or service that the
telemetry is associated with. For example, a metric about a service, or that comes from
an AWS resource. To identify the entity associated in your code, you create a set of
`KeyAttributes` and optional `Attributes` of the entity.

###### Note

CloudWatch can only find related resources for entities that have had telemetry sent
within the previous three hours. If your resource only emits sparse telemetry
(less than once every 3 hours), you may want to send additional
_heartbeat_ telemetry, to keep the entity active within
CloudWatch.

For information on how to add entity information, see [Entity information in EMF format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format_Specification.html#entity-information-emf-format).

The following sections describe how to create the `KeyAttributes` and
`Attributes` so that CloudWatch can identify the resources and services associated
with the telemetry.

## Identifying the entity with the KeyAttributes object

The `KeyAttributes` property of the Entity objects ( [in CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Entity.html) or
[in CloudWatch \
logs](../../../../reference/amazoncloudwatchlogs/latest/apireference/api-entity.md)) uniquely identifies the entity for CloudWatch. It is a list of
key-value pairs. Entities with the same `KeyAttributes` are considered
to be the same entity. Telemetry associated with the same entity are considered
related, and can be easily found in the **Explore related**
pane.

###### Note

In the CloudWatch API, the property is called `KeyAttributes`. In the
CloudWatch Logs API, the property is called `keyAttributes`. Here they are
treated as the same property.

There are five possible types of object that an `Entity` can
represent.

- **AWS::Resource** – The
entity represents an AWS resource, such as a DynamoDB table or Amazon EC2
instance.

- **AWS::Service** – The
entity represent an AWS service, such as Amazon S3. This might be used, for
example, when calling the `ListBuckets` operation, which is not
associated with a specific Amazon S3 resource.

- **Service** – The entity
represents a workload running in your account. For example, an application
or service that you manage.

- **Resource** – The
entity represents a resource that is not managed by AWS, for example,
operating system resources, such as processes or file volumes.

- **RemoteService** – The
entity represents an external service in a remote call. For example, a
remote call to a database, external cache, or an external endpoint.

Depending on which of the above types you are trying to represent, you must
provide the correct key-value pairs for the `KeyAttributes`. The
following describes each type.

AWS::Resource

To specify an AWS Resource, you must include the following three
key value pairs:

- `"Type": "AWS::Resource"` – This key-value
pair identifies the entity as an AWS resource.

- `"ResourceType": "<resource-type>"`
– The string value of the `ResourceType` is
the CloudFormation [resource type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) string. For example,
`AWS::DynamoDB::Table`.

- `"Identifier": "<resource-id>"`
– The primary identifier for the resource. For more
information, see [primaryIdentifier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-schema.html#schema-properties-primaryidentifier) in the _Extension Development_
_for CloudFormation User Guide_.

AWS::Service

To specify an AWS Service, you must include the following two
key value pairs:

- `"Type": "AWS::Service"` – This key-value
pair identifies the entity as an AWS service.

- `"Name": "<service-name>"`
– The value of the `Name` is the CloudFormation
[service name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) string. For example,
`AWS::DynamoDB`.

Service

To specify a service that is not operated by AWS, you must include
the following three key value pairs:

- `"Type": "Service"` – This key-value
pair identifies the entity as a service.

- `"Name": "<service-name>"`
– This represents the name of the service that is
sending the metrics. For example, `my-service-frontend`
or `api.myservice.com`.

- `"Environment": "<environment-name>"`
– This attribute specifies
where the service is hosted, or the environment to which it
belongs. For example `us-west-2`, or
`myservice.production`.

Resource

To specify a resource that is not provided by AWS, you must include
the following three key value pairs:

- `"Type": "Resource"` – This key-value
pair identifies the entity as a resource.

- `"ResourceType": "<resource-type>"`
– A string specifying the type of resource. For example,
`K8s::Pod` for a Kubernetes Pod.

- `"Identifier": "<resource-id>"`
– A string identifier for the resource. Can contain
multiple names, separated by pipes. For example, a Kubernetes
Pod might be represented by it's cluster name, namespace, and
pod name, such as `MyCluster|MyNamespace|MyPod`.

RemoteService

To specify a remote service, you must include the following two
key value pairs:

- `"Type": "RemoteService"` – This key-value
pair identifies the entity as a remote service.

- `"Name": "<remote-service-name>"`
– Specifies how the application refers to the external
service in a remote call. For example,
`api.test.myservice.com`.

## Providing additional details about the entity with the Attributes object

You can provide additional details about the `Entity` that you
provide with your telemetry. This can include details about the platform,
resource, application, or telemetry provider. The following tables describes
the key words that you can use for each of these types of data.

CloudWatch Logs API, the property is called `attributes`. Here they are
treated as the same property.
