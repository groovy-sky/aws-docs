# Conduct an CloudWatch investigation without additional configuration

You can conduct a CloudWatch investigations AI-powered root cause analysis without any additional
configuration of your AWS account using the **Investigations**
feature available in **Operational troubleshooting**.

These investigations provide instant access to CloudWatch investigations capabilities from commonly used
telemetry sources in the AWS console. This type of investigation is session-based,
read-only, and automatically deleted after 24 hours.

The investigation pane provides you:

- **AI-generated observations** \- Telemetry that
fans out from your initial observation you provided to locate additional
supporting data that can lead to a potential root cause.

- **Root cause hypotheses** \- Potential
explanations for what's causing the problem, including causal diagrams when
multiple resources are involved

- **Natural language explanations** -
Easy-to-understand descriptions of findings and recommendations

You can use the suggestions from the investigation pane to help accelerate your
troubleshooting process.
