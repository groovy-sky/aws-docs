# Create an investigation

You can start an investigation from several AWS consoles, including (but not limited
to) CloudWatch alarm pages, CloudWatch metric pages, and Lambda monitoring pages.

###### To start an investigation from an AWS console page

1. In **Account-level** select the graph of the metric or alarm
    that you want to investigate.

2. If the top of the page has an **Investigate** button, choose
    it and then choose **Start new investigation**.

Otherwise, choose the vertical ellipsis menu icon ![Depicts the appearance of the vertical ellipsis icon on the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/images/vmore.png) for the metric, and choose
    **Investigate**, **Start a new**
**investigation**.

3. In the **Investigation** pane, enter a name for the
    investigation in **New investigation title**, and optionally
    enter notes about the selected metric or alarm.

4. Under **Approximate impact start time** CloudWatch investigations recommends a
    timestamp to investigate based on the selected telemetry. To change the
    timestamp of the investigation, update the date and time.

5. Then choose **Start investigation**.

The investigation starts. CloudWatch investigations scans your telemetry data to find data that
    might be associated with this situation.

6. To move the investigation data to the larger pane, choose **Open in**
**full page**.

7. For detailed instructions about steps that you can take while continuing the
    investigation, see [View and continue an open investigation](investigations-continue.md).

## Create an investigation from Amazon Q chat

You can ask questions about issues in your deployment in CloudWatch investigations chat. The question
could be something like "Why is my Lambda function slow today?"

When you do so, CloudWatch investigations might ask follow up questions and run a health check
regarding the issue. After the health check, the chat will prompt you about whether
you want to start an investigation.

For more information and more sample questions, see [Chatting with Amazon Q about AWS](../../../amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/chat-with-q.md#example-questions-investigations).

For detailed instructions about steps that you can take while continuing the
investigation after it has been started, see [View and continue an open investigation](investigations-continue.md).

## Create an investigation from a CloudWatch alarm action

When you create a CloudWatch alarm, you can specify for it to automatically start an
investigation when it goes into ALARM state. You can do this for both metric alarms
and composite alarms. For more information, see [Start a CloudWatch investigations from an alarm](start-investigation-alarm.md),
[Create a CloudWatch alarm based on a static threshold](consolealarms.md) and [Create a composite alarm](create-composite-alarm.md).
