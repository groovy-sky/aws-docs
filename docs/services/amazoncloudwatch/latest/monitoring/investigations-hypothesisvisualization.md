# Understanding hypothesis visualizations

When CloudWatch investigations generates hypotheses that include multiple resources, the investigation view
provides a visual representation of the causal relationships between those resources.
This visual hypothesis view helps you quickly understand complex issues without reading
lengthy text explanations.

The hypothesis visualization displays resources as nodes connected by the pathways
identified by CloudWatch investigations. For example, if a hypothesis involves Lambda function A affecting
DynamoDB table B, you'll see two nodes visualizing the relationship.

**Key features of hypothesis visualizations:**

- **Resource nodes** \- Each AWS resource
mentioned in the hypothesis appears as a distinct node, labeled with the
resource type and identifier.

- **Connections** \- Connections between nodes
indicate the relationships that CloudWatch investigations has identified.

- **Visual context** \- The layout helps you
understand the scope and complexity of multi-resource issues at a glance.

This visual representation is particularly valuable for:

- Understanding distributed system failures that span multiple services

- Identifying upstream and downstream impact relationships

- Quickly assessing the scope of an issue before diving into detailed
analysis

###### Note

Hypothesis visualizations are automatically generated when CloudWatch investigations identifies causal
relationships between multiple resources.
