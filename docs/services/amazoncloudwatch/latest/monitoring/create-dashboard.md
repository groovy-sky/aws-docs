# Creating a customized CloudWatch dashboard

To get started,
create a CloudWatch dashboard.
You can create multiple dashboards,
and you can add dashboards
to a favorites list.
You aren't limited
to the number
of dashboards
that you can have
in your AWS account.
All dashboards are global.
They are not Region-specific.

The following procedure shows you
how to create a dashboard
from the CloudWatch console.
You can use the `PutDashboard` API operation
to create a dashboard
from the command line interface.
The API operation contains a JSON string
that defines your dashboard content.
For more information
about creating a dashboard
with the `PutDashboard` API operation,
see [PutDashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutDashboard.html)
in the _Amazon CloudWatch API Reference_.

###### Tip

If you're creating a new dashboard
with the `PutDashboard` API operation,
you can use the JSON string
from a dashboard
that already exists.

###### To create a dashboard from the console

1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).

2. In the navigation pane,
    choose **Dashboards**,
    and then choose **Create dashboard**.

3. In the **Create new dashboard** dialog box,
    enter a name
    for the dashboard,
    and then choose **Create dashboard**.

    If you use the name **CloudWatch-Default** or **CloudWatch-Default- `ResourceGroupName`**,
    the dashboard appears
    in the overview
    of the CloudWatch home page
    under **Default Dashboard**.
    For more information,
    see [Getting started with CloudWatch automatic dashboards](gettingstarted.md).

4. In the **Add to this dashboard** dialog box,
    do one
    of the following:

   - To add a graph to the dashboard, choose **Line** or
      **Stacked area**, and then choose
      **Configure**. In the **Add metric**
     **graph** dialog box, select the metric(s) to graph, and then
      choose **Create widget**. If a metric doesn't appear in
      the dialog box because it hasn't published data in more than 14 days,
      you can add it manually. For more information, see [Graph metrics manually on a CloudWatch dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/add_old_metrics_to_graph.html).

   - To add a number displaying a metric
      to the dashboard,
      choose **Number**,
      and then choose **Configure**.
      In the **Add metric graph** dialog box,
      select the metric(s)
      to graph,
      and then choose **Create widget**.

   - To add a text block to the dashboard, choose
      **Text**, and then choose
      **Configure**. In the **New text**
     **widget** dialog box, for **Markdown**,
      format your text using [Markdown](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-markdown.html), and then choose **Create**
     **widget**.
5. (Optional) Choose **Add widget**,
    and then repeat step 4
    to add another widget
    to the dashboard.
    You can repeat this step multiple times.

For each graph on the dashboard, there is an information icon at the upper right. Choose this icon
    to see the descriptions of the metrics in the graph.

6. Choose **Save dashboard**.
