- **PlayWright support** – You can write
canary scripts by using the Playwright automation framework. You can bring your
existing Playwright scripts to run as canaries, and enhance them with AWS
monitoring capabilities.

- **CloudWatch Logs integration** – You can query
and filter for logs through the CloudWatch Synthetics console. Each log message
contains unique `canaryRunId`, making it easy to search for logs for
a particular canary run.

- **Metrics and canary artifacts** – You
can monitor canary run pass rate through CloudWatch metrics, and configure alarms to
alert you when canaries detect issues.

- **Screenshots and steps association** –
You can capture screenshots using native Playwright functionality to visualize
the stages of a canary script on each run. Screenshots are automatically
associated with canary steps, and are uploaded to Amazon S3 buckets.

- **Multiple tabs**– You can create
canaries that open multiple browser tabs, and access screenshots from each tab.
You can create multi-tab and multi-step user workflows in Synthetics.
