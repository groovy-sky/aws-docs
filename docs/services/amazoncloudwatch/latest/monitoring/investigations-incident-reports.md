# Generate incident reports

Incident reports help you more quickly and easily write a report about your incident
investigation. You can use this report to provide details to management or to help your team
learn from the incident and take actions to prevent future such occurrences. The structure
of the report is based on industry standards for these types of reports and can be copied
into other repositories for long-term retention.

When you use the AWS Management Console to create an `investigation group`
resource in CloudWatch investigations, an IAM role is created for the group to give it access to resources
during the investigation. Generating CloudWatch investigations incident reports requires additional permissions
be granted to your investigation group. The new managed policy
`AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy` provides the required permissions and is
automatically added to investigation groups created using the AWS Management Console after October 10,
2025\. For more information, see [AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy](managed-policies-cloudwatch.md#managed-policies-QInvestigations-AIOpsAssistantIncidentReportPolicy).

###### Note

If you are using the CDK or SDK, you must explicitly add the investigation group role
and specify the role policy or equivalent inline permissions on the role. For more
details about permissions, see [Security in CloudWatch investigations](investigations-security.md)

These reports capture investigation findings, root causes, timeline events, and
recommended corrective actions in a structured format that can be easily shared with
stakeholders and used for organizational learning.

Incident report generation is included at no additional charge for all CloudWatch investigations users and
integrates seamlessly with your investigation workflow.

**How incident reports work**

1. Run an investigation on your incident.

2. Accept at least one hypothesis. Each hypothesis you accept is considered for the
    report. The hypothesis doesn't need to be 100% accurate.

3. Choose **Incident report**. During the investigation
    the AI parsed the data collected for your investigation and derived facts. Facts are
    atomic pieces of information about your incident that form the basis of generating
    the report. Fact extraction can take a few minutes.

4. When fact extraction is finished, you can review the facts available in the
    following areas:

1. **Incident Overview** – High-level overview
    of the incident including its severity, duration, and operational
    hypothesis.

2. **Impact Assessment** – Metrics and analysis
    related to the impact of the incident on customers, service function, and
    business operations.

3. **Detection and Response** – Metrics and
    analysis related to how and when the incident was detected and how you
    responded to the incident.

4. **Root Cause Analysis** – Detailed analysis
    of underlying causes based on investigation hypotheses.

5. **Mitigation and Resolution** – Metrics and
    analysis related to mitigation steps and resolution measures, along with the
    time measurement for incident mitigation and resolution.

6. **Learning and Next Steps** – A list of
    recommended actions for your team to consider, automatically generated from
    the investigation findings. These recommendations may include preventive
    measures against similar incidents, as well as suggested improvements to
    your monitoring and response processes.

5. After reviewing the facts, choose **Generate report**
    to create a comprehensive analysis of the incident. While the selected facts serve
    as key reference points, the report draws from all available information gathered
    during the investigation. This process can take a few minutes.

6. After generating the report, you can then either:

- Use the report as is:

- Copy it to edit in your external editor if needed

- Save it for later reference

- Enhance the report by adding more data:

- Choose **Add facts** (recommended
method) to input additional text-based content such as incident
tickets or custom narratives. The AI will analyze this content to
augment existing facts or infer new ones.

- Edit facts directly (use sparingly) - Manually edited facts may
create inconsistencies with the investigation timeline. This should
be used only as a last resort when **Add**
**facts** doesn't achieve the desired result.

- Choose **Regenerate report** to produce a new
report using the updated information.
