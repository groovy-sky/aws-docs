## What is Prometheus Query Language (PromQL)?

Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) is a functional query language that lets you select,
aggregate, and transform time series data in real time. PromQL was originally designed for
Prometheus and has become a popular query language for metrics.

Amazon CloudWatch supports PromQL for querying metrics including metrics ingested via OpenTelemetry
Line Protocol (OTLP) and [AWS enriched vended metrics](aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.md). When you ingest OTLP metrics, CloudWatch preserves the
full semantic structure of your telemetry, including resource attributes, instrumentation scope,
datapoint attributes, and AWS-specific metadata, and exposes them as queryable PromQL labels.

With PromQL you can do the following:

- Select time series by metric name and label matchers.

- Apply mathematical functions and operators across time series.

- Aggregate metrics across dimensions such as service, region, or account.

- Compute rates, histograms, quantiles, and moving averages.

You can use PromQL queries interactively in [Running PromQL queries in Query Studio (Preview)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-PromQL-QueryStudio.html) and also to create CloudWatch Alarms. For more
information, see [PromQL querying](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-PromQL-Querying.html) and [Using PromQL in alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-PromQL-Alarms.html).

###### Note

CloudWatch uses PromQL based on the Prometheus 3.0 specification. This includes support for
UTF-8 metric names and label names.

The following concepts are fundamental to working with PromQL in CloudWatch.

ConceptDescription

**Time series**

A stream of timestamped values identified by a metric name and a set of key-value pairs called _labels_. Each unique combination of metric name and labels forms a distinct time series.

**Instant vector**

A set of time series containing a single sample for each series, all sharing the same timestamp. Returned by queries like `{"http.server.active_requests", "@resource.service.name"="myservice"}`.

**Range vector**

A set of time series containing a range of data points over time for each series. Created by appending a time duration selector in brackets, for example, `avg_over_time({"http.server.active_requests", "@resource.service.name"="myservice"}[5m])`.

**Label**

A key-value pair attached to a time series. In OTLP-ingested metrics, labels are derived from resource attributes, instrumentation scope, datapoint attributes, and AWS-specific metadata.

**Label matcher**

An expression in curly braces that filters time series by label value. Supports exact match ( `=`), not equal ( `!=`), regex match ( `=~`), and negative regex match ( `!~`).

**Aggregation operator**

A function that combines multiple time series into fewer series. Common operators include `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`, and `topk`.

## PromQL limits and restrictions

## IAM permissions for PromQL

To execute PromQL queries, you need both `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` and
`cloudwatch:ListMetrics` permissions. The following table lists the new PromQL
API operations and their required IAM actions:
