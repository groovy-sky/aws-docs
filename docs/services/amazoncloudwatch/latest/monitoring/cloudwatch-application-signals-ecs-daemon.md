# Deploy using the daemon strategy

## Step 1: Enable Application Signals in your account

You must first enable Application Signals in your account. If you haven't, see [Enable Application Signals in your account](cloudwatch-application-signals-enable.md).

## Step 2: Create IAM roles

You must create an IAM role. If you already have created this role, you might
need to add permissions to it.

- **ECS task role—** Containers use this role to run.
The permissions should be whatever your applications need, plus **CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy**.

For more information about creating IAM roles, see
[Creating IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html).

## Step 3: Prepare CloudWatch agent configuration

First, prepare the agent configuration with Application Signals enabled. To do this, create a local file
named
`/tmp/ecs-cwagent.json`.

```json

{
  "traces": {
    "traces_collected": {
      "application_signals": {}
    }
  },
  "logs": {
    "metrics_collected": {
      "application_signals": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Then upload this configuration to the SSM Parameter Store. To do this, enter the
following command. In the file, replace `$REGION` with your
actual Region name.

```nohighlight

aws ssm put-parameter \
--name "ecs-cwagent" \
--type "String" \
--value "`cat /tmp/ecs-cwagent.json`" \
--region "$REGION"
```

## Step 4: Deploy the CloudWatch agent daemon service

Create the following task definition and deploy it to your application cluster. Replace `$REGION` with your actual Region name.
Replace `$TASK_ROLE_ARN` and `$EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN` with the IAM roles you prepared in
[Step 2: Create IAM roles](#Application-Signals-Enable-ECS-IAM-Daemon). Replace `$IMAGE` with the path to the latest
CloudWatch container image on Amazon Elastic Container Registry. For more information, see
[cloudwatch-agent](https://gallery.ecr.aws/cloudwatch-agent/cloudwatch-agent) on Amazon ECR.

###### Note

The daemon service exposes two ports on the host, with 4316 used as endpoint for receiving metrics and traces and 2000 as the
CloudWatch trace sampler endpoint. This setup allows the agent to collect and transmit telemetry data from all application tasks running on the host.
Ensure that these ports are not used by other services on the host to avoid conflicts.

```json

{
  "family": "ecs-cwagent-daemon",
  "taskRoleArn": "$TASK_ROLE_ARN",
  "executionRoleArn": "$EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN",
  "networkMode": "bridge",

        {
          "containerPort": 2000,

    }
  ],
  "requiresCompatibilities": [
    "EC2"
  ],
  "cpu": "128",
  "memory": "64"
}
```

## Step 5: Instrument your application

The next step is to instrument your application for Application Signals.

Java

###### To instrument your application on Amazon ECS with the CloudWatch agent

1. First, specify a bind mount. The volume will be used to share files across containers in the
    next steps. You will use this bind mount later in this procedure.

```json

"volumes": [
     {
       "name": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation"
     }
]
```

2. Append a new container `init` to your application's task definition. Replace
    `$IMAGE` with the latest image from the
    [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Amazon ECR image repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-observability/adot-autoinstrumentation-java).

```json

{
     "name": "init",
     "image": "$IMAGE",
     "essential": false,
     "command": [
       "cp",
       "/javaagent.jar",
       "/otel-auto-instrumentation/javaagent.jar"
     ],
     "mountPoints": [
       {
         "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation",
         "containerPath": "/otel-auto-instrumentation",
         "readOnly": false
       }
     ]
}
```

3. Add a dependency on the `init` container to make sure that this container finishes before your application container starts.

```json

"dependsOn": [
     {
       "containerName": "init",
       "condition": "SUCCESS"
     }
]
```

4. Add the following environment variables to your application container. You must be using
    version 1.32.2 or later of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry [auto-instrumentation\
    agent for Java](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent).

Environment variableSetting to enable Application Signals

`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`

Specify the following information as
key-value pairs:

- `service.name` sets the name of the service. This will be diplayed as the service
name for your application in Application Signals dashboards. If you don't provide a value for this key, the
default of `UnknownService` is used.

- `deployment.environment` parameter defines your application's runtime environment and controls the `Environment` dimension for Amazon ECS Application metrics in CloudWatch. When not specified, CloudWatch Agent automatically uses the Amazon ECS
Cluster name

This
attribute key is used only by Application Signals, and is converted into X-Ray trace annotations and
CloudWatch metric dimensions.

(Optional) To enable log correlation for Application Signals, set an additional environment variable `aws.log.group.names` to be the log group name for your application log.
By doing so, the traces and metrics
from your application can be correlated with the relevant log entries from the log group. For this variable, replace `$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP`
with the log group names for your application. If you have multiple log groups, you can use an ampersand ( `&`) to separate them as in this example: `aws.log.group.names=log-group-1&log-group-2`.
To enable metric to log correlation, setting this current environmental variable is enough. For more information, see
[Enable metric to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-MetricLogCorrelation.html). To enable trace to log correlation, you'll also need to change the
logging
configuration in your application. For more information, see [Enable trace to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-TraceLogCorrelation.html).

`OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED`

Set to `true` to have your container start sending X-Ray traces and CloudWatch metrics
to Application Signals.

`OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER`

Set to `none` to disable other metrics exporters.

`OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`

Set to `none` to disable other logs exporters.

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`

Set to `http/protobuf` to send metrics and traces
to Application Signals using HTTP.

`OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT`

Sends metrics to the CloudWatch daemon container.

- For applications running in `host` mode, set this to `http://localhost:4316/v1/metrics`.

- For applications running in `bridge` mode or `awsvpc` mode, set this to
http:// `CW_CONTAINER_IP`:4316/v1/metrics, where `CW_CONTAINER_IP` is the private IP address of
the EC2 container instance. You can retrieve this address from the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`

Sends traces to the CloudWatch daemon container.

- For applications running in `host` mode, set this to `http://localhost:4316/v1/traces`.

- For applications running in `bridge` mode or `awsvpc` mode, set this to
http:// `CW_CONTAINER_IP`:4316/v1/traces, where `CW_CONTAINER_IP` is the private IP address of
the EC2 container instance. You can retrieve this address from the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS).

`OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER`

Set this to `xray` to set X-Ray as the traces sampler.

`OTEL_PROPAGATORS`

Set `xray` as one of the propagators.

`JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`

Set to `" -javaagent:$AWS_ADOT_JAVA_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH"` Replace
`AWS_ADOT_JAVA_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH` with the path where the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Java
auto-instrumentation agent is stored. For example, `/otel-auto-instrumentation/javaagent.jar`

5. Mount the volume `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation` that you defined
    in step 1 of this procedure. If you don't need to enable log correlation with metrics and traces, use the following example
    for a Java application. If you want to enable log correlation, see the next step instead.

```json

{
     "name": "my-app",
      ...
     "environment": [
       {
         "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
         "value": "service.name=$SVC_NAME"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER",
         "value": "none"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER",
         "value": "none"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL",
         "value": "http/protobuf"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED",
         "value": "true"
       },
       {
         "name": "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS",
         "value": " -javaagent:/otel-auto-instrumentation/javaagent.jar"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT",
         "value": "http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:4316/v1/metrics"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT",
         "value": "http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:4316/v1/traces"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER",
         "value": "xray"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_PROPAGATORS",
         "value": "tracecontext,baggage,b3,xray"
       }
     ],
       "dependsOn": [
       {
         "containerName": "init",
         "condition": "SUCCESS"
       }
     ],
     "mountPoints": [
       {
         "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation",
         "containerPath": "/otel-auto-instrumentation",
         "readOnly": false
       }
     ]
}
```

Python

Before you enable Application Signals for your Python applications, be aware of the following considerations.

- In some containerized applications, a missing `PYTHONPATH` environment variable can sometimes
cause the application to fail to start. To resolve this, ensure that you set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
to the location of your application’s working directory. This is due to a known issue with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation.
For more information about this issue, see
[Python autoinstrumentation setting of PYTHONPATH is not compliant](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/issues/2302).

- For Django applications, there are additional required configurations, which are outlined
in the [OpenTelemetry Python documentation](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/django/README.html).

- Use the `--noreload` flag to prevent automatic reloading.

- Set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to the location of your Django
application’s `settings.py` file. This ensures that OpenTelemetry can correctly access and integrate with your Django settings.

- If you're using a WSGI server for your Python application, in addition to the following steps in this section,
see [No Application Signals data for Python application that uses a WSGI server](cloudwatch-application-signals-enable-troubleshoot.md#Application-Signals-troubleshoot-Python-WSGI) for information to make Application Signals work.

         "readOnly": false
       }
     ]
}
```

6. (Optional) To enable log correlation, do the following before you mount the volume. In `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, set an additional environment variable `aws.log.group.names` for the log groups of your application.
    By doing so, the traces and metrics from your application can be correlated with the relevant log entries from these log groups. For this variable, replace `$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP`
    with the log group names for your application. If you have multiple log groups, you can use an ampersand ( `&`) to separate them as in this example: `aws.log.group.names=log-group-1&log-group-2`.
    To enable metric to log correlation, setting this current environmental variable is enough. For more information, see
    [Enable metric to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-MetricLogCorrelation.html). To enable trace to log correlation, you'll also need to change the
    logging
    configuration in your application. For more information, see [Enable trace to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-TraceLogCorrelation.html).

The following is an example. To enable log correlation, use this example when you mount the volume `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python` that you defined
    in step 1 of this procedure.

```json

{
     "name": "my-app",
     ...

         "condition": "SUCCESS"
       }
     ],
     "mountPoints": [
       {
         "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-python",
         "containerPath": "/otel-auto-instrumentation-python",
         "readOnly": false
       }
     ]
}
```

###### To instrument your application on Amazon ECS with the CloudWatch agent

1. First, specify a bind mount. The volume will be used to share files across containers in the
    next steps. You will use this bind mount later in this procedure.

```json

"volumes": [
     {
       "name": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation"
     }
]
```

2. Append a new container `init` to your application's task definition. Replace
    `$IMAGE` with the latest image from the
    [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Amazon ECR image repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-observability/adot-autoinstrumentation-dotnet).

For a Linux container instance, use the following.

```json

{
     "name": "init",
     "image": "$IMAGE",
     "essential": false,
     "command": [
         "cp",
         "-a",
         "autoinstrumentation/.",
         "/otel-auto-instrumentation"
     ],
     "mountPoints": [
         {
             "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation",
             "containerPath": "/otel-auto-instrumentation",
             "readOnly": false
         }
     ]
}
```

For a Windows Server container instance, use the following.

```json

{
     "name": "init",
     "image": "$IMAGE",
     "essential": false,
     "command": [
         "CMD",
         "/c",
         "xcopy",
         "/e",
         "C:\\autoinstrumentation\\*",
         "C:\\otel-auto-instrumentation",
         "&&",
         "icacls",
         "C:\\otel-auto-instrumentation",
         "/grant",
         "*S-1-1-0:R",
         "/T"
     ],
     "mountPoints": [
         {
             "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation",
             "containerPath": "C:\\otel-auto-instrumentation",
             "readOnly": false
         }
     ]
}
```

3. Add a dependency on the `init` container to make sure that container
    finishes before your application container starts.

```json

"dependsOn": [
       {
           "containerName": "init",
           "condition": "SUCCESS"
       }
]
```

4. Add the following environment variables to your application container. You must be using
    version 1.1.0 or later of the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry [auto-instrumentation agent\
    for .NET](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/net).

###### Note

If you are enabling Application Signals for a Node.js application with ESM, see

[Setting up a Node.js application with the ESM module format](#ECSDaemon-NodeJs-ESM) before you start these steps.

###### To instrument your application on Amazon ECS with the CloudWatch agent

1. First, specify a bind mount. The volume will be used to share files across containers in the
    next steps. You will use this bind mount later in this procedure.

```json

"volumes": [
     {
       "name": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-node"
     }
]
```

2. Append a new container `init` to your application's task definition. Replace
    `$IMAGE` with the latest image from the
    [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Amazon ECR image repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/aws-observability/adot-autoinstrumentation-node).

```json

{
     "name": "init",
     "image": "$IMAGE",
     "essential": false,
     "command": [
       "cp",

```

4. Add the following environment variables to your application container.

Environment variableSetting to enable Application Signals

`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`

Specify the following information as
key-value pairs:

- `service.name` sets the name of the service. This will be diplayed as the service
name for your application in Application Signals dashboards. If you don't provide a value for this key, the
default of `UnknownService` is used.

- `deployment.environment` parameter defines your application's runtime environment and controls the `Environment` dimension for Amazon ECS Application metrics in CloudWatch. When not specified, CloudWatch Agent automatically uses the Amazon ECS
Cluster name

This
attribute key is used only by Application Signals, and is converted into X-Ray trace annotations and
CloudWatch metric dimensions.

(Optional) To enable log correlation for Application Signals, set an additional environment variable `aws.log.group.names` to be the log group name for your application log.
By doing so, the traces and metrics
from your application can be correlated with the relevant log entries from the log group. For this variable, replace `$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP`
with the log group names for your application. If you have multiple log groups, you can use an ampersand ( `&`) to separate them as in this example: `aws.log.group.names=log-group-1&log-group-2`.
To enable metric to log correlation, setting this current environmental variable is enough. For more information, see
[Enable metric to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-MetricLogCorrelation.html). To enable trace to log correlation, you'll also need to change the
logging
configuration in your application. For more information, see [Enable trace to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-TraceLogCorrelation.html).

`NODE_OPTIONS`

Set to `--require AWS_ADOT_NODE_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH`. Replace
`AWS_ADOT_NODE_INSTRUMENTATION_PATH` with the path where the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Node.js auto-instrumentation is
stored. For example, `/otel-auto-instrumentation-node/autoinstrumentation.js`

5. Mount the volume `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-node` that you defined
    in step 1 of this procedure. If you don't need to enable log correlation with metrics and traces, use the following example
    for a Node.js application. If you want to enable log correlation, see the next step instead.

For your Application Container, add a dependency on the `init` container to make sure that container finishes before your application container starts.

```json

{
     "name": "my-app",
      ...
     "environment": [
       {
         "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
         "value": "service.name=$SVC_NAME"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER",
         "value": "none"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER",
         "value": "none"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL",
         "value": "http/protobuf"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED",
         "value": "true"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT",
         "value": "http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:4316/v1/metrics"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT",
         "value": "http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:4316/v1/traces"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER",
         "value": "xray"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG",
         "value": "endpoint=http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:2000"
       },
       {
         "name": "NODE_OPTIONS",
         "value": "--require /otel-auto-instrumentation-node/autoinstrumentation.js"
       }
       ],
     "mountPoints": [
       {
         "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-node",
         "containerPath": "/otel-auto-instrumentation-node",
         "readOnly": false
       }
     ],
     "dependsOn": [
       {
         "containerName": "init",
         "condition": "SUCCESS"
       }
     ]
}
```

6. (Optional) To enable log correlation, do the following before you mount the volume. In `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, set an additional environment variable `aws.log.group.names` for the log groups of your application.
    By doing so, the traces and metrics from your application can be correlated with the relevant log entries from these log groups. For this variable, replace `$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP`
    with the log group names for your application. If you have multiple log groups, you can use an ampersand ( `&`) to separate them as in this example: `aws.log.group.names=log-group-1&log-group-2`.
    To enable metric to log correlation, setting this current environmental variable is enough. For more information, see
    [Enable metric to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-MetricLogCorrelation.html). To enable trace to log correlation, you'll also need to change the
    logging
    configuration in your application. For more information, see [Enable trace to log correlation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Application-Signals-TraceLogCorrelation.html).

The following is an example. Use this example to enable log correlation when you mount the volume `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation` that you defined
    in step 1 of this procedure.

```json

{
     "name": "my-app",
      ...
     "environment": [
       {
         "name": "OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES",
         "value": "aws.log.group.names=$YOUR_APPLICATION_LOG_GROUP,service.name=$SVC_NAME"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER",
         "value": "none"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER",
         "value": "none"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL",
         "value": "http/protobuf"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_ENABLED",
         "value": "true"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_AWS_APPLICATION_SIGNALS_EXPORTER_ENDPOINT",
         "value": "http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:4316/v1/metrics"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT",
         "value": "http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:4316/v1/traces"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER",
         "value": "xray"
       },
       {
         "name": "OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG",
         "value": "endpoint=http://CW_CONTAINER_IP:2000"
       },
       {
         "name": "NODE_OPTIONS",
         "value": "--require /otel-auto-instrumentation-node/autoinstrumentation.js"
       }
       ],
     "mountPoints": [
       {
         "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-node",
         "containerPath": "/otel-auto-instrumentation-node",
         "readOnly": false
       }
     ],
     "dependsOn": [
       {
         "containerName": "init",
         "condition": "SUCCESS"
       }
     ]
}
```

**Setting up a Node.js application with the ESM module format**

We provide limited support for Node.js applications with the ESM module format.
For details, see [Known limitations about Node.js with ESM](cloudwatch-application-signals-supportmatrix.md#ESM-limitations).

For the ESM module format, using the `init` container to inject the Node.js instrumentation SDK doesn’t apply.
To enable Application Signals for Node.js with ESM, skip steps 1 and 2 in
of the previous procedure, and do the following instead.

###### To enable Application Signals for a Node.js application with ESM

1. Install the relevant dependencies to your Node.js application for autoinstrumentation:

```nohighlight

npm install @aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation
npm install @opentelemetry/instrumentation@0.54.0
```

2. In steps 4 and 5 in the previous procedure, remove the mounting of the volume `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-node`:

```json

"mountPoints": [
       {
           "sourceVolume": "opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-node",
           "containerPath": "/otel-auto-instrumentation-node",
           "readOnly": false
       }
    ]
```

Replace the node options with the following.

```json

{
       "name": "NODE_OPTIONS",
       "value": "--import @aws/aws-distro-opentelemetry-node-autoinstrumentation/register --experimental-loader=@opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs"
}
```

## Step 6: Deploy your application

Create a new revision of your task definition and deploy it to your application cluster.
You should see two containers in the newly created task:

- `init`– A required container for initializing Application Signals

- `my-app`– This is the example application container in our
documentation. In your actual workloads, this specific container might not exist or might be replaced with your own service containers.

## (Optional) Step 7: Monitor your application health

Once you have enabled your applications on Amazon ECS, you can monitor your application health. For more information, see [Monitor the operational health of your applications with Application Signals](services.md).
