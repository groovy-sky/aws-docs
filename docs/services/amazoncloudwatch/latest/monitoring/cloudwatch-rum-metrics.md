# CloudWatch metrics that you can collect with CloudWatch RUM

The tables in this section lists the metrics that you automatically collect with
CloudWatch RUM from web applications, mobile applications, or both. You can see these
metrics in the CloudWatch console. For more information, see [View available metrics](viewing-metrics-with-cloudwatch.md).

You can also optionally send extended metrics to CloudWatch. For more information, see
[Extended metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-custom-and-extended-metrics.html#CloudWatch-RUM-vended-metrics).

These metrics are published in the metric namespace named `AWS/RUM`.
All of the following metrics are published with an `application_name`
dimension. The value of this dimension is the name of the app monitor. Some metrics
are also published with additional dimensions, as listed in the following
table.

Web metricsMetricUnitDescription

`HttpStatusCodeCount`

Count

The count of HTTP responses in the application, by their response
status code.

Additional dimensions:

- `event_details.response.status` is the response
status code, such as 200, 400, 404, and so on.

- `event_type` The type of event.

status code.

These are calculated based on `http_event` RUM events
that result in 4xx codes.

code.

These are calculated based on `http_event` RUM events
that result in 4xx codes.

status code.

These are calculated based on `http_event` RUM events
that result in 4xx codes.

`Http5xxCount`

Count

The count of HTTP responses in the application, with 5xx response
status code.

These are calculated based on `http_event` RUM events
that result in 5xx codes.

`Http5xxCountPerSession`

status code.

These are calculated based on `http_event` RUM events
that result in 5xx codes.

review.

`NavigationFrustratedTransaction`

Count

The count of navigation events with a `duration` higher
than the frustrating threshold, which is 8000ms. The duration of
navigation events is tracked in the
`PerformanceNavigationDuration` metric.

`NavigationSatisfiedTransaction`

Count

The count of navigation events with a `duration` that
is less than the Apdex objective, which is 2000ms. The duration of
navigation events is tracked in the
`PerformanceNavigationDuration` metric.

`NavigationToleratedTransaction`

Count

The count of navigation events with a `duration`
between 2000ms and 8000ms. The duration of navigation events is
tracked in the `PerformanceNavigationDuration`
metric.

`PageViewCount`

Count

The count of page view events ingested by the app monitor.

This is calculated by counting the `page_view_event`
RUM events.

`PageViewCountPerSession`

Count

The count of page view events in a session.

`PerformanceResourceDuration`

Milliseconds

The `duration` of a resource event.

Additional dimensions:

- `event_details.file.type` is the file type of
the resource event, such as a stylesheet, document, image,
script, or font.

- `event_type` The type of event.

`PerformanceNavigationDuration`

Milliseconds

The `duration` of a navigation event.

`RumEventPayloadSize`

Bytes

The size of every event ingested by CloudWatch RUM. You can also use the
`SampleCount` statistic for this metric to monitor
the number of events that an app monitor is ingesting.

`SessionCount`

Count

The count of session start events ingested by the app monitor. In
other words, the number of new sessions started.

`SessionDuration`

Milliseconds

The duration of a session. These are calculated based on the time
between first and last events in a session.

`TimeOnPage`

Milliseconds

The duration of a page view.

These are calculated based on the time until next page view,
except for the final page in a session where it's the time between
first and last events on that page.

`WebVitalsCumulativeLayoutShift`

None

Tracks the value of the cumulative layout shift events.

`WebVitalsFirstInputDelay`

Milliseconds

Tracks the value of the first input delay events.

`WebVitalsLargestContentfulPaint`

Milliseconds

Tracks the value of the largest contentful paint events.

`WebVitalsInteractionToNextPaint`

Milliseconds

Tracks the value of the interaction to next paint events.

You can configure extended metrics for your mobile application to provide additional
dimensions for analysis.

Mobile metricsMetricUnitDescription

`ANRCount`

Count

For Android only: The number of Application Not Responding (ANR)
incidents, occurring when the application is unresponsive for more
than 5 seconds, resulting in application crash.

`AppHangCount`

Count

For iOS only: The number of times the application became
unresponsive for more than 250ms on the main loop.

`ColdAppLaunchFrustratedTransaction`

`didBecomeActiveNotification`.

`CrashCount`

Count

The number of unexpected application terminations caused by
unhandled exceptions or OS termination.

termination.

For iOS: Crashes due to unhandled exceptions, fatal errors, or

Count

Records the number of HTTP server errors encountered by the web or
mobile application during HTTP requests.

`LogPayloadSize`

Bytes

of inactivity or when explicitly terminated.

`SpanPayloadSize`

Bytes

The size in bytes of the span telemetry data being sent to

You can also use the `SampleCount` statistic for this
